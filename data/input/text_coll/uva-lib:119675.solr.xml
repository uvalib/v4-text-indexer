      <field name="fulltext">HISTORICAL SKETCH. INTRODUCTION. HISTORICAL SKETCH. By an act of the Legislature of Virginia, dated January 12, 1803, certain citizens of Albemarle County were incorporated under the style of "Trustees of Albemarle Academy," and were empowered to take such steps as seemed practicable to raise the funds necessary for erecting buildings and putting the Academy into operation Albemarle Academy was destined never to exist except on paper, but under the guidance of Thomas Jefferson, who was elected to the board of trustees on March 23, 1814, a process of development was begun leading first to the organization of Central College, and afterwards to that of the University of Virginia. On August 19, 1814, the committee of the trustees appointed to select a site, reported that it would be desirable to locate the Academy in the vicinity of the town of Charlottesville, distant not more than half a mile therefrom. By an act of February 14, 1816, the Legislature authorized the establishment of "Central College, in the County of Albemarle, at the place which has been, or shall be, selected by the trustees of Albemarle Academy, and in lieu of such Academy." All rights and claims of Albemarle Academy were, by the same act, vested in Central College. The board of visitors of the College consisted of six members, of whom Jefferson was the only one who had been a member of the Academy board. The other five members were James Madison, James Monroe, Joseph Carrington Cabell, David Watson, and John H. Cocke. On May 5, 1817, Jefferson was elected Rector of the board, and, on the same day, the board authorized the purchase of a farm of about two hundred acres lying one mile west of Charlottesville as a site for the College. This tract now forms a part of the grounds of the University of Virginia. The cornerstone of Central College was laid on October 6, 1817, in the presence of Thomas Jefferson, Rector, and of James Madison and James Monroeâthe latter then President of the United States. This building, located on what is known as the West Lawn of the University, is now utilized as the Colonnade Club. Jefferson's plan was to erect a distinct building, a "pavilion," for each individual professorâthe buildings to be arranged around a rectangular lawn. Each pavilion was to contain "a schoolroom and apartments for the accommodation of the professor," and one-story dormitories for the students were to be erected adjacent to the pavilions. Jefferson drew most of the sketches for the buildings with his own hands, basing them upon designs by Palladio; and his ideas of architectural effect and grouping were carried out in detail when Central College was merged into the University of Virginia. HISTORICAL SKETCH. The prime object in Jefferson's mind, while Rector of the board of visitors of Central College, was to get the college well under way, and then have it adopted by the Legislature as the State University. Accordingly, in the first report of the visitors to the Legislature, on January 6, 1818, it is recommended that a state university be established on the site of Central College. By an act of February 21, 1818, the Legislature authorized the appointment by the Governor of a board of twenty-four members, to be known as the "Board of Commissioners of the University." It was the duty of this board to meet on August 1, 1818, at the Tavern in Rockfish Gap, on the Blue Ridge Mountains, and report upon the following points regarding the organization of a state university: 1. A proper site for the projected university. 2. A plan for the building thereof. 3. The branches of learning which should be taught therein. 4. The number and description of professorships; and 5. Such general provisions as might properly be enacted by the Legislature for the better organizing and governing of the University. Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe were present at the meeting of the Commissioners, and their able and elaborate report to the Legislature (indicating much careful thought) had probably been prepared by Jefferson before the meeting was held. This report, recommending, among other things, the site of Central College as the most advantageous one for the University, was forwarded in duplicate to the Speaker of the House and the Speaker of the Senate on August 4, 1818. On January 25, 1819, the Legislature adopted a formal act "for establishing an university," and this date must be reckoned as the year of the origin of the University, although the institution was not opened to students until March 7, 1825. Although Jefferson's was the dominant spirit and the shaping hand in the whole movement for the establishment of a state university, it should be stated that but for the influence and efforts of Joseph Carrington Cabell, the close personal friend of Jefferson, the acts of February 21, 1818, and January 25, 1819, would probably have failed of adoption by the Legislature. The act of January 25, 1819, establishing the University, is as follows (Revised Code, 1819, ch. 34, p. 90): "1. Be it declared by the General Assembly of Virginia, That the conveyance of the lands and other property appertaining to the Central College in the County of Albemarle, which has been executed by the proctor thereof, under authority of the subscribers and founders, to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund, is hereby accepted, for the use and on the conditions in the said deed of conveyance expressed. "2. And be it enacted, That there shall be established, on the site provided for the said College, an university, to be called the University of Virginia; that it shall be under the government of seven visitors to be appointed forthwith by the Governor, with the advice of Council, notifying HISTORICAL SKETCH. thereof the persons so appointed, and prescribing to them a day for their first meeting at the said University, with supplementary instructions for procuring a meeting subsequently, in the event of failure at the time first appointed. "3. The said visitors, or so many of them as, being a majority, shall attend, shall appoint a rector, of their own body, to preside at their meetings, and a secretary to record, attest, and preserve their proceedings, and shall proceed to examine into the state of the property conveyed as aforesaid; shall make an inventory of the same, specifying the items whereof it consists; shall notice the buildings and other improvements already made, and those which are in progress; shall take measures for their completion, and for the addition of such others, from time to time, as may be necessary. "4. In the said University shall be taught the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages; French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Anglo-Saxon; the different branches of Mathematics, pure and physical; natural philosophy; the principles of agriculture; chemistry; mineralogy, including geology; botany, zoÃ¶logy; anatomy; medicine; civil government; political economy; the law of nature and nations; municipal law; history; ideology; general grammar; ethics; rhetoric; and belles lettres; which branches of science shall be so distributed, and under so many professors, not exceeding ten, as the visitors shall think proper and expedient. "5. Each professor shall be allowed the use of the apartments and accommodations provided for him, and those first employed such standing salary as the visitors shall think proper and sufficient, and their successors such standing salary, not exceeding one thousand dollars, as the visitors shall think proper and sufficient, with such tuition fees from each student as the visitors shall from time to time establish. "6. The said visitors shall be charged with the erection, preservation, and repair of the buildings, the care of the grounds and appurtenances, and of the interests of the University generally; they shall have power to appoint a bursar, employ a proctor, and all other necessary agents; to appoint and remove professors, two-thirds of the whole number of visitors voting for the removal; to prescribe their duties and the course of education, in conformity with the law; to establish rules for the government and discipline of the students, not contrary to the laws of the land; to regulate tuition fees, and the rent of the dormitories occupied; to prescribe and control the duties and proceedings of all officers, servants, and others, with respect to the buildings, lands, appurtenances, and other property and interests of the University; to draw from the literary funds such monies as are by law charged on it for this institution; and, in general, to direct and do all matters and things which, not being inconsistent with the laws of the land, to them shall seem most expedient for promoting the purposes of said institution; which several functions they shall be free to exercise in the form of by-laws, resolutions, orders, instructions, or otherwise, as they shall deem proper. HISTORICAL SKETCH. "7. They shall have two stated meetings in every year, to-wit, on the first Mondays of April and October; and occasional meetings at such other times as they shall appoint, or on a special call, with such notice as themselves shall prescribe by a general rule, which meetings shall be at the University, a majority of them constituting a quorum for business; and on the death, resignation of a member, or failure to act for the space of one year, or on his removal out of the Commonwealth, or by the Governor, with the advice of Council, the Governor with the like advice shall appoint a successor. "8. The said rector and visitors shall be a body corporate, under the style and title of `The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia,', with the right, as such, to use a common seal; they shall have capacity to plead and be impleaded in all courts of justice, and in all cases interesting to the University, which may be subjects of legal cognizance and jurisdiction; which pleas shall not abate by the determination of their office, but shall stand revived in the name of their successors; and they shall be capable in law, and in trust for the University, of receiving subscriptions and donations, real and personal, as well from bodies corporate or persons associated, as from private individuals. "9. And the said rector and visitors shall, at all times, conform to such laws as the legislature may from time to time, think proper to enact for their government; and the said University shall in all things, and at all times, be subject to the control of the legislature. And the said Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia shall be, and they are hereby, required to make report annually to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund (to be laid before the legislature at the next succeeding session), embracing a full account of the disbursements, the funds on hand, and a general statement of the condition of said University. "10. The said board of visitors, or a majority thereof, by nomination of the board, shall, once in every year at least, visit the said University; enquire into the proceedings and practices thereat; examine the progress of the students, and give to those who excel in every branch of science there taught, such honorary marks and testimonials of approbation as may encourage and incite to industry and emulation. "11. On every twenty-ninth day of February, or, if that be Sunday, then on the next, or earliest day thereafter on which a meeting can be effected, the Governor and Council shall be in session, and shall appoint visitors of the said University, either the same or others at their discretion, to serve until the twenty-ninth day of February next ensuing, duly and timely notifying to them their appointment, and prescribing a day for their first meeting at the University; after which, their meetings, stated and occasional, shall be as hereinbefore provided: Provided, that nothing in this act contained shall suspend the proceedings of the visitors of the said Central College of Albemarle; but for the purpose of expediting any objects of said institution, they shall be authorized, under the control of the Governor and Council, to continue the exercise of their functions, and fulfil HISTORICAL SKETCH. those of their successors, until the first actual meeting of their said successors. "12. And be it further enacted, That the additional sum of twenty thousand dollars shall be, and the same is hereby, appropriated to the education of the poor, out of the revenue of the literary fund, in the aid of the sum heretofore appropriated to that object, and to be paid in the same manner and upon the same conditions in all respects as is prescribed by the fourth section of the act entitled `An act appropriating part of the revenue of the literary fund, and for other purposes, passed the twenty-first day of February, eighteen hundred and eighteen.' "13. This act shall commence and be in force from and after the passing thereof." The first Board of Visitors consisted of four members of the old board of Central Collegeânamely, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Joseph Carrington Cabell, and John H. Cocke; the additional appointees were James Breckenridge, Chapman Johnson, and Robert Taylor. The board met for the first time on March 29, 1819, and elected Thomas Jefferson rector. Henceforth, until his death in 1826, Jefferson was the dominating and directing power of the University, not only evolving the entire system of education introduced, but actually devising, to the minutest detail, every feature of construction and administration. The organization of the University, its government, discipline, and methods of instruction, were virtually prescribed by Jefferson alone; and in many respects they still retain the impression derived from him. By virtue of its charter, the supreme government of the institution, under the General Assembly, is vested in the Rector and Visitors. Under the general direction of this board, and subject to its regulations, the affairs of the University were administered, for the first eighty years of its existence, by the Faculty and its chairman, the latter being a member of the faculty, who occupied temporarily the position of chief executive officer of the institution. As the University grew, it became more and more difficult for a member of the teaching staff to fill the position of Chairman, and attend to the manifold executive duties attached to that office. In October, 1903, the Visitors decided that modern conditions rendered necessary the creation of the office of president; and in June, 1904, Edwin Anderson Alderman was elected first president of the University of Virginia. The scheme of instruction organized by Jefferson contemplated no fixed uniform curriculum of studies to be pursued by every student alike, without discrimination. Each distinct branch of knowledge was, as far as was practicable, assigned to an individual "School" with its own instructors; and the University was to consist of a collection of independent Schools. The origin of the elective system at the University of Virginia is found in the fact that students were permitted to matriculate in any School or Schools of the University for which they were prepared. The wisdom of the Founder in establishing such a system has been amply vindicated HISTORICAL SKETCH. in the history of this university and in the adoption by almost all schools of higher education in the country of methods involving this principle. The original organization embraced eight independent Schoolsâ namely, Ancient Languages, Modern Languages, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Moral Philosophy, Chemistry, Medicine, and Law. The first seven Schools mentioned were opened to matriculates on March 7, 1825, with an aggregate attendance, during the first session, of 123 students. The School of Law was not opened until 1826. This original organization was gradually enlarged and modified. As early as 1837 the School of Medicine was elevated to a Department, consisting of three individual Schools; while in 1850 the School of Law was enlarged to a Department consisting of two Schools. Other Departments and Schools have been added from time to time. A most notable addition was made in May, 1909, when, through a gift from Mr. Andrew Carnegie to the General Alumni Association, six new Schools were established by joint action of the Rector and Visitors and the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund: The Andrew Carnegie School of Engineering, The James Madison School of Law, The James Monroe School of International Law, The James Wilson School of Political Economy, The Edgar Allan Poe School of English, The Walter Reed School of Pathology. In April, 1919, was founded through the generous gift of Mr. Paul Goodloe McIntire, the McIntire School of Fine Arts, embracing instruction in Art, Architecture and Music. It was provided by the first Board of Visitors, in accordance with Jefferson's wishes, that but two degrees should be conferred by the University. The lower degree, charactersitic of the institution for many years, was conferred upon a student who had completed all the work offered in any one School; to such a candidate the untitled degree of "Graduate" in the School in question should be given. The other, the higher degree, was to be the doctor's degree and was to be given to the graduate in two or more Schools who had, in addition, exhibited well-developed powers of research. There is abundant evidence that, in planning the organization of the University of Virginia, Thomas Jefferson had in mind the so-called continental type of university. The first faculty were, however, with one or two exceptions, Oxford or Cambridge men. Naturally they had in mind the English type of university, and the result was that in 1831 the faculty substituted for the doctor's degree proposed by Jefferson, the master's degree, common in England. The degree of "Master of Arts of the University of Virginia" was accordingly, for more than half a century, the leading degree conferred by this institution. THE HONOR SYSTEM. For eighteen years after the opening of the institution, written examinations were conducted under the surveillance of a committee of three HISTORICAL SKETCH. professors. This was not altogether satisfactory, and in June, 1842, Judge Henry St. George Tucker, Professor of Law, offered the following resolution, which the Faculty at once adopted: Resolved, That in all future written examinations for distinction and other honors of the University, each candidate shall attach to the written answers presented by him on such examination a certificate in the following words: "I, A. B., do hereby certify, on honor, that I have derived no assistance during the time of this examination from any source whatever, whether oral, written, or in print, in giving the above answers." This was the beginning of the honor system at this institution, and it has been in operation ever since without interruption. Later the pledge was extended so as to preclude the giving as well as the receiving of assistance. Still more recently the scope of the honor system has been enlarged so as to cover other phases of student conduct. Its administration is entirely in the hands of the students, the essence of the system being that the violation of a student's word of honor is an offense not against the university authorities, but against the whole student body, and on the rare occasions on which it has occurred, the students themselves have quietly and promptly sent the offender away from the University without need of faculty action. Examinations are required to be held in one place and in the presence of the professor in charge of the course or one of his assistants. These regulations in no way conflict with the spirit of the honor system, but are regarded as being necessary to give a proper dignity and formality to the occasion.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. For admission to any department of the University, the general conditions are the following: 1. Sufficient Age.âThe minimum legal age is sixteen years; the faculty advise seventeen or more. Eighteen years is the minimum for admission to the Department of Law. 2. Good Character.âThis must be attested by a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended, or by other valid proof. 3. Adequate Preparation.âThis must be such as will enable the candidate to meet the requirements for admission to the several departments of the University, as detailed below. For admission to the Department of Graduate Studies, see page 156. For admission to the Department of Law, see page 209. For admission to the Department of Medicine, see page 223. For admission to the College, the Department of Education, or the Department of Engineering, the candidate must present a certificate or pass an equivalent examination. In either case the amount of preparation required is measured in terms of units. A unit represents a year's study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year's work. This definition of a unit takes the four-year high-school course as a basis and assumes that the length of the school year is from thirty-six to forty weeks, that a period is from forty to sixty minutes in length, and that the study is pursued for four or five periods a week; but under ordinary circumstances a satisfactory year's work in any subject cannot be accomplished in less than one hundred and twenty hours, or their equivalent. Schools organized on any other than a four-year basis can, nevertheless, estimate their work in terms of this unit. For the requirements as to the number and selection of the units required for entrance, see, for the College, page 141, for the Department of Education, page 161; for the Department of Engineering, page 174. Admission of Women.âThe admission of women to the several departments of the University is subject to the following conditions: 1. General Requirements: The applicant must be at least twenty years old on the birthday preceding matriculation; must present a certificate showing graduation from an accredited public high-school, or not less than four years attendance in an accredited private-school, with credit for not less than 15 college entrance units obtained at least two years before admission to the University; and must in addition show by proper certificate the completion in a standard college, subsequent to the credit obtained for 15 entrance-units, of at least 30 session-hours, (60 semester hours), of courses of college grade, in not less than eighteen calendar months. 2. Specific Departmental Requirements: These will be found in the requirements for admission to each of the several departments. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. SUBJECTS ACCEPTED FOR ADMISSION. The subjects accepted for admission and their values in units are given below in tabulated form. Fuller definitions of the units may be had upon application to the Dean. Subject Topics Units English A Grammar and Grammatical Analysis 1 English B Composition and Rhetoric 1 English C Critical Study of Specimens of English Literature 1 English D Critical Study of Specimens of English Literature 1 Mathematics A1 Algebra to Quadratic Equations 1 Mathematics A2 Quadratics, Progressions, and the Binomial Formula Â½ or 1 Mathematics B Plane Geometry 1 Mathematics C Solid Geometry Â½ Mathematics D Plane Trigonometry Â½ History A Greek and Roman History 1 History B Medieval and Modern European History 1 History C English History 1 History D American History and Civil Government 1 Latin A Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Latin B Caesar's Gallic War, I-IV; Grammar; Composition 1 Latin C Cicero's Orations (6); Grammar; Composition 1 Latin D Virgil's Ãneid, I-VI; Grammar; Composition 1 Greek A Elementary Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Greek B Xenophon's Anabasis, I-IV; Grammar; Composition 1 Greek C Homer's Iliad, I-III; Grammar; Composition 1 German A Elementary Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 German B Intermediate Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 German C Third-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 German D Fourth-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 French A Elementary Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 French B Intermediate Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 French C Third-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 French D Fourth-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Spanish A Elementary Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Spanish B Intermediate Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Spanish C Third-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Spanish D Fourth-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Science A Physical Geography 1 Science B Inorganic Chemistry 1 Science C Experimental Physics 1 Science D Botany Â½ Science E Zoology Â½ Vocational Subjects (Not more than four Units) Manual Training Mechanical and Projection Drawing Â½ to 1 Free-Hand Drawing Â½ to 1 Shop-Work Â½ to 4 Agriculture (Accredited Agricultural Schools) 1 to 4 Commercial Subjects Commercial Geography Â½ Shorthand Â½ to 1 Typewriting Â½ Bookkeeping 1 Commercial Arithmetic Â½ to 1 ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. ADMISSION BY CERTIFICATE. For admission by certificate, the applicant should file with the Dean of the University not later than September 1 a Certificate of Preparation, made out on the blank form furnished by the University. This certificate must come from a recognized institution of collegiate rank, from an accredited public high school, or from an accredited private secondary school. The candidate for admission from a public high school must be a graduate of an accredited four-year high school. The candidate for admission from a private secondary school must be a graduate of the school, or must present a certificate showing that he has completed at least the equivalent of four years of satisfactory high-school work of standard grade, covering at least fifteen entrance units. In every case the candidate for admission must have the recommendation of the principal of the certifying school. Private secondary schools in Virginia are accredited by the faculty of this university after inspection and report by a committee of the faculty (see page 88). The university also accredits all four year public high schools which are fully accredited by the State Board of Education of Virginia. The Dean of the University is further authorized to accept certificates from schools outside Virginia, accredited by their own state universities or institutions of equal rank, or by their own state departments of education, provided the courses of study offered in such schools meet the requirements demanded of accredited schools in this state. If in any accredited school the number of periods given to a study, or the length of the period, is below the specified standard, the credit for such subject is reduced pro rata. In the science subjects only half-credit is allowed unless individual laboratory notebooks, properly attested by the teacher in charge, are filed with the certificate. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must in all cases take the entrance examinations. ADMISSION BY EXAMINATION. For admission by examination, the candidate must present himself at the University in June or in September, according to the dates given in the Program of Entrance Examinations. The examinations are held under the honor system, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge. All candidates who take their examinations at the times appointed are tested free of charge. In case of delayed entrance, where the grounds of postponement are good, the President of the University may admit the candidate to a special examination, for which a fee of five dollars is charged. This fee is payable in advance, and is in no case returned. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. PROGRAM OF ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS. June, 1922 9-11 A. M. 11 A. M.-1 P. M. 3-5 P.M.

      <field name="fulltext">ACCREDITED SCHOOLS. ACCREDITED SCHOOLS. Conditions for the Accrediting of Private Secondary Schools.âA school desiring to be placed on the accredited list of the University should apply to the Chairman of the Committee on Accredited Schools. In response to the application, a blank form inquiring into the course of study, faculty, etc., of the school will be sent to the principal. Upon the return of this blank, properly filled out, a representative of the University will be sent to inspect the school, and to report on such matters as the quality of instruction, the general intellectual and moral tone of the school, and the efficiency of the equipment, especially library and laboratory facilities. If his report is favorable and the Committee concurs, the school will be accepted and the principal duly notified. The name of the school will be entered upon the list of accredited schools and published in the catalogue of the University. Each school must meet the following requirements: (1) A course of study covering not less than four years of high-school work, based on at least seven years of competent elementary instruction, and embracing at least sixteen units. These sixteen units must include English A, B, C, Mathematics A1, A2, B, and one unit of History. Those schools that wish to prepare students for the study of Latin in the University must offer instruction in this subject to the extent of four units. (2) A teaching force of not less than three teachers, each of whom devotes his entire time to high-school instruction, and conducts not more than six recitation periods a day. The University will scrutinize with extreme care any school in which any instructor teaches more than six periods a day. All teachers should possess college training, and preference will be given to those schools in which the teachers are college graduates. Accrediting of Public High Schools.âThe University accredits all four year public high schools which are fully accredited by the State Board of Education of Virginia. List of Accredited Private Secondary Schools.âThe following is a list of the private secondary schools within the State of Virginia at present accredited by the University. This list is revised annually by the Committee, and any school which fails to report to the Committee when requested to do so, or which fails to maintain the standard above specified, may be removed therefrom: Augusta Military Academy (Fort Defiance). Benedictine College (Richmond). Blackstone Military Academy. ACCREDITED SCHOOLS. Chatham Training School. Danville Military Institute. Episcopal High School (Alexandria). Fishburne Military Academy (Waynesboro). Fork Union Academy. McGuire's University School (Richmond). Massanutten Academy (Woodstock). Miller Manual Training School (Miller School). Randolph-Macon Academy (Bedford City). Randolph-Macon Academy (Front Royal). Shenandoah Valley Academy (Winchester). Staunton Military Academy. St. Christopher's School (Richmond). Virginia Episcopal School (Lynchburg). Woodberry Forest School. Partial Accrediting of Schools.âSchools which cannot fulfill all the requirements for a fully accredited school, but which offer four years of work, covering at least thirteen units, may be partially accredited, upon those subjects which have been approved by the Committee. Graduates of such schools will be credited with the thirteen approved units and will be given examinations upon the other two units required for entrance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REGULATIONS. REGULATIONS. REGISTRATION. Registration of New Students.âApplicants seeking admission to the University for the first time must present themselves to the Dean of the University at some time during the first three days of the session. Registration of Matriculated Students.âStudents who have previously been matriculated as members of the University must present themselves to the deans of their respective departments upon one of the first three days of the session. Delayed Registration.âAny student who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session will not be admitted unless he can explain his delay in a manner satisfactory to the President, and will be charged a delayed registration fee of five dollars. Spring Registration Period in the College.âStudents enrolled in the College who expect to return for the next succeeding session must register during the Spring Registration Period. Any student who fails to register during this period will be charged a delayed registration fee of five dollars upon registering in the College at the opening of the following session. Registration after the Christmas Recess.âOn the first week-day after the Christmas recess every student is required to register with the dean of his department between the hours of 9 a. m. and 2 p. m. Any student failing to register thus will be required to pay the delayed registration fee of five dollars, and will be liable to whatever penalties may be imposed by his professors for unexcused absences. But if the delay is due to illness or other providential cause, the dean is authorized to remit the fee and to notify the professors concerned that the student's absences have been satisfactorily explained. RESIDENCE AND ATTENDANCE. The Academic Year begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September and continues for thirty-nine weeks. Thanksgiving Day and Jefferson Day are holidays, and there is a Christmas recess beginning on the last week-day before the twenty-fifth of December and closing on the evening of the second of January. Attendance is required of each student throughout the entire session, with the exception of holidays, unless he has received written permission to be temporarily absent, or to withdraw before the close of the session. While in residence each student is required to attend regularly all lectures and other prescribed exercises in the courses which he pursues, or else suffer such penalties as his professors may impose for unexcused absences. Leave of Absence from the University is granted for sufficient reason by the dean of the department in which the student is registered, and must REGULATIONS. in every case be obtained in advance. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or other student organizations on excursions will not be granted except to the officers and members of these organizations. The laws relating to absence from the University of members of the athletic teams are found on page 259. The same regulations apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University and the dean of the department in which the student is registered. For the conditions governing the return of fees upon withdrawal, see page 93. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the several departmental faculties for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also the regulations as to delinquent students in the various departments. Absence from Examinations.âWritten examinations are an essential part of the work of every course in the University, and attendance upon them is required of every student. Absence may be excused only on the ground of sickness on the day of the examination (attested by a physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause which may be approved by the several faculties of the University. Special Examinations are granted only upon prompt application therefor, and in case the applicant's absence from the regular examination has been excused. See the preceding paragraph. Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the Honor System, and an unpledged paper is counted as a total failure. In matters of class standing as well, students are expected to regard themselves as governed by the law of honor. CONDUCT. The laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the University precincts or not. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University any student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The keeping of dogs by students within the university grounds is forbidden. Prohibition of Credit.âAn act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting minor students. The license to contract debts, which the President is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity. REGULATIONS. DORMITORIES AND BOARD. Dormitories.âStudents may reside in the university dormitories, in their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. The President will withdraw from the approved list any house in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Any change of residence during the session should be reported at the office of the Registrar. For rules governing the rental and occupancy of university dormitories, and the rates charged for the same, see pages 96-97. For list of private lodging houses, with rates, apply to the Bursar. Board.âStudents may board at the University Cafeteria, at their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. For the cost of board at the Cafeteria, see page 95. For list of private boarding houses, with rates, apply to the Bursar. MEDICAL ATTENDANCE AND PHYSICAL TRAINING. Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the University Physician; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for his maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, treatment of the eye, ear, nose and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of students, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Students who take the responsibility of boarding at houses not approved by the Board of Health forfeit the right of medical attendance. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the University Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. Physical Training.âNo student is permitted to undertake an amount of work greater than he may reasonably be expected to carry without detriment to his health; and every student is advised to take a due amount of daily outdoor exercise, for which ample opportunities are afforded by the athletic fields, the tennis courts, the golf course, and elsewhere; and, in addition, to make systematic use of the facilities afforded without cost for definite and judicious physical training at the Fayerweather Gymnasium under the advice and instruction of the director and his assistants For the regular course in Physical Training with credit value toward academic degrees, see page 135. Further information upon the equipment and policy of the University in the matter of Physical Training and Athletics will be found on page 258.</field>

If he withdraw or is dropped from the rolls for any cause after the fifth day of the term and before the middle thereof, his fees shall be returned pro rata. If he withdraw or is dropped from the rolls for any cause after the middle of the term no refund shall be made for the respective term, except in case of sickness when the refund shall be pro-rated upon certificate of the University Physician or other reputable medical practitioner. In any case a minimum charge of $5 shall be made to cover cost of registration. Laboratory fees shall be refunded upon statement of professor in charge except where the withdrawal is within five days after registering. Regulation Concerning Registration as Virginia Student.âIn order to be considered a Virginia student, it is necessary that the applicant's parent's be domiciled in the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; if he has attained his majority, it is necessary that he himself be domiciled here. One is domiciled in the State who is living in it at the time the application EXPENSES. is made and has no intention of removing therefrom in the future, or who, though absent from the State, has not lost his former domicile by acquiring one elsewhere. No other person can honestly avail himself of this privilege. Superintendents and Teachers of Public Schools Exempt from Fees.â White male teachers and superintendents of the public schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Academic Schools of the University without payment of fees (except those charged in laboratory courses), upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the public schools of the State during the year. Applicants for admission as teachers are required to send in their names to the President of the University not later than March 5. Ministers of Religion and Candidates for the Ministry.âMinisters of religion may attend any of the Academic Schools of the University without payment of the tuition fee. The same privilege will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet without aid the expense of an education. UNIVERSITY CHARGES. University and Tuition Fees.* * The university fee goes to the fund intended to defray the general expenses of the University. Payment of this fee entitles the student, without additional charge, to the use of the library; to the privileges of the gymnasium, with baths, private lockers, etc., and the advice and aid of the physical training staff (see page 258); and to free medical attendance by the University Physician in case of illness (see page 92).

Rules.âStudents desiring rooms should apply to the Bursar, enclosing a reservation fee of $5, which will be returned should there be no room to let. The occupant of a room may reserve it for the next session by applying to the Bursar and depositing $5 (which is in no case returnable), not later than May 1. The balance of the rent must be paid not later than the first registration day of the session, otherwise such preference or other right shall be forfeited. No room may be sublet. Rates.âAll rooms are rented unfurnished, but the University has arranged with a local dealer to place in each room the necessary articles, consisting of one three-piece enameled bed with comfortable springs, one thoroughly sanitary all-cotton mattress, one solid oak six-drawer chiffonier with mirror, one student rocker with cane seat and back, one student straight chair and one student table with 24 Ã 36-inch top. This furniture will be placed in the room before the opening of the session, so that the room will be ready for occupancy immediately upon arrival. The student will pay the local dealer $20 per session as rent for the furniture. The rental for the necessary furniture for a room occupied by two students will be $25.50 using a double bed, or $28 for a double room using two single beds or a double-deck bed. Additional furniture may be rented if desired. The student should bring bed linen, towels, blankets, pillow, etc., or be prepared to purchase them here. All rooms are provided with either steam or hot-water heat and electric light, except where otherwise specified. Janitor service is included in the rate given. The rooms on East and West Lawn (with the exception of Bachelors' Row), East and West Range, and Dawson's Row, are commodious, and are frequently occupied by two students. The rates given below are for the session of nine months. East and West Lawns. ONE OCCUPANT TWO OCCUPANTS Rooms in Bachelors' Row (9) $ 70.00 $ 70.00 Other rooms (27) 75.00 100.00 East Range.

In order to provide rooming facilities at the very lowest cost to the students, a large, frame two-story barracks building has been erected on the grounds, conveniently located to the lecture halls and cafeteria. The building comprises four large, well-lighted sleeping rooms, equipped with 20 single iron beds with good all-cotton mattresses in each room. Builtin clothes closets and all-steel lockers are provided for each occupant. The house contains two large study rooms equipped with tables and chairs. Steam heat, electric light and janitor service are provided. The discipline and conduct of the building are in charge of a committee of the occupants who will see that order is maintained. Accommodation may be had in the Club for $45 for the session. APPROXIMATE SUMMARY OF NECESSARY EXPENSES. The figures in the following tables may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of nine months. As necessary expenses are reckoned here university and tuition fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. For each department three estimates are given âa low, an average, and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundry âin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. If a student shares a room with another student, and practices the strictest economy, he may possibly reduce his expenses below the low estimate.

While it is difficult for any student to be assured of remunerative work before he reaches the University, information as to such employment may be had from the Secretary of the Committee on Student Self-Help, Madison Hall.

Advanced courses: Seminars will be offered in the different branches of Chemistry to students applying for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. The courses will be offered only as occasion demands, and the subjects treated will vary. These courses will be designated as "D" courses, but owing to the flexibility which it is desired to secure in the subject matter, no definite statement of them will be made except that special phases of physical, organic, inorganic, and analytical chemistry will be treated, including such subjects as radio-chemistry, the chemistry of the rare elements, thermodynamics, colloid and surface chemistry, etc. Research work looking toward a thesis will accompany these courses. The Chemical Journal Club will meet once a week (hour to be arranged) for the critical review and discussion of various topics of interest in current chemical literature and of such chemical researches as are in progress in the University. All members of the teaching staff and advanced students in chemistry are expected to participate in these meetings and to take part in the discussions. The privileges of the club are extended to all members of the University and others who are interested in the progress of Chemistry. The Chemical Laboratory, recently completed, is of brick, fire-proof construction, and the three floors afford 30,000 square feet of space. The seven larger laboratories will accommodate 625 students, and, in addition to these, there are smaller laboratories for the use of instructors and advanced students. There are also rooms for assay furnaces, gas and water analysis, photography, etc. The equipment is satisfactory for purposes of both instruction and research. The laboratory maintains a working library containing about 4,000 volumes directly relating to chemistry, as well as complete files of the more important periodicals. Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy: In addition to fulfilling the regular University requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy, candidates for this degree who select chemistry as their Major Subject must give evidence of thorough training in the general principles of chemistry, in organic chemistry, and in analytical chemistry, by passing written qualifying examinations in these subjects; these examinations to be passed not later than the close of the session preceding that in which it is expected that the degree will be conferred.

      <field name="fulltext">THE COLLEGE. THE COLLEGE. Edwin Anderson Alderman, Ph.B., D.C.L., LL.D. President James Morris Page, M.A., Ph.D., LL.D. Dean ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. The general requirements for admission to the University may be found on page 84. For admission to the College, the candidate should possess an amount of preparation which is at least the equivalent of that represented by four years of successful work in an accredited school. He must offer, either by certificate or by examination (see page 86), fifteen units, of which three must be in English, two and one-half in Mathematics, and one in History. The remaining eight and one-half units may be selected at will from the list on page 85, unless the candidate expects to apply for a baccalaureate degree. In that case he should offer, if he is an applicant for the degree of Bachelor of Arts, four units in Latin or two units in Greek; if he is an applicant for the degree of Bachelor of Science, two units in each of two modern languages (French, German, Spanish). In addition to the above, each candidate must pass at the University a qualifying examination in English before his registration can be completed. Advanced Standing is given to any candidate who, in addition to meeting the minimum requirements for entrance above stated, can show by passing an examination that he has done work equivalent to that covered by any of the following courses offered in the college: Latin A1, Greek A1, Greek A2, English A1 or A2 or A3, German A1, Mathematics A1, French A, Spanish A. Candidates who apply for examination for advanced standing must present a special certificate showing that the full content of the course, on which advanced standing is sought, has been covered in a systematic manner in the preparatory school, and in addition must present the specific recommendation of the principal of the school that the candidate be admitted to the advanced standing examination in question. The examinations for advanced standing are set at some time during the first month of the session. College Credit.âCandidates who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students, and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the College a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college, must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate, and must give his grades. The final validation of such certificates is effected by the THE COLLEGE. successful completion of the courses taken in this university. In no case will credit be given on more than forty-eight session-hours of work done elsewhere, and any candidate who receives this maximum amount of credit can count among the remaining fifteen session-hours required for his degree only the credit value of the courses he has passed as a resident student in the College, exclusive of any credit for work done in the Summer Quarter or in any of the professional departments. In every case the candidate must spend at least one regular session of nine months exclusively in college work in this university. Conditioned Students.âA candidate for entrance must offer fifteen units as defined by the Southern Commission on Accredited Schools. At least thirteen of the units offered must be included in the list of units accepted for admission on page 85. A student not able to offer fifteen units as defined in this list may be conditioned on any two units except English A and B. All conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the session following initial registration. This may be done by private study or in the Summer Quarter. But no course taken to remove a condition may be counted as part of the work credited toward a degree. No conditioned student may be later registered as a special student. Special Students.âA candidate may be admitted as a special student without fulfilling the entrance requirements above specified, provided that, if he is a Virginian, he is more than twenty years old or, if he is not a Virginian, he is more than twenty-three years old, on the day of registration, and gives adequate evidence of serious purpose and of the training needed to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for a degree; but such students are permitted and encouraged to make up their deficiencies by private study or by taking courses in the Summer Quarter. They will then be admitted as regular students, and may be accepted as applicants for degrees, provided all entrance requirements are met at least one academic year before the date of graduation. Admission of Women.âWomen are admitted as candidates for the vocational degrees of Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, Bachelor of Science in Architecture and Bachelor of Science in Commerce. A candidate must be at least twenty years old on the birthday preceding matriculation; must present certificates showing graduation from an accredited public high-school, or not less than four years' attendance in an accredited private school, with credit for not less than fifteen college entrance units obtained at least two years before admission to the University; and must in addition show by proper certificate the completion in a standard college, subsequent to the credit obtained for fifteen entrance-units, of at least thirty session-hours, (sixty semester hours), of courses of college grade, in not less than eighteen calendar months. The thirty session-hours of college courses required for admission must include: three session-hours each in French and German; six in Mathematics; twelve in laboratory sciences; and six in English. THE COLLEGE. REGULATIONS. (1) The Session-Hour.âAll courses are measured in terms of the session-hour as a unit. A session-hour is one hour a week throughout the session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week throughout the session of laboratory work. (2) Maximum and Minimum Number of Session-Hours.âEach College student is required to undertake each session courses aggregating at least fifteen session-hours (with the exception noted in paragraph (4) ). This number may be increased in the following cases: (I) Any first-year student may take eighteen session-hours, provided he is credited with six session-hours of advanced standing. (II) A student not in his first year in the College may take eighteen session-hours, provided he (a) has passed in the preceding session courses aggregating fifteen session-hours, or (b) is in his graduating year and needs eighteen session-hours for his degree. (III) A student not in his first year may take twenty-one session-hours provided he passed in the preceding session courses aggregating eighteen session-hours. (IV) Any student whose term grade (or class grade, if the term grade is not available) for the first or second term is at least 75 per cent in each of his courses, may take three additional session-hours for the ensuing term. Exceptions to the above regulations will be allowed only by special permission of the Committee on Rules and Courses. Physical Training is not counted in the maximum and minimum requirements detailed above. (3) Grade.âThe grade of a college student in any course either for a term or for the session, is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Class standing in any course is determined by the regularity of the student's attendance upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercises) of the course, and by the quality of his work, as indicated by his recitation grades, written tests, laboratory work, etc. For passing in any course in the college a grade of seventy-five per cent is required. (4) Exclusion from Courses, Probation and Suspension. (I) Exclusion from Courses: A student who, after due admonition, is evidently making no real progress in a course, may, at any time during the session, be excluded from the course by the Dean upon the recommendation of the instructor concerned. A student whose term grade in a course is less than 50%, or who discontinues the course without the permission of the Dean, or who is absent without excuse from the term examination, will be automatically excluded THE COLLEGE. from the course, unless the instructor recommends on his term report to the Registrar that the student be retained in the course. Any student excluded from English A1, A2, or A3 in the first term, must take up English A4 at the beginning of the second term, but this required addition to the student's program of studies will not affect his total number of session-hours as far as the application of these regulations is concerned. A student who by exclusion from one or more of his courses, is left at the end of the first or second term with 15 or more session-hours, shall not be allowed to take up additional work for the ensuing term. For the case of students left with less than 15 session-hours see below. (II) Probation: (1) A student placed on 15-hour probation must pass on at least 6 session-hours of his work, or else be suspended from the college. (2) A student placed on 12-hour probation must pass on at least 6 session-hours of his work and average at least 50% on the other 6 session-hours, or else be suspended from the college. A student on 12-hour probation who passes on all of his courses may take up 3 additional session-hours and be absolved from probation. (3) A student placed on 9-hour probation must pass on 6 session-hours of his work, and receive a grade of at least 65% on the remaining 3 session-hours, or else be suspended from the college. A student on 9-hour probation who passes on all of his courses may take up 3 additional session-hours and be placed on 12-hour probation for the term next ensuing. (III) Suspension: Suspension means enforced withdrawal from the college. If imposed during the session it applies to the remainder of the regular session; if imposed at the end of the session, it applies to the whole of the following session. In no case does it apply to the Summer School. [But see also (10) below.] (IV) Probation and suspension are administered as follows: (1) A student who by exclusion from a course or courses, is left at the end of the first or second term with only 12 session-hours is put on 12-hour probation for the term next ensuing, unless he has passed all his remaining 12 session-hours. In this case he may take up 3 additional session-hours and escape probation. (2) A student who by exclusion from a course or courses, is left at the end of the first or second term with only 9 session-hours (1) will be put on 9-hour probation, unless he has passed all his remaining 9 session-hours, in which case he may take up 3 additional session-hours and be put on 12-hour probation, or (2) if he be other than a first year student, will be suspended unless he has passed on at least 3 session-hours. THE COLLEGE. (3) Any student not in his first year, who by exclusion from a course or courses, is left at any time during the session with only 6 session-hours, will be suspended. Any first year student who by exclusion from a course or courses, is left with only 6 session-hours will be suspended at the end of the term unless he has passed on at least 3 session-hours. In this case he will be required to take up 3 additional session-hours and be put on 9-hour probation for the ensuing term. (4) Any student who fails to attain a session grade of at least 75% on at least 9 session-hours of his work will be put on 15-hour probation for the first term of the subsequent session. (V) The Committee on Rules and Courses have power to suspend the enforcement of the above regulations in any case in which the low grade was the result of circumstances over which the student had no control. (5) Absence from Examinations will not be excused, except for sickness on the day of examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as to a total failure. (6) Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, in accordance with (5) above, is entitled to a special examination on a date during the regular session to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge of the examination. (7) Re-Examinations.â(I) A College student whose session grade in any course falls below seventy-five percent, but not below sixty-five percent, may, upon the written recommendation of the professor in charge, be admitted to re-examination upon that course, or upon such portion of it as the professor shall determine, during the registration week of the following September. The fee for each re-examination is five dollars, and should be paid to the Bursar on or before July fifteenth. (II) The candidate for an academic degree who fails on only one term of one of his courses during his final session of candidacy, is entitled to a special re-examination on the work of that term before the Final Day. The candidate who passes the re-examination, as an independent unit and not averaged in with the grades of the other terms, will receive credit for the work of the whole course in question. No fee is charged for such re-examination. (8) Reports.âReports are sent at the end of each term to the parent or guardian of each College student. These reports indicate the number of times the student has been absent from lectures, and give his term grade on each course. The dean will be glad at any time to furnish to the proper person a special report on any student's standing. In addition to the above, a report on the standing of each first year student in the College is sent to the student's parent or guardian early in November. THE COLLEGE. (9) Conduct.âThe laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or not. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University for the residue of the current session every student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The keeping of dogs by students within the University grounds is forbidden. (10) Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University as well as the consent of the student's parent or guardian, if he is a minor. But it should be noted that no student on probation may withdraw except for imperative reasons; and any student on probation who withdraws without permission will be suspended, not only for the residue of the current session, but also for the whole of the subsequent session. Any student, not on probation, who withdraws from the University, shall be on 15-hour probation for the first term of the next session, if he is passing on less than 9 session-hours of his courses at the time of withdrawal. (11) Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also (4). (12) Change of Studies.âNo change can be made in a student's program of studies except with the approval of the Dean together with official notification by the Registrar. Any student desiring to change his program of studies must apply to the Dean who, if he approves the change, will give the student a permit to be taken at once to the Registrar. The change becomes valid only when the Registrar notifies the student and the Professors concerned to this effect. No permit for change of courses will be issued after the end of the first week of each term, except that first-year students may make such changes within the first two weeks after the beginning of lectures in September. Any student who drops a course without permission will receive a failure in that course and may be subjected to further discipline by the Academic Faculty; and no credit may be received for any portion of a course attended before formal permission has been granted as outlined above. (13) (a) Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors, but only for sickness or like providential cause. Any explanation of an absence which a student has to offer must be made on the day of the first lecture attended after the absence. Unexcused absence from lectures renders the student liable to discipline by the Faculty. THE COLLEGE. It should be carefully noted that no student is "entitled" to be absent at all. His presence is required at each class or laboratory exercise at which he is due, unless his absence is excused for reasons outlined above or in the next paragraph below. Even if the student is absent with excuse, he must make up the work lost by such absence. No student who was, for any reason, absent from more than fifty per cent of the lectures of any one term, can receive a grade on the work of that term. (b) Absence from the University is permitted upon the written leave of the dean, and should in every case be obtained in advance. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or musical clubs on excursions will not be granted, except to the officers and members of these organizations. The laws relating to absence from the University of members of the athletic teams are found on page 259 of the Catalogue. The same regulations apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. It should also be carefully noted that no leave of absence can be granted just before or just after a vacation, or just after term examinations, except for very grave reasons. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES. Full opportunity is given to any student to carry out any definite plan of work which he may have in view on coming to the University, or which may have been prescribed for him by those under whose direction he is completing his education. But when no well-considered plan has been outlined in advance, and the end in view is that for which the great majority of students enter college, namely, the attainment of a liberal education, the student will be expected to enter upon the regular work of the college leading to a baccalaureate degree. Six degrees are offered candidates for graduation in the College. Two of these, the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science, are cultural; the Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, the name of which is inscribed on the diploma, the Bachelor of Science in Architecture, the Bachelor of Science in Commerce, and the Bachelor of Science in Medicine, are vocational degrees, designed for those who wish to fit themselves especially for professional work. No course offered by a successful candidate for one of the cultural baccalaureate degrees can be offered by the same candidate as part of the work credited toward the other cultural baccalaureate degree, nor can any work done to remove an entrance condition be counted for any degree. For a student who enters without advanced standing the normal time required for obtaining a baccalaureate degree is four years, assuming that he completes each year courses which aggregate the regular minimum of fifteen session-hours. A student receiving advanced standing in not less than two subjects may obtain a degree in three years, provided he is able THE COLLEGE. to complete each year eighteen session-hours. A student may materially shorten the time required for obtaining a degree by taking courses in the Summer Quarter on which college credit is given (see page 247). For credit for work done at other colleges, see page 141. The requirements for the baccalaureate degrees are such as to allow a large measure of freedom of election on the part of the individual student, such restriction only being placed upon this liberty as is necessary to insure at the same time the thoroughness and the breadth of culture for which these degrees stand. In order to secure to the recipient of a degree a due measure of acquaintance with the methods of thought characteristic of each of the leading departments of knowledge, as well as with their subject matter, his courses must be chosen subject to the specific requirements detailed below. BACHELOR OF ARTS AND BACHELOR OF SCIENCE. The degree of Bachelor of Arts or of Bachelor of Science, respectively, will be conferred upon regular students who have completed not less than sixty-three (63) session-hours of undergraduate courses, taken in conformity with the following programme: (1) Required Subjects.âCandidates for either cultural degree must take 33 hours of required subjects as stated below, 3 hours of which must be Physical Training.

President Richard Heath Dabney, M.A., Ph.D. Dean ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. Admission to the Department.âFor admission to the Department of Graduate Studies a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank is required, for men and women alike. In order to become a candidate for a degree, the student must be advanced to candidacy by the Committee on Rules and Courses upon formal application, as set forth below. Advancement to Candidacy for a Degree.âAny graduate student who wishes to become a candidate for a degree must file with the Dean of the Department his application on a blank form to be secured from the Registrar. This application must include a proposed program of work arranged in accordance with the requirements for the several degrees as stated below, and must be accompanied, in case the applicant does not hold an academic degree from this University, by an official transcript of the applicant's academic record made out by the Registrar of the institution from which the baccalaureate degree was received, and by a catalogue of that institution, marked to show the courses of study pursued. The application will be submitted by the Dean to the Committee on Rules and Courses, who will consider it in conference with the professors concerned. The Committee will have the right to require that the applicant add to his program any courses, undergraduate or graduate, considered necessary to supply his deficiencies, or to enable him to pursue with profit the courses he has selected. When the program has been finally approved, the Dean will report to the applicant his advancement to candidacy for a degree. It should be distinctly understood that graduate degrees are not conferred merely upon the basis of the number of courses passed, or of the length of time spent in resident or non-resident work, but upon the basis of the quality and scope of the candidate's knowledge, and his power of investigation in his chosen field of study. Candidates whose training and attainments are inferior cannot expect to secure a degree in the normal length of time estimated below for the respective degrees. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES.

CHARLES GILMORE MAPHIS Professor of Education JOHN LEVI MANAHAN, M.A., Ph.D. Professor of Educational Administration GEORGE OSCAR FERGUSON, JR., M.A., Ph.D. Professor of Educational Psychology WILLIAM ROYALL SMITHEY, M.A., Ph.D. Professor of Secondary Education HISTORY. The Curry Memorial School of Education was founded in 1905 as one of the academic schools of the University. It was endowed by gifts of $100,000 from John D. Rockefeller and $50,000 from the General Education Board, and was named in honor of Dr. J. L. M. Curry, the Southern educator. There were originally two professorships in the School, the Curry Memorial Professorship of Education and the Professorship of Secondary Education. In 1914 a chair of Educational Psychology and Principles of Teaching was added to the School, and two years later a Professorship of School Administration was established. In 1919 the School was organized into a Department of the University, with four professorships, and was placed upon a professional basis similar to that of the Departments of Law, Medicine and Engineering. The relation of the Department of Education to the various academic schools of the University remains close, however, since the academic training of students of Education is obtained in the academic schools, and courses in Education are credited toward the academic degrees. PURPOSE. The rapid development of educational science and practice has made it necessary that ample provision be made for the professional training of those who expect to teach or to administer school affairs. It is the main purpose of the Department of Education to provide opportunity for such professional training. Since education is of great importance as an agency of Democracy and as an aspect of civilization, the Department also aims to provide courses of cultural value for citizens generally. In addition to affording opportunities for study and training, the Department, DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. as a part of the State University, offers its services to school authorities throughout Virginia, with a desire to coÃ¶perate in the solution of practical educational problems and in the furtherance of public education. PEABODY HALL. Peabody Hall, the Education Building, was named in honor of George Peabody, who in 1867 made his great gift to the cause of education in the South. The building was made possible through a gift of $40,000 from the trustees of the Peabody Education Fund. This amount was supplemented by an appropriation of $12,000 from the Rector and Visitors of the University. The building was completed in 1912, and is the home of the Curry Memorial Department of Education. The plans were drawn by a modern school architect, and approved by the leading authorities on school architecture in this country who were consulted before its erection. It is, therefore, a model of excellence in this regard. It is one of the best equipped buildings in the University, and has ample classroom and laboratory facilities, and an excellent auditorium equipped with a modern motion picture machine. Modern requirements in heating, lighting and ventilation are exemplified in its construction without sacrificing conformity to the general style of classic architecture prevailing in the University. THE HECK MEMORIAL LIBRARY. The Department of Education maintains its own library in Peabody Hall, named in honor of the first professor of Education in the University, the late Professor William Harry Heck. The library consists of numerous select books covering every field of Education, a complete file of the publications of the United States Bureau of Education, various national, state and foreign documents, State School Laws, State Superintendents' Reports, City Superintendents' Reports, etc. Files of the leading educational magazines are available for free use of the students. Exhibits of school textbooks are at hand for comparative studies. OBSERVATION AND DIRECTED TEACHING. Ample laboratory facilities are made available through the coÃ¶peration of the public schools of the City of Charlottesville and the County of Albemarle. Arrangements have been made whereby students in Education will do observation work and directed teaching in the city schools under close supervision by the City Superintendent of Schools and the Education Faculty. This arrangement gives the Department adequate facilities for effective practical work by every candidate for a degree in Education. The city school system consists of three schools, two elementary schools, one for whites and one for colored, and one high school. The new McGuffey Elementary School is a model of modern school architecture. The Midway DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. High School has an enrollment of 400, a teaching staff of 20, and has 81 classes meeting daily. Besides work in observation and directed teaching, the city schools are also available for studies in school administration, secondary education and educational psychology. Certain well-qualified students will be assigned special problems to study under the direction of the Superintendent of Schools and the Education Faculty. Arrangements have been made whereby the schools of Albemarle County become a part of the laboratory system of the Department of Education. Students in School Administration and Secondary Education will be required to study the organization and supervision of the county system of schools. Advanced students may be assigned to make special studies under the supervision of the Division Superintendent of Schools and the Education Faculty. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. Requirements for the Admission of Men.âTo be admitted to regular standing in the Department of Education, men must have satisfied the entrance requirements of the College. Students who have decided to enter the teaching profession at the time of entering college should register with the Dean of the Department of Education in order to be advised in planning their curricula. Holders of State Teachers' Scholarships are required to register in the Department of Education. Three courses in Education (Education B1, Education B2 and Education B3) are especially suited to the needs of first-year students. These courses count as electives toward any degree offered in the College. Requirements for the Admission of Women.âTo be admitted to regular standing in the Department of Education, women must be twenty years of age, must meet the entrance requirements of the University and must have completed two years of college work aggregating thirty session-hours in academic subjects. Candidates not able to meet these requirements may make up their deficiencies during the summer quarter. Special Students.â(a) Graduates of colleges and universities other than the University of Virginia, desiring to secure the necessary professional training to qualify for the Collegiate Professional Certificate, may register in the Department of Education and upon completion of the required courses receive a certificate which will entitle them to the Collegiate Professional Certificate issued by the State Board of Education. (b) Women, twenty-five years of age, giving satisfactory evidence that they are qualified to pursue courses in Education successfully, may be admitted as special students, even though they fail to show credit for the 30 session-hours of academic work required of women for admission to regular standing. GRADUATE WORK IN EDUCATION. Graduate work in Education leading to the degrees of Master of Arts, DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. Master of Science or Doctor of Philosophy may be pursued in the Department of Graduate Studies. Graduate students who choose Education as their major for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy must meet the entrance requirements of the Department of Graduate Studies, and, in addition, must pass, at least two terms prior to receiving the degree, preliminary written examinations in each of the following fields: History of Education, Educational Psychology, Educational Administration, Secondary Education, and Educational Sociology. The candidate must also pass a final oral examination upon his dissertation and the general fields of his major and minor subjects. The Department of Education offers the following graduate courses: Education C1, Advanced Educational Psychology; Education C2, Educational Surveys, State, City and County; Education C3, Standard Tests in School Subjects; Education C4, Problems in Secondary Education; Education C5, Sociology and Education; Education C6, Mental Tests and their applications; Education D1, Seminar in Educational Psychology; Education D2, Seminar in School Administration; and Education D3, Seminar in Secondary Education.

Recipients of the Bachelor of Science in Education will receive the Collegiate Professional Certificate, the highest form of certificate for high-school teachers issued by the State Board of Education. This certificate is valid for ten years, renewable for a similar period, and entitles the holder to teach in both high and elementary schools in Virginia. Holders of Collegiate Certificates, the certificate of second rank issued by the State Board of Education, may obtain the Collegiate Professional Certificate by attending the University one session and taking four three-session-hour courses in Education. Curricula organized to meet the requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Education will fulfill the professional requirements for the highest form of professional and collegiate high school certificates issued by the state departments of education in the other southern states. SPECIAL CERTIFICATES IN HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS. Students who find it necessary to leave college to teach before completing their full course may be issued special certificates by the State Board of Education to teach any high-school subjects in which they have completed six session-hours of study of college grade. These students should plan to take two courses in Education during their second year in order to become familiar with school problems. COURSES FOR TEACHERS IN SERVICE. Saturday courses in any subject offered in the Department of Education will be arranged at the University for teachers in service, if requested by at least five teachers. Degree credit will be allowed on the same basis as in the regular courses, provided that not more than one and one-half session-hours' credit shall be given for the work in any course for one year. UNIVERSITY EXTENSION TEACHING COURSES. Extension teaching courses are courses of instruction corresponding closely with those regularly given in the University by regular members of the faculty, and are under the administration, supervision and control of the University, for the benefit of persons unable to attend the regular courses of instruction and to take work in residence. Each course represents a definite amount of study corresponding to an equivalent amount of work done in residence at the University, and when completed satisfactorily by persons meeting the entrance requirements of the University, receives the same credit as if taken in residence. Extension teaching classes in Education, conducted by members of the faculty of the Department of Education, were organized in the session of 1921-22, under the Bureau of Extension of the University, in Arlington County, Danville, Roanoke, Schoolfield, Staunton and Waynesboro. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. Extension Teaching Courses will be organized upon application for them in as many centers as possible, if a sufficient number (usually not fewer than fifteen) apply for them. Application for such courses should be made to the Director of University Extension, Box 149, University, Virginia. THE SUMMER QUARTER. The Summer Quarter is an integral part of the University year. Courses in the College of Arts and Sciences, as well as the Department of Education, are the same in character and in credit value as in any other Quarter of the University. Degrees are conferred upon men and women upon exactly the same terms for work done in the Summer Quarter when the degree requirements are fully met. Sixty-three session-hours of undergraduate courses, taken in conformity with the requirements published herewith, are required for the Bachelor's degree. Those who contemplate completing their degree requirements in the Summer Quarter should keep clearly in mind, in estimating the time that will be required, that the normal amount of credit which may be taken in one Summer Quarter is six session-hours. Candidates for a degree who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. This certificate must be acceptable both to the Dean of the Summer Quarter and to the Dean of the Department in which the degrees will be obtained. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college and must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate and must give his grade. In every case the candidate must spend at least three full Summer Quarters at the University in order to meet the residence requirements. The Master's degree may be obtained in three Summer Quarters. In no case is this degree to be conferred upon any person who has not attended and done graduate work three full Summer Quarters or the equivalent time in the regular session of the University and the Summer Quarter. The demand for graduate work in the Summer Session of 1921 was so great that in future sessions the number of graduate courses will be largely increased. All persons who are looking forward ultimately to taking a degree through summer work are urgently requested to file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter an official statement of their entrance requirements and work for which college credit is desired. Blanks for this purpose will be mailed upon application. BUREAU OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS. Educational Tests.âThe Department of Education maintains a Bureau of Tests and Measurements as a feature of its extra-University service. Select standard tests in school subjects will be supplied to cities, counties and individual schools at cost. Members of the Faculty of Education will DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. visit the schools to be tested, train teachers in the use of the tests and personally direct the giving and scoring of them, provided the necessary traveling expenses are borne by the schools served. Mental Tests.âIn connection with its work in educational psychology, the Department undertakes to assist school authorities in the diagnosis and training of backward and gifted children. Assistance will be rendered in the making of mental surveys and the establishment of special classes. A clinic will be maintained for the study of cases accessible to the University and the services of the professor in charge will be available to any community in Virginia at the cost of the necessary test materials and traveling expenses. Any school official desiring the services of the Bureau of Tests and Measurements should address the Dean of the Department of Education. BUREAU OF APPOINTMENTS. The University of Virginia maintains a Bureau of Appointments in charge of a committee consisting of Professors J. L. Manahan, W. R. Smithey, J. C. Metcalf and I. F. Lewis. The services of the bureau are free to all teachers and prospective teachers seeking positions in secondary schools (both public and private), normal schools, and colleges. Correspondence with regard to appointment should be addressed to the Bureau of Appointments (J. L. Manahan, Director), University, Virginia. PHI DELTA KAPPA FRATERNITY. A chapter of the national honorary educational fraternity of Phi Delta Kappa has been organized in connection with the Department of Education. Under the constitution of the fraternity, only those students are eligible to membership who expect to make teaching or administration of schools a permanent vocation, and who give evidence of superior qualities of character, scholarship and initiative. The standards of scholarship governing election to membership in the fraternity are similar to those prescribed for election to Phi Beta Kappa. The purpose of the fraternity as stated in its constitution is "to develop among the students of Education at the University of Virginia the spirit of `Research, Service and Leadership,' " and to endeavor by every worthy means at its command to create and foster fellowship and true fraternalism among the members of the society. EDUCATION CLUB. An Education Club is conducted for the purpose of fostering a scientific study of educational problems. Membership is open to all students taking courses in Education, teachers, principals and superintendents now in service, and members of the faculty of the University who are willing to lend their influence and efforts toward placing the teaching profession in Virginia and the South on a professional basis. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. SCHOLARSHIPS. In order to encourage the training of teachers, the General Assembly of Virginia, in 1918, founded one hundred and nineteen Virginia State Teachers' Scholarships, one for each School Division in the State. The emolument is free lodging, heat, light and janitor service in the university dormitories. The holder of one of these scholarships must be a Virginian needing financial assistance in order to attend the University, and he must pledge himself to engage in some form of school work in the State for at least two years, or, failing this, to repay to the University the value of the scholarship. Appointments are made prior to September 1, upon the recommendation of Division Superintendents of Schools. If any Superintendent fails to make a recommendation, the vacancy thus created may be filled from the State at large by the President of the University. Blank forms of application will be sent upon request. In addition to the Virginia State Teachers' Scholarships, there are a number of other scholarships in the University available for students of Education. A detailed description of them is given in the General Catalogue of the University. LOAN FUNDS AND STUDENT SELF-HELP. The University is in possession of funds from which loans are made to deserving students in need of such assistance. An account of these loans is given in the General Catalogue, page 106. Inquiries concerning them should be addressed to the Bursar. Opportunities for obtaining remunerative employment are afforded to students who are desirous by this means of partially paying their way through the University. It is difficult to give definite assurance of employment to a student before he reaches the University, but it may be stated that any student with sufficient resources to carry him through the first half of the session can be reasonably sure of obtaining work which will help defray his expense for the rest of the academic year. Information as to employment may be obtained from the secretary of the Committee on Student Self-Help, Madison Hall, University, Virginia. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses of a Virginia student in the Department of Education may be estimated at from $320 a year upward, according to the mode of living; for students from other States, $510 upward. A fuller statement of expenses will be found on pages 93-98 of the General Catalogue.</field>

He must present a certificate of honorable withdrawal from the school last attended, or other valid proof of general good character. He must further satisfy the Dean of the University as to his adequate preparation for the work by passing the Entrance Examinations specified below or by the presentation of equivalent certificates of preparation signed by the president of a recognized institution of collegiate rank, or by the principal of an accredited high school. The topics required for entrance and their values in units are as follows, the unit being one year's work on the subject in an accredited high school: English A.âGrammar and Grammatical Analysis 1 English B.âComposition and Rhetoric 1 English C.âCritical Study of Specimens of Literature 1 Mathematics A1.âAlgebra to Quadratics 1 Mathematics A2.âQuadratics, Progressions, Binomial Formula 1 Mathematics B.âPlane Geometry 1 Mathematics C.âSolid Geometry Â½ Mathematics D.âPlane Trigonometry Â½ History.âAncient; MediÃ¦val; English; American (any one) 1 Electives 7 Total 15 High school students who expect to study Engineering are advised to include among their electives Physical Geography, Chemistry, Physics, Mechanical Drawing, and Shop-work (valued at one unit each). Other electives which may be offered are History of English and American Literature (1 unit), History (4 units), Latin (4 units), Greek (3 units), German (4 units), French (4 units), Spanish (4 units), Botany (half unit), ZoÃ¶logy (half unit). A candidate may be admitted as a Conditioned Student in spite of some deficiencies, DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. provided these are not such as will impair the integrity of his work. But no such candidate will be conditioned except upon subjects actually taught in this university, nor will any candidate be conditioned on more than two units; and all conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the next session after initial registration. Courses taken for the removal of entrance conditions may in no case be counted as part of the work credited for any degree. No conditions will be allowed in English A or B or in Mathematics A1, A2, or B. A candidate may be admitted as a Special Student, without formal examination, provided he is more than twenty years old if a Virginian and not less than twenty-three years old if a non-Virginian, and gives evidence of serious purpose and of fitness to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for any degree. No conditioned student may register later as a special student. ADMISSION OF WOMEN. Women are admitted as regular students in the Department of Engineering provided they have completed at least two years of standard college work before entrance, and are at least twenty years old. PROGRAMS OF STUDY. The candidate who has satisfied the requirements for entrance as above defined is matriculated as a student of Engineering and admitted to the Freshman Class. The studies of this class comprise lecture courses in English, Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Chemistry with associated laboratory courses in Chemistry, Drawing, Shop-work and Field-work. For advancement to the Sophomore Class the student must have completed at least two-thirds of his Freshman work. Upon entering this class he elects his specialty. The courses thereafter diverge according as the student is an applicant for a degree in Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Chemical, or Mining Engineering. Programs of study for each degree are given below. The courses are so ordered that the specified entrance requirements are adequate for the work of the Freshman Year. Each succeeding year pre-supposes the completion of the work for all the foregoing years. Students are advised to adhere strictly to the regular programs. The arrangements specified in them have been carefully planned and are the best. Departures from the curriculum will in almost every case produce conflicts in lecture hours or laboratory periods and may cost the student a year's time. Haphazard election is discouraged and in extreme cases will be prohibited. No student will be registered for a course unless, in the opinion both of the Dean and of the professor, his preliminary training has fitted him for the profitable pursuit of that course. Students are especially advised against the attempt to crowd too many studies into their scheme of work, and are warned that admission to advanced courses will be granted only to those who have adequate mathematical and scientific training to profit by them. Men overloaded with work, too great in volume or in difficulty for their powers, suffer inevitable discouragement and incur almost certain failure. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. Changes of classes with transfer of fees may be made, subject to the approval of the Dean, within two weeks after the beginning of any term. Thereafter such changes may be made only by special order of the faculty, and then without transfer of fees. Upon the completion of the four years' course as defined in any one of the Programs of Study, the faculty will award to any student in regular and honorable standing the appropriate degree of Civil Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Chemical Engineer, or Mining Engineer. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION.

The examination day for a particular course is indicated in the table above by the Roman numeral in the space denoting hour of lecture. The examination period covers ten days at the end of each term. A change in lecture period for any course will change the examination day correspondingly. Classes for which lecture periods are not indicated will have examination days fixed by the arranged lecture hour in accordance with above schedule. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. EXPENSES OF REGULAR STUDENTS. The average annual expense of a student who pursues the regular course in Engineering will be: NonVirginians Virginians University Fee $ 40 $ 20 Tuition and Laboratory Fees (average) 200 125 Living Expenses (for nine months) 400 400 Books and Drawing Materials 30 30 Incidental Expenses (for nine months) 60 60 Total annual for average conditions $730 $635 The charges for Tuition are uniform to all students, except that Virginians are relieved of tuition on courses offered in the College, this exception saving regular Freshmen from Virginia $100 and all other Virginia students $65 each year in comparison with non-Virginians. The laboratory charges are $15 per class for the year's course in Physics, and $20 per class for a year's course in Chemistry. A deposit for breakage of $5 is required for each laboratory course in Chemistry. The fee for each practice course in the Engineering Department, Drawing, Engineering Laboratories, and Shop-work is $5 per term for each course. The fees for Field-work and Bridge Drafting are each $10 per term per course. These fees include all charges for laboratory materials; but the student is held further responsible for breakage. The living Expenses include board, lodging, fuel and lights, servant and laundry; the average is $10.00 per week, the minimum $7.50, and a reasonable maximum $12.50. Books and Drawing Materials will cost about $120 for the four-year course. Incidental Expenses ought to be kept within modest bounds; the above estimate is sufficient; large allowances of pocket money promote idleness and attract companions of the baser sort. No allowances are included for clothing and travel, the expenses for which vary too much to be introduced into any general estimate. The charges payable on entrance are the University Fee, and the Tuition and Laboratory Fees. EXAMINATIONS AND REPORTS. Oral examinations are held at the beginning of each lecture hour on the topics of the preceding lecture. Written test papers are set monthly, or at such interval as the professor may appoint. Absences from lecture except by reason of sickness are not excused without a written leave from the Dean. Class standing is determined on the basis of the oral examinations and the written tests. Absence from the latter or failure to answer incurs a zero grade. Absences from laboratory periods, however caused, must be made up by special private arrangement with the instructor. Written examinations are held at the end of each term on the entire DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. work of that term. The result of examination combined with the student's class-standing gives his term-grade. The pass-mark is seventy-five per cent. Absence from the written term examination incurs a zero term-grade, which may not be removed except by the passage of a special written examination on the work of that term. Such special examinations are granted only upon presentation of a written certificate from a reputable physician that the student by reason of sickness on the day of the regular examination was unable to attend. Regular Reports are sent out at the end of every term to the student's parent or guardian. These state for each course followed the term-grade and the number of absences. Further comment may be added by the Dean or the professor, if it appears probable that such comment would be helpful to the student. Parents are urged to examine these reports carefully and to exert such parental influence as may seem needed to establish and confirm the student in habits of industry and order. Special Reports are sent to parents at the end of each month for students delinquent in attendance or studiousness and for delinquents only. When a student is making steady progress and showing due diligence in his work, only the regular reports are sent. The receipt of a special report is evidence that, in the judgment of the faculty, prompt and pointed parental admonition is urgently needed. If in any class in the Department of Engineering a student fails to make satisfactory progress, he is first admonished by the professor in charge. In default of prompt and permanent improvement, he is next formally warned by the Dean. If due amendment is then not immediately effected, the student's name is dropped from the rolls of the Department, on the ground that he is not accomplishing the purposes for which he should have entered upon a University course of study. REGULATIONS. The following regulations, adopted to define the policy of the faculty, are published for the information and guidance of the students: 1. Practice-courses as well as lecture-courses must be conducted under the Honor System. The student who submits any work to be graded is considered to submit it under pledge. 2. When the lecture-course and the associated practice-course are given in the same term of the same year, no student will be admitted to examination on the lecture-course until he has completed at least three-fourths of the practice-course. 3. No student will be admitted to any practice-course unless he is at the same time pursuing the associated lecture-course, or has already received credit for the same. 4. No student will be admitted to the graduating examination on a DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. lecture-course unless he has been present at more than half the lectures in that course. 5. In the technical courses in Engineering (i. e., courses not given in the College) term-grades shall not be averaged; except that the term-grades for Freshman Applied Mathematics may be averaged for the first-year men only, provided no mark is below 65. 6. The pass-mark in every course is 75. Class standing is estimated at 20 points; the written examination at 80 points. 7. No student who fails to make 75 on term-grade shall be granted another examination on the course until he has again attended lectures on that course. 8. Special examinations are not given except by reason of sickness on the day of examination, attested by the written certificate of a reputable physician, or for other like providential causes. In every case they must be validated by special vote of the faculty. 9. A student whose term-grades average less than 40 for all the courses in which he is registered shall be at once dropped from the rolls. If his average is above 40 with no mark above 65, he is placed on probation. 10. A student on probation, who in the next term makes less than 65 on each and all his courses, shall be at once dropped from the rolls. ADVANCED STANDING. Under the elective system of the University of Virginia, a student who has completed courses of college or university grade in other institutions of learning on mathematical or scientific subjects may be excused from attendance upon these courses by the Dean, with the advice and consent of the professors in charge, and will then be registered for the more advanced work. In order to secure College Credit upon such courses toward a degree in Engineering from this University, the applicant must showâ 1. That the courses offered are coextensive with the corresponding courses as given in the University of Virginia. 2. That his grades on them were not below the seventy-five per cent. pass-mark of this University. Such credits may be granted by the faculty upon the recommendation of the Dean and the professors in charge; but are automatically revoked by the failure of the student to pass in the more advanced courses in the related topics. The same rules apply to Credits on Summer School Courses; except that for courses in the Summer School of this University the examination questions must be prepared by the professor in charge of the regular course, and the answers must be read and graded by him. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING Credits on Practice-Courses in Drawing, Shop-work, or Field-work may be granted to applicants who have gained in professional practice the training which these courses represent. Such applicants must file with the Dean proper certificates from the official under whom the work was done and must in addition pass a practical test on the subjects for which credit is desired. College credit is not granted for high-school work. DRAFTING ROOMS. The drafting rooms are abundantly lighted and are provided with solidly constructed tables with locked drawers for instruments and materials. Each student is assigned to a table and has a drawer for his exclusive use. The regular Drawing Classes execute each one plate a week under the supervision of the Instructors in Drawing. The more advanced students have such additional drawings assigned by their respective professors as are needed for the full development of the courses of study. Careful attention is given to the training of the students in free-hand lettering, in the conventional signs of mechanical drawing, in the proper lay-out of drawings, and in neat and accurate execution. Exercises are required also in tracing and in blue-printing, the rooms for which are conveniently arranged and in close contiguity to the drafting rooms. While, however, technical dexterity is demanded, the graphical method is taught and used primarily as an indispensable instrument of research, the thoughtful mastery of which is essential for the instructed Engineer. The construction and theory of the Polar Planimeter, the Slide Rule, and the Pantograph are carefully taught, and the student is trained in the practical use of these appliances for the rapid and accurate production of estimates and copies from finished drawings. SHOPS. The machine shop is provided with six first-class engine lathes, illustrating the practice of the best American makers; with a planer, a shaper, two drill presses, a universal milling machine (Brown &amp; Sharpe), and a universal grinder (same makers); also with a gas forge for tempering tools, a cut-off saw for metal rods, an emery wheel, grindstone, and so on. The wood shop is furnished with five small lathes, a large pattern-maker's lathe, a jointer, a planer, a saw bench for slitting and cross-cutting, a band-saw, a jig-saw, and a wood trimmer for pattern-making, six cabinetmaker's benches, and an ample supply of hand tools. EXPERIMENTAL ENGINEERING LABORATORIES. Road Materials Laboratory.âThe apparatus for tests of non-bituminous road materials includes a two-cylinder Deval abrasion machine, a ball mill, a moulding press for briquettes of rock dust, a Page impact cementation tester, a Page impact toughness tester, a rock crusher and a Purdue brick rattler. This outfit the University owes to the generous aid of the DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. late Dr. Logan Waller Page. In addition, the Department has acquired a 40,000-pound compression tester, a diamond core drill, a diamond rock saw, a grinding lap, a Westphal balance, specific gravity apparatus, and a complete set of sieves. Useful researches in the road-building rocks and gravels of Virginia, as well as the standard tests, are conducted each year by the class in Civil Engineering. The apparatus for tests of bituminous road materials includes the New York Testing Laboratory penetrometer, the Kirschbaum ductility machine, the Engler viscosimeter, the asphalt viscosimeter, the New York Testing Laboratory extractor, the New York State Board of Health oil tester, Hubbard pyknometers, asphalt flow plates, gas and electric hot plates, and the accessory apparatus needed for research on bituminous road-binders. Structural Materials Laboratory.âThe Sinclair Laboratory for work in testing structural materials was founded on the original donation of Mrs. John Sinclair, of New York City, as a memorial to her late husband. The collection has since been considerably enlarged. It contains a Riehle 100,000-pound machine, arranged for tensile, compressive, and transverse tests, with an attachment for taking autographic diagrams; an Olsen 100,000-pound machine fitted with a suspended ball compression block; an Olsen torsion machine of 50,000-inch pounds capacity; a Ewing machine for finding the modulus of elasticity; hand machines for testing rods and wires under pull, and small specimens of timber and cast iron under transverse loads. It is also equipped with accessory measuring instruments; these include a Henning extensometer, an Olsen compressometer, and a Ewing optical extensometer of great delicacy. The laboratory is completely equipped for making tests of cement, cement aggregates, and concrete. It contains a Fairbank's tensile tester of 1,000 pounds capacity; an Olsen steaming oven for accelerated tests; an Olsen drying oven with automatic temperature regulation; moist air closets; sieves for mechanical analysis; moulds for tension and compression tests; and the required small apparatus. Fuel and Oil Laboratory.âFor the determination of the heating value of coal, petroleum, etc., the laboratory has an Emerson bomb calorimeter. For gas calorimetry, a Junker calorimeter made by the American Meter Co. is used. The equipment also includes a Braun gas muffle furnace, a Brown high resistance pyrometer, balances, platinum crucibles, etc. For investigating the coefficient of friction for lubricants, the laboratory has an Olsen-Cornell oil tester, and is further equipped with such apparatus as flash and chill point testers, hydrometers, viscosimeters, etc., used in the determination of the physical properties of oils. Hydraulics Laboratory.âThe laboratory equipment for work in hydraulics comprises a steel tank for weir experiments with interchangeable bronze notches; a hook gauge for measurement of surface levels; a standpipe provided with a set of standard bronze orifices for experiments on DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. efflux; commercial pipe and elbows arranged for determining friction losses; and the necessary scales, tanks, manometers, etc. It also includes a pump which is piped to circulate water from a cement cistern to a tank in the attic of the building. Power Laboratory.âThe laboratory is equipped to illustrate the theory involved in Mechanical Engineering; to give practical instruction in the handling of machinery; and to teach the fundamental methods of experimental work. It contains a Ball high-speed engine; a De Laval turbine with condensing and non-condensing nozzles, which is direct-connected to a 20-kva. alternating-current generator; an Otto gasoline engine with a special piston for alcohol; a Wheeler surface condenser to which the exhaust from any of the steam units may be connected; a Sturtevant blower; an air compressor; an A. B. C. Pitot tube; a steam pump; steam traps, etc. For boiler tests, the boilers of the University Heating and Lighting Plant are used. The instrument room contains all necessary apparatus for carrying out complete tests. Among this may be mentioned indicators, thermometers, gauges, planimeters, with standards for their correction and calibration; two types of Orsat apparatus; separating and throttling calorimeters, etc. FIELD WORK IN CIVIL ENGINEERING. The outfit of field instruments contains compasses, transits, and levels of various approved makes; a solar transit, furnished also with stadia wires and gradienter for tachymetric work; hand-levels and clinometers for field topography; plane tables; a sextant; together with an adequate supply of leveling rods, telemeter rods, signal poles, chains, tapes, pins, and so on. For hydraulic surveys a hook guage and a current meter are provided. All students are instructed in the theory and adjustments of the field instruments and in their practical use in the field. They are also required to make up their field-books in standard forms; to reduce their surveys and execute all the necessary profiles, plans, and maps; and to determine lengths, areas, and volumes both from the maps and from the original notes. Polar planimeters are provided for facilitating such estimates, and a pantograph for making reduced copies of finished drawings. In recognition of the growing interest in Good Roads in Virginia and the immense social and economic importance of the construction of such roads in all parts of the commonwealth, the Faculty of the Department of Engineering has rearranged the courses of instruction in this topic and brought them together into the Spring Term, so as to form a special course in highway engineering for the benefit of young men from Virginia who wish to go into public highway work. To such Virginians, if adequately prepared and recommended, free scholarships will be given. Application should be made to the Dean, accompanied by recommendations from the State Highway Commissioner or from the Board of Supervisors of the applicant's county. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING LABORATORY. The Scott Laboratory of Electrical Engineering.âThis laboratory was initially equipped and endowed by Mrs. Frances Branch Scott, of Richmond, Va., as a memorial to her late son, an alumnus of this University. During the year 1910 the equipment was substantially increased through the generosity of the Hon. Charles R. Crane, of Chicago, Ill., a friend of the University. During 1912 still further substantial additions were made, consisting of measuring instruments, auxiliary control apparatus, and more particularly a steam-turbine-driven three-phase alternating-current generator with exciter and control switchboard. In addition to full sets of electric meters with the appliances for testing and calibrating them, galvanometers of the best modern types, standard cells and resistances, standard condensers, and other pieces of apparatus for minor tests, this laboratory contains numerous pieces of the very best construction. Such are the Wolff potentiometer, the Seimens and Halske Thomson double bridge, the Koepsel permeameter, the Duddell double projection oscillograph, the Station photometer with Lummer-Brodhun screen, the Carey-Foster bridge and others. For the work in machine-testing there are a number of direct-current generators and motors, series, shunt and compound, an interpole motor, a double current generator, a two-phase alternator, a General Electric experimental test set for alternating current, comprising a generator furnishing single, two, three, six or twelve-phase current, and, in addition, offering three types of induction motors with all necessary starting and controlling devices, a single-phase repulsion motor, a two-phase induction motor, two three-phase induction motors, several pairs of constant voltage transformers, a constant current transformer, frequency meters, power factor indicator, synchronism indicator, ground detector and the auxiliary apparatus used in testing these machines. The laboratory has been arranged with a system of universal plug and receptacle-connections to facilitate the setting up of all experimental combinations. BUILDINGS. The buildings devoted wholly or in part to the work of the Department of Engineering are the following: The Mechanical Laboratory is the main seat of the instruction in technical studies. It is 180 by 70 feet and contains on the main floor the Dean's office and the offices of three other professors; and three lecture-rooms. Above are an office, a small drafting room for advanced students, and blue-print and photographic rooms. Below on the ground floor are an office and classroom, the electrical laboratories, the testing laboratories, apparatus and storerooms, and the students' lavatory. In order to more adequately care for increased numbers this building has undergone a considerable rearrangement during the past year. Wood and machine shop equipment has been entirely removed from the building, as well as the facilities DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. for Freshman and Sophomore Drawing. This change made available much needed classroom space and allowed the electrical laboratories to be expanded. Incident to the changes new cement floors were constructed for the Road Materials Testing Laboratory, the main testing Laboratory and the main hall. A new high-pressure steam line from the Power House was also installed. The Shops are now temporarily housed in the Garage erected for the Motor Truck Training Detachment. This building gives a floor space of some 5,000 square feet and has allowed the rearrangement of wood and machine shop equipment for group drive by four electric motors. Space is also available in this structure for use in connection with the course in automobile construction and testing. The Drawing Room is temporarily housed near Peabody Hall in one of the Barracks taken from the Training Camp site and rebuilt and fitted for drawing. The building accommodates about 180 men, each man having his individual drawing desk. The Power House is a single-story building 110 by 40 feet. In addition to the University boiler plant and the electric lighting plant, this contains the foundry and the forge-room. The Boiler plant consists of two horizontal return-tubular boilers, each of 140 horse-power. The lighting plant consists of three electric generators directly connected to high-speed engines, the respective capacities being 25, 50, and 75 kilowatts. The whole plant is available for purposes of instruction, study and experiment. The Geological Museum is 120 by 50 feet. It is a three-story building. The main floor is devoted to the very extensive geological collection of specimens, charts, relief maps, and so on. The gallery above contains an equally good collection of minerals and numerous models of typical crystallographic forms. The upper floor contains the lecture-rooms and the laboratories of Economic Geology. In the basement are stored subsidiary collections and new material accumulated in more recent geological surveys. The Physical Laboratory faces the Mechanical Laboratory on the opposite side of the quadrangle, and has almost the same proportions. The main floor contains the lecture-room, the professors' offices, the laboratory of experimental physics, and the storeroom for the very large collection of apparatus used in the lectures. On the ground floor is the laboratory of theoretical electricity, the storage battery room, a well-equipped shop for the repair and manufacture of apparatus, and smaller rooms for the work of graduate students. The new Chemical Laboratory was opened for use in September, 1917. In this fire-proof structure all the work in Chemistry is assembled. The floor area provided is about 30,000 square feet. The lecture-rooms seat classes of 300, 75 and 25 students. The laboratories assigned to General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Qualitative Analysis, Quantitative Analysis, and Physical Chemistry contain 110, 60, 40, 30, and 20 desks. Altogether by dividing classes into sections, 600 students may be accommodated. Smaller private laboratories are provided for research workers. Large DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. stock rooms communicating by elevators with the several floors contain ample stores of chemical supplies. The 5,000 volumes of books and bound sets of journals constituting the Departmental Library of Chemistry are so housed as to be accessible to both teachers and students. INSTRUCTION IN ARCHITECTURE. Instruction leading to the professional degree of Bachelor of Science in Architecture is offered in the University by the McIntire School of Fine Arts in collaboration with the Department of Engineering and with the other academic schools. This work is under the administrative jurisdiction of the College, and the rules of the College regarding entrance requirements, fees, choice of courses, and requirements for degrees are those which apply in it. For the courses offered, equipment, etc., see pp. 112-115.</field>

Historical.âAmong the original Schools contemplated in Mr. Jefferson's plan for the organization of the University of Virginia was "Law: Municipal and Foreign; Embracing the General Principles, Theory and Practice of Jurisprudence, together with the Theory and Principles of Constitutional Government." Accordingly the School of Law was established in 1826, and has been in continuous operation since. From the establishment of the Law School until 1894, the course comprised the work of a single year. With the session of 1894-1895, a two years' course was inaugurated, which continued up to the session of 1909-1910, when the course was extended to three years. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. The aim of the Department of Law has always been to maintain a high standard as a requirement for graduationâthe degree being conferred only upon such students as are thorough masters of the prescribed course of study. This policy has been rigorously enforced, and its wisdom has been vindicated by the high position which the graduates of the Law School are accustomed to attain at the bar and in public life. The course of instruction has been extended from time to time to conform to changing conditions and to meet the increasing needs of the profession. Minor Hall.âThe Law School is accommodated in its own building, designated as Minor Hall, in honor of the late John B. Minor, whose distinguished service of fifty years as a professor in the Law School, the University thus commemorates. The building is located between Dawson's Row and the southern end of West Range. The architecture is on classic lines, in keeping with the general design of the other university buildings. It contains on the first floor four large lecture halls, with convenient offices, lavatories, etc., and on the second floor a stack room with ample space for books, two commodious reading rooms, and a number of offices for the use of the librarian and the teaching staff. Law Library.âThe Library contains fifteen thousand and seven hundred volumes. Its financial resources, from appropriations by the Visitors, and from income from special endowments, make possible the addition of several hundred volumes annually. The Library contains the English Reports, practically complete, from and including the Year Books to date; the United States Supreme Court Reports; reports of all the American States; the National Reporter System, complete; selected and annotated reports, together with modern search-books in the form of general Digests (including the Century and Decennial editions), and the leading Encyclopedias, besides a large collection of textbooks, bound volumes of law magazines, etc. Law students have all the privileges of the general University Library, containing more than ninety thousand volumes. The Library is the beneficiary of two special endowments of ten thousand dollars each,âone the gift of William W. Fuller, Esq. ('78), and the other of Farrell Dabney Minor, Esq. ('83) and Mrs. Minor, in memory of their son, the late Lieutenant Farrell Dabney Minor, Jr. ('11), who died in France (1918) from wounds received in battle. The Virginia Law Review.âUnder the title of The Virginia Law Review, the undergraduate students of the Law School conduct a law journal devoted to the discussion of general questions of American jurisprudence. Eight numbers are issued annually, from October to May inclusive. The Review is now in its eighth volume. From its inception it has maintained a high standard of excellence, and a worthy rank among the leading law journals of the country. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. Suggestions as to Preliminary Education.âStudents, and their parents or guardians, are admonished that the law is peculiarly an intellectual profession, DEPARTMENT OF LAW. and for its successful prosecution, whether in a law school or in the broader fields of professional life, demands a well-trained mind. If it be true that untrained recruits, in rare instances, under diligent and persistent effort, develop into successful practitioners after entrance upon the practice, such exceptional cases but serve to illustrate the rule that out of a given number of candidates entering upon the study of law, those with sound preliminary training will have incomparably the advantage, while those without such training are likely never to rise above mediocrity in their profession. The experience of the Law Facultyâindeed, of all law teachersâis, that the standing and progress of law students may, in general, be measured by their academic preparation. Students are therefore advised not to begin their legal studies until they have completed an academic course approximating that required for a baccalaureate degree. So high a standard, however, is not exacted as a condition of entrance into the Law School. These conditions are shown in the following sections. 1. Regular Students.âCandidates for the degree of Bachelor of Laws must have attained the age of at least nineteen years before entering the department, must produce a certificate of good character from the school or college last attended, or from other satisfactory source, and must conform to the general requirements following: For Admission to the Department of Law, in addition to the completion of an approved high school course of four years, or its equivalent, the candidate must present evidence that he has pursued at least two years, of fifteen session-hours each, of standard college work, of which he must have successfully completed at least twenty-four session-hours, distributed among three or more courses, and exclusive of courses in Art, Music, Commercial Law, Education (Course B3, as described in the bulletin of the Department of Education of this University, or its equivalent completed elsewhere, will be accepted), Physical or Military Training, and Public Speaking. A session-hour is one hour a week of recitation, or two hours a week of laboratory work, throughout the college year. Credit will be given for completed courses only. A completed course is one for which the student is entitled to final credit toward a baccalaureate degree. It is deemed advisable that in preparation for entering the Law School the student select his courses from among the following subjects: English, Latin, French or Spanish, History, a Natural Science, Mathematics, Government, Accounting, and for students of more than average maturity Economics, Logic and Ethics. Admission of Women.âWith the beginning of the session 1920-21, women were admitted to the Law School for the first time. The conditions of their admission as Special Students, and, beginning with the session of 1922-1923 as Regular Students, are the same as in the case of male applicants. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. Forensic Debating.âAs indicated in a preceding regulation, Forensic Debating is excluded from the category of courses accepted in fulfillment of entrance requirements. This course, however, as one of the required subjects in the regular curriculum of the Law School, may be substituted by the completion of an equivalent course in the College of this university, or other institution of collegiate rank, evidenced by proper certificate. But the student is advised to defer the pursuit of this course until entrance into the Law School. The High School Subjects for Admission to the College, and their values in units are indicated in the General Catalogue of the University, in connection with that department. Evidence of the Required High School and College Work must be in the form of a certificate, properly authenticated by the Registrar or other authorized official of the institution at which the work was done. 2. Special Students.âAn applicant who is at least 23 years old, and who presents proper evidence of good character, and of needful maturity and training, though unable to fulfill the foregoing entrance requirements, may, by special action of the Law Faculty, in exceptional cases, be admitted as a special student, and not as a candidate for the degree. Every applicant for admission as a special student is required to make written application to the Dean of the University, on a blank furnished for the purpose, with detailed information as to his age, general habits, his educational and business experience, and his general fitness to undertake the study of law. Such application, together with such testimonials as may be required, should be filed with the Dean of the University not later than September 1 of the year in which the applicant desires to enter the Law School. Every such applicant for admission as a special student must (if required) pass a satisfactory examination, to be held at the University during the registration days of the session. The examination, which will be conducted by a committee of the Law Faculty, may include the subjects of English, American and English History, and Civil Government. This regulation is subject to the general university regulation as to delayed entrance examinations. Special students who fail to complete 60 per cent. of the work taken during any session may be declared ineligible for readmission the following session. Admission to Advanced Standing.âNo credit is given, in any case, for attendance at another law school, nor for time spent in private reading.1 1. Credit may be received, however, for Forensic Debating. See above. The candidate for graduation must spend three years in residence. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. GENERAL INFORMATION. The Session begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September, and continues for thirty-nine weeks ending about June 15. The first three days of the session are given to registration, and all students, both old and new, are required during that time to place their names upon the books of the University and the rolls of their respective classes. Lecture courses begin on the Monday following, and absences will be recorded against any student not present from the opening lecture of each course. Students entering after the first three days, without satisfactory excuse, will be charged a fee for registration. The session is divided into Three Terms. The first term ends December 23; the second, March 21; and the third, with the close of the session. Late Entrance.âStudents are advised that late entrance upon the work of any term is a serious hindrance to progress. The student who enters late must begin his work at the point to which the several courses have advanced at the time of his entrance; and credit for three years' attendance cannot be secured unless the student is in actual residence at least thirty weeks per session. No registration in absentia is permissible. When Students May Enter.âIt is highly desirable that students of any year, and particularly those entering the work of the first year, should enter at the beginning of the year's work which they propose to pursue. Where this is impossible students may register at the beginning of the second term, but no later, save in exceptional cases. In case of such late entrance the student's chief handicap (often a serious one) will be lack of familiarity with preceding courses, on some of which his own work may be based. Entrance at the beginning of the later term, therefore, is not advised, but only permitted. Where the student has thus entered in a later term, he may not make up the work of the earlier term except by returning for such portion of a fourth year as is covered by the term omitted. Expenses.âThe necessary expenses of a student in the Department of Law may be estimated at $500 per session of nine months. This minimum estimate includes all university and tuition fees, board, lodging, washing and books. An average estimate would be $600 per session, reckoning board, lodging, and washing at a somewhat higher figure. The university fee applicable to all law students (including those from Virginia) is $40; and the tuition fee is $160 for the regular work of each session. Three Years' Course.âThe course of study embraces three years of thirty-seven weeks each, exclusive of holidays. Residence for three years, with attendance of at least thirty weeks a year, exclusive of holidays, is essential to graduation. Plan of Instruction.âThe instruction is as thorough as possible, and is DEPARTMENT OF LAW. given mainly through textbooks and lectures, supplemented in some of the courses by the study of cases. While convinced of the value of the combined textbook and lecture system, which has prevailed for more than half a century in the Law School, the Law Faculty have long appreciated the value that the study of cases possesses, in illustrating the practical application of legal principles. The present organization of the Law School gives opportunity for more emphasis on this form of instruction, and the case-book is now used more extensively than heretoforeânot as supplanting, but as supplementing, textbooks and lectures. The daily oral quiz has long been a marked and, as experience has proved, a most valuable feature of the system of instruction. This oral quiz is supplemented by frequent written tests, the results of which are carefully recorded, and, in the professor's discretion, are considered in estimating the final grade of the student. Practical Work.âIn the courses on Equity Procedure, Virginia Pleading, Practice at Law, Code Pleading, Criminal Procedure, Forensic Debating, and Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, special stress is laid upon practical work. In the Pleading and Procedure courses, every student is required to draw, and submit for correction and criticism, the principal pleadings, orders, decrees, and other forms encountered in actual litigation. In the course on Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, an intimate acquaintance with law books and skill in their use are secured by oral and written quizzes, and finally by practical tests; and briefs on assigned topics are required to be prepared according to rigorous standards. Much practical work is done in the headnoting of cases, on scientific principles. Required for Graduation.âThe degree of Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) is conferred upon such students as have satisfied the entrance requirements; have attended three full sessions of the Law School and have successfully passed the required examinations, with satisfactory performance of assigned practical work. More specifically, the candidate for graduation must have completed all of the obligatory courses (see Outline of Courses, below), and at least two elective courses, one of which must be Virginia Pleading or Code Pleading. OUTLINE OF COURSES. The schedule, as outlined below, contemplates an average of ten lecture periods (or fifteen hours) per week. Written examinations are held during the final week of each term, on the subjects completed during the term. See Schedule of Examinations, page 219. DEPARTMENT OF LAW.

Registration of New Students.âBefore registration in the Law School, students who have not before been registered in any department of the University must produce to the Dean of the Law School (office in Minor Hall) a certificate from the Dean of the University that entrance requirements have been fulfilled. 2. Registration Generally.âStudents must register in advance at the office of the Dean of the Law School and with the Registrar for every course taken, and no credit will be given for work done in any course without proper registration therefor. 3. Delayed Registration.âStudents are not permitted to delay their registration through carelessness or for inadequate reasons. Any student, new or old, who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session, and between the hours of nine a. m. and two p. m. on the first week-day after the Christmas Recess, will be charged a special registration fee of five dollars. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. 4. Exchange or Omission of Courses.âAfter registration no course may be exchanged or omitted except on the written approval of the professor in charge and of the Dean. 5. Carrying Over Uncompleted Work.âStudents who are deficient in the work of one year will be permitted to take but a limited amount of the work of the succeeding year. 6. Minimum for Which Student Must Register.âNo student, without special permission, and for good cause, may register for less than nine periods per week. 7. Advanced Work.âStudents of one year are not permitted to anticipate the courses of a subsequent year, without urgent reasons satisfactory to the Dean. 8. Late Entrance into Classes.âNo credit is given for the completion of any course upon which the student has entered after fifty per centum of the lectures thereon have been delivered. See Requirements for Graduation, ante, p. 213. 9. Optional Attendance.âA student who has failed on an examination but who has attended the required lectures on the subject may, on written application, with the endorsed approval of the professor in charge, and of the Dean, secure optional attendance on such subject the following session, but subject to Regulation 5. Re-examination are not granted in any other form. 10. General Requirements.âEvery student of the Law School is required to attend all regular exercises of the classes of which he is a member, and to perform all the work assigned, including quizzes and examinations, unless excused for good cause. 11. Invalids.âStudents whose condition of health is too precarious to permit regular attendance upon lectures, but not serious enough to admit them as patients of the hospital, will be required to withdraw from the University until able to resume their regular work. 12. Conditions of Readmission.âAny student who, without satisfactory cause, has not attained for the session, on his examinations, credit for courses comprising in the aggregate at least 150 lecture periods, will be excluded from the Law School the following session. In this connection, attention is called to Regulation 5 foregoing. 13. First-Year Students.âFailure on the part of any first-year student, without just cause, to attain, for the first term, an average grade of 75 per cent. on the daily written quizzes, will place such student on probation for the remainder of the session, and the student and his parent or guardia will be so notified. Unless, in the opinion of the Law Faculty, a decided improvement DEPARTMENT OF LAW. in the character of such student's work is indicated at the end of the second term, he will be required to withdraw from the Law School. 14. Absence from the University is permitted on the written leave of the dean of the Law School. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or musical clubs on excursions will not be granted, except to the officers and members of the organizations. Nor, except for good cause, may leaves be granted in anticipation or extension of holidays. 15. Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors for sickness or other providential cause. Such excuses must be rendered promptly. Unexcused absences from lectures render the student liable to be disciplined. 16. Special Examinations.âNo special examinations are granted, save in cases of sickness on the day of examination (attested by physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause approved by the Law Faculty. In no case will such examination be granted unless prompt application be made therefor. 17. Third-Year StudentsâIncomplete Work.âCandidates for the degree, who have failed on one or more subjects during their third year, may return the following session, and stand the regular examinations on such subjects, without further attendance upon lectures. But this privilege may be exercised but onceâthat is to say, after a second failure the candidate must take the lectures over again, on the subject or subjects on which he has for a second time proved deficient. See Regulation 9. 18. Examination Fees.âThe fee for standing such examinations as are mentioned in the preceding regulation is $5 for each examination taken. Students who, under such circumstances, return for further lectures, and who have paid full matriculation and tuition fees for three years, pay a matriculation fee in proportion to the amount of work taken plus $5 for each course. There is no charge for special examinations granted for imperative cause. 19. Application for Degree.âCandidates for graduation are required to file a written application with the Dean, not later than November 15th of their third year, indicating the courses completed, together with a schedule of the courses to be pursued during their final year. Blanks for this purpose will be supplied at the Dean's office. 20. Required Withdrawal.âThe right is reserved to require the withdrawal of any student who, in the opinion of the faculty, is not profiting nor likely to profit by the instruction offered; or whose neglect or irregular performance of required duties, after admonition, indicates indifference or contumacy; or whose character or habits are a menace to the good order of the Law School. 21. Honor System.âAll examinations are conducted under the Honor System.</field>

A unit is the credit value of at least thirty-six weeks' work of four or five recitation periods per week, each recitation period to be not less than forty minutes. II. PREMEDICAL COLLEGE COURSE. The requirements given below are strictly minimum requirements. Premedical students are advised to take more than thirty session-hours of college work, either by spending an additional year in college or by taking thirty-three or thirty-six session-hours during their two years as college students. Entrance conditions of any kind whatsoever are absolutely prohibited and no substitution can be allowed for any required subject. In addition to the high-school work specified above, a candidate for admission to the Department of Medicine must present evidence of the completion of at least thirty session-hours of collegiate work in a college approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association. A session-hour is the credit value of one hour a week of DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. lecture or recitation or two hours a week of laboratory work throughout a session of at least thirty-two weeks, exclusive of holidays. The subjects included in the thirty session-hours of college work should be in accordance with the following schedule: Required Subjects: Session-hours. General Inorganic Chemistry (a) 4 Organic Chemistry (b) 3 Physics (c) 4 Biology (d) 4 English Composition and Literature (e) 3 Other non-science subjects, including one ancient or modern language (f) 6 Subjects Strongly Urged: French or German, Advanced Botany or Advanced ZoÃ¶logy, Psychology, Advanced Algebra, Solid Geometry, and Trigonometry, additional courses in Chemistry. Other Suggested Electives: English (additional), Economics, History, Sociology, Political Science, Logic, Mathematics, Latin, Greek, Drawing. REQUIREMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL COLLEGIATE SUBJECTS. (a) General Inorganic Chemistry. Four session-hours are required, including two session-hours of laboratory work. In the interpretation of this rule work in qualitative analysis may be counted as general inorganic chemistry. (b) Organic Chemistry. Three session-hours are required of which at least one must be laboratory work. Four session-hours including two session-hours of laboratory work are recommended as giving better preparation in organic chemistry. Students are advised to take, in addition to the required general and inorganic chemistry at least four session-hours in qualitative analysis and two session-hours in quantitative analysis. (c) Physics. Four session-hours required, of which at least one must be laboratory work. It is urged that this course be preceded by a course in trigonometry and solid geometry. (d) Biology. Four session-hours required, of which two must consist of laboratory work. The requirement may be satisfied by a course of four session-hours in general biology or zoÃ¶logy, or by courses of two session-hours each in zoÃ¶logy and botany, but not by botany alone. (e) English Composition and Literature. The usual introductory college course of three session-hours, or its equivalent, is required. (f) Non-Science Subjects Including One Modern Foreign Language. Of the thirty session-hours required as the measurement of two years of DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. college work, at least nine, including three session-hours of English, should be in subjects other than the physical, chemical, or biologic sciences. At least three of these nine session-hours must be in an ancient or modern foreign language. When the student has presented for admission to College two units of high school work in an ancient or modern foreign language, he must complete three session-hours in the same language, this work to be the continuation and not a repetition of his high-school work. When the language studied in College was not studied in high school, he must complete work aggregating four and should preferably complete six session-hours in the language. College courses in Physical Training and in Military Training or Military Science will not be counted towards the thirty session-hours required for admission to medicine; nor will required courses in Bible and Biblical Literature be counted, unless the course has a credit value of at least three session-hours for one session. No entrance conditions whatever can be allowed nor can any substitutions be made for the required subjects. Premedical students in other colleges and universities who are considering the possibility of entering upon their medical studies in this university are urged to have the authorities of the University of Virginia pass officially upon their academic credit early in their last premedical college year and in no case later than June 1, of that year. Deficiencies may be discovered in this way in time to remove them before the following September. Such students will incur no obligation to enter this medical school. The prohibition of entrance conditions in all Class A medical colleges makes it especially important for the student to be absolutely sure six months or more beforehand that the course he is taking will admit him to the study of medicine. Many deficiencies can be made up by work in summer schools. Further information concerning the character of entrance requirements and forms for certificates may be obtained by addressing the Dean of the Department of Medicine. In planning two years of premedical college work students are advised to take English, mathematics (solid geometry, plane trigonometry, and advanced algebra), biology, and general inorganic chemistry the first year; and organic chemistry, physics, foreign language, and one or more electives the second year. This arrangement of studies is advised because mathematics should precede physics and general inorganic chemistry must precede organic chemistry. Those who have to take four or more session-hours of college work in foreign language may find it advisable to take foreign language both years and take the mathematics in a summer school following the first premedical college session. Admission with Advanced Standing.âStudents are admitted to advanced standing in the second and third years under the following conditions: 1. Satisfaction of the requirements for entrance into this department at the time of entrance of the class to which the applicant seeks admission. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. 2. The presentation of a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended. 3. The presentation of the complete record of the student in the school previously attended, on blanks to be obtained from the Dean of the Department of Medicine. This record will be submitted to the action of the Faculty Committee on Advanced Standing, and the admission of the student, together with the terms of admission, will be determined by this committee. Limitation of Numbers and Reservation of Places in the First-Year Class.âThe number of students in the first-year class is limited to sixty-five. Reservation of a place, if desired by the applicant, can be made beforehand on the conditions hereinafter described. Those intending to enter the Department of Medicine are advised to ascertain at once by correspondence with the Dean of the Department of Medicine whether their high-school and college courses entitle them to admission to the first-year class. For this purpose there may be obtained from the Dean a blank form on which the necessary information may be entered in full. At the time of registration, applicants will be registered in the order in which they present themselves, until all vacancies are filled. Applicants who have not made reservations, as described below, are therefore advised to apply for registration at 9 o'clock of the first day of registration (September 14, 1922). Any applicant whose record, certified by the proper official of the college last attended, has been endorsed by the Dean of the Department of Medicine as entitling him to admission to the first-year class, may at any time after June 25 and before the registration period in September have a place reserved for him until 12:00 noon of the first day of registration by depositing with the Bursar the sum of $50.00 in part payment of the tuition fee of the first year. A reservation so made can be cancelled only in exceptional cases. In case a student who has obtained a reservation fails to register, the deposit of $50.00 will be forfeited to the University unless, in case of illness or other providential cause, the Dean of the Department of Medicine directs that it be returned. Women over twenty years of age are admitted to the medical department by satisfying the entrance requirements specified above. FACILITIES FOR AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION. There are well-equipped laboratories for the study of organic chemistry, biochemistry, gross anatomy, histology and embryology, bacteriology and pathology, physiology, pharmacology, materia medica, and clinical diagnosis. These laboratories are all presided over by trained teachers, to whom teaching and investigation are primary considerations. The number of hours assigned to laboratory subjects is quite large and affords ample time for thorough study of the best methods. The student is brought into close contact with teachers who are both willing and able to guide him; he DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. gains a very large part of his knowledge at first hand and by his own exertions, and thus acquires the habit of working out things for himself; he becomes self-reliant, a quality essential to the practice of his difficult profession. Trained in this manner, he acquires an understanding of the medical sciences and the ability to apply the facts of these sciences to the subsequent study of disease. For these reasons the great fundamental sciences receive the utmost consideration, constituting the entire work of the first two years. The methods of clinical instruction are based upon the belief that no clinical teaching is efficient which is not governed by essentially the same principles as those which govern the best laboratory teaching. This instruction is accordingly designed to enforce with the individual student a careful, thorough, face-to-face study of disease and its management. The facilities afforded by the University Hospital and Out-Patient Department are described on a subsequent page. After two sessions devoted to laboratory training, the student is introduced in the third year to the study of disease in living persons. In the Out-Patient Department and in the Hospital he learns the methods of examining patients, of diagnosing their diseases, and of instituting rational treatment; and he learns these things in much the same way as he studied in the laboratory, that is to say, by doing them himself under the direction and criticism of the instructors. This practical training is accompanied by a systematic study of the various subjects by means of lectures, textbooks, and recitations. With this preparation the student is ready to enter upon the hospital work in his fourth year. Here he has advantages for clinical training similar to those enjoyed by internes. Each clinical patient on admission to the hospital is assigned to a student, and that patient is regarded as his "case." The student conducts a complete examination, records his observations in a scientific manner, makes a diagnosis, states his view as to the treatment indicated, and keeps a complete record of the case, all under the advice and criticism of the physician or surgeon in charge. He is expected to keep himself informed of the progress of the case throughout its course. If it is one requiring surgical treatment, he assists at the operation, and thus is able to follow all the procedures of the operator at close range. In addition, students make frequent visits to the wards with the attending physicians and surgeons, during which visits the nature, treatment, and progress of various cases are gone over in detail. To carry out this method of clinical instruction the hospital had last year over 3,500 cases. The patients of the Blue Ridge Sanatorium afford additional material for clinical instruction. Since the number of students in each class is relatively small, it is clear that the department offers capable young men clinical advantages which are distinctly exceptional. Opportunities are offered in the third and fourth years for more extended training in certain subjects with a view toward possible specialization after graduation. At the meetings of the Medical Journal Club reviews of important articles DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. and results of original research are presented by the instructors and by invited guests. These meetings are open to the students. REGULATIONS, EXPENSES, ETC. Regulations.âThe records given after the regular examination on a course, with their explanations, are as follows: Passed indicates the satisfactory completion of the course and admits to all dependent subjects. Conditioned means that to obtain a clear record on the course the student must pass a special examination. Failure to take or to pass this examination is equivalent to a record of "failed." The record "conditioned" is not given in fourth year subjects, except in case of illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty. A student may be conditioned on any examination because of failure to maintain a reasonable standard of English composition. Deficient indicates that part of the work of the course has not been completed. Upon the satisfactory completion of this work within the time and in the manner prescribed by the professor in charge, the student receives the record "passed"; otherwise the record is "failed" on the entire course. Failed indicates that the course must be repeated; except that when the laboratory or other practical work has been satisfactorily performed, the professor in charge may, at his discretion, excuse the student from repeating the same; and, by special vote of the faculty, the student may be granted optional attendance upon the course, in whole or in part. In general, a student who is repeating a course will be required to attend all the exercises of the course, and will not be excused from any exercise thereof because of schedule conflicts with more advanced work. Absence from a regular examination, when excused because of illness or other equivalent cause, gives a record of conditioned; if not excused, a record of failed. To pass a regular or a special examination, a grade of eighty per cent. is required. If the grade is less than eighty per cent. but not less than seventy per cent., the student is entitled to the record conditioned; but the record conditioned is not given in fourth-year subjects, except under the conditions noted above. No student will be admitted to any subject of the second or third year (save by the consent of the Dean and the professors concerned), if more than one-third of the work of the preceding year remains unfinished. If at the beginning of the year his deficiencies have not been made up by the satisfactory completion of courses at some school approved by the instructors in charge at this university, he may continue as a student in the Department of Medicine only by repeating the courses in which he has failed. In the interpretation of this rule the values of the subjects of the first and second years are estimated in points as follows: Anatomy 1, 36 points; Anatomy 2, 6 points; Histology, 18 points; Embryology, 9 points; Biochemistry, 30 points. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Anatomy 3, 8 points; Physiology, 24 points; Bacteriology, 12 points; Pathology, 28 points; Pharmacology, 11 points; Clinical Diagnosis, 12 points; Physical Diagnosis, 4 points. Whenever in the judgment of the faculty a student is receiving too many records below the grade of passed, the faculty may prescribe special conditions upon which the student may remain in the Department of Medicine, or may require his withdrawal therefrom. Students will not be allowed to undertake the work of the third or fourth year until they have completed that of the first year, save by special consent of the Medical Faculty. A student may not take any course, either in whole or in part (as explained under the above definition of failed) more than twice. A second record of failed on the same course involves withdrawal from the Department of Medicine. Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine, who have less than one full year's work to complete, may be required to take such additional work and to pass such additional examinations as the Medical Faculty may prescribe. This additional work may be selected from any of the courses given in the Department of Medicine, even when such prescribed courses have previously been taken and passed by the candidate in question. Certificates of Attendance.âStudents who attend the whole regular course of one or more of the four years are entitled to certificates of attendance. Requirements for Graduation.âThe degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred by the University of Virginia upon candidates who have complied with the entrance requirements of this department; attended a regular medical course of four years of at least eight months each, the last two of which years must have been at this institution; and have satisfactorily completed all of the subjects included in the medical course. Examinations.âThese are in writing, accompanied in many subjects by individual practical examinations. Examinations may be held only during the regular examination periods at the end of each term or during the vacation periods. No examinations may be given while regular class work is in progress; provided this rule is not to be interpreted to prohibit unannounced written tests or regular daily or weekly tests which count on the class standing of students. The regular examinations are held at stated periods during the session. In addition, examinations are held each year during the week immediately preceding the beginning of lectures. To the latter are admitted: 1. Students of the previous session who, from illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty, were unable to present themselves for examination in any particular subject at the regular time. 2. Students who at the regular examination in any first, second, or third year subject of the preceding session have attained a grade less than eighty per cent., but as much as seventy per cent., on one or more subjects, DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. as explained in a preceding paragraph; or any student who has received the record conditioned on a course taken in this university. 3. Certain applicants for advanced standing who are admitted to these examinations by the Committee on Advanced Standing. The usual period for special or conditioned examinations is in September during the week of registration; but such examinations may be scheduled, at the option of the professor in charge, for any other time, provided regular class work is not in progress and also provided all students entitled to take examination agree to the change of date. For a special or condition examination held at any other time than that assigned for all students entitled thereto a fee of five dollars is charged. This fee must be paid to the Bursar before the examination is held. In all courses in which there is practical work, either in the laboratory or in the outpatient department or wards of the hospital, two records are returned to the Registrar's office for each student: one of these records is for the practical laboratory or clinical workâin which the record is P(assed), D(eficient), or F(ailed), the other record is for the didactic work, including the final examinationsâin which case the record is P(assed), C(onditioned), D(eficient), or F(ailed), with the approximate percentage grade. To obtain a clear record on the course a student must have a record of P(assed) both on practical and on didactic work; in no case will the two grades be averaged. No record whatever is given on didactic work unless there is a record of P(assed) on practical work; failure on practical work gives a record of F(ailed) on the entire course. The Fall Examinations for 1922-1923 begin September 11 and close September 16. Students entitled to admission to these examinations will be informed of the date of examination by the Dean. Expenses.âThe fees for instruction are 1, the tuition fee; 2, the university fee which entitles the student to the use of the Library, Gymnasium, to medical attention, etc.; and 3, special laboratory fees, as specified below: FIRST YEAR SECOND YEAR THIRD YEAR FOURTH YEAR Tuition $160.00 $160.00 $135.00 $135.00 University fee 40.00 40.00 40.00 40.00 Laboratory fees: Biochemistry 10.00 Anatomy 17.50 2.50 Histology and Embryology 7.50 Physiology 10.00 Bacteriology and Pathology 12.50 Pharmacology 5.00 Clinical Diagnosis 10.00 Materia Medica and Toxicology 5.00 Total $235.00 $240.00 $180.00 $175.00 DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. The minimum for necessary living expenses, including room, heat, light, furniture, service, board, books, and laundry, is estimated at $400. In the course in Biochemistry, a deposit of $10 is required to cover cost of breakage. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University and the dean of the department in which the student is registered. When a permit is granted upon the University Physician's certificate that withdrawal is necessary on account of ill health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct, the fees are returned pro rata. Under no other circumstances will there be a return of fees. Combined Degrees in Arts (or Science) and Medicine.âStudents who have credit for the forty-eight session-hours of the group electives required in this university for the cultural baccalaureate degrees in arts and science may substitute for twelve session-hours of electives-at-large the first-year course in the Department of Medicine and receive the degree of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science at the end of the year. The University also offers a course leading to the vocational degree of Bachelor of Science in Medicine. This course includes two years of group electives in academic subjects followed by the first two years of the medical course. Since the academic group-electives satisfy the entrance requirements of the Medical Department, students who can spend only two years in college before entering upon the study of medicine are advised to plan their work so as to secure this degree. For further information regarding these degrees, see the General Catalogue of the University. The William A. Herndon Scholarships are founded upon the bequest of Dr. Cumberland George Herndon, a graduate in medicine of this university. They are awarded by the Medical Faculty after a competitive examination held during the summer vacation preceding enrollment as a student in the Medical Department. Candidates must be unable to defray the expenses of their medical education and must signify their intention of entering the medical service of the army or navy of the United States. These scholarships provide for the necessary expenses of the student during the entire four years of his medical course and are awarded whenever there is a vacancy. The last awards were made in 1919. For information as to the examinations and other requirements, address the Dean of the Department of Medicine. The Alpha Omega Alpha Society.âOn November 15, 1919 a charter was issued for the establishment in this University of a chapter of the honor medical society, Alpha Omega Alpha, to which there are chosen annually one-fifth of each graduating class, on the basis of scholarship, character, and professional promise. The following have been elected to membership from the class of 1922: John Throckmorton Bate, Jr., and Edward Joseph Ottenheimer, B.S. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. In the following description of courses, the number of hours represents the amount of time each student devotes to the course. In addition to the hours scheduled in the third and fourth years of the course, each student devotes a considerable amount of time to practical work which does not appear in the schedule, but the satisfactory performance of which is essential to graduation. Thus the taking of histories, the visits to his cases in the hospital, assisting at operations, attendance upon cases of labor, the employment of microscopical and chemical methods of diagnosis in the hospital, require much time which it has not seemed possible to record in a rigid schedule. It should, however, be stated that each student in the fourth year gives at least six hundred hours to this required but unscheduled practical work. The session, exclusive of the time devoted to examination, is divided into a fall term of twelve weeks, a winter term of ten weeks, and a spring term of ten weeks. FIRST YEAR. Anatomy 1.âTwenty-one hours weekly during the first term and fifteen hours weekly during the second term. This course begins with a systematic study of the bones, on the completion of which a part is assigned to each student for dissection and study. On the completion of this course each student has dissected a lateral half of the body. The student obtains his knowledge at first hand and by his own personal efforts. The work in gross anatomy is completed by Anatomy 3 of the second year. Dr. Bean, Dr. Speidel, Mr. Cardwell and Mr. Brand. Anatomy 2.âSix hours weekly during the third term. This course consists in a laboratory study of the anatomy of the central nervous system carried out in considerable detail. The gross anatomy of the spinal cord and brain is first considered, on the completion of which sections of the more important regions are studied carefully with the aid of the microscope. Fresh brains and series of sections of the cord and brain are thoroughly used. A reconstruction of the central nervous system showing the more important pathways is prepared by each student. Dr. Bean, Dr. Speidel, Mr. Cardwell and Mr. Brand. Histology.âThree lectures or recitations and six hours of laboratory work weekly during the first and second terms. This course aims to acquaint the student with the microscopic structure of tissues and organs. Cytogenesis and histogenesis are briefly considered in the case of many tissues studied. The relation of histology to physiology and pathology is constantly kept in view. The student is also given opportunity to acquaint himself with the principles and practice of histological technique. A record of seventy per cent. in this course is required for admission to Physiology, and of eighty per cent. for admission to Pathology. Dr. Jordan, and Dr. Nicholson. Embryology.âNine hours weekly during the third term. The laboratory DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. work (six hours weekly) with sections and dissections of mammalian embryos, is supplemented by lectures, recitations, and the study of models. The course aims to give the student a knowledge of developmental processes, in the light of which he may the better understand the more abstruse normal conditions of adult anatomy, as well as many anomalies and variations, neoplasms and malformations. Dr. Jordan and Dr. Nicholson. Biochemistry.âLectures and recitations, three hours weekly during the first and second terms, six hours weekly during the third term; laboratory work, six hours weekly during the second term; twelve hours weekly during the third term. The chemical structure and reactions of carbohydrates, lipins, proteins, and other compounds occurring in the body. Blood, milk, and bile. The chemical physiology of digestion, secretion, excretion, internal secretion, intermediary metabolism, and nutrition. The laboratory work includes the study of carbohydrates, fats, fatty acids, soaps, proteins, purine compounds, etc.; blood, milk, and bile; the digestive enzymes and the digestion of foods; and extensive qualitative and quantitative work on urine. A grade of seventy per cent. on this course is required for admission to Physiology. Dr. Hough, Mr. Strang and assistants. SECOND YEAR. Anatomy 3.âFour hours weekly through the first and second terms. This course is the continuation of Anatomy 1, and consists of the systematic study of topographic anatomy, with the aid of cross sections of the human body, special dissections, and wet preparations with a review of the whole body in relation to the needs of the student in general medicine and surgery. At the end of this course a practical examination is given, covering the work of Anatomy 1, 2 and 3. Dr. Bean, Dr. Speidel, Mr. Cardwell and Mr. Brand. Physiology.âLectures, recitations, and demonstrations, six hours weekly during the first and second terms; laboratory work, ten hours weekly during the first term, two hours weekly during the second term. The physiology of muscle and nerve; blood and lymph; the circulation; respiration; secretion; digestion and nutrition, and the central nervous system. The work of the laboratory closely follows the lectures as an integral part of the study of each subject. Open only to students who have obtained grades of seventy per cent. in Histology and Biochemistry. The satisfactory completion of the laboratory work of this course is necessary for admission to Pharmacology. Dr. Hough and Mr. Strang. Bacteriology and Pathology.âTwelve hours weekly throughout the session and four additional hours a week the second term. The work in pathology is open only to students who have obtained a record of passed in Histology. Bacteriology and pathology are taught in a combined course. Emphasis is laid upon the medical and public health aspects of bacteriology. Autopsies and the study of gross and microscopic specimens supply the practical work accompanying the systematic study of pathology. Opportunity is given selected students for advanced work. Dr. Marshall and Dr. Sheppe. Pharmacology.âLectures, recitations and demonstrations five hours weekly and laboratory work six hours weekly, during the third term. The physical and DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. chemical characteristics and the mode of action of representative drugs and other chemic agents are dealt with in both didactic and practical exercises. Special attention is given to analysing and interpreting the results obtained in the laboratory. An average grade of seventy per cent. on the first two terms of Physiology together with the satisfactory completion of the laboratory work of Physiology is required for admission to the course. Dr. Waddell, assisted by Mr. Hiden and Mr. Johnson. Clinical Diagnosis.âSix hours weekly during the second and third terms. In this course the student is made familiar with those laboratory methods which are helpful in the diagnosis of disease. These include, among others, the examination of blood, urine, sputum, gastric contents, feces, spinal fluid, exudates and transudates. Instruction is given in the Clinical Laboratory in the north pavilion of the hospital, which is well equipped with the most modern instruments and apparatus. Dr. Bray, assisted by Mr. Norfleet. Journals.âIn connection with the work in Physiology, Bacteriology and Pathology, the second-year students meet with their instructors for one hour each week from the first of December to the end of the session for reports and discussion of the current literature of the above sciences. Three reports are made at each meeting by the students. Physical Diagnosis.âFour hours weekly during the third term. Instruction is given in the principles and methods of physical examination. Attention is especially given to study of the normal subject. Dr. Flippin. THIRD YEAR. Materia Medica.âLectures and recitations six hours weekly and laboratory work six hours weekly, during the first three-fourths of the fall term. A thorough study is made of the sources, preparation, composition, properties and interactions of medicinal substances to the end that they may be intelligently prescribed. Special attention is paid to their standardization for purity and potency. Prescription writing and incompatibility are dealt with in frequent practical exercises. While the consideration of the more important preparations of the Pharmacopeia and the New and Non-Official Remedies consumes the greater portion of the allotted time, the course is concluded with a critical study of many of the so-called patent medicines. Dr. Waddell, assisted by Mr. Pearre. Toxicology.âLectures and recitations six hours weekly and laboratory work six hours weekly, during the last quarter of the fall term. A systematic review is made of the pharmacological action of such chemic agents as are particularly liable to cause injury to health or loss of life, special attention being given to their quantitative effects. Practical instruction is given in the methods of isolating and identifying. The treatment of poisoning is dealt with in detail. Dr. Waddell. Theory and Practice of Medicine.âThree hours weekly of lectures and recitations throughout the session; six hours weekly in the clinics for one-half the session. A systematic course of lectures, supplemented by work in the outpatient department and hospital. The class is divided into two sections, each of DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. which devotes itself for half the year to the medical service in the out-patient department, and also twice a week receives instruction on selected cases in the wards of the hospital. There is a general medical clinic once a week in the hospital amphitheater. Dr. Davis, Dr. Flippin, Dr. Daniel, Dr. Nelson and Dr. Smith. Dermatology and Syphilology.âOne hour weekly of lectures during second and third terms; one hour of ward rounds and six hours of clinic weekly to the class in sections throughout the year. The importance, etiology, prophylaxis, pathology, clinical history, diagnosis, and treatment of syphilis are discussed. After review of the anatomic and histologic structure and physiology of the skin the diseases commonly met with are discussed. Out patient material is utilized by third-year students. Selected cases, admitted to the hospital, are studied by fourth-year students. Dr. Smith. Surgery and Gynecology.âFour hours weekly of lectures and recitations, and two hours weekly of surgical clinic throughout the session; with six hours weekly, in the out-patient department, two hours weekly in ward rounds in the hospital, and one hour weekly in X-ray diagnosis for one-fourth the session. The study of surgery begins in the third year and continues through the fourth year. In the third year the classroom work consists of lectures and recitations, as arranged in the schedule, in which the principles and practice of surgery, surgical diseases, surgical diagnosis, etc., are thoroughly discussed. The out-patient department course in the third year gives opportunities for diagnosis and treatment of clinical cases under close personal supervision. Experience in dressings, bandaging, anesthesia and minor surgery is afforded. Surgical appliances and technique are demonstrated to the students, divided into small groups. The work in gynecology follows closely the outlines already described for surgery. The general principles of gynecology are taken up in lectures and recitations. In addition, the out-patient department affords practice in palpation, diagnosis and treatment. Dr. Watts, Dr. Goodwin, Dr. Bigger and Dr. Banks. Urology and Proctology.âOf the total time assigned to surgery, one lecture hour weekly for the first and second terms, and six hours weekly in the outpatient department for one-fourth of the session are devoted to urology and proctology. In the classroom a general survey of the surgery of the genito-urinary tract and rectum is made by lectures and recitations. Especial emphasis is placed upon modern methods of diagnosis and treatment. In the out-patient department, one-fourth of the class at a time obtains supervised experience in handling clinical cases and performing minor operations. Ample opportunity is afforded for the observation of cystoscopic, urethroscopic and proctoscopic procedures. Dr. Neff and Dr. Jones. Orthopedics.âTwo hours weekly of lectures and recitations during the second and third terms; with six hours weekly in the out-patient department. Dr. Voshell. Roentgenology.âSix lectures, and practical demonstrations to the class in sections throughout the year. The applications of the X-rays to medicine and the interpretation of plates in diagnosis. Dr. Wiatt. Phthisiotherapy.âSix hours weekly for eight weeks, with each of the four DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. sections of the class. The work is given in three two-hour sessions a week, held at the Blue Ridge Sanatorium, and consists of demonstrations, ward rounds and assignment of cases for history taking and physical examination. At the end of each clinic session the case history, physical signs, X-ray plates and laboratory findings are compared in conference. The section is also invited to be present at the fluoroscopic examinations on Friday mornings at the University Hospital. The procedure followed aims to instruct in the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis by systematically presenting each step separately at first and later combining them all in the full consideration of the case, including the management and treatment of the patient both in institutions and private practise. Dr. Brown. Obstetrics.âFive hours weekly of lectures, recitations and manikin demonstrations during the year, supplemented by work with patients in the wards of the hospital. The class is divided into sections of five for manikin instruction and for examination of patients in the hospital. The manikin course forms an important part of the work, not only for teaching presentation, position and posture, but also the mechanism of normal and abnormal labor and the application of forceps. When the section is taken into the wards of the hospital, the methods of examination, particularly abdominal palpation, are practiced on the living subject. Dr. Macon. In the second and third terms each student is required to take an elective course of approximately five hours weekly. Elective courses vary from year to year, and include both pre-clinical and clinical subjects. FOURTH YEAR. Theory and Practice of Medicine.âThe same plan is followed in the clinical work as that already described for the third year, each of the two sections of the class devoting itself for half the year to the medical service in the wards of the hospital. Full histories are taken of every case, thorough examinations made, and management indicated by the students of each division. These records are considered in the final grading of the student. The subjects treated with the approximate division of time among them are as follows: Nervous Diseases and Insanity.âThree lectures and recitations weekly, supplemented by clinical work during the first term. In this course is given also instruction in electrotherapeutics. Dr. Davis Pediatrics.âThree lectures and recitations weekly, supplemented by clinical work during the second term. This course of lectures is intended to point out in a brief way how disease is modified by childhood and to indicate how the difficulties of diagnosis and treatment due to early age may best be encountered. The principles of infant feeding are emphasized and the student is taught how to prepare the food. There is also a baby welfare clinic once a week in the outpatient department. Dr. Davis and Dr. Rea. Case Teaching, Medical Ethics and Economics, and Insurance Exam- inations.âTwo hours weekly during the third term. Dr. Davis. Internal Medicine.âTwo lectures weekly throughout the session. In this course the endeavor is made to bring to the attention of the senior student the DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. more important problems of Internal Medicine. The relationship of recent investigations in the fields of normal and pathological physiology, biochemistry, immunology, etc., to internal diseases is especially emphasized. No text-book is used; students are referred to the files and current issues of journals and to reference works in the Medical Library as sources of information. Dr. Flippin. Surgery and Gynecology.âTwo hours weekly of surgical clinic throughout the session; five hours weekly of ward classes, supplemented by clinical work in the wards and operating room for one-half the session with each of the two sections of the class. Instruction in surgery is carried on by clinics and bedside demonstrations in the hospital. In the wards the students are assigned cases, whose histories they must take. They must also make complete physical and clinical examinations, urine analyses, blood examinations, etc. In the ward rounds the diagnosis, operaative and other treatment, post-operative care of the cases, complications, prognosis, etc., are discussed in detail. A large variety of cases is available and the close contact of the students with their cases and with the routine of hospital management offers many of the opportunities that an interneship affords. In the operating rooms the students, in small groups, take part in the operations, thus acquiring familiarity with technique, anesthetization, etc. Those of the class who are not assisting witness the operations, whose important features are demonstrated to them. In gynecology, urology and orthopedics the students have the same general work as in surgery, consisting of the examination and the recording of the cases in the public wards, attendance on ward rounds, at which the cases are discussed, and observation and assistance in the operating rooms. Dr. Watts, Dr. Goodwin, Dr. Neff, Dr. Voshell, Dr. Bigger, Dr. Banks and Dr. Jones. In addition to the above course, required of all students, the following elective course is offered in the Department of Surgery: Surgical Pathology.âAn optional course. Two hours weekly during one-half the session. This course is intended to supplement the general courses in pathology and surgery and consists of lectures upon the pathology of surgical lesions, demonstrations of fresh tissues obtained from the operating rooms, and examination of microscopic sections. The student reviews pathological technique, and frozen section work is emphasized. Dr. Goodwin. Clinical Pathological Conferences.âThe pathological material from the operating tables and from the autopsy is correlated with the clinical findings. The conference is participated in by the students and internes in charge of the patients, the physicians in charge and the pathologist. Dr. Marshall and the visiting staff of the hospital. Obstetrics.âThe student attends, under the guidance of an instructor, the labor cases in the hospital, and is required to prepare the history of patients and to follow up the cases through the puerperium. Instruction is also given in the care of the new-born. In addition the student has the opportunity of attending patients in the out-patient department, and each student is expected to attend at least six cases of labor. A clinic for third year students is held one day in the week in the out-patient department for recording and examining pregnant women. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. The patients are instructed in prenatal care, and students are assigned to each case for attendance during labor under the guidance of an instructor. Dr. Macon. Medical Jurisprudence.âOne lecture weekly during one term of the fourth year. The application of medical knowledge and skill to the needs of the law is presented. References to literature are assigned for the fuller development of special topics. Dr. Waddell. Phthisiotherapy.âTwo lectures weekly for four weeks supplemented by demonstration clinics at the Blue Ridge Sanatorium. Dr. Brown. Diseases of the Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat.âTwo lectures weekly during the first two terms, supplemented by regular two- to three-hour clinics twice weekly throughout the session and clinical lectures to sections of the class as suitable cases occur. The class is divided into small sections and each student is taught the methods of examination and the use of the ophthalmoscope, head mirror, and of the laryngeal and post-nasal mirrors. In the clinics each patient is assigned to a student, who must take the history and keep the record of that patient; the case is then demonstrated by the professor in charge, and, if possible, each student makes his own examination under the personal supervision of the attending physician. Clinical cases are abundant, and during the year the student sees and handles practically all the common diseases of the eye, ear and upper respiratory tract. Dr. Hedges and Dr. Compton. Hygiene.âOne hour weekly throughout the session, and thirteen additional hours in the second term. The course begins with a historical sketch of the developments of preventive medicine, including short biographical sketches of the pioneers of hygiene. With this introduction the story of the natural history of contagious and infectious diseases, modes of propagation and methods of prevention engage the attention of the student. With this preparation, the chemical and bacteriological contamination of food, water, air and soil is made an important study. Instruction is also begun in the proper location and construction of habitations, hospitals, schoolhouses, etc., with special reference to the modern methods of heating, ventilating and draining. Notice is taken of the special relations involved in military and naval hygiene. Dr. Lambeth. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. TABLE OF SCHEDULED HOURS IN EACH SUBJECT. (Exclusive of examination periods.)

The Department of Medicine not only fosters in its methods of instruction the inductive study by the student himself of the phenomena presented by the human body in health and disease, but also encourages the spirit of investigation of unsolved problems of medical science and practice on the part of the instructors and students. During the past few years there have appeared annually a number of papers from its laboratories embodying the results of such investigations, and it is the policy of the department to enlarge this feature of its work in the future. Students are encouraged to engage in research as they are prepared for it, usually assisting an instructor in some special study or else conducting the research under his guidance and advice. For this purpose the scientific and clinical laboratories offer the necessary facilities, and heads of departments will always be glad to suggest and outline problems for investigation by any medical student or by others possessing the necessary training therefor. Library.âThe medical Library contains upwards of 7,000 volumes. It is housed in the basement of the Rotunda, and is in charge of a special Librarian.

The hospital is the property of the University and is under the exclusive control of its Medical Faculty. It was designed and is administered as a teaching hospital, being so arranged that free use can be made of its clinical material without in any way disturbing or violating the privacy of other patients. The buildings are arranged upon the pavilion system, consisting of a central structure, four stories in height, to which have been added up to the present time three additional units of three stories each. The central building is largely devoted to administrative purposes and general service departments, but also contains an amphitheater and suite of private operating rooms, sterilizing and anesthetizing rooms. The three pavilions are connected with the main building by corridors on each floor. In these are located the wards and suites of rooms for private patients. As at present constituted, the hospital has a capacity of about 200 beds; of these, upwards of 160 are available and used for clinical teaching. The north pavilion contains, in addition to quarters for ward and private patients, on the first floor, a specially designated series of laboratory rooms, which have been equipped with new and modern furnishings and apparatus throughout. The basement floor is devoted in large part to the Out-Patient Department of the Hospital. Here separate waiting rooms for white and colored patients are provided, examining rooms for medical cases, operating rooms for minor surgery, specially equipped rooms for genito-urinary and orthopedic surgery and for the treatment of diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat. On the same floor is the Roentgen Ray Department of the hospital. Attention is particularly called to the fact that the hospital, with its associated Out-Patient Department, constitutes a most valuable adjunct to the teaching facilities of the Department of Medicine. The size of the clinic permits the presentation of a wide variety of cases, and the organization of the hospital as an integral part of the Medical Department affords exceptional facilities for thorough study of the individual case. The location of the University Hospital is a most favorable one, being situated at the intersection of two great railway trunk lines near the geographical center of the State. A large population outside of the city of Charlottesville is available as a source of clinical material, both in the wards and the Out-Patient Department. The hospital is thus enabled to serve a large area of the State, and the transportation facilities are such that this service includes a progressively increasing number of emergency cases and cases of acute illness.

Commodious and well-equipped quarters for the treatment of ambulant cases are provided in the north pavilion of the hospital, and the service is conducted under the direct personal supervision of members of the teaching staff of the Medical Department. Clinics are held three times a week for general medical, surgical and genito-urinary diseases, which are attended by students of the third year; and twice weekly for the diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat, attended by students of the fourth year. The character of the equipment of this department and its location in the hospital make possible the use of most advanced methods in the diagnosis and treatment of cases, and the systematic and thorough examination of each case is thus emphasized at the very outset of the student's clinical experience. An out-patient obstetrical service, and provision for attendance in the home of certain cases of illness by the student, under the supervision of an instructor, are a part of the organization of this department. THE BLUE RIDGE SANATORIUM. The Blue Ridge Sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis, which is owned and controlled by the Virginia State Board of Health, lies within easy reach of the Medical School. Under a plan of coÃ¶peration agreed upon by the State Board of Health and the University, the Medical Director of the Sanatorium teaches phthisiotherapy in the Medical School, and the 120 beds of the Sanatorium afford excellent clinical material for first hand, practical experience for internes, medical students and nurses of the University Medical School. Work at the Sanatorium is part of the required course of the Medical School. This affiliation of the Sanatorium and the Medical School offers an opportunity almost ideal for the medical student to become thoroughly familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of this most important disease. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HOSPITAL TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES. A training school for nurses is conducted in connection with the hospital. Full information regarding requirements for admission, and the course of instruction may be obtained by addressing the Superintendent of Nurses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SUMMER QUARTER. THE SUMMER QUARTER. Edwin Anderson Alderman, Ph.B., D.C.L., LL.D. President. Charles Gilmore Maphis Dean. The faculty of the Summer Quarter in 1921 numbered one hundred and seven members, a complete list of whom may be found in the Summer Quarter Catalogue. SUMMARY OF ATTENDANCE. 1921. From Virginia 2161 From other states and countries 552 Total 2713 Less Duplicates 284 Net Enrollment 2429 ANNOUNCEMENTS. The Summer Quarter of the University is an integral part of the University Year, the Courses in the College of Arts and Sciences being the same in character, method and in credit value as in the other quarters. In the Department of Education many professional courses for elementary and high school teachers which are not offered in the regular session are given to meet certificate requirements. The Summer Quarter is divided into two terms for the accommodation of those who can give only six weeks to the work but who desire University credit. The First Term will begin June 19th, and will close July 29th, with lectures five times a week. The Second Term will begin July 31st, and will close September 2nd, with six lectures a week. Students may enter for either term or both. A separate registration card must be filled out for each Term. The normal amount of work for college credit which a student may take, is three courses; but in a few exceptional cases, by special permission of the Dean and the approval of the instructors in all the courses taken, permission may be obtained to take four courses. In all cases an additional fee of $5.00 will be charged for each extra advanced course, and $3.00 for each extra elementary course. FEES. For Non-Virginia Students.âA single registration fee of $15 for each term will be charged each non-Virginia student. This fee will entitle the student SUMMER QUARTER. to enter any of the courses outlined in the catalogue, except a few special courses which are so designated. No student, however, will be allowed to take more than three advanced courses or four elementary courses without special permission of the Dean. For Virginia Students.âStudents from Virginia who are not teachers or preparing to teach next session will be charged the same tuition as non-Virginia students. Tuition is entirely free to all Virginia teachers in all the regular courses, both elementary and advanced, leading to the professional certificates. To meet local expenses, the State Board of Education has fixed a registration fee of $1.50 for a six weeks' term for all the summer schools of the State, and this fee will be charged here. There are a few special courses offered to meet certain demands, but not necessary for certificate credit, for which fees will be charged. The fee for each is designated in the catalogue. Small extra fees are charged in laboratory courses. EXPENSES. Board and Rooms.âBoard and rooms may be had at prices ranging from $7.50 per week, where several stay in the same room, upward, according to accommodation and proximity to the University, the average being $7.50 to $9.00 a week. Most of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the university grounds. The University Commons conducts a first-class cafeteria at which meals may be obtained at very low rates. The average cost per month for three meals a day last year was $22.40. Two hundred and twenty-five double rooms in the university dormitories will be reserved in the order of application upon the following terms: For a term, $5.00 for each person, two persons assigned to each room. No reduction will be made for parts of a term. Applications for rooms must be accompanied by the full amount of the fee in order to have them reserved. The amount of the fee will be returned for good reason, and room released if application is made before June 10. No rooms will be rented to any person who does not register and pay the fee in the Summer Quarter. SUMMARY OF COURSES OFFERED. The following courses were offered in the Summer Quarter of 1921 and will, with slight changes, be repeated in the session of 1922. Agriculture (5 Courses), Art (4 Courses), Astronomy (3 Courses), Biblical Literature (1 Course), Biology (6 Courses), Chemistry (6 Courses), Commercial Subjects (5 Courses), Commercial Law (5 Courses), Drawing (6 Courses), Economics (8 Courses), Education (33 Courses), English (16 Courses), French (6 Courses), General Science (1 Course), Geography (3 Courses), German (4 Courses), Government (6 Courses), History (7 Courses), Household Arts (11 Courses), Latin (6 Courses), Library Economy (2 Courses), Manual and Industrial Arts (7 Courses), Mathematics (15 Courses), Music (24 Courses), Philosophy (6 Courses), Physical Education (10 SUMMER QUARTER. Courses), Physics (6 Courses), Psychology (3 Courses), Sociology (4 Courses), Spanish (6 Courses), Writing (4 Courses). CREDITS AND DEGREES. Degrees are conferred upon men and women for work done in the Summer Quarter when the degree requirements are fully met. Sixty-three session-hours of undergraduate courses, taken in conformity with the requirements published on pages 147-149 are required for the Bachelor's degree. Those who contemplate completing their degree requirements in the Summer Quarter should keep clearly in mind, in estimating the time that will be required, that the normal amount of credit which may be taken in one Summer Quarter is six session-hours. Candidates who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. This certificate must be acceptable both to the Dean and to the professor in charge of the course accredited. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college and must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate and must give his grade. In every case the candidate must spend at least three full Summer Quarters at the University in order to meet the residence requirement. The Master's degree may be obtained in three Summer Quarters. In no case is this degree to be conferred upon any person who has not attended and done graduate work three full Summer Quarters or the equivalent time in the regular session of the University. The demand for graduate work in the Summer Session of 1921 was so great that in future sessions the number of graduate courses will be largely increased. All persons who are looking forward ultimately to taking a degree through summer work are urgently requested to file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter an official statement of entrance credits and work for which college credit is desired. Blanks for this purpose will be mailed upon application to the Dean of the Summer Quarter. PRE-MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS. Courses covering all the required subjects for entrance to the first year of the Medical School, as described on page 224 of this catalogue, are offered in the Summer Quarter so that it is possible for the student to meet the pre-medical requirements in two summer quarters and one regular session of the University.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">STUDENT ACTIVITIES. STUDENT ACTIVITIES. THE VIRGINIA UNION. The Virginia Union was organized for the general purpose of directing and coÃ¶rdinating various phases of student activity. It has set for itself the three-fold function of initiating, promoting, and supervising movements that merit student attention and deserve student patronage. Its activities include intercollegiate debating, oratorical contests, and, through the coÃ¶peration of the faculty Committee on Public Celebrations, the control of miscellaneous lectures, concerts, and other entertainments. The union gives at least one public program each term and holds informal entertainments at frequent intervals. Membership is extended to students, faculty and alumni of the University, on payment of an annual fee of two dollars. All business is conducted through an executive board composed of both student and faculty members, elected annually. LITERARY SOCIETIES. Connected with the University are two literary societies of long standingâthe Jefferson Society and the Washington Society. At weekly meetings in their respective halls they hold debates and practice extemporaneous and other forms of public speaking. Each society annually offers gold medals for excellence in debating and oratory, and each organization contests for intersociety prizes. WOMAN'S SELF-GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION. The Association includes all women students of the University of Virginia, and exists to bring about a greater unity and mutual helpfulness among the women of the University, and to promote and maintain the highest standards of University life. PUBLICATIONS. The University of Virginia Magazine, designed to encourage literary work among the students, is published by the students with the advisory assistance of the Linden Kent Memorial School of English Literature, and appears at monthly intervals, eight times during the session. As a stimulus to literary activity, the Magazine offers every year three medals: One for the best poem, one for the best short story, and one for the best essay, of student authorship, appearing in one of the numbers of the publication. The awards are made by alumni committees, one committee for each of the three medals. College Topics is a semi-weekly newspaper, published under the auspices STUDENT ACTIVITIES. of the General Athletic Association, and devoted to the interests of athletics and the University at large. Corks and Curls is the University annual, its aim being to present some record of the scholastic, religious, athletic and social activities of the college year. Its publication is in the hands of a chartered corporation formed by the fraternities and literary societies of the University. The Virginia Law Review is a journal devoted to the discussion of general questions of American jurisprudence, published monthly from October to May, inclusive, by the students of the Law Department. The Virginia Reel is an illustrated magazine of humor, published by the students ten times a year. The University of Virginia Journal of Engineering is published by the students of the Department of Engineering ten times a year.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RELIGIOUS WORK. RELIGIOUS WORK. YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION, INCORPORATED. Duncan Bassett Murphy, General Secretary. Mrs. Albert Edward Walker, Hostess. Object.âThe Young Men's Christian Association of the University of Virginia has the distinction of being the oldest organization of its kind in existence. It was founded October 12, 1858, and has today a larger proportionate membership than that in any other state university in America. The purpose of the Association is to promote growth in Christian Fellowship among its members and to challenge them to devote themselves in united effort to make the will of God effective in human society. Work.âThe Association affords opportunity for voluntary study of the Bible and also of problems of national and international interest, particularly with reference to the possibility of solution by the fundamental principles of Christianity. Through denominational clubs the organization seeks to relate the students to the churches of their particular affiliation; and through voluntary service of its members materially assistsâand in some cases wholly mansâthe Sunday Schools and young people's societies of churches in the community. In addition to this definite religious service in the community members of the Association work with Boy Scout troops and coÃ¶perate with community agencies in other forms of welfare work. Both religious and welfare activities are carried into the outlying districts under the supervision of the Extension Department of the Association; and free medical clinics which were originally established in these localities by the Association have increased in usefulness and importance through active coÃ¶peration with the State and University medical staffs. Under the Deputation Committee, student leaders and groups of students visit various preparatory and high schools in the State to conduct religious meetings, and they also carry on evangelistic campaigns in various communities throughout the State. In addition to these activities outside the University the Association, through its Student Self-Help Committee, renders valuable aid to students seeking employment; and through receptions, entertainments, and "Open Houses" stimulates social intercourse among the students. Equipment.âThrough the munificence of Mrs. William E. Dodge and family, of New York City, the Association possesses a very handsome building, which was erected in 1905 at a cost, including furnishings, of about $80,000, and which is maintained in part by an endowment of over $16,000, subscribed by students, alumni, and friends of the University. This building, called "Madison Hall" in honor of President Madison, who was intimately connected with the early history of the University, faces the north front of the Rotunda. In recent RELIGIOUS WORK. years Madison Hall has become the center of the social and student activities of the University as well as of the religious; and offices in the building have been furnished gratis to the more prominent student publications and organizations. THE UNIVERSITY CHAPEL. The handsome Gothic chapel was erected upon the university grounds by the voluntary gifts of students, alumni, members of the faculty and other friends. For many years regular Sunday services were conducted in it until easy access to the city churches rendered that needless. It is now used for occasional services addressed by religious leaders of national repute, thus supplementing the religious meetings of the churches and the Y. M. C. A.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PHYSICAL TRAINING. PHYSICAL TRAINING. William Alexander Lambeth, M.D., Ph.D. Director of Physical Training William Rice Warren, B.A., M.D. Professor of Physical Training Henry Haden Lannigan Associate Director of Athletics Frank Wesley Davies, B.S., M.A. Instructor in Physical Training Benton Brooks Owen Instructor in Physical Training Frederick Virginius Watkins Instructor in Physical Training The method of instruction pursued does not follow blindly any so-called system, but proper attention is given to all methods which in whole or in part have proved useful or effective. The importance of individual training is in every case recognized, especially where an examination discloses the student's inability to pursue with safety or profit general or concerted exercises. Students are entitled, without cost, to a thorough physical examination by the director, and are urged to avail themselves of this privilege soon after they enter the University. The examination includes an accurate measurement of the student's physical proportions, a careful examination of the condition and action of the heart and lungs, and the strength of the principal muscular groups. Upon the basis of the facts thus ascertained, advice is given as to particular exercises and the use of various developing appliances. The examination is repeated at intervals, note is taken of any improvement, and new exercises are suggested. In addition to individual work, daily instruction is given to classes in light gymnasticsâmarching, figure-running, calisthenics, dumb-bells, and clubsâadapted as nearly as possible to the needs of individuals of varying age and physical condition. The exercises are gradual and progressive, commencing with the simplest movements and proceeding to others more complicated and difficult. During the winter months instruction in gymnastics which require great strength and agility is given to those who are fitted for it by previous training. This work is terminated by an annual gymnastic tournament held usually in the early part of March. The faculty regulations on athletics require that members of the university athletic teams shall give evidence of satisfactory physical condition by passing in doubtful cases a strength test, in addition to the regular physical examination. For members of the football teams, 1,300 points are required; for members of the baseball team, 1,100 points. The Fayerweather Gymnasium, the gift of Daniel Fayerweather, of New York, is situated on the eastern slope of Carr's Hill. The first floor contains a spacious exercise hall, equipped with the best developing appliances, as well as with apparatus for light and heavy gymnastics, a one-twentieth mile concaveinclined running track, a visitors' gallery, lavatory, trophy room, and various offices. PHYSICAL TRAINING. The basement floor is concrete throughout and contains hot and cold baths (needle, shower, spray, tub, and plunge), bowling alleys, ball cage, boiler room, lockers, locker room, and dressing rooms. The building is heated by hot water, ventilated by airshafts, registers and skylights, and lighted by gas and electricity. The gymnasium is open from 8 a. m. to 7 p. m. every day except Sunday. Attendance is voluntary and is free of cost to every student. Classes are held at hours which do not conflict with other university duties. For the course in Physical Training with credit value for the B.A. and B.S. degrees, see page 135. ATHLETICS. The Athletic Park contains twenty-one acres, and includes two athletic fields, Lambeth Field and Lefevre Field, as well as a driving park, set with trees and hedges and containing the site for the proposed Athletic Club-house. Two hundred thousand surface feet have been perfectly graded, drained and fenced, for football, baseball, and track work. This surface was completed at a cost of about fifty thousand dollars, and involved the removal of forty-eight thousand cubic yards of earth. A concrete stadium has been erected, seating eight thousand persons. Games and sports of all kinds are under the special direction of the General Athletic Association, a student organization whose object is to encourage this phase of physical exercise. The faculty, by means of its Committee on Athletics, exercises a general advisory control, endeavoring to foresee and avert dangerous tendencies or excess in physical exercise, while giving to the students, as far as possible, entire liberty of management. A strict supervision is maintained over the character of intercollegiate games, and the number of these which may be played away from the University is definitely limited. REGULATIONS OF THE GENERAL FACULTY CONCERNING ATHLETICS.* * Certain changes are being made in these regulations during the session of 1921-22. 1. The Faculty Committee on Athletics is intrusted with the general oversight of athletics, and is authorized to forbid any features in these exercises which endanger the health or morals of the participants, and to foster the true spirit of amateur sport among them. 2.

Only students who act as regular or substitute members of the athletic teams will be granted leaves of absence to accompany them on trips away from the University. 4. Special reports may be made to the President from time to time by any PHYSICAL TRAINING. departmental faculty with respect to the class-standing and progress in study of each regular and substitute player on the athletic teams, and if the President and such faculty are convinced that his class-standing is discreditable, such student may be required to sever his connection with such team. 5. The athletic teams shall not have contests elsewhere than upon the university grounds with any teams except those from other institutions of learning. 6. To be eligible for an intercollegiate athletic contest an applicant must be a bona fide student who is pursuing a course of at least ten hours of undergraduate work or a course of study certified by the proper faculty authority. 7. Before any student can take part in any intercollegiate contest, he shall make application in a prescribed form in writing to the Faculty Committee on Athletics, and secure the endorsed approval of his application from the committee. It shall be the duty of the Faculty Athletic Committee to have the executive officers of the University endorse such application to the effect that the applicant is a registered student of the University. 8. It shall be the duty of the Faculty Committee on Athletics to inquire into and make a record of the athletic experiences of the applicant, who shall appear before the committee and answer on his honor such questions as the committee may see fit to ask. 9. It shall be the duty of the Faculty Committee on Athletics, before it endorses an application, to require of the applicant a written pledge, certifying on his honor that he has never accepted directly or indirectly remuneration, compensatory gift, valuable consideration or the promise thereof, for or on account of his athletic services, and that he is in the proper and strict sense of the word an amateur athlete. 10. No student shall participate in any intercollegiate football, baseball, basketball or track contest during his first college year, and in no case shall a student be eligible for these teams unless he shall have been a resident student for at least six months. If a student has participated in any intercollegiate contest at another college, he shall not be eligible in the same branch of sport at this institution his first succeeding session. 11. No person who has participated in intercollegiate football, baseball, basketball or track contests for four sessions, consecutive or not, is eligible; provided, that his total time of participation in these sports shall not include more than five college years. 12. No student who is receiving from the University remuneration for teaching or administrative services shall be eligible for the university teams. 13. It shall be the duty of the President of the Athletic Association, the Executive Committee of that Association, the Manager and the Captain of the team concerned, the Director of the Gymnasium, the Associate Director of Athletics, and the Treasurer of the Association, to furnish on request a statement to the effect that each member of an athletic team is above their suspicion as to his eligibility PHYSICAL TRAINING. to represent the University as a proper amateur player, before such player shall be allowed to take part in any contest. 14. No coach or trainer who is not an officer of the University shall be employed for the purpose of instructing or training any athletic team in this university. This shall not be interpreted as excluding alumni who act as assisting coaches. 15. The Faculty Committee on Athletics is directed to assume responsible charge of the details of the athletic situation and to permit the playing of intercollegiate games with such colleges only as express a general conformity with the code of rules adopted by this faculty. 16. The members of any athletic team may be allowed not more than eight days' leave of absence from the University for the purpose of engaging in athletic contests; but no student who is a member of more than one athletic team shall be allowed more than sixteen days' leave of absence during the entire session for such purpose. 17. Not more than four days' leave of absence from the University shall be given to those First-Year Athletic teams which are regularly organized by the General Athletic Association. 18. The football team is permitted to play games only on the home grounds of one of the contestants. 19. "Training Tables" for football, baseball, basketball and track teams are hereby abolished. 20.

To the list of professional teams thus proscribed shall be added all league teams in any State or States which the leading university of such State or States declares professional and from which it debars its own players. 21. The term "college" as used in the Faculty Regulations concerning athletics is hereby interpreted to mean the U. S. Military Academy, Naval Academy, or any institution which confers a baccalaureate degree and which has not less than 150 male students of at least collegiate grade recorded in the catalogue of the institution in question as students of the session preceding the applicant's entrance into this university. In case such catalogue fails to distinguish between students of collegiate and preparatory grade, the president of the college concerned shall be requested to render or to authorize an official statement as to the number of college students. 22. The term "substitute" is interpreted to mean a student who has taken part in an intercollegiate contest. 23. The term "general conformity," as used in the Faculty Regulations, is interpreted by the faculty to mean conformity in regard to period of residence, maximum period of eligibility and amateur standing.</field>
