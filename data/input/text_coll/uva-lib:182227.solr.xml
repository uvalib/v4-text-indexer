      <field name="fulltext">REPORT ON HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS WHY ARE so many of "our Virginia manuscripts" in North Carolina and California? Why is Princeton University publishing the Jefferson papers? These two questions are partly concerned with history, and the answers are in part a concern of this library. They recur with a certain monotony, and for this reason I have prefaced this guide to our new accessions not only with the usual report on our projects and development, but also with several comments on, if not complete answers to, these two questions and some library policies which relate to them. Transmigration of Virginia Manuscripts Recent widespread controversy over the "transmigration of Virginia manuscripts" to other states has involved criticism in some quarters of the collecting policies of out-of-state institutions. It is indeed true that among the half dozen regional collections in the South of more than local significance, there are some which appear in the past to have concentrated on the collecting of Virginiana to the apparent relative neglect of their own states. To Virginians, however, such interest should not appear altogether unreasonable. At the University of Virginia Library, oldest and largest manuscripts repository in the Southern states, we have found the out-of-state competition for Virginia material both stimulating and helpful in several ways to our own collecting. For the reassurance of those who have been worried unduly by the belated agitation, it is certainly safe to say that for at least a decade the annual accessions of Virginia manuscripts to this Virginia library alone have greatly exceeded in quantity the total acquisitions of such Virginia material by all out-of-state agencies combined. Even so, not enough collecting has been done by public institutions either inside or outside of Virginia, and too often also truly monumental manuscripts, the inheritance of all our people, emerge for a moment from obscurity, only to pass from the auction block again into what is sometimes complete inaccessibility in private hands. The competition, however, which we do fear is that of destructive elements, not the constructive competition of institutions, or even necessarily of individuals, which happen to be located beyond the boundaries of this Commonwealth. Research libraries, such as the University's, are the logical depository of all manner of manuscripts, as well as of printed works. Here, protected from fire, rats, and decay; from wind, rain, dust, and heat; from industrious housemaids and careless stamp collectors, the neglected family letters that tell the story of times past are safely kept and made available for research. Our General Policies Receptivity and cooperation, therefore, have continued to be our watchwords. With such institutions, for example, as Duke University or the Library of Congress, (which happen to be our two most formidable rivals for Virginia manuscripts) cooperation is an easy and mutually profitable matter. Their manuscripts are not only well housed and catalogued, but are generously made available by photo-duplication to us and to individual students. A similar cordial relationship obtains with scores of other institutions. A happy example this year has been our exchange with the Regional Collection of History at Cornell University of a group of New York manuscripts and broadsides for a collection of Virginia Revolutionary documents. Private owners who wish to retain ownership and control of their papers are encouraged to place them here for safekeeping and historical reference free of obligation. Such private depositors are nearly always content to retain publication rights to deposited material; and rare indeed is the depositor who withdraws his deposit, or who refuses either access to manuscripts or publication privileges to properly qualified researchers recommended by us. Passive receptivity is not enough, however, and our potential donors and depositors need to be kept informed of our interest by a vigorous and continuous program of correspondence and travel. The current results of this policy of cooperation and receptivity will, it is hoped, be apparent in the report which follows this brief introduction. Manuscripts—Two Years of Rapid Growth The introduction to our last report (for the years 1945-1947) was said by some to be too brief. It was indeed shorter than the introductions to previous reports, but perhaps we may be pardoned for departing from our usual modesty to point out that the textual description of new acquisitions was of necessity much longer than in past years. That report listed 426 newly acquired collections comprising more than half a million manuscripts. The present report describes as adequately as available space permits the million and a quarter manuscripts contained in the 541 new collections acquired between July 1947 and June 1949. To the 447 generous friends (listed in an appendix to this report) who have given manuscripts, or funds for their acquisition, we can only say, as we did to the 320 donors listed in our last report, that their talent is not being buried. Every collection received during these two years (all gifts and every deposit except two or three temporarily restricted by the depositor) has been processed and made available to investigators within a few weeks of its reception. The handling of such a flood of materials has taxed our small staff, and detailed immediate indexing is impossible for most collections, though all are catalogued upon reception, with as many index tracings furnished as time permits. Careful arrangement makes up in part for cataloguing shortcomings. Each new donation or deposit is sacredly preserved as a separate collection, and the collections are being used by an ever increasing number of local and visiting researchers. In the World Almanac, in which this Library appeared for the first time in 1947 (in the distinguished company of Texas and Duke) as one of the three Southern libraries among the two dozen principal libraries in America, our manuscript collection is described as particularly strong in the papers of Virginia's public men. Papers of recent public men (Carter Glass, for example, and Claude Swanson, Miles Poindexter, and Edward R. Stettinius) have been actively sought by the University. Since these recent collections are often voluminous, the suspicion might well arise that emphasis has been put on twentieth century quantity to the neglect of the rarer materials of earlier periods. An analysis of the pages that follow should provide a sufficient answer to this question. Of the 541 new collections reported, 12 fall in the years before 1699, 114 between 1700 and 1799, 339 between 1800 and 1899, 193 between 1900 and 1949. Many of the larger collections (about a third of the total), it will be noted, fall in two or more of these periods. A word as to geographical spread and subject matter. Like Mr. T. S. Eliot's patriotism, our interests and, we feel, our responsibility extend outwards in concentric circles. Hence the continuing emphasis in this year's collecting on the University, on Charlottesville and Albemarle County, and on Virginia. Beyond Virginia (and indeed within the State) we are inclined to steer regional materials to the most appropriate depository, but we also welcome for preservation here manuscripts and other source materials of broad general interest—political, institutional, social, literary, religious, economic, educational and bibliographical—with emphasis on American history, especially of the southeastern states. Among such European materials as have been obtained, chief interest has been in British manuscripts related to our colonial beginnings and to our own later history, or in literary manuscripts of general interest to the inheritors of Anglo-American culture. Other Materials and Special Collections Printed books, pamphlets, and serials are ignored in this report, regardless of whether or not they are housed in the Division of Rare Books and Manuscripts and even though they absorb most of our funds available for purchases. The significant items among them are recorded in the union catalogues and bibliographies. Our holdings of public documents of Jefferson's administration, particularly valuable for researchers in the manuscripts of that period, have been increased this year through extensive purchases by the McGregor Library and by a generous gift from Dr. A. S. W. Rosenbach. The annual reports of the Curator of the McGregor Library (the most important of the special libraries constituting the Division of Rare Books and Manuscripts) are not printed, a fact which I personally regret, though they are sometimes mimeographed. Readers who find this introduction too brief are urged to turn from the paragraphs below this one to the following headings for general and specific comment (similar to that in the last report) on special materials of great importance to our collections: Broadsides, page 117; Jefferson Papers, page 158; Maps, page 178, Microfilm, page 182; Newspapers, page 190; Prints and Pictures, page 205; and University of Virginia Archives, page 222. Newspapers and Microfilm Our newspaper collection has been increased during the two-year period of this report by the rather astonishing number of 2,235 issues of newspapers so rare that they have never before existed in a library. All of these but one happen to be Virginia newspapers, and some are privately owned deposits; all of them are listed on pages 192-197 as a supplement to the standard bibliographies by Clarence S. Brigham and Lester J. Cappon. A few (not so many, however, as in our last report) are listed as previously unknown titles. On the same pages and on the final page of this report will be found statements of what we have done during these two years to see to it that the titles and substance of the newspapers being published in Virginia today shall not in future vanish utterly from the memory of man. A survey just initiated by the Richmond Area University Center will, it is hoped, lead to better coordination of this state-wide cooperative project of Virginia libraries and newspaper publishers. Microfilming of manuscripts has not been particularly extensive in recent months, a total of approximately 120,000 pages of manuscript having been filmed during the year for our collections as detailed later in this report under the Microfilm entry. Filming of newspapers (including current subscriptions) and other printed materials, for which microfilm is in general more satisfactory than for manuscripts, has proceeded at a greater rate. The use of microfilm has been considerably facilitated this year by the acquisition of an additional projector and of cabinets for the storage of the several thousand reels of film in our collections. We have not found microfilm to be the cheap expedient which it is sometimes reported to be. The film and the necessary equipment are costly, and use and cataloguing of the film are time-consuming. It does save storage space, and it brings to our researchers source materials from remote libraries as well as from private owners, in whose hands in many instances unique materials are not only inaccessible for study, but also subject to many hazards. Our own photographic laboratory has turned out the largest volume of work in its history. The microfilming last year of the major portion of our Miles Poindexter Papers for the University of Washington and the State College of Washington was a project of some magnitude, costing those two institutions $5,000. Use of microfilm in our reading rooms has been so great this year that we have been obliged occasionally to establish waiting lists of researchers desiring to use the projectors. Jefferson's Papers Thomas Jefferson was not discovered in 1943. That was merely his bicentennial year. The many persons from whom we have had somewhat anxious inquiries may be assured that in this biennium the University has continued to be the principal institutional collector of Jefferson's papers, acquiring in this period 127 original manuscripts of our Founder. Our collection of 2,500 autograph manuscripts is small compared with the great one in the Library of Congress, but it has many unique features of peculiar interest. Mrs. Thurlow and I will have ready for publication early in 1950 an indexed calendar of every manuscript in the collection. We may as well confess that our most valuable "find" of Jefferson papers during the past year was the discovery of fifty-eight letters from Jefferson to Arthur S. Brockenbrough, first Proctor of the University, tied in a neat bundle and lying where they had lain for 125 years in the office in which Brockenbrough received them, less than 300 yards from my desk. Rarely has a 300-mile journey yielded comparable treasure! Mr. Jefferson, who selected and purchased our original library, died before he could see personally to the moving of the books from Pavilion VII to the central building he had erected for them. He lived long enough, though, to beg for us in 1825 our first manuscript collection. During the past year he has assisted us in our collecting work. He was aided in this by various alumni chapters. Following a timely suggestion by Mr. Harrison Mann of Washington, D. C., Jefferson's witty letter of 9 September 1817, to Joseph Cabell, was issued in facsimile in a handsome leaflet entitled Mr. Jefferson on Lawyers' Language. The leaflet, containing also brief notes on our collecting interests and an appeal on our behalf by President Darden, was printed and distributed in several thousand copies by the alumni chapters in Washington, D. C.; Louisville, Kentucky; Charleston, West Virginia; New York City; and by a Richmond alumnus. These helpful friends of the library have the satisfaction of knowing that their work has assisted materially in strengthening our collections. The Jefferson publications sponsored or assisted by the University in recent years are too well known to need mention here. Two more will be published in coming months by the McGregor Library (which has issued since the appearance of our last report Hugh T. Lefler's A Plea for Federal Union: North Carolina, 1788). Letters to a Bookseller, edited by Professor Elizabeth Cometti of Marshall College, will concern Jefferson's work in establishing the University Library (to a man of affairs, not a bookseller, Jefferson wrote that the building of the library was much more important than the remission of the University's debt). Professor Luther P. Jackson, of Virginia State College, is editing the memoirs of Isaac Jefferson, a household servant at Monticello, as dictated in old age a century ago to the historian Charles Campbell. Princeton's Jefferson and Ours But if Jefferson himself was not discovered in Charlottesville in 1943, our long-time project for dealing with the editorial challenge he presents was discovered in that year by new and powerful friends elsewhere, who have assumed responsibility for its execution on a scale which promises to exceed our brightest hopes. I refer of course to the Princeton Jefferson publication mentioned later in this report. And it is a presumption on my part to use the plural form of the possessive pronoun in reference to the ten years of editorial preparation at the University of Virginia which preceded the inception of the Princeton project in 1943. For it was a one-man task, to which the rest of us made largely mechanical contributions, though it had the full support of the University's Librarian, who always gave it as much assistance as the Library's circumstances permitted. I shall incur the certain indignation of my colleague, John Cook Wyllie, in mentioning as his the far-seeing plan and laborious task which was brought so nearly to completion before his departure from our staff to join the British Army in northeast Africa in 1941. For Mr. Wyllie's feeling for anonymity goes somewhat beyond the anonymity of the normal librarian as an assistant to research. I shall incur no censure, however, from Julian P. Boyd. To us he has given ample evidence of his gratitude for assistance to his work— suggesting that his daring and enterprise do not preclude the humility of the great scholar. He is not to blame if others, carried away by natural enthusiasm for the magnitude of his project and the character of its planning, have incorrectly ascribed to him credit for being the first to see the need for surveying and re-editing Jefferson's writings, or the first to take effective action towards that end. Mr. Wyllie's self-imposed task was a survey of all existing Jefferson texts in print or in manuscript in their hundreds of well known and obscure locations. This union catalogue (or "Checklist") now contains 77,000 chronologically arranged cards listing some 50,000 manuscripts. Viewing it as a sine qua non in the further search for Jefferson papers, and a basic tool for the hoped-for bicentennial Congressional edition of Jefferson's writings, the Library of Congress proposed in 1941 to publish and distribute our Checklist under a joint imprint. The intervention of Pearl Harbor made it my unpleasant duty to veto this generous proposal. (Our entire staff, including finally my stenographer and me, promptly entered the armed forces, making it impracticable to prepare the enormous list for the printer.) I hope I may be excused, therefore, for making this allusion to Mr. Wyllie's personal project. For the Checklist did not "just happen." It had a purpose, and there was no accident in the fact that the Historian of the Bicenntial Commission found ready here for the extensive use that he made of it then and later a nearly-completed survey which revealed astounding statistics about the unpublished condition of Jefferson's writings and has served ever since as a basic tool in Jefferson scholarship. In emphasizing the usefulness of Mr. Wyllie's project, I detract not a whit from the brilliant work now going forward at Princeton. For there we are having revealed to us the wonderful potentialities in the teamwork of an able group of scholars working in close cooperation with a university press of the first order of talent, equipment, and courage. Many of us at the University of Virginia regret that we do not have a university press, such as Princeton's, but no one at this University, as far as I know, regrets what has developed since 1943 to make possible the full publication of Jefferson's papers, towards which so much effort was expended here in the preceding years. Let Virginians and alumni remember that a university publishing house, capable of committing itself to a million-dollar venture over a period of years, is not always to be had for the asking. The recent Development Fund campaign demonstrated that. When our Librarian offered to Princeton in 1943 our full cooperation, he spoke for all our staff. We have initiated Madison and Monroe checklists, which grow very slowly at present. If we are successful in carrying them to a point beyond which a library staff cannot go, we shall be very happy indeed if another university and another university press should step forward to complete the work. And if our friends do not hear a great deal more about Princeton's Jefferson in forthcoming years, we of this Library shall be much disappointed. Founder's Day at the University in 1948 turned out to be the most satisfying Jeffersonian occasion of recent years. Following Julian Boyd's notable address (published later as "Thomas Jefferson's Empire of Liberty," Virginia Quarterly Review, vol. XXIV, No. 4, Oct. 1948, pp. 538-54) a group of friends of the library met in the McGregor Room for a simple ceremony in which Dumas Malone presented to President Darden the first volume of his Jefferson and His Time. This initial volume, Jefferson the Virginian, first fruit of a great many years of planning and preparation, is dedicated to this University, where some of the research was done, and where vicarious pride is commensurate with Mr. Malone's accomplishment. It was a satisfaction to acquire afterward the manuscript of the book and the texts of the remarks made at the presentation. The Undergraduate, the Scholar, and the Collections Considerable expansion of our Map and Print collections (19,228 new maps and 12,527 new prints and pictures) will be noted under the respective headings below. The relatively strong growth of our holdings in maps has been stimulated by the establishment in the University several years ago of a full-fledged School of Geography. Cause and effect here are hard to distinguish. A decade ago the McGregor Library was established in the University, at once becoming the central and preeminent collection among the several special libraries constituting the Division of Rare Books and Manuscripts. Through this gift, Lawrence Wroth wrote in 1945, "the Charlottesville institution . . . has become an important center for American studies in a part of the country where the materials for such studies had not previously existed in strength and number." (In "The Chief End of Book Madness," Library of Congress Quarterly Journal . . . Vol. III, No. 1, Oct. 1945). In the meantime the collections of historical manuscripts, independent of the McGregor Library, have increased by geometrical progression. The American history faculty during the same period has exactly doubled in size. The School of History has grown to be the second largest department in graduate studies and has outstripped all others in the humanities; its undergraduate section, now numbering just under a thousand students, has today the third largest enrollment of any school in the college of arts and sciences. This is a phenomenon of some interest when one recalls the New York Times Report of 1943 on the non-teaching of history in American colleges, or even last month's report of a committee of Virginia's General Assembly that "Virginia history and government, as such, are not actually being taught in our schools." In a year which has seen the bequest of the T. Catesby Jones Collection of modern French prints, a generous addition to the Fred O. Seibel Archive of contemporary political cartoons, and some distinguished groups of historical engravings and political cartoons of our earlier history, it is gratifying to report a notable expansion of our facilities for the exhibits which have become an increasingly popular activity of the Division. The new Exhibition Gallery, opened several months ago with an exhibit from the Jones Collection, has made it possible for undergraduates and other visitors to examine closely many of the rarer items of large size, which formerly were seldom seen except by the specialist. The McGergor Library itself, once the almost exclusive domain of the graduate student, the visiting biographer, and other scholars, has become an increasing stimulus in undergraduate life. Book collections of undergraduates are frequently displayed there, and students in the college are active participants in the annual book collectors' contests as well as in the work of the University of Virginia Bibliographical Society, which meets in the room. The McGregor Room Seminars in Contemporary Prose and Poetry, conducted in recent months by such men as Basil Willey, Willard Thorp, and W. H Auden, have stirred such enthusiasm among undergraduates that they threaten to outgrow the room. Towards the Implementing of Policy Beyond our basic function of preservation, which we take to include cooperation with others as well as the building of our own collections, our staff has taken the stand that our proper aim is not to exploit materials but rather to make them available to scholars. Efforts have been made, therefore, to assist such projects as the Union Catalog, the Jefferson editing at Princeton, the 17th Century Inventory at Yale, the Evans Bibliography continuation at Worcester, the Short-Title Catalogue entries at Michigan, the microfilm inventory at Philadelphia, the Florida Catalogue at Winter Park, the Confederate Music listing at Emory, and the Confederate unofficial publications at Chapel Hill. The Curator of Rare Books is serving as general editor of the Virginia Imprints Inventory, a cooperative venture which includes, besides this University, the Library of Congress, the Virginia State Library, the College of William and Mary, and the Virginia Historical Society. Too much absorbed in the collecting and processing of new material, I am personally to blame for the lateness of this report, which is our principal means, other than correspondence and photography, of making available to researchers elsewhere our manuscript sources. With next year's report, which will include an index for the years 1945-1950, we hope that it will resume its proper character as an "annual" report. Other aids to research in the manuscripts have gone forward satisfactorily. One of the happiest appointments of recent years has been that of Mrs. Constance E. Thurlow, formerly of the John Carter Brown Library, who is engaged in overhauling the card catalogue to our manuscripts, and is also preparing for the press the calendar of our Jefferson Papers, previously mentioned. Assisted by a timely grant from the Richmond Area University Center, Mr. William E. Stokes and I are compiling a preliminary checklist of the writings of John Randolph of Roanoke. By its publication and distribution we hope to obtain many corrections and additions and to pave the way for an adequate editing of Randolph's papers. The resignations from our staff of Miss Evelyn Dollens and Mr. William H. Gaines, Jr., who have given yeoman's service to all our projects, are a source of regret to all of us. Their unselfish enthusiasm in the work of the Division has greatly helped in carrying forward into the future that "continuity with the past" which, according to Mr. Justice Holmes, "is not a duty," but "only a necessity."

      <field name="fulltext">EXPLANATORY NOTES MOST ENTRIES describe the manuscripts of a single acquisition, all the items in such a group being usually the papers of the single individual or family whose name is given. Dates in parentheses following names are birth and death dates. Dates not in parentheses indicate inclusive years of the manuscripts, with an occasional added date in parentheses to show the period covered by the bulk of the material. Thus 1725 (1900) -1928 means that while the earliest manuscript is dated 1725, the majority of papers fall in the period after 1900; 1805-(1850)1910 means that the body of the material ends in 1850, with a few scattered items up to 1910; and 1791 (1840-1860) 1902 means that the bulk of the papers fall between 1840 and 1860. Abbreviations, MS for manuscript, ALS for autograph letter, signed, etc., are those in common use. Numbers which appear at the end of each heading are accession numbers, included for their convenience to the library staff. As used in this report, "manuscripts" are the handwritten letters or other personal papers of individuals or families; "papers" are the manuscripts of a public officer, and are official or semi-official in character; "archives" are the official records of an institution; and "collections" are deliberately assembled groups, such as autograph collections. Non-manuscript material, other than books, acquired for the historical collections will be found under the following headings: Broadsides, Maps, Microfilm, Newspapers, and Prints and Pictures. Under University of Virginia a statement regarding the University's archives is given. The names of depositors of manuscripts on loan to the University are not included; it should be understood that while the majority of such manuscripts are accessible for research, all are subject to such restrictions as the depositor has made, and none may be reproduced without consent of the owner.</field>

GLASS, CARTER (1858-1946). 1879(1909)-1946. 400,000 items. Gift of Carter Glass, Jr., Mrs. John G. Boatwright, and Powell Glass, Jr. No. 2913. His professional and personal papers as farmer; newspaper publisher (The News and The Daily Advance) of Lynchburg, Virginia; member of Congress to 1919; Secretary of the Treasury, 1918-1920; and U. S. Senator, 1920-1946. Only scattering papers remain for the years prior to 1909 (because of a fire which destroyed papers and other personal property in that year), so that few records relate to Mr. Glass' early career in the Virginia Senate, 1899-1903, to his notable work in the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1902, and to his service in the 57th-59th Congresses. For the remaining forty years, however, the files provide extremely detailed and complete coverage of Senator Glass' varied and important activities in state, national, and international affairs. These include his work as patron and floor manager of the Federal Reserve Bank Act in the House of Representatives (the collection includes a copy of the Act signed by President Wilson, Vice-President Marshall, and Senator Champ Clark), as chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee reporting the Federal Farm Land Bank Act, and as a member of key committees in Democratic national conventions. Aside from the Federal Reserve System and banking and currency reform, the collection is rich in material on World Wars I and II; the close political and personal relations of Glass and Wilson; the League of Nations controversy; Democratic Party platforms and policies; national elections (especially those of 1920, 1924, and 1928); the policies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal (in which Senator Glass declined appointment to his old post of Secretary of the Treasury), such as the Supreme Court controversy of 1937 and "Neutrality" legislation. The papers demonstrate Roosevelt's personal friendship with Glass, their hostility on domestic issues, and their agreement on foreign policy. Although not calendared or indexed, the papers have been sufficiently processed to make research practicable. On a single day they have been consulted by out-of-state visitors doing research on such diverse topics as the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the career of Bishop James Cannon, the Methodist leader and Prohibitionist. During his eight years as a member of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, Mr. Glass, as a member of a special subcommittee, was influential in bringing to the University in 1904, as its first President, the late Edwin Anderson Alderman. Two decades later he served as treasurer of the University's campaign for the Centennial Endowment Fund. In 1936 he was instrumental in obtaining for the University the Federal grant which made possible construction of the Alderman Library building in which his papers now repose. Representative of the correspondents in the collection are letters to and from the following: Edwin A. Alderman, Newton D. Baker, Alben W. Barkley, Bernard Baruch, John Stewart Bryan, Harry F. Byrd, Richard E. Byrd, Calvin Coolidge, Josephus Daniels, Colgate W. Darden, Jr., Westmoreland Davis, James A. Garfield, Cary Grayson, Warren G. Harding, J. Edgar Hoover, Herbert Hoover, Edwin M.

JEFFERSON, THOMAS (1743-1826) PAPERS. The addition of 127 original Jefferson manuscripts to our collections during the two-year period covered by this report brings the total of our Jefferson papers to a figure exceeding 2,500. A detailed, item-by-item, indexed calendar of our Jefferson papers is now being compiled under a grant from the Richmond Area University Center, and will be published by the Library early in 1950. Subsequent acquisitions of Jefferson manuscripts will be listed in future issues of this report. Current acquisitions will be included in the Calendar, and are therefore merely summarized below in the entries following this one. Our own Jefferson papers are supplemented by a very extensive collection of transcripts (more than 50,000) available in our Manuscripts Reading Room, including photographic copies of the great Jefferson collection at the Library of Congress and of the holdings of the lesser Jefferson repositories, as well as photostats and other copies donated by hundreds of private owners of individual manuscripts. The conspicuous gap in our Jefferson transcripts collection is the great body of material at the National Archives, of which we hope to obtain microfilm copies at a future date. For students of Jefferson and his times, the University's most useful reference tool is our Jefferson Checklist, a chronologically arranged card file, which has now reached the astounding total of approximately 77,000 entries. Begun by our staff many years ago as an essential first step towards the full publication of Jefferson's writings, this Checklist describes briefly every Jefferson manuscript known to us, and every letter to and from him, indicating the location of the manuscript and any known printing, or partial printing, of its text. Only a small fraction have appeared in print. Princeton University was unintentionally slighted in our last report in the statement that no original Jefferson manuscripts exist there. What we intended to emphasize was that Princeton is engaged in collecting transcripts rather than originals. The Library and other agencies of Princeton University actually own more than thirty original Jefferson manuscripts, and the Jefferson Office in Princeton's Library now houses the most complete collection of Jefferson transcripts in existence. The most ambitious Jefferson project ever attempted, an editorial task of enormous complexity and difficulty, has been in process at Princeton since 1944. Under the editorship of Julian P. Boyd and his associates, Lyman H. Butterfield and Mrs. Mina R. Bryan, with assistance from the New York Times Company, the complete writings of Jefferson are being edited for publication by the Princeton University Press. The first volume (of a contemplated total of fifty) of The Papers of Thomas Jefferson will be issued early in 1950, making that year a milestone in American historical scholarship.

Virginia's state-wide cooperative program for the preservation of currently published Virginia newspapers, maintained by a majority of the editors and publishers in cooperation with the libraries of Virginia, has been supported by the University Library during the past two years through the cataloguing for permanent preservation of sixty-eight Virginia dailies and weeklies. The purpose of the program is to ensure the preservation of at least one complete file of each Virginia newspaper in at least one library. The publishers are asked to furnish one free subscription to one library. The libraries bear the cost of cataloguing, storage, and maintenance or microfilming. Fifty-three subscriptions have been received by this library during the period of this report as the publishers' contribution to this project in our library. A list of these is appended at the end of this report. Leading regional newspapers of the United States and foreign countries come to the library by subscription, the most constantly used of these being the rag-paper edition of the New York Times, with its index. Provision of adequate storage space is an ever-increasing problem, and consideration is being given to a greater use of the space-saving (but costly and time-consuming) expedient of microfilm. Some subscriptions are already received in the form of microfilm. Participation in cooperative microfilming projects has added to our files for research; and files of original newspapers have been received by exchange and on deposit. Editors' files, deposited for safekeeping, are catalogued and made available for research in all cases where that is authorized by the owners. A notable editor's file received on deposit is that of the Suffolk Herald and Suffolk News-Herald, for the years 1879-1938, from the publisher, Mr. W. J. Missett. Mr. A. R. Summers has deposited the files of southwestern Virginia newspapers, 1810-1924, owned by the late Lewis Preston Summers. A few of these (unique issues) are listed below. Valuable runs of the Southern Illustrated News, 18621864; the Magnolia Weekly, 1863-1864; and the Lynchburg Daily Republican have been received from Mr. Howell C. Featherston. Gifts of several important files have enriched the collections. From Mr. Robert Webb have come several of the unique issues of Richmond and Suffolk papers listed below. Through Mr. Royce E. Atkinson, the Tidewater Voiture No. 86 has presented the American Beacon &amp; North Carolina Gazette, 12 January-29 December 1832. The Wytheville Times, 8 January 1859-20 December 1860 has been donated by Mr. Trinkle Johnson. Mr. Frank C. Littleton has presented files of the New York Times, 1914-1918; the New York Sun, 1914-1917, and the New York Herald, 1914-1915. Mr. R. Smith Simpson has continued his generous work in building up our files of Belgian and Greek newspapers for the World War II and post-war years. The McGregor Library acquired some important volumes of Virginia and Washington, D. C., newspapers of the Civil War period which were originally in the library of the Confederate cartographer, Jed Hotchkiss: the Staunton Spectator; 1853-1868; the Staunton Messenger, 24 September 1850-19 March 1853; the Rockingham Register, 10 December 1859-1 September 1865; the Richmond Examiner, 29 October 1861-30 September 1862; and the Richmond Whig, 15 March 1861-November 1864. The acquisition of a file of the Boston Daily Advertiser, nearly complete for the years 1830-1915, has filled an important regional gap in our holdings, as does the Boston Repertory, 1804-1812 and Russell's Gazette, 1799-1801, for earlier years. A number of donors, actively supporting Clarence Brigham's assertion that newspapers are the most indispensable of all printed sources for historians, have helped during the period covered by this report to fill gaps in our files. In addition to the gifts already mentioned (and those noted on the final page of this report) we wish particularly to acknowledge generous help from the following: Robert L. Bidwell, Mrs. Harry A. Fellows, Jr., Miss Bertha Deane, Carter Glass, Jr., Edwin P. Lehman, William M. McGill, Miss Evelyn Moore, Mr. and Mrs. Maurice Moore, Willoughby Newton, William C. Noland, Alfred D. Preston, Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., James A. Williams, Jr., Miss Margaret Withrow, and Mrs. Douglas Wyllie. New acquisitions listed below include only those issues which, so far as is known (from Brigham's and Cappon's bibliographies) have never previously existed in any library.

Although the records range from studies of dinosaur remains at Oak Hill to soil analyses of this modern stock farm, the bulk of the papers concern James Monroe, who built the house (constructed by James Hoban from Jefferson's design, mantelpieces for two of the principal rooms being presented by Lafayette) and resided there after his retirement from public life. Original manuscripts include correspondence of Monroe with his daughter Eliza, with the overseer at Oak Hill, and memoranda by Henry Clay in connection with his nomination of Monroe for the presidency in caucus in 1816. In addition to transcripts of material significant to Monroe's career, the collection contains extensive photographic files on the Oak Hill house and its furnishings, including furniture owned by Monroe, Madison, John Adams, and other contemporaries. Correspondence of Mr. Littleton with Claude Bowers, Laurence G. Hoes, Jay W. Johns, and others, concerns the history of Oak Hill, challenges the claims of Ash Lawn as an authentic home of Monroe, and requests documentation of Ash Lawn's history. Gifts of other manuscripts by Mr. Littleton, not related to Monroe but once in the collection at Oak Hill, are separately entered under such headings as William Eustis, Thomas Jefferson, and Frank C. Littleton. PAGE-WALKER MANUSCRIPTS. 1742-1886. 251 items. Deposit. No. 3098.

Catesby Jones, Admiralty lawyer of New York City, who died on December 21, 1946, left by will his collection of modern prints and finely illustrated books to the University. The collection, made over a period of twenty-odd years by Mr. and Mrs. Jones, is almost entirely in the work of living French artists. There are over 200 separate prints exclusive of illustrations in books. These include fine examples in etching, woodcut, dry point, lithograph, and colored lithograph of the work of Picasso (including the "Vollard set"), of Derain ( a signed portfolio of the twelve women's heads known as "Metamorphoses"), Braque, Dufy, Galanis, Juan Gris, Laurencin, Matisse (etchings and lithographs, the latter including the portfolio "Dix Danseuses"), Miro, Goya, Toulouse-Lautrec, Lipchitz (including "The Drawings," a folio published by Curt Valentin, New York, 1944, signed by the artist and with a signed etching laid in), Segonzac, Jean Hugo, Masareel, Vlaminck, Chagall, Marcoussis, Lurcat, Jacques Villon, Pacsin, Gromaire, Masson, and Hayter.

There is also a complete collection of the books published by the Museum of Modern Art, from the beginning to 1946, and a file, lacking only one number, of the French quarterly "Verve." The chief acquisitions of historical prints were made by the McGregor Library in two lots, the first of which was a set of the 1790 Purmann re-engravings of the John White-De Bry pictures of Virginia, probably special proofs from the German Sitten und Meinungen of 1790. The other main group under this heading consisted of 72 American, British, and German political and comic cartoons, 1836-1870. This included twelve American political cartoons for the Jacksonian period, treating such subjects as the Texan War for Independence, the French spoliation claims, the bank crisis of 1837, and the Specie Circular, the Presidential election of 1844, and the union of the Free Soil with the Liberty parties in 1848. Among the characters depicted were Thomas Hart Benton, Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, John Tyler, Martin Van Buren, and Gulian Verplanck. There were also a group of drawings for Punch by John Tenniel, 11 of which dealt with British attitudes toward the U. S. Civil War, the Trent affair, and Lincoln's blockade policy. Other Punch cartoons dealt with British domestic politics, 1856-1862, the foreign policies of Palmerston, Gladstone, and Sir John Russell, and with such European matters as the Italian policy of Napoleon III, and the Italian War of Liberation. The collection also included a satirical French attack on the Federations created by Napoleon I, and six German comic cartoons.
