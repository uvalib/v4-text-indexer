E. Jordan, Chairman Committee on Admissions. For information as to lodgings, board, expenses, etc., address the Bursar, and for catalogues and other printed literature, address the Registrar. For other information address the Dean of the Department of Medicine. The session of 1936-37 opens on September 17. The registration days are September 17-19. A fee is required for delayed registration. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS The requirement for admission to the first year of the Department of Medicine is a four-year high-school education or its full equivalent, and two years of work in a college of arts and sciences approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association, as follows: I. High School Requirements The following are the minimum high school requirements of the American Medical Association and the Association of American Medical Colleges and must be satisfied for admission to all Class A medical schools. Students entering the College of the University of Virginia for their premedical college work must also satisfy the regular entrance requirements for admission to the college. (See General Catalogue.) These differ from the requirements stated below only in that 2Â½ units of Mathematics (1Â½ in Algebra and 1 in Plane Geometry) are required. (a) For admission to the two-year premedical college course, students shall have completed a four-year course of at least 15 units in a standard accredited high school or other institution of standard secondary school grade, or have the equivalent as demonstrated by examinations conducted by the College Entrance Examination Board or by the authorized examiner of a standard college or university which has been approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association. (b) Credit for admission to the premedical college course may be granted for the subjects shown in the following list and for any other subject counted by a standard accredited high school as part of the requirements for its diploma, provided that at least 11 units must be offered in groups I-V: Group I. English. (3 units required) Literature and composition. Group II. Foreign Languages. (2 units required, both of which must be in the same language) Latin, Greek, French, German, Spanish, Italian, or other modern foreign language. Group III. Mathematics. (2 units required) Elementary Algebra, Advanced Algebra, Plane Geometry, Solid Geometry, Trigonometry. Group IV. History. (1 unit required) Ancient History, Medieval and Modern History, English History, American History, Civil Government. Group V. Science. Botany, ZoÃ¶logy, Chemistry, Physics, Physiography, Physiology, Astronomy, Geology. Group VI. Miscellaneous. Agriculture, Bookkeeping, Business Law, Commercial Geography, Domestic Science, Drawing, Freehand and Mechanical, Economics and Economic History, Manual Training, MusicâAppreciation or Harmony. A unit is the credit value of at least thirty-six weeks work of four or five recitation periods per week, each recitation period to be not less than forty minutes. II. Premedical College Course The requirements given below are strictly minimum requirements. Premedical students are advised to take more than 30 session-hours of college work, either by spending an additional year in college or by taking 33 or 36 session-hours during their two years as college students. Entrance conditions of any kind whatsoever are absolutely prohibited and no substitution can be allowed for any required subject. In addition to the high-school work specified above, a candidate for admission to the Department of Medicine must present evidence of the completion in a manner satisfactory to this medical school of at least 30 session-hours of collegiate work in a college approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association. A session-hour is the credit value of one hour a week of lecture or recitation or two hours a week of laboratory work throughout a session of at least thirty-two weeks, exclusive of holidays. The subjects included in the 30 session-hours of college work should be in accordance with the following schedule: Required Subjects: Session-hours General Inorganic Chemistry (a) 4 Organic Chemistry (b) 3 Physics (c) 4 Biology (d) 4 English Composition and Literature (e) 3 Other non-science subjects (f) 6 Subjects Strongly Urged: French or German, Advanced Botany or Advanced ZoÃ¶logy, Psychology, Advanced Algebra, Solid Geometry, and Trigonometry, additional courses in Chemistry. Other Suggested Electives: English (additional), Economics, History, Sociology, Political Science, Ethics, Logic, Mathematics, Latin, Greek, Italian, Spanish, Drawing. Credit Not Given for an Incomplete Course: Credit can be accepted only when the student has a clear record on the entire course; for example, if the course in General Chemistry is a 6 session-hour course consisting of 3 hours lecture and 6 hours laboratory weekly for three trimesters and the student passes on two trimesters but fails on the third no credit for admission to medicine can be given for the portion of the subject passed, even though the credit value of this work is 4 session-hours. In all cases the student must have completed the entire subject for which he is registered. Deficiencies of this kind may, however, be made up by obtaining a clear record in the portion of the subject in which the failure has occurred, without repeating the entire course. Aptitude Tests: Applicants are strongly advised to take the Aptitude Tests of the Association of American Medical Colleges. Requirements in Individual Collegiate Subjects (a) General Inorganic Chemistry. 4 session-hours are required, including 2 session-hours of laboratory work. In the interpretation of this rule work in Qualitative Analysis may be counted as General Inorganic Chemistry. It is desirable that more time than this be given to General Chemistry and especially that either the elements of Physical Chemistry be included in a 6 session-hour course in this subject or a supplementary course in Elementary Physical Chemistry be taken. Students are also advised when their premedical work extends over more than two sessions to take at least 4 session-hours of Qualitative Analysis and 2 session-hours of Quantitative Analysis. (b) Organic Chemistry. 3 session-hours are required of which at least 1 must be laboratory work. 4 session-hours including 2 session-hours of laboratory work are recommended as giving better preparation in Organic Chemistry. (c) Physics. 4 session-hours required, of which at least 1 must be laboratory work. It is urged that this course be preceded by a course in Trigonometry and Solid Geometry. (d) Biology. 4 session-hours required, of which 2 must consist of laboratory work. The requirement may be satisfied by a course of 4 session-hours in General Biology or ZoÃ¶logy, or by courses of 2 session-hours each in ZoÃ¶logy and Botany, but not by Botany alone. Courses in Physiology and Hygiene, Sanitation, Bacteriology, Histology, and other similar work covered in the medical curriculum cannot be accepted as part of the premedical college requirements in Biology. (e) English Composition and Literature. The usual introductory college course of 3 session-hours, or its equivalent, is required. (f) Non-Science Subjects. Of the 30 session-hours required as the measurement of two years of college work, at least 9, including 3 session-hours of English, should be in subjects other than the physical, chemical, or biological sciences. Although not required for admission to the medical school, premedical students are strongly urged to acquire the basic knowledge of French or Germanâand preferably of both French and Germanâwhich will enable them with a little practice to read with ease the medical literature published in these languages. Apart from the cultural value of the study of a foreign language and the use which may be found for French and German in the study of medicine, a reading knowledge of one or both of these languages is required for certain desirable postgraduate scholarships and fellowships. When the student presents for admission to the premedical college course 2 units of high school work in either language, the usual 3 session-hour "second year" college course will amply give this basic knowledge. When he begins the study of the language in college, he should take at least 4, and preferably 5, session-hours in the language. College courses in Physical Education and in Military Training or Military Science will not be counted towards the 30 session-hours required for admission to medicine; nor will required courses in Bible and Biblical Literature be counted, unless the course has a credit value of at least 3 session-hours for one session. No entrance conditions whatever can be allowed nor can any substitutions be made for the required subjects. Premedical students in other colleges and universities who are considering the possibility of entering upon their medical studies in this University are urged to have the authorities of the University of Virginia pass officially upon their academic credit early in their last premedical college year and in no case later than June 1, of that year. Deficiencies may be discovered in this way in time to remove them before the following September. Such students will incur no obligation to enter this medical school. The prohibition of entrance conditions in all recognized medical colleges makes it especially important for the student to be absolutely sure six months or more beforehand that the course he is taking will admit him to the study of medicine. Many deficiencies can be made up by work in summer schools. In planning two years of premedical college work students are advised to take English, Mathematics (Solid Geometry, Plane Trigonometry, and Advanced Algebra), Biology, and General Inorganic Chemistry the first year; and Organic Chemistry, Physics, Foreign Language, and one or more electives the second year. This arrangement of studies is advised because Mathematics should precede Physics and General Inorganic Chemistry must precede Organic Chemistry. Those who have to take 4 or more session-hours of college work in Foreign Language may find it advisable to take Foreign Language both years and take the Mathematics in a summer school following the first premedical college session. Admission with Advanced Standing.âStudents are admitted to advanced standing in the second and third year under the following conditions: 1. Satisfaction of the requirements for entrance into this department at the time of entrance of the class to which the applicant seeks admission. 2. The presentation of a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended. 3. The presentation of the complete record of the student in the school previously attended, on blanks to be obtained from the Dean of the Department of Medicine. This record will be submitted to the action of the Faculty Committee on Advanced Standing, and the admission of the student, together with the terms of admission, will be determined by this committee. The Committee on Advanced Standing will not in general consider favorably applications which are not accompanied by a distinctly good record in the school previously attended. Whenever a student is admitted to advanced standing he must take and pass the full work of the class to which he is admitted unless by permission of the Dean he substitutes for one or more of the regular courses of his class other courses of approximately the same credit value. Students are not received with advanced standing to the fourth-year class. Limitation of Numbers and Reservation of Places.âThe number of students in the first year class is limited to sixty-five. Any applicant whose record has been endorsed by the Dean of the Department of Medicine as entitling him to admission to the class to which he seeks admittance, may at a specified time after June 25 of which he will be given due notice and before the registration period in September have a place reserved for him until 12:00 noon of the first day of registration by depositing with the Bursar the sum of $50.00 in part payment of the tuition fee. A reservation so made can be cancelled only in exceptional cases. In case a student who has obtained a reservation fails to register, the deposit of $50.00 will be forfeited to the University unless, in case of illness or equivalent cause, the Dean of the Department of Medicine directs that it be returned. Unreserved places are filled from a "waiting list" of approved candidates. By the deposit, under similar conditions, of the entire fees for the year a student may have a place reserved for him until 5 p. m. of the last day of registration. Women over twenty years of age are admitted to the medical department by satisfying the entrance requirements specified above. All women students must first register at the office of the Dean of Women, 16 East Lawn. FACILITIES FOR AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION The new Medical Building completed in 1929 contains modern well-equipped laboratories for the accommodation of the medical sciences. This building is connected by corridors and bridges with the hospital, thus bringing all departments of the Medical School into close physical association. The new arrangement necessitated extensive changes in certain portions of the hospital, involving especially the surgical suite, the X-ray suite and the out-patient quarters. It required also the erection of an enlarged laundry, a new power plant, and dining halls for hospital staff and nurses. The Medical School Building consists of two wings connected by an inside pavilion, all five floors in height. The south wing houses on four successive floors the departments of biochemistry, pharmacology and materia medica, physiology, and histology and embryology. On the top floor are the experimental laboratories, quarters for experimental animals and a fire-proof storage room for X-ray plates. The north wing gives accommodations on the ground floor for autopsy rooms, an embalming room, a media room, refrigeration, incineration and storage. The first floor houses half of the Out-patient Department and the receiving room. On the second floor are the offices of administration, the museum and the library. On the third floor are the department of pathology and bacteriology, and two classrooms. The fourth floor contains a laboratory for neuro-anatomy. The connecting pavilion, or west wing, contains on the ground floor four student locker rooms, the electrical power room, a record storage room, and an amphitheatre. The latter is two floors in height and extends eastward into the open court between the north and south wings. On the first floor are a lecture room, a staff room, a record room, a drug room, and examining and sterilizing rooms. On the second floor are housed the department of clinical pathology and a cardiac laboratory. The third floor has three laboratories for gross anatomy, a study room, a number of offices, and quarters for surgical pathology. On the top floor are accommodations for the department of public health and hygiene. These laboratories are all presided over by trained teachers, to whom teaching and investigation are primary considerations. The number of hours assigned to laboratory subjects is quite large and affords ample time for thorough study by the best methods. The student is brought into close contact with teachers who are both willing and able to guide him; he gains a very large part of his knowledge at first hand and by his own exertions, and thus acquires the habit of working out things for himself; he becomes self-reliant, a quality essential to the practice of his difficult profession. Trained in this manner, he acquires an understanding of the medical sciences and the ability to apply the facts of these sciences to the subsequent study of disease. For these reasons the great fundamental sciences receive the utmost consideration, constituting a large part of the work of the first two years. The methods of clinical instruction are based upon the belief that no clinical teaching is efficient which is not governed by essentially the same principles as those which govern the best laboratory teaching. This instruction is accordingly designed to enforce with the individual student a careful, thorough, face-to-face study of disease and its management. The facilities afforded by the University Hospital and Out-Patient Department are described on a subsequent page. In the Out-Patient Department and in the Hospital the student learns the methods of examining patients, of diagnosing their diseases, and of instituting rational treatment; and he learns these things in much the same way as he studied in the laboratory, that is to say, by doing them himself under the direction and criticism of the instructors. This practical training is accompanied by a systematic study of the various subjects by means of lectures, textbooks, and recitations. The student conducts a complete examination, records his observations in a scientific manner, makes a diagnosis, states his view as to the treatment indicated, and keeps a complete record of the case, all under the advice and criticism of the physician or surgeon in charge. He is expected to keep himself informed of the progress of the case throughout its course. If it is one requiring surgical treatment, he assists at the operation, and thus is able to follow all the procedures of the operator at close range. In addition, students make frequent visits to the wards with the attending physicians and surgeons, during which visits the nature, treatment, and progress of various cases are gone over in detail. The patients of the Blue Ridge Sanatorium afford additional material for clinical instruction. Since the number of students in each class is relatively small, it is clear that the department offers capable young men clinical advantages which are distinctly exceptional. At the meetings of the Medical Society of the University of Virginia reviews of important articles, clinical cases and results of original research are presented by the instructors and by invited guests. Graduate Instruction in the Department of Medicine is administered under the Department of Graduate Studies of the University. The courses of the regular medical curriculum are credited as C courses; elective, special research and seminar courses are evaluated as D courses. Recent revision of the medical curriculum, involving chiefly reductions in the number of session-hours of required work and the establishment of elective and research courses in each of the major departments, makes possible an enlarged scope of graduate instruction. Registrar's Records of Student's Work.âThe results of the work of each student are recorded in the Registrar's office in such manner as to show (1) the grade received on each course, (2) whether the student has or has not absolved the course and, if not, what is necessary to obtain a clear record and admit to dependent subjects, and (3) a valuation in "honor points" of the results of the work for each session. 1. The grade received on each course. These grades with their percentage equivalents are as follows: 1 + = 95-100 per cent 1 = 90- 94 per cent 2 = 85- 89 per cent 3 = 80- 84 per cent 4 = 70- 79 per cent 5 = below 70 per cent The passing grade is 3. A grade of 4 entitles the student to a condition, as explained below. A grade of 5 means a failure for the course. No passing grades are reported to the Registrar's office on didactic work unless the laboratory or clinical part of the course is completed in a satisfactory manner; nor are any grades reported when the student is deficient until the deficiency has been made up. 2. Whether the student has or has not absolved the course, and, if not, what is required to obtain a clear record and admit to dependent subjects. This is indicated in the following terms: Passed (P) indicates the satisfactory completion of the course and admits to all dependent subjects. Conditioned (C) means that to obtain a clear record on the course the student must pass a special examination. Failure to take or to pass this examination is equivalent to a record of "failed." The record "conditioned" is not given in fourth-year subjects, except in case of illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty. A student may be conditioned on any examination because of failure to maintain a reasonable standard of English composition. Deficient (D) indicates that part of the required laboratory or clinical work of the course has not been completed. Upon the satisfactory completion of this work within the time and in the manner prescribed by the professor in charge, the student receives the record "passed"; otherwise the record is "failed" on the entire course. Failed (F) indicates that the course must be repeated; except that when the laboratory or other practical work has been satisfactorily performed, the professor in charge may, at his discretion, excuse the student from repeating the same; and, by special vote of the faculty, the student may be granted optional attendance upon the course, in whole or in part. In general, a student who is repeating a course will be required to attend all the exercises of the course, and will not be excused from any exercise thereof because of schedule conflicts with more advanced work. Absence from a regular examination, when excused because of illness or equivalent cause gives a record of conditioned; if not excused, a record of failed. 3. A valuation of the general results of the work on each course and of the student's work for the entire session. Honor points and Deficiency points. The term point is employed as an index of the extent of departure from the passing grade of 3. No points are given for a mere passing grade; but for grades above 3 they are designated as honor points (or +) and for those below 3 as deficiency points (or -) An honor point may be defined as the value of one-half session-hour of a course on which a grade of 2 has been received; this value is increased to 2 when a grade of 1 has been received; and to 2Â½ when a grade of 1+ has been received. A deficiency point is the value of 1/3 session-hour of a course on which a grade of 4 has been received; this becomes 1 1/3 when a grade of 5 has been received. Deficiency points, once incurred, cannot be expunged. The 1 deficiency point of a grade requiring a conditioned examination becomes 1 1/3 deficiency points if a passing grade is not made on the re-examination, since the record becomes a failure. Each course is valued in the usual manner in terms of session-hours. Then the student's honor and deficiency points are determined by multiplying the number of session-hours involved by the point value of the grade earned. The following table gives the values in points for one session-hour of work for the various grades: Grade Point value per session-hour 1+ (95-100%) 5 honor points (+5) 1 (90-94.9%) 4 honor points (+4) 2 (85-89.9%) 2 honor points (+2) 3 (80-84.9%) 0 honor points (None) 4 (70-79.9%) 3 deficiency points (-3) 5 (Under 70%) 4 deficiency points (-4) The value in points of a session's work is the difference between the honor points received and the deficiency points. If there is an excess of the former, this is indicated by placing a plus (+) sign before the numeral; if vice versa, a minus (-); if they balance one another, no sign or numeral is employed, which is also the case where the grade is 3 on all subjects. Honor points will not be given for grades received on conditioned examinations or on courses in which repetition was required on account of poor scholarship. On the other hand, deficiency points will be given in accordance with the above table. Furthermore, deficiency points shall be cumulative. A student, having incurred deficiency points in June, shall have these added to such as he may incur on repeating a course on re-examination and the sum shall be used in determining his relative rank in his class. Students, whose excess of honor points over deficiency points amounts to 50 on the entire curriculum of medical study of any one year, or its equivalent, are designated as "honor" or "distinguished" students and have the privilege of optional attendance on the didactic work of the next session. Special Rules Governing Advancement and Registration. I. At the close of the University in June the records of the past session will be reviewed and the students will be classified as follows: (a) Promoted; (b) Required to Withdraw; (c) Provisionally Promoted; and (d) Required to Repeat. (a) Promoted. This group shall be composed of all students who have satisfactorily completed the entire work of the year. (b) Required to Withdraw. This group shall include such students as are not deemed competent to continue their training in this school. The record requiring withdrawal, reckoned in deficiency points and in session-hours, is as follows: For first-year classâ36 deficiency points regardless of honor points, or the equivalent in session-hours: (1) Failures in 9 session-hours; (2) failures in 6 hours plus conditions in 4 hours; (3) conditions in 12 hours. For second-year classâ36 deficiency points regardless of honor points, or the equivalent in session-hours: (1) Failures in 9 hours; (2) failures in 6 hours plus conditions in 4 hours; (3) conditions in 12 hours. For third-year classâ26 deficiency points regardless of honor points, or the equivalent in session-hours: (1) Failures in 6.5 hours; (2) failures in 4 hours plus conditions in 3.3 hours; (3) conditions in 8.6 hours. (c) Provisionally Promoted. This group shall include the students who have incurred only such deficiencies as can with reasonable expectation be removed by the opening of the next session. The record entitling provisional promotion, reckoned in deficiency points and in session-hours, must not be worse than the following: For first-year classâ28 deficiency points regardless of honor points, or the equivalent in session-hours: (1) Failures in 7 hours; (2) failures in 4 hours plus conditions in 4 hours; (3) conditions in 9.3 hours. For second-year classâ18 deficiency points regardless of honor points, or the equivalent in session-hours: (1) Failures in 7 hours; (2) failures in 4 hours plus conditions in 4 hours; (3) conditions in 9.3 hours. For third-year classâ18 deficiency points regardless of honor points, or the equivalent in session-hours: (1) Failures in 4.5 hours; (2) failures in 3 hours plus conditions in 2 hours; (3) conditions in 6 hours. (d) Required to Repeat. This group shall include all students not placed in groups a, b, and c; that is, those who have incurred (1) in the first or second year between 28.1 and 35.9 deficiency points, and (2) in the third between 18.1 and 25.9. A student who is repeating a session's work must attend all the exercises of the year, or courses, and pass all the examinations, regardless of the grades previously made. II. Students, classified in June as "Required to Withdraw" or "Required to Repeat," shall not change their status by passing summer courses and (or) special examinations. III. At the opening of the session in September, the status of the students, who were classified in June as Provisionally Promoted, will be revised and they will be re-classified as follows: (a) Promoted; (b) Required to Withdraw; (c) Required to Repeat. (a) Promoted. This group shall be composed of such students as were provisionally promoted in June and have now, by summer's work and reexamination, satisfactorily completed the entire work of the year; i. e., have not added to their deficiency points. (b) Required to Withdraw. This group shall be composed of such students as have failed to make up their deficiencies to such an extent as to incur (1) in the first and second years more than 24 additional deficiency points, or the equivalent in failures of more than 6 session-hours of work, and (2) in the third year more than 16 additional deficiency points, or its equivalent in failures of more than 4 session-hours of work. (c) Required to Repeat. This group shall be composed of such students as were not placed in a and b, above; i. e., in the first and second years they have not more than 24 additional deficiency points; and in the third, not more than 16 additional. IV. A student who has been permitted to repeat a year, or prescribed courses, shall not be granted the privilege for a second time, i. e., he shall not spend more than five years in completing the requirements for graduation. V. A student may not take any course, either in whole or in part (as explained under the above definition of failed) more than twice. A second record of failed on the same course involves withdrawal from the Department of Medicine. VI. A clear record at the opening of the session in September on all subjects of the preceding year is required for advancement to the third and fourth years. VII. Summer courses taken for the removal of deficiencies must be approved by the professor in whose subjects the deficiencies were incurred; but it shall be the duty of the student concerned to provide the information on which to base the decision as to acceptability of courses; he must absolve the summer work and have an official record mailed directly from the institution to the professor at the University in charge of the subjects; and in addition he must report for the special examination at this University and make a passing grade therein. VIII. Any student, who makes a grade below passing on any term's work or is in any way derelict in his duties, shall be warned, warned and placed on probation, or dismissed, according to the merits of the case. The value in session-hours of the courses of the first three years:â First Year Second Year Third Year Anatomy 1 6 Physiology 5 Clinical Diagnosis 2.5 Anatomy 2 2 Pathology 6 Medicine 4.0 Histology 4 Pharmacology 2 Surgery 4.0 Embryology 2 Materia Medica 3 Obstetrics 2.5 Biochemistry 4 Physical Diagnosis 1 Orthopedics 1.5 Bacteriology 3 Medicine 2 Pediatrics 2.0 Surgery 1 Urology 1.0 Ophthalmology 1.0 Otolaryngology 1.0 Totals 21 Totals 20 Totals 19.5 Similar rules are enforced at practically all medical schools. It is exceedingly difficult for a student who has been dropped or not advanced at one school to secure admission to another. Compulsory withdrawal may therefore terminate a medical career. Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine, who have less than one full year's work to complete, may be required to take such additional work and to pass such additional examinations as the Medical Faculty may prescribe. This additional work may be selected from any of the courses given in the Department of Medicine, even when such prescribed courses have previously been taken and passed by the candidate in question. Certificates of Attendance.âStudents who attend the whole regular course of one or more of the four years are entitled to an official statement under the seal of the University, showing all courses for which the student was registered each year as a medical student and the record (see above under "Regulations") with the grade received on each course for which he was registered. These statements will also contain any special faculty votes affecting the student's registration in this school. In no case will the University give an official certificate of the completion of a part of a course. The professor in charge may, at his discretion, make a personal statement by letter to the head of the same department in another medical school of the work done by the student in his course; but he must at the same time clearly state that this letter does not imply credit in this medical school. Requirements for Graduation.âThe degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred by the University of Virginia upon candidates who have complied with the entrance requirements of this department; attended a regular medical course of four years of at least eight months each, the last two of which years must have been at this institution; and have satisfactorily completed a thesis and all of the subjects included in the medical course. Examinations.âThese are in writing, accompanied in many subjects by individual practical examinations. Examinations may be held only during the regular examination periods at the end of each term or during the vacation periods. No examinations may be given while regular class work is in progress; provided this rule is not to be interpreted to prohibit unannounced written tests or regular daily or weekly tests which count on the class standing of students. The regular examinations are held at stated periods during the session. In addition, examinations are held each year during the week immediately preceding the beginning of lectures. To the latter are admitted: 1. Students of the previous session, who, from illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty, were unable to present themselves for examination in any particular subject at the regular time. 2. Students who at the regular examination in any first-, second-, or third-year subject of the preceding session have attained a grade less than 80 per cent., but as much as 70 per cent., on one or more subjects, as explained in a preceding paragraph. This does not apply to students who have been required to withdraw, or required to repeat, under the Special Rules Governing Advancement (pp. 13-15). 3. Certain applicants for advanced standing who are required to take examinations by the Committee on Advanced Standing. The usual period for special or conditioned examinations is in September during the week of registration; but such examinations may be scheduled, at the option of the professor in charge, for any other time, provided regular class work is not in progress and also provided all students entitled to take examinations agree to the change of date. For a special or conditioned examination held at any other time than that assigned for all students entitled thereto a fee of five dollars is charged. This fee must be paid to the Bursar before the examination is held. In all courses in which there is practical work, either in the laboratory or in the outpatient department or wards of the hospital, two records are returned to the Registrar's office for each student; one of these records is for the practical laboratory or clinical work in which the record is P(assed), D(eficient), or F(ailed), the other record is for the didactic work, including the final examinationsâin which case the record is P(assed), C(onditioned), D(eficient), or F(ailed), with the approximate percentage grade. To obtain a clear record on the course a student must have a record of P(assed) both on practical and on didactic work; at the discretion of the professor in charge these grades may be averaged to determine the final standing of the student. No record whatever is given on didactic work unless there is a record of P(assed) on practical work nor will any record be given on practical work until a clear record is obtained on didactic work; failure on practical work gives a record of F(ailed) on the entire course. The Fall Examinations for 1936-37 begin September 14 and close September 19. Students entitled to admission to these examinations will be informed of the date of examination by the Dean. Expenses.âThe fees for instruction are 1, the tuition fee; 2, the University fee which entitles the student to the use of the Library, Gymnasium, to medical attention, etc.; 3, the athletic fee; 4, the Topics fee; 5, special laboratory fees, as specified in following table. First Year Second Year Third Year Fourth Year Tuition (Virginians) $250 00 $250 00 $250 00 $250 00 (Non-Virginians) 300 00 300 00 300 00 300 00 University fee 60 00 60 00 60 00 60 00 Athletic fee 15 00 15 00 15 00 15 00 College Topics fee 1 50 1 50 1 50 1 50 Laboratory Fees: Biochemistry 10 00 Deposit in Biochemistry 10 00 Anatomy 1 and 2 17 50 Histology and Embryology 7 50 Physiology 10 00 Bacteriology 7 50 Pathology 5 00 Pharmacology 5 00 Clinical Diagnosis 5 00 5 00 Materia Medica 5 00 Total (Virginians) $379 00 $356 50 $331 50 $326 50 (Non-Virginians) 429 00 406 50 381 50 376 50 The minimum for necessary living expenses, including room, heat, light, furniture, service, board, books, and laundry, is estimated at $400. In the course in Biochemistry, a deposit of $10 is required to cover cost of breakage. A fee of $3.00 is required of all women students for the upkeep of the "Women Students' Association Room." Each student in the Department of Medicine is required to provide himself with a satisfactory microscope. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University and the Dean of the Department in which the student is registered. When a permit is granted upon the University Physician's certificate that withdrawal is necessary on account of ill health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct, the fees are returned pro rata. Under no other circumstances will there be a return of fees. Combined Degrees in Arts (or Science) and Medicine.âStudents who have credit for the 48 session-hours of the group electives required in this University for the cultural baccalaureate degrees in arts and science may substitute for 12 session-hours of Electives-at-Large the first-year course in the Department of Medicine and receive the degree of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science at the end of the year. For further information, see the General Catalogue of the University. The University offers also the degree of Bachelor of Science in Medicine. This degree has been placed in charge of the Medical Faculty. It is awarded on the recommendation of the Medical Faculty after the completion of the second year of the medical curriculum to students who (1) present 33 session hours of acceptable work in premedical college subjects (whether taken in the University or elsewhere) as specified below; (2) complete the first two years of the medical course in this University with grades in general higher than the lowest passing grade; and (3) demonstrate by examination a reading knowledge of medical French and German. (1) Premedical College Subjects.âThese must include: Session-hours One year of English 3 Algebra, Solid Geometry, Plane Trigonometry 3 Physics, Chemistry, and Biology 24 With minimum requirements in each subject as follows: (a) General Chemistry (including in this term Analytical or Physical Chemistry) 6 (b) Organic Chemistry 3 (c) General Physics 4 (d) Biological Science 6 Elective in subjects other than Physics, Chemistry and Biology 3 (2) First two years of the Medical Curriculum, completed with a record of 30 honor points on first-year subjects and 40 honor points on second-year subjects. (3) Reading knowledge of Medical French and German.âThis will be tested by examination consisting of the translation of passages from textbooks of Anatomy and Histology, Biochemistry, Physiology, and Pathology. No specific college work is required although the equivalent of 3 session-hour college courses in each of these languages is desirable. The vocabulary of medical French and German may best be acquired by using foreign textbooks, etc., in the above medical sciences as parallel reading, or as summer reading after the completion of the above subjects in the regular medical course. SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS Certain special scholarships are open only to medical students. A considerable number of other scholarships are open to medical students in common with students from other departments of the University. The William A. Herndon Scholarships are founded upon the bequest of Dr. Cumberland George Herndon, a graduate in medicine of this University. They are awarded by the Medical Faculty after a competitive examination held during the summer vacation preceding enrollment as a student in the Medical Department. Candidates must be unable to defray the expenses of their medical education and must signify their intention of entering the medical service of the army or navy of the United States. These scholarships carry a stipend of approximately $500. They continue for the four years of the medical course and are awarded whenever there is a vacancy. Two appointments were made in September, 1934. Applications must be made not later than July 1 of the year of appointment. For information as to the examinations and other requirements, address the Dean of the Department of Medicine. The Richard Henry Whitehead Scholarships, founded by an anonymous donor in memory of Dr. Richard Henry Whitehead, Professor of Anatomy and Dean of the Department of Medicine, 1905-1916, are awarded to young men of promise who contemplate entering upon lines of medical work which will advance medical knowledge either pure or applied. They are usually awarded only to students who have completed at least two years of the medical curriculum. There are three of these scholarships. New appointments will be made for the session 1936-37. For further information, address the Dean of the Department of Medicine. The Virginia State Medical Scholarships, established in 1925 by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. Two scholarships are awarded annually in the Department of Medicine, towards the close of the session, to the students from Virginia on the basis of rank and need, retroactive for the session. Tenure four years, conditioned upon maintenance of satisfactory scholastic record. Emolument, remission of tuition fee. The Doctor William Selden Memorial Scholarship in the Department of Medicine, with an emolument of $500. Established through the Centennial Endowment Fund. Appointment made by the Rector and Visitors upon the nomination of the Dean of the Department of Medicine. The Doctor Edward May Magruder Medical Scholarship, founded in 1927 by the American Clan Gregor Society, with an emolument of $60, is awarded upon the recommendation of the Society. The Henry Clay Marchant Scholarships: two, with an emolument of $360 each. For detailed information see Henry Clay Marchant Fellowships in Graduate and General Catalogues. If appointments cannot be made from the Department of Graduate Studies as therein set forth, then applications will be considered in the following order from undergraduates: (1) from those in the Medical Department who may be preparing to be medical missionaries; (2) from those in the College preparing to enter the ministry. Other Scholarships and Fellowships open to medical students in common with students in other departments of the University are: The Bayly-Tiffany Scholarships; the Valentine Birely Scholarship; the Thompson Brown Scholarship; the Isaac Cary Scholarship; the Philip Francis duPont Scholarships and Fellowships; the Richard Eppes Memorial Scholarship; the William C. Folkes Scholarships; the Frank Stringfellow Hall Scholarship; the D. J. Hennessy Scholarship; the James Rufus Humphrey Scholarship; the McCormick Scholarship; the Thomas Fortune Ryan Scholarships; the Daniel Kerr Stewart Scholarship; the James Parker Williams Scholarship; the Virginia Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy Scholarship; the Samuel Watts Scholarship; the Bennett Wood Green Fellowships; and the John Y. Mason Fellowship. Loan funds also are available. For full information regarding scholarships, fellowships, and loan funds, see the General Catalogue of the University. THE JOHN HORSLEY MEMORIAL PRIZE IN MEDICINE This prize consists of the interest on an endowment fund and varies in amount from $600 to $1,000. It was founded in 1925 by Dr. J. Shelton Horsley of Richmond, Virginia, as a memorial to his father, Mr. John Horsley of Nelson County, Virginia. The prize will be awarded every two years by a committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Virginia for the best thesis based on research in a problem of general surgery. The prize is open to all graduates of the Medical Department of the University of Virginia of not more than fifteen years standing. For further information, address Dr. Edwin P. Lehman, University, Virginia, who is chairman of the committee of award. HONOR SOCIETIES The Alpha Omega Alpha Society.âOn November 15, 1919, a charter was issued for the establishment in this University of a chapter of the honor medical society, Alpha Omega Alpha, to which there are chosen annually one-fifth of each graduating class, on the basis of scholarship, character, and professional promise. Since publication of the last catalogue the following have been elected to membership: from the class of 1935, John William Ashworth, Jr., Byrd Stuart Leavell, Carl Louis Wilson and Herman Wolff; and from the class of 1936, Julian Ruffin Beckwith, John Randolph Tucker Carmichael and Robert William McCullough. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION In the following description of courses, the number of hours represents the amount of time each student devotes to the course. In addition to the hours scheduled in the third and fourth years of the course, each student devotes a considerable amount of time to practical work which does not appear in the schedule, but the satisfactory performance of which is essential to graduation. Thus the taking of histories, the visits to his cases in the hospital, assisting at operations, attendance upon cases of labor, the employment of microscopical and chemical methods of diagnosis in the hospital, require much time which it has not seemed possible to record in a rigid schedule. The session, exclusive of the time devoted to examination, is divided into a first term of twelve weeks, a second term of ten weeks, and a third term of ten weeks. First Year Anatomy 1: 19 hours weekly during the first term and 12 hours weekly during the second term. This course begins with a systematic study of the bones, on the completion of which a part is assigned to each student for dissection and study. On the completion of this course each student has dissected a lateral half of the body. The student obtains his knowledge at first hand and by his own personal efforts. Dr. Bean. Dr. Speidel and Assistants. Anatomy 2: 6 hours weekly during the second term. This course consists of a laboratory study of the anatomy of the central nervous system carried out in considerable detail. The gross anatomy of the spinal cord and brain is first considered, on the completion of which sections of the more important regions are studied with the aid of the microscope. Fresh brains and series of sections of the cord and brain are thoroughly used. A reconstruction of the central nervous system showing the more important pathways is prepared by each student. Dr. Speidel. Histology: 4 lectures or recitations and 10 hours of laboratory work weekly during the first term. This course aims to acquaint the student with the microscopic structure of tissues and organs. Cytogenesis and histogenesis are briefly considered in the case of many tissues studied. The relation of histology to physiology and pathology is constantly kept in view. The student is also given opportunity to acquaint himself with the principles and practice of histological technique. Dr. Jordan and Dr. Kindred. Embryology: 7 hours weekly during the second term. The laboratory work (5 hours weekly) with sections and dissections of mammalian embryos, is supplemented by lectures, recitations, and the study of models. The course aims to give the student a knowledge of developmental processes, in the light of which he may the better understand the more abstruse normal conditions of adult anatomy, as well as many anomalies and variations. Dr. Jordan and Dr. Kindred. Bacteriology: Lectures, conferences and laboratory work 15 hours weekly during the third term. The object of this course is to acquaint the student with the microÃ¶rganisms which are of importance to man and his environment, the methods used in their study and identification. The fundamentals of infection and immunity are taught. So far as practicable the material studied is obtained from the environment, from the body surfaces and excretions of normal individuals, and from the body surfaces, excretions, secretions and exudates of the persons with various common pathological conditions. The student is thus introduced to the etiology of infectious disease and some of the factors involved in resistance. Through a consideration of selected bacteriologic and immunologic studies the basis is laid for the later study of epidemiology and preventive medicine. Dr. Maxcy, Dr. Scott and Assistants. Biochemistry: Lectures and laboratory, 7 hours weekly during the second term and 14 hours weekly during the third term. Course comprises the chemistry of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates; digestion, intestial putrefaction, feces, blood, milk, and bile; particular attention is devoted to the chemical physiology of digestion, secretion, excretion, internal secretion, intermediary metabolism, and nutrition. Laboratory work includes the study of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, purine compounds, etc.; gastric contents, blood, milk, and urine; the digestive enzymes and the digestion of foods; and extensive qualitative and quantitative work on urine. Dr. Chanutin and Dr. Ludewig. Second Year Physiology: Lectures, conferences, and demonstrations, 5 hours weekly during the first term, and 4 hours during the second term; laboratory work, 7 hours weekly during the first term, 3 hours weekly during the second term. In the lecture course attention is drawn to the fundamental branches of the subject, and the more difficult aspects are thoroughly discussed. Recent important physiological contributions are evaluated, and the student is directed further to consult various monographs and original papers. The laboratory work consists of preliminary elemental experiments on the neuromuscular system, followed by intensive courses in mammalian and in human physiology. The latter are designed particularly to train students to observe and record, and to interpret and make deductions from their results. Suggestive outlines only are provided for the experimental studies. The course in physiology is particularly devised to stimulate and correlate the student's consideration of the activities of the organism as a whole. Emphasis is given to those branches of physiology which should prove valuable in later work in medicine. Dr. Britton, Dr. Corey, Dr. Silvette and Assistants. Pathology: 4 hours weekly during the first term; 12 hours weekly during the second term, and 12 hours weekly during the third term. By a systematic series of lectures, combined with demonstrations of both gross and microscopic preparations, the various morbid conditions of the body are presented. In the laboratory, under supervision, the student personally examines all of the gross material and devotes considerable time to the study of the loan-collection of slides with which he is provided. In addition to this systematic portion of the course an attempt is made to acquaint the students with fresh tissues and disease as seen at the autopsy table. With this end in view the class is divided into small groups of students each of which assists at a limited number of autopsies. Fresh tissues are demonstrated during class hours and, whenever possible, autopsies are performed before the entire class. Dr. Cash, Dr. Casey, Dr. Scott and Dr. Foote. Materia Medica: Lectures and recitations 4Â½ hours weekly and laboratory work 6 hours weekly, during the first three-fourths of the first term.

Pharmacist Maud Lambert Assistant Pharmacist The hospital is the property of the University and is under the exclusive control of its Medical Faculty. It was designed and is administered as a teaching hospital, being so arranged that free use can be made of its clinical material without in any way disturbing or violating the privacy of other patients. The location of the University Hospital is a most favorable one, being situated at the intersection of two great railway trunk lines near the geographical center of the State. A large population outside of the city of Charlottesville is available as a source of clinical material, both in the wards and the Out-Patient Department. The hospital is thus enabled to serve a large area of the State and the transportation facilities are such that this service includes a progressively increasing number of emergency cases and cases of acute illness. The buildings are arranged upon the pavilion system, consisting of a central structure, four stories in height, to which have been added up to the present time five additional units, including a service building. The central building is largely devoted to administrative purposes and general service departments. The four pavilions are connected with the main building by corridors on each floor. In these are located the wards and suites of rooms for private patients. As at present constituted, the hospital has a capacity of about 300 beds; of these, approximately 225 are available and used for clinical teaching. During the past year there were 7,092 admissions to the hospital. Attention is particularly called to the fact that the hospital, with its associated Out-Patient Department, constitutes a most valuable part of the teaching facilities of the Department of Medicine. The size of the clinic permits the presentation of a wide variety of cases, and the organization of the hospital as an integral part of the Medical Department affords exceptional facilities for thorough study of patients. THE OUT-PATIENT DEPARTMENT Commodious and well-equipped quarters for the treatment of ambulant cases are provided in the north pavilion of the hospital, and medical school building, and the service is conducted under the direct personal supervision of members of the teaching staff of the Medical Department. The character of the equipment of this department and its location in the hospital makes possible the use of thorough methods in the diagnosis and treatment of cases, and the systematic examination of each patient is thus emphasized at the very outset of the student's clinical experience. 37,681 visits were made by patients to this department during the past year. THE BLUE RIDGE SANATORIUM The Blue Ridge Sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis, which is owned by the State and controlled by the Virginia State Board of Health, is situated near the Medical School. Under a plan of coÃ¶peration agreed upon by the State Board of Health and the University, the Medical Director and other members of the staff of the Sanatorium give instruction in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis to students in the Medical School. The Sanatorium has accommodations for 270 patients. Work at the Sanatorium is part of the required course. This affiliation of the Sanatorium and the Medical School offers an opportunity almost ideal for the medical student to become thoroughly familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of this most important disease. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HOSPITAL TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES A training school for nurses is conducted in connection with the hospital.
