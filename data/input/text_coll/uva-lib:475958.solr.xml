      <field name="fulltext">OMAR KHAYYAM: THE ASTRONOMER-POET OF PERSIA OMAR KHAYYÁM was born at Naishápúr in Khorassán in the latter half of our Eleventh, and died within the First Quarter of our Twelfth Century. The Slender Story of his Life is curiously twined about that of two other very considerable Figures in their Time and Country: one of whom tells the Story of all Three. This was Nizám ul Mulk, Vizier to Alp Arslán the Son, and Malik Shah the Grandson, of Toghrul Beg the Tartar, who had wrested Persia from the feeble Successor of Mahmúd the Great, and founded that Seljukian Dynasty which finally roused Europe into the Crusades. This Nizám ul Mulk, in his Wasiyat — or Testament — which he wrote and left as a Memorial for future Statesmen — relates the following, as quoted in the Calcutta Review, No. 59, from Mirkhond's History of the Assassins. "'One of the greatest of the wise men of Khorassán was the Imám Mowaffak of Naishápúr, a man highly honored and reverenced, — may God rejoice his soul; his illustrious years exceeded eighty-five, and it was the universal belief that every boy who read the Koran or studied the traditions in his presence, would assuredly attain to honor and happiness. For this cause did my father send me from Tús to Naishápúr with Abd-us-samad, the doctor of law, that I might employ myself in study and learning under the guidance of that illustrious teacher. Towards me he ever turned an eye of favor and kindness, and as his pupil I felt for him extreme affection and devotion, so that I passed four years in his service. When I first came there, I found two other pupils of mine own age newly arrived, Hakim Omar Khayyám, and the ill-fated Ben Sabbáh. Both were endowed with sharpness of wit and the highest natural powers; and we three formed a close friendship together. When the Imám rose from his lectures, they used to join me, and we repeated to each other the lessons we had heard. Now Omar was a native of Naishápúr, while Hasan Ben Sabbáh's father was one Ali, a man of austere life and practise, but heretical in his creed and doctrine. One day Hasan said to me and to Khayyám, "It is a universal belief that the pupils of the Imám Mowaffak will attain to fortune. Now, even if we all do not attain thereto, without doubt one of us will; what then shall be our mutual pledge and bond?" We answered, "Be it what you please." "Well," he said, "let us make a vow, that to whomsoever this fortune falls, he shall share it equally with the rest, and reserve no pre-eminence for himself." "Be it so," we both replied, and on those terms we mutually pledged our words. Years rolled on, and I went from Khorassán to Transoxiana, and wandered to Ghazni and Cabul; and when I returned, I was invested with office, and rose to be administrator of affairs during the Sultanate of Sultan Alp Arslán.' "He goes on to state, that years passed by, and both his old school-friends found him out, and came and claimed a share in his good fortune, according to the school-day vow. The Vizier was generous and kept his word. Hasan demanded a place in the government, which the Sultan granted at the Vizier's request; but discontented with a gradual rise, he plunged into the maze of intrigue of an oriental court, and, failing in a base attempt to supplant his benefactor, he was disgraced and fell. After many mishaps and wanderings, Hasan became the head of the Persian sect of the Ismailians, — a party of fanatics who had long murmured in obscurity, but rose to an evil eminence under the guidance of his strong and evil will. In A.D. 1090, he seized the castle of Alamút, in the province of Rúdbar, which lies in the mountainous tract south of the Caspian Sea; and it was from this mountain home he obtained that evil celebrity among the Crusaders as the OLD MAN OF THE MOUNTAINS, and spread terror through the Mohammedan world; and it is yet disputed where the word Assassin, which they have left in the language of modern Europe as their dark memorial, is derived from the hashish, or opiate of hemp-leaves (the Indian bhang), with which they maddened themselves to the sullen pitch of oriental desperation, or from the name of the founder of the dynasty, whom we have seen in his quiet collegiate days, at Naishápúr. One of the countless victims of the Assassin's dagger was Nizám ul Mulk himself, the old school-boy friend.[1] "Omar Khayyám also came to the Vizier to claim his share; but not to ask for title or office. 'The greatest boon you can confer on me,' he said, 'is to let me live in a corner under the shadow of your fortune, to spread wide the advantages of Science, and pray for your long life and prosperity.' The Vizier tells us, that when he found Omar was really sincere in his refusal, he pressed him no further, but granted him a yearly pension of 1200 mithkáls of gold from the treasury of Náishapúr. "At Naishápúr thus lived and died Omar Khayyám, 'busied,' adds the Vizier, 'in winning knowledge of every kind, and especially in Astronomy, wherein he attained to a very high pre-eminence. Under the Sultanate of Malik Shah, he came to Merv, and obtained great praise for his proficiency in science, and the Sultan showered favors upon him.' "When the Malik Shah determined to reform the calendar, Omar was one of the eight learned men employed to do it; the result was the Jaláli era (so called from Jalál-ud-din, one of the king's names) — 'a computation of time,' says Gibbon, 'which surpasses the Julian, and approaches the accuracy of the Gregorian style.' He is also the author of some astronomical tables, entitled 'Zíiji-Maliksháhí,' and the French have lately republished and translated an Arabic Treatise of his on Algebra. "His Takhallus or poetical name (Khayyám) signifies a Tent-maker, and he is said to have at one time exercised that trade, perhaps before Nizám-ul-Mulk's generosity raised him to independence. Many Persian poets similarly derive their names from their occupations; thus we have Attár, 'a druggist,' Assar, 'an oil presser,' etc.[2] Omar himself alludes to his name in the following whimsical lines: — "'Khayyám, who stitched the tents of science, Has fallen in grief's furnace and been suddenly burned; The shears of Fate have cut the tent ropes of his life, And the broker of Hope has sold him for nothing!' "We have only one more anecdote to give of his Life, and that relates to the close; it is told in the anonymous preface which is sometimes prefixed to his poems; it has been printed in the Persian in the Appendix to Hyde's Veterum Persarum Religio, p. 499; and D'Herbelot alludes to it in his Bibliotheque, under Khiam.[3]— "'It is written in the chronicles of the ancients that this King of the Wise, Omar Khayyám, died at Naishápúr in the year of the Hegira, 517 (A.D. 1123); in science he was unrivaled, — the very paragon of his age. Khwajah Nizámi of Samarcand, who was one of his pupils, relates the following story: "I often used to hold conversations with my teacher, Omar Khayyám, in a garden; and one day he said to me, 'My tomb shall be in a spot where the north wind may scatter roses over it.' I wondered at the words he spake, but I knew that his were no idle words.[4] Years after, when I chanced to revisit Naishápúr, I went to his final resting-place, and lo! it was just outside a garden, and trees laden with fruit stretched their boughs over the garden wall, and dropped their flowers upon his tomb, so that the stone was hidden under them."'" Thus far — without fear of Trespass — from the Calcutta Review. The writer of it, on reading in India this story of Omar's Grave, was reminded, he says, of Cicero's Account of finding Archimedes' Tomb at Syracuse, buried in grass and weeds. I think Thorwaldsen desired to have roses grow over him; a wish religiously fulfilled for him to the present day, I believe. However, to return to Omar. Though the Sultan "shower'd Favors upon him," Omar's Epicurean Audacity of Thought and Speech caused him to be regarded askance in his own Time and Country. He is said to have been especially hated and dreaded by the Súfis, whose Practise he ridiculed, and whose Faith amounts to little more than his own, when stript of the Mysticism and formal recognition of Islamism under which Omar would not hide. Their Poets, including Háfiz, who are (with the exception of Firdausi) the most considerable in Persia, borrowed largely, indeed, of Omar's material, but turning it to a mystical Use more convenient to Themselves and the People they addressed; a People quite as quick of Doubt as of Belief; as keen of Bodily sense as of Intellectual; and delighting in a cloudy composition of both, in which they could float luxuriously between Heaven and Earth, and this World and the Next, on the wings of a poetical expression, that might serve indifferently for either. Omar was too honest of Heart as well of Head for this. Having failed (however mistakenly) of finding any Providence but Destiny, and any World but This, he set about making the most of it; preferring rather to soothe the Soul through the Senses into Acquiescence with Things as he saw them, than to perplex it with vain disquietude after what they might be. It has been seen, however, that his Worldly Ambition was not exorbitant; and he very likely takes a humorous or perverse pleasure in exalting the gratification of Sense above that of the Intellect, in which he must have taken great delight, although it failed to answer the Questions in which he, in common with all men, was most vitally interested. For whatever Reason, however, Omar as before said, has never been popular in his own Country, and therefore has been but scantily transmitted abroad. The MSS. of his Poems, mutilated beyond the average Casualties of Oriental Transcription, are so rare in the East as scarce to have reacht Westward at all, in spite of all the acquisitions of Arms and Science. There is no copy at the India House, none at the Bibliotheque Nationale of Paris. We know but of one in England: No. 140 of the Ouseley MSS. at the Bodleian, written at Shiráz, A.D. 1460. This contains but 158 Rubáiyát. One in the Asiatic Society's Library at Calcutta (of which we have a Copy), contains (and yet incomplete) 516, though swelled to that by all kinds of Repetition and Corruption. So Von Hammer speaks of his Copy as containing about 200, while Dr. Sprenger catalogues the Lucknow MS. at double that number.[5] The Scribes, too, of the Oxford and Calcutta MSS. seem to do their Work under a sort of Protest; each beginning with a Tetrastich (whether genuine or not), taken out of its alphabetical order; the Oxford with one of Apology; the Calcutta with one of Expostulation, supposed (says a Notice prefixed to the MS.) to have arisen from a Dream, in which Omar's mother asked about his future fate. It may be rendered thus: — "O Thou who burn'st in Heart for those who burn In Hell, whose fires thyself shall feed in turn, How long be crying, 'Mercy on them, God!' Why, who art Thou to teach, and He to learn?" The Bodeleian Quatrain pleads Pantheism by way of Justification. "If I myself upon a looser Creed Have loosely strung the Jewel of Good deed, Let this one thing for my Atonement plead: That One for Two I never did misread." The Reviewer,6 to whom I owe the Particulars of Omar's Life, concludes his Review by comparing him with Lucretius, both as to natural Temper and Genius, and as acted upon by the Circumstances in which he lived. Both indeed were men of subtle, strong, and cultivated Intellect, fine Imagination, and Hearts passionate for Truth and Justice; who justly revolted from their Country's false Religion, and false, or foolish, Devotion to it; but who fell short of replacing what they subverted by such better Hope as others, with no better Revelation to guide them, had yet made a Law to themselves. Lucretius indeed, with such material as Epicurus furnished, satisfied himself with the theory of a vast machine fortuitously constructed, and acting by a Law that implied no Legislator; and so composing himself into a Stoical rather than Epicurean severity of Attitude, sat down to contemplate the mechanical drama of the Universe which he was part Actor in; himself and all about him (as in his own sublime description of the Roman Theater) discolored with the lurid reflex of the Curtain suspended between the Spectator and the Sun. Omar, more desperate, or more careless of any so complicated System as resulted in nothing but hopeless Necessity, flung his own Genius and Learning with a bitter or humorous jest into the general Ruin which their insufficient glimpses only served to reveal; and, pretending sensual pleasure, as the serious purpose of Life, only diverted himself with speculative problems of Deity, Destiny, Matter and Spirit, Good and Evil, and other such questions, easier to start than to run down, and the pursuit of which becomes a very weary sport at last! With regard to the present Translation. The original Rubáiyát (as, missing an Arabic Guttural, these Tetrastichs are more musically called) are independent Stanzas, consist ing each of four Lines of equal, though varied, Prosody; sometimes all rhyming, but oftener (as here imitated) the third line a blank. Somewhat as in the Greek Alcaic, where the penultimate line seems to lift and suspend the Wave that falls over in the last. As usual with such kind of Oriental Verse, the Rubáiyát follow one another according to Alphabetic Rhyme — a strange succession of Grave and Gay. Those here selected are strung into something of an Eclogue, with perhaps a less than equal proportion of the "Drink and make-merry," which (genuine or not) recurs over-frequently in the Original. Either way, the Result is sad enough: saddest perhaps when most ostentatiously merry: more apt to move Sorrow than Anger toward the old Tentmaker, who, after vainly endeavoring to unshackle his Steps from Destiny, and to catch some authentic Glimpse of TO-MORROW, fell back upon TO-DAY (which has outlasted so many To-morrows!) as the only Ground he had got to stand upon, however momentarily slipping from under his Feet. EDWARD J. FITZGERALD</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[1] Some of Omar's Rubáiyát warn us of the danger of Greatness, the instability of Fortune, and while advocating Charity to all Men, recommending us to be too intimate with none. Attár makes Nizám-ul-Mulk use the very words of his friend Omar [Rub. xxviii.], "When Nizám-ul-Mulk was in the Agony (of Death) he said, 'Oh God! I am passing away in the hand of the wind.'" [2] Though all these, like our Smiths, Archers, Millers, Fletchers, etc., may simply retain the Surname of an hereditary calling. [3] "Philosophe Musulman qui a ve?u en Odeur de Sainteté dans sa Religion, vers la Fin du premier et le Commencement du second Siecle," no part of which, except the "Philosophe," can apply to our Khayyám. [4] The Rashness of the Words, according to D'Herbelot, consisted in being so opposed to those in the Koran: "No Man knows where he shall die." — This story of Omar reminds me of another so naturally — and when one remembers how wide of his humble mark the noble sailor aimed — so pathetically told by Captain Cook — not by Doctor Hawkworth — in his Second Voyage (1. 374). When leaving Ulietea, "Oreo's last request was for me to return. When he saw he could not obtain that promise, he asked the name of my Marai (burying-place). As strange a question as this was, I hesitated not a moment to tell him 'Stepney'; the parish in which I live when in London. I was made to repeat it several times over till they could pronounce it; and then 'Stepney Marai no Toote' was echoed through an hundred mouths at once. I afterwards found the same question had been put to Mr. Forster by a man on shore; but he gave a different, and indeed more proper answer, by saying, 'No man who used the sea could say where he should be buried.'" [5] "Since this paper was written" (adds the Reviewer in a note), "we have met with a Copy of a very rare Edition, printed at Calcutta in 1836. This contains 438 Tetrastichs, with an Appendix containing 54 others not found in some MSS." [6] Professor Cowell.</field>

Wine!Red Wine!" — the Nightingale cries to the RoseThat yellow Cheek of hers to'incarnadine.VII Come, fill the Cup, and in the Fire of SpringThe Winter Garment of Repentance fling:The Bird of Time has but a little wayTo fly — and Lo! the Bird is on the Wing.VIII And look — a thousand Blossoms with the DayWoke — and a thousand scatter'd into Clay:And this first Summer Month that brings the RoseShall take Jamshýd and Kaikobád away.IX But come with old Khayyám, and leave the LotOf Kaikobád and Kaikhosrú forgot:Let Rustum lay about him as he will,Or Hátim Tai cry Supper — heed them not.X With me along some Strip of Herbage strownThat just divides the desert from the sown,Where name of Slave and Sultán scarce is knownAnd pity Sultán Máhmúd on his Throne.XI Here with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough,A Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse — and ThouBeside me singing in the Wilderness —And Wilderness is Paradise enow.XII "How sweet is mortal Sovranty!" — think some: Others — "How blest the Paradise to come!"Ah, take the Cash in hand and waive the Rest;Oh, the brave Music of a distant Drum!XIII Look to the Rose that blows about us — "Lo,Laughing," she says, "into the World I blow:At once the silken Tassel of my PurseTear, and its Treasure on the Garden throw."XIV The Worldly Hope men set their Hearts uponTurns Ashes — or it prospers; and anon,Like Snow upon the Desert's dusty FaceLighting a little Hour or two — is gone.XV And those who husbanded the Golden Grain,And those who flung it to the Winds like Rain,Alike to no such aureate Earth are turn'dAs, buried once, Men want dug up again.XVI Think, in this batter'd CaravanseraiWhose Doorways are alternate Night and Day,How Sultán after Sultán with his PompAbode his Hour or two, and went his way.XVII They say the Lion and the Lizard keepThe Courts where Jamshýd gloried and drank deep:And Bahrám, that great Hunter — the Wild AssStamps o'er his Head, and he lies fast asleep.XVIII I sometimes think that never blows so redThe Rose as where some buried Caesar bled;That every Hyacinth the Garden wearsDropt in its Lap from some once lovely Head.XIX And this delightful Herb whose tender GreenFledges the River's Lip on which we lean —Ah, lean upon it lightly! for who knowsFrom what once lovely Lip it springs unseen!XX Ah! my Beloved, fill the Cup that clearsTO-DAY of past Regrets and future Fears —To-morrow? — Why, To-morrow I may beMyself with Yesterday's Sev'n Thousand Years.XXI Lo! some we loved, the loveliest and the bestThat Time and Fate of all their Vintage prest,Have drunk their Cup a Round or two before,And one by one crept silently to Rest.XXII And we, that now make merry in the RoomThey left, and Summer dresses in new Bloom,Ourselves must we beneath the Couch of EarthDescend, ourselves to make a Couch — for whom?XXIII Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend,Before we too into the Dust Descend;Dust into Dust, and under Dust, to lie,Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer and — sans End!XXIV Alike for those who for TO-DAY prepare,And those that after a TO-MORROW stare,A Muezzín from the Tower of Darknesscries "Fools! your Reward is neither Here nor There."XXV Why, all the Saints and Sages who discuss'dOf the Two Worlds so learnedly, are thrustLike foolish Prophets forth; their Words to ScornAre scatter'd, and their Mouths are stopt with Dust.XXVI Oh, come with old Khayyám, and leave the WiseTo talk; one thing is certain, that Life flies;One thing is certain, and the Rest is Lies;The Flower that once has blown for ever dies.XXVII Myself when young did eagerly frequentDoctor and Saint, and heard great ArgumentAbout it and about: but evermoreCame out by the same Door as in I went.XXVIII With them the Seed of Wisdom did I sow,And with my own hand labour'd it to grow:And this was all the Harvest that I reap'd —"I came like Water, and like Wind I go."XXIX Into this Universe, and why not knowing,Nor whence, like Water willy-nilly flowing:And out of it, as Wind along the Waste,I know not whither, willy-nilly blowing.XXX What, without asking, hither hurried whence?And, without asking, whither hurried hence!Another and another Cup to drownThe Memory of this Impertinence!XXXI Up from Earth's Centre through the seventh GateI rose, and on the Throne of Saturn sate,And many Knots unravel'd by the Road;But not the Knot of Human Death and Fate.XXXII There was a Door to which I found no Key:There was a Veil past which I could not see:Some little Talk awhile of ME and THEEThere seemed — and then no more of THEE and ME.XXXIII Then to the rolling Heav'n itself I cried,Asking, "What Lamp had Destiny to guideHer little Children stumbling in the Dark?"And — "A blind understanding!" Heav'n replied.XXXIV Then to this earthen Bowl did I adjournMy Lip the secret Well of Life to learn:And Lip to Lip it murmur'd — "While you live,Drink! — for once dead you never shall return."XXXV I think the Vessel, that with fugitiveArticulation answer'd, once did live,And merry-make; and the cold Lip I kiss'dHow many Kisses might it take — and give.XXXVI For in the Market-place, one Dusk of Day,I watch'd the Potter thumping his wet Clay:And with its all obliterated TongueIt murmur'd — "Gently, Brother, gently, pray!"XXXVII Ah, fill the Cup: — what boots it to repeatHow Time is slipping underneath our Feet:Unborn TO-MORROW and dead YESTERDAY,Why fret about them if TO-DAY be sweet!XXXVIII One Moment in Annihilation's Waste,One moment, of the Well of Life to taste —The Stars are setting, and the CaravanStarts for the dawn of Nothing — Oh, make haste!XXXIX How long, how long, in infinite PursuitOf This and That endeavour and dispute?Better be merry with the fruitful GrapeThan sadden after none, or bitter, Fruit.XL You know, my Friends, how long since in my HouseFor a new Marriage I did make Carouse:Divorced old barren Reason from my Bed,And took the Daughter of the Vine to Spouse.XLI For "Is" and "Is-NOT" though withRule and Line,And, "UP-AND-DOWN" without, I could define,I yet in all I only cared to know,Was never deep in anything but — Wine.XLII And lately, by the Tavern Door agape,Came stealing through the Dusk an Angel Shape,Bearing a vessel on his Shoulder; andHe bid me taste of it; and 'twas — the Grape!XLIII The Grape that can with Logic absoluteThe Two-and-Seventy jarring Sects confute:The subtle Alchemist that in a TriceLife's leaden Metal into Gold transmute.XLIV The mighty Mahmúd, the victorious Lord,That all the misbelieving and black HordeOf Fears and Sorrows that infest the SoulScatters and slays with his enchanted Sword.XLV But leave the Wise to wrangle, and with meThe Quarrel of the Universe let be:And, in some corner of the Hubbub coucht,Make Game of that which makes as much of Thee.XLVI For in and out, above, about, below,'Tis nothing but a Magic Shadow-show,Play'd in a Box whose Candle is the Sun,Round which we Phantom Figures come and go.XLVII And if the Wine you drink, the Lip you press,End in the Nothing all Things end in — Yes —Then fancy while Thou art, Thou art but whatThou shalt be — Nothing — Thou shalt not be less.XLVIII While the Rose blows along the River Brink,With old Khayyám the Ruby Vintage drink:And when the Angel with his darker DraughtDraws up to thee — take that, and do not shrink.XLVIX 'Tis all a Chequer-board of Nights and Days Where Destiny with Men for Pieces plays:Hither and thither moves, and mates, and slays,And one by one back in the Closet lays.L The Ball no Question makes of Ayes and Noes,But Right or Left as strikes the Player goes;And He that toss'd Thee down into the Field,He knows about it all — HE knows — HE knows!LI The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor WitShall lure it back to cancel half a Line,Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.LII And that inverted Bowl we call The Sky,Whereunder crawling coop't we live and die,Lift not thy hands to It for help — for ItRolls impotently on as Thou or I.LIII With Earth's first Clay They did the Last Man's knead,And then of the Last Harvest sow'd the Seed:Yea, the first Morning of Creation wroteWhat the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read.LIV I tell Thee this — When, starting from the Goal,Over the shoulders of the flaming FoalOf Heav'n Parwín and Mushtarí they flung,In my predestin'd Plot of Dust and SoulLV The Vine had struck a Fibre; which aboutIt clings my Being — let the Súfi flout;Of my Base Metal may be filed a Key,That shall unlock the Door he howls without.LVI And this I know: whether the one True Light,Kindle to Love, or Wrath consume me quite,One Glimpse of It within the Tavern caughtBetter than in the Temple lost outright.LVII Oh Thou who didst with Pitfall and with GinBeset the Road I was to wander in,Thou wilt not with Predestination roundEnmesh me, and impute my Fall to Sin?LVIII Oh Thou, who Man of baser Earth didst make,And who with Eden didst devise the Snake;For all the Sin wherewith the Face of ManIs blacken'd, Man's Forgiveness give — and take!* * * * *LIX KUZA — NÁMA Listen again. One Evening at the CloseOf Ramazán, ere the better Moon arose,In that old Potter's Shop I stood aloneWith the clay Population round in Rows.LX And strange to tell, among that Earthen LotSome could articulate, while others not:And suddenly one more impatient cried —"Who is the Potter, pray, and who the Pot?"LXI Then said another — "Surely not in vainMy substance from the common Earth was ta'en,That He who subtly wrought me into ShapeShould stamp me back to common Earth again."LXII Another said — "Why, ne'er a peevish BoyWould break the Bowl from which he drank in Joy;Shall He that made the Vessel in pure LoveAnd Fansy, in an after Rage destroy!"LXIII None answer'd this; but after Silence spakeA Vessel of a more ungainly Make:"They sneer at me for leaning all awry;What? did the Hand then of the Potter shake?"LXIV Said one — "Folks of a surly Tapster tell,And daub his Visage with the Smoke of Hell;They talk of some strict Testing of us — Pish!He's a Good Fellow, and 'twill all be well."LXV Then said another with a long-drawn Sigh,"My Clay with long oblivion is gone dry:But, fill me with the old familiar Juice,Methinks I might recover by-and-bye!"LXVI So, while the Vessels one by one were speaking,One spied the little Crescent all were seeking:And then they jogg'd each other, "Brother! Brother!Hark to the Porter's Shoulder-knot a-creaking!"* * * * *LXVII Ah, with the Grape my fading Life provide,And wash my Body whence the life has died,And in a Windingsheet of Vineleaf wrapt,So bury me by some sweet Gardenside.LXVIII That ev'n my buried Ashes such a SnareOf Perfume shall fling up into the Air,As not a True Believer passing byBut shall be overtaken unaware.LXIX Indeed, the Idols I have loved so longHave done my Credit in Men's Eye much wrong:Have drown'd my Honour in a shallow Cup,And sold my Reputation for a Song.LXX Indeed, indeed, Repentance oft beforeI swore — but was I sober when I swore?And then and then came Spring, and Rose-in handMy thread-bare Penitence a-pieces tore.LXXI And much as Wine has play'd the Infidel,And robb'd me of my Robe of Honour — well,I often wonder what the Vintners buyOne half so precious as the Goods they sell.LXXII Alas, that Spring should vanish with the Rose!That Youth's sweet-scented Manuscript should close!The Nightingale that in the Branches sang,Ah, whence, and whither flown again, who knows?LXXIII Ah, Love! could thou and I with Fate conspireTo grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,Would not we shatter it to bits — and thenRe-mould it nearer to the Heart's Desire!LXXIV Ah, Moon of my Delight who know'st no wane,The Moon of Heav'n is rising once again:How oft hereafter rising shall she lookThrough this same Garden after me — in vain!LXXV And when Thyself with shining Foot shall passAmong the Guests Star-scatter'd on The Grass,And in Thy joyous Errand reach the SpotWhere I made one — turn down an empty Glass!

      <field name="fulltext">RUBÁIYÁT OF OMAR KHAYYÁM: FIFTH EDITION I. WAKE! For the Sun, who scatter'd into flightThe Stars before him from the Field of Night,Drives Night along with them from Heav'n, and strikesThe Sultán's Turret with a Shaft of Light.II. Before the phantom of False morning died,Methought a Voice within the Tavern cried,"When all the Temple is prepared within,"Why nods the drowsy Worshiper outside?"III. And, as the Cock crew, those who stood beforeThe Tavern shouted — "Open then the Door!"You know how little while we have to stay,And, once departed, may return no more."IV. Now the New Year reviving old Desires,The thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires,Where the WHITE HAND OF MOSES on the BoughPuts out, and Jesus from the Ground suspires.V. Irám indeed is gone with all his Rose,And Jamshýd's Sev'n-ring'd Cup where no one knows;But still a Ruby kindles in the Vine,And many a Garden by the Water blows.VI. And David's lips are lockt; but in divineHigh-piping Pehleví, with "Wine! Wine! Wine!"Red Wine!" — the Nightingale cries to the RoseThat sallow cheek of hers to' incarnadine.VII. Come, fill the Cup, and in the fire of SpringYour Winter garment of Repentance fling:The Bird of Time has but a little wayTo flutter — and the Bird is on the Wing.VIII. Whether at Naishápúr or Babylon,Whether the Cup with sweet or bitter run,The Wine of Life keeps oozing drop by drop,The Leaves of Life keep falling one by one.IX. Each Morn a thousand Roses brings, you say:Yes, but where leaves the Rose of Yesterday?And this first Summer month that brings the RoseShall take Jamshýd and Kaikobád away.X. Well, let it take them! What have we to doWith Kaikobád the Great, or Kaikhosrú?Let Zál and Rustum bluster as they will,Or Hátim call to Supper — heed not you.XI. With me along the strip of Herbage strownThat just divides the desert from the sown,Where name of Slave and Sultán is forgot —And Peace to Mahmúd on his golden Throne!XII. A Book of Verses underneath the Bough,A Jug of Wine, a Loaf of Bread — and ThouBeside me singing in the Wilderness —Oh, Wilderness were Paradise enow!XIII. Some for the Glories of This World; and someSigh for the Prophet's Paradise to come;Ah, take the Cash, and let the Credit go,Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum!XIV. Look to the blowing Rose about us — "Lo,Laughing," she says, "into the world I blow,At once the silken tassel of my PurseTear, and its Treasure on the Garden throw."XV. And those who husbanded the Golden grain,And those who flung it to the winds like Rain,Alike to no such aureate Earth are turn'dAs, buried once, Men want dug up again.XVI. The Worldly Hope men set their Hearts uponTurns Ashes — or it prospers; and anon,Like Snow upon the Desert's dusty Face,Lighting a little hour or two — is gone.XVII. Think, in this batter'd CaravanseraiWhose Portals are alternate Night and Day,How Sultán after Sultán with his PompAbode his destined Hour, and went his way.XVIII. They say the Lion and the Lizard keepThe courts where Jamshýd gloried and drank deep:And Bahrám, that great Hunter — the Wild AssStamps o'er his Head, but cannot break his Sleep.XIX. I sometimes think that never blows so redThe Rose as where some buried Caesar bled;That every Hyacinth the Garden wearsDropt in her Lap from some once lovely Head.XX. And this reviving Herb whose tender GreenFledges the River-Lip on which we lean —Ah, lean upon it lightly! for who knows&gt;From what once lovely Lip it springs unseen!XXI. Ah, my Beloved, fill the Cup that clearsTO-DAY of past Regrets and future Fears:To-morrow — Why, To-morrow I may beMyself with Yesterday's Sev'n thousand Years.XXII. For some we loved, the loveliest and the bestThat from his Vintage rolling Time hath prest,Have drunk their Cup a Round or two before,And one by one crept silently to rest.XXIII. And we, that now make merry in the RoomThey left, and Summer dresses in new bloom,Ourselves must we beneath the Couch of EarthDescend — ourselves to make a Couch — for whom?XXIV. Ah, make the most of what we yet may spend,Before we too into the Dust descend;Dust into Dust, and under Dust to lie,Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Singer, and — sans End!XXV. Alike for those who for TO-DAY prepare,And those that after some TO-MORROW stare,A Muezzín from the Tower of Darkness cries,"Fools! your Reward is neither Here nor There."XXVI. Why, all the Saints and Sages who discuss'dOf the Two Worlds so wisely — they are thrustLike foolish Prophets forth; their Words to ScornAre scatter'd, and their Mouths are stopt with Dust.XXVII. Myself when young did eagerly frequentDoctor and Saint, and heard great argumentAbout it and about: but evermoreCame out by the same door where in I went.XXVIII. With them the seed of Wisdom did I sow,And with mine own hand wrought to make it grow;And this was all the Harvest that I reap'd —"I came like Water, and like Wind I go."XXIX. Into this Universe, and Why not knowingNor Whence, like Water willy-nilly flowing;And out of it, as Wind along the Waste,I know not Whither, willy-nilly blowing.XXX. What, without asking, hither hurried Whence?And, without asking, Whither hurried hence!Oh, many a Cup of this forbidden WineMust drown the memory of that insolence!XXXI. Up from Earth's Center through the Seventh GateI rose, and on the Throne of Saturn sate,And many a Knot unravel'd by the Road;But not the Master-knot of Human Fate.XXXII. There was the Door to which I found no Key;There was the Veil through which I might not see:Some little talk awhile of ME and THEEThere was — and then no more of THEE and ME.XXXIII. Earth could not answer; nor the Seas that mournIn flowing Purple, of their Lord Forlorn;Nor rolling Heaven, with all his Signs reveal'dAnd hidden by the sleeve of Night and Morn.XXXIV. Then of the THEE IN ME who works behindThe Veil, I lifted up my hands to findA lamp amid the Darkness; and I heard,As from Without — "THE ME WITHIN THEE BLIND!"XXXV. Then to the Lip of this poor earthen UrnI lean'd, the Secret of my Life to learn:And Lip to Lip it murmur'd — "While you live,"Drink! — for, once dead, you never shall return."XXXVI. I think the Vessel, that with fugitiveArticulation answer'd, once did live,And drink; and Ah! the passive Lip I kiss'd,How many Kisses might it take — and give!XXXVII. For I remember stopping by the wayTo watch a Potter thumping his wet Clay:And with its all-obliterated TongueIt murmur'd — "Gently, Brother, gently, pray!"XXXVIII. And has not such a Story from of OldDown Man's successive generations roll'dOf such a clod of saturated EarthCast by the Maker into Human mold?XXXIX. And not a drop that from our Cups we throwFor Earth to drink of, but may steal belowTo quench the fire of Anguish in some EyeThere hidden — far beneath, and long ago.XL. As then the Tulip for her morning supOf Heav'nly Vintage from the soil looks up,Do you devoutly do the like, till Heav'nTo Earth invert you — like an empty Cup.XLI. Perplext no more with Human or Divine,To-morrow's tangle to the winds resign,And lose your fingers in the tresses ofThe Cypress-slender Minister of Wine.XLII. And if the Wine you drink, the Lip you press,End in what All begins and ends in — YES;Think then you are TO-DAY what YESTERDAYYou were — TO-MORROW you shall not be less.XLIII. So when that Angel of the darker DrinkAt last shall find you by the river-brink,And, offering his Cup, invite your SoulForth to you Lips to quaff — you shall not shrink.XLIV. Why, if the Soul can fling the Dust aside,And naked on the Air of Heaven ride,Were't not a Shame — were't not a Shame for himIn this clay carcass crippled to abide?XLV. 'Tis but a Tent where takes his one day's restA Sultán to the realm of Death addrest;The Sultán rises, and the dark FerrashStrikes, and prepares it for another Guest.XLVI. And fear not lest Existence closing yourAccount, and mine, should know the like no more;The Eternal Sákí from that Bowl has pour'dMillions of Bubbles like us, and will pour. XLVII. When You and I behind the Veil are past,Oh, but the long, long while the World shall last,Which of our Coming and Departure heedsAs the Sea's self should heed a pebble-cast.XLVIII. A Moment's Halt — a momentary tasteOf BEING from the Well amid the Waste —And Lo! — the phantom Caravan has reach'dThe NOTHING it set out from — Oh, make haste!XLIX. Would you that spangle of Existence spendAbout THE SECRET — quick about it, Friend!A Hair perhaps divides the False from True —And upon what, prithee, may life depend?L. A Hair perhaps divides the False and True;Yes; and a single Alif were the clue —Could you but find it — to the Treasure-house,And peradventure to THE MASTER too;LI. Whose secret Presence through Creation's veinsRunning Quicksilver-like eludes your pains;Taking all shapes from Máh to Máhi andThey change and perish all — but He remains;LII. A moment guessed — then back behind the FoldImmerst of Darkness round the Drama roll'dWhich, for the Pastime of Eternity,He doth Himself contrive, enact, behold.LIII. But if in vain, down on the stubborn floorOf Earth, and up to Heav'n's unopening Door,You gaze TO-DAY, while You are You — how thenTO-MORROW, when You shall be You no more?LIV. Waste not your Hour, nor in the vain pursuitOf This and That endeavor and dispute;Better be jocund with the fruitful GrapeThan sadden after none, or bitter, Fruit.LV. You know, my Friends, with what a brave CarouseI made a Second Marriage in my house;Divorced old barren Reason from my Bed,And took the Daughter of the Vine to Spouse.LVI. For "Is" and "Is-not" though with Rule and LineAnd "UP-AND-DOWN" by Logic I define,Of all that one should care to fathom, IWas never deep in anything but — Wine.LVII. Ah, by my Computations, People say,Reduce the Year to better reckoning? — Nay,'Twas only striking from the CalendarUnborn To-morrow and dead Yesterday.LVIII. And lately, by the Tavern Door agape,Came shining through the Dusk an Angel ShapeBearing a Vessel on his Shoulder; andHe bid me taste of it; and 'twas — the Grape!LIX. The Grape that can with Logic absoluteThe Two-and-Seventy jarring Sects confute:The sovereign Alchemist that in a triceLife's leaden metal into Gold transmute;LX. The mighty Mahmúd, Allah-breathing Lord,That all the misbelieving and black HordeOf Fears and Sorrows that infest the SoulScatters before him with his whirlwind Sword.LXI. Why, be this Juice the growth of God, who dareBlaspheme the twisted tendril as a Snare?A Blessing, we should use it, should we not?And if a Curse — why, then, Who set it there?LXII. I must abjure the Balm of Life, I must,Scared by some After-reckoning ta'en on trust,Or lured with Hope of some Diviner Drink,To fill the Cup — when crumbled into Dust!LXIII. Of threats of Hell and Hopes of Paradise!One thing at least is certain — This Life flies;One thing is certain and the rest is Lies;The Flower that once has blown for ever dies.LXIV. Strange, is it not? that of the myriads whoBefore us pass'd the door of Darkness through,Not one returns to tell us of the Road,Which to discover we must travel too.LXV. The Revelations of Devout and Learn'dWho rose before us, and as Prophets burn'd,Are all but Stories, which, awoke from SleepThey told their comrades, and to Sleep return'd.LXVI. I sent my Soul through the Invisible,Some letter of that After-life to spell:And by and by my Soul return'd to me,And answer'd "I Myself am Heav'n and Hell:"LXVII. Heav'n but the Vision of fulfill'd Desire,And Hell the Shadow from a Soul on fire,Cast on the Darkness into which Ourselves,So late emerged from, shall so soon expire.LXVIII. We are no other than a moving rowOf Magic Shadow-shapes that come and goRound with the Sun-illumined Lantern heldIn Midnight by the Master of the Show;LXIX. But helpless Pieces of the Game He playsUpon this Chequer-board of Nights and Days;Hither and thither moves, and checks, and slays,And one by one back in the Closet lays.LXX. The Ball no question makes of Ayes and Noes,But Here or There as strikes the Player goes;And He that toss'd you down into the Field,He knows about it all — HE knows — HE knows!LXXI. The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,Moves on: nor all your Piety nor WitShall lure it back to cancel half a Line,Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.LXXII. And that inverted Bowl they call the Sky,Whereunder crawling coop'd we live and die,Lift not your hands to It for help — for ItAs impotently moves as you or I.LXXIII. With Earth's first Clay They did the Last Man knead,And there of the Last Harvest sow'd the Seed:And the first Morning of Creation wroteWhat the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read.LXXIV. YESTERDAY This Day's Madness did prepare;TO-MORROW's Silence, Triumph, or Despair:Drink! for you not know whence you came, nor why:Drink! for you know not why you go nor where.LXXV. I tell you this — When, started from the Goal,Over the flaming shoulders of the FoalOf Heav'n Parwín and Mushtarí they flung,In my predestined Plot of Dust and Soul.LXXVI. The Vine had struck a fiber: which aboutIt clings my Being — let the Dervish flout;Of my Base metal may be filed a KeyThat shall unlock the Door he howls without.LXXVII. And this I know: whether the one True LightKindle to Love, or Wrath consume me quite,One Flash of It within the Tavern caughtBetter than in the Temple lost outright.LXXVIII. What! out of senseless Nothing to provokeA conscious Something to resent the yokeOf unpermitted Pleasure, under painOf Everlasting Penalties, if broke!LXXIX. What! from his helpless Creature be repaidPure Gold for what he lent him dross-allay'd —Sue for a Debt he never did contract,And cannot answer — Oh the sorry trade!LXXX. Oh Thou, who didst with pitfall and with ginBeset the Road I was to wander in,Thou wilt not with Predestined Evil roundEnmesh, and then impute my Fall to Sin!LXXXI. Oh Thou, who Man of baser Earth didst make,And ev'n with Paradise devise the Snake:For all the Sin wherewith the Face of ManIs blacken'd — Man's forgiveness give — and take!* * * * * *LXXXII. As under cover of departing DaySlunk hunger-stricken Ramazán away,Once more within the Potter's house aloneI stood, surrounded by the Shapes of Clay.LXXXIII. Shapes of all Sorts and Sizes, great and small,That stood along the floor and by the wall;And some loquacious Vessels were; and someListen'd perhaps, but never talk'd at all.LXXXIV. Said one among them — "Surely not in vainMy substance of the common Earth was ta'enAnd to this Figure molded, to be broke,Or trampled back to shapeless Earth again."LXXXV. Then said a Second — "Ne'er a peevish BoyWould break the Bowl from which he drank in joy;And He that with his hand the Vessel madeWill surely not in after Wrath destroy."LXXXVI. After a momentary silence spakeSome Vessel of a more ungainly Make;"They sneer at me for leaning all awry:What! did the Hand then of the Potter shake?"LXXXVII. Whereat some one of the loquacious Lot —I think a Súfi pipkin — waxing hot —"All this of Pot and Potter — Tell me then,Who is the Potter, pray, and who the Pot?"LXXXVIII. "Why," said another, "Some there are who tellOf one who threatens he will toss to HellThe luckless Pots he marr'd in making — Pish!He's a Good Fellow, and 'twill all be well."LXXXIX. "Well," murmured one, "Let whoso make or buy,My Clay with long Oblivion is gone dry:But fill me with the old familiar Juice,Methinks I might recover by and by."XC. So while the Vessels one by one were speaking,The little Moon look'd in that all were seeking:And then they jogg'd each other, "Brother! Brother!Now for the Porter's shoulders' knot a-creaking!"* * * * * *XCI. Ah, with the Grape my fading life provide,And wash the Body whence the Life has died,And lay me, shrouded in the living Leaf,By some not unfrequented Garden-side.XCII. That ev'n buried Ashes such a snareOf Vintage shall fling up into the AirAs not a True-believer passing byBut shall be overtaken unaware.XCIII. Indeed the Idols I have loved so longHave done my credit in this World much wrong:Have drown'd my Glory in a shallow Cup,And sold my reputation for a Song.XCIV. Indeed, indeed, Repentance oft beforeI swore — but was I sober when I swore?And then and then came Spring, and Rose-in-handMy thread-bare Penitence apieces tore.XCV. And much as Wine has play'd the Infidel,And robb'd me of my Robe of Honor — Well,I wonder often what the Vintners buyOne half so precious as the stuff they sell.XCVI. Yet Ah, that Spring should vanish with the Rose!That Youth's sweet-scented manuscript should close!The Nightingale that in the branches sang,Ah whence, and whither flown again, who knows!XCVII. Would but the Desert of the Fountain yieldOne glimpse — if dimly, yet indeed, reveal'd,To which the fainting Traveler might spring,As springs the trampled herbage of the field!XCVIII. Would but some wingéd Angel ere too lateArrest the yet unfolded Roll of Fate,And make the stern Recorder otherwiseEnregister, or quite obliterate!XCIX. Ah Love! could you and I with Him conspireTo grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,Would not we shatter it to bits — and thenRe-mold it nearer to the Heart's Desire!* * * * * *C. Yon rising Moon that looks for us again —How oft hereafter will she wax and wane;How oft hereafter rising look for usThrough this same Garden — and for one in vain!CI. And when like her, oh Sákí, you shall passAmong the Guests Star-scatter'd on the Grass,And in your joyous errand reach the spotWhere I made One — turn down an empty Glass! TAMAM.</field>
