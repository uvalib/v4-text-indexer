      <field name="fulltext">PART I. HISTORY AND ORGANIZATION: OFFICERS AND STUDENTS: DEGREES CONFERRED. HISTORICAL SKETCH. By an act of January 12, 1803, of the Legislature of Virginia, certain citizens of Albemarle County were incorporated under the style of "Trustees of Albemarle Academy," and were empowered to take such steps as seemed practicable to raise the funds necessary for erecting buildings and putting the Academy into operation. Albemarle Academy was destined never to exist except on paper, but under the guidance of Thomas Jefferson, who was elected to the board of trustees on March 23, 1814, a process of development was begun leading first to the organization of Central College, and afterwards to that of the University of Virginia. On August 19, 1814, the committee of the trustees appointed to select a site, reported that it would be desirable to locate the Academy in the vicinity of the town of Charlottesville, distant not more than one-half mile therefrom. By an act of February 14, 1816, the Legislature authorized the establishment of "Central College, in the County of Albemarle, at the place which has been, or shall be, selected by the trustees of Albemarle Academy, and in lieu of such Academy." All rights and claims of Albemarle Academy were, by the same act, vested in Central College. The board of visitors of the college consisted of six members, of whom Jefferson was the only one who had been a member of the Academy board. The other five members were James Madison, James Monroe, Joseph Carrington Cabell, David Watson, and John H. Cocke. On May 5, 1817, Jefferson was elected Rector of the board, and, on the same day, the board authorized the purchase of a farm of about two hundred acres lying one mile west of Charlottesville as a site for the College. This tract now forms a part of the grounds of the University of Virginia. The cornerstone of Central College was laid on October 6, 1817, in the presence of Thomas Jefferson, Rector, and of James Madison and James Monroeâthe latter then President of the United States. This building, located on what is known as the West Lawn of the University, is now utilized as the Colonnade Club. Jefferson's plan was to erect a distinct building, a pavilion for each individual professorâbuildings to be arranged around a rectangular lawn. Each pavilion was to contain "a school room and apartments for the accommodation of the professor;" and one-story dormitories for the students were to be erected adjacent to the pavilions. Jefferson drew most of the sketches for the buildings with his own hands, basing them upon designs by Palladio; and his ideas HISTORICAL SKETCH. of architectural effect and grouping were carried out in detail when Central College was merged into the University of Virginia. The prime object in Jefferson's mind, while Rector of the board of visitors of Central College, was to get the college well under way, and then have it adopted by the Legislature as the State University. Accordingly, in the first report of the visitors to the Legislature, of date January 6, 1818, it is recommended that a state university be established on the site of Central College. By an act of February 21, 1818, the Legislature authorized the appointment by the Governor of a board of twenty four members, to be known as the "Board of Commissioners of the University." It was the duty of this board to meet on August 1, 1818, at the Tavern in Rockfish Gap, on the Blue Ridge Mountains, and report upon the following points regarding the organization of a state university: 1. A proper site for the projected university. 2. A plan for the building thereof. 3. The branches of learning which should be taught therein. 4. The number and description of professorships; and 5. Such general provisions as might properly be enacted by the Legislature for the better organizing and governing of the University. Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe were present at the meeting of the Commissioners, and their able and elaborate report to the Legislature (indicating much careful thought) had probably been prepared by Jefferson before the meeting was held. This report, recommending, among other things, the site of Central College as the most advantageous one for the University, was forwarded in duplicate to the Speaker of the House and the Speaker of the Senate on August 4, 1818. On January 25, 1819, the Legislature adopted a formal act "for establishing an University," and this date must be reckoned as the year of the origin of the University, although the institution was not opened to students until March 7, 1825. Although Jefferson's was the dominant spirit and the shaping hand in the whole movement for the establishment of a state university, it should be stated that but for the influence and efforts of Joseph Carrington Cabell, the close personal friend of Jefferson, the acts of February 21, 1818, and January 25, 1819, would probably have failed of adoption by the Legislature. The act of January 25, 1819, establishing the University, is as follows: "1. Be it declared by the General Assembly of Virginia, That the conveyance of the lands and other property appertaining to the Central College in the County of Albemarle, which has been executed HISTORICAL SKETCH. by the proctor thereof, under authority of the subscribers and founders, to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund, is hereby accepted, for the use and on the conditions in the said deed of conveyance expressed. "2. And be it enacted, That there shall be established, on the site provided for the said College, an University, to be called the University of Virginia; that it shall be under the government of seven visitors to be appointed forthwith by the Governor, with the advice of Council, notifying thereof the persons so appointed, and prescribing to them a day for their first meeting at the said University, with supplementary instructions for procuring a meeting subsequently, in the event of failure at the time first appointed. "3. The said visitors, or so many of them as, being a majority, shall attend, shall appoint a rector, of their own body, to preside at their meetings, and a secretary to record, attest, and preserve their proceedings, and shall proceed to examine into the state of the property conveyed as aforesaid; shall make an inventory of the same, specifying the items whereof it consists; shall notice the buildings and other improvements already made, and those which are in progress; shall take measures for their completion, and for the addition of such others, from time to time as may be necessary. "4. In the said University shall be taught the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages; French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Anglo-Saxon; the different branches of Mathematics, pure and physical; natural philosophy; the principles of agriculture; chemistry; mineralogy, including geology; botany; zoÃ¶logy; anatomy; medicine; civil government; political economy; the law of nature and nations; municipal law; history; ideology; general grammar; ethics; rhetoric; and belles lettres; which branches of science shall be so distributed, and under so many professors, not exceeding ten, as the visitors shall think proper and expedient. "5. Each professor shall be allowed the use of the apartments and accommodations provided for him, and those first employed such standing salary as the visitors shall think proper and sufficient, and their successors such standing salary, not exceeding one thousand dollars, as the visitors shall think proper and sufficient, with such tuition fees from each student, as the visitors shall from time to time establish. "6. The said visitors shall be charged with the erection, preservation, and repair of the buildings, the care of the grounds and appurtenances, and of the interests of the University generally; they shall have power to appoint a bursar, employ a proctor, and all other necessary agents; to appoint and remove professors, two-thirds of the whole number of visitors voting for the removal; to prescribe their duties and the course of education, in conformity with the law; HISTORICAL SKETCH. to establish rules for the government and discipline of the students, not contrary to the laws of the land; to regulate tuition fees, and the rent of the dormitories occupied; to prescribe and control the duties and proceedings of all officers, servants, and others, with respect to the buildings, lands, appurtenances, and other property, and interests of the University; to draw from the literary funds such monies as are by law charged on it for this institution; and, in general, to direct and do all matters and things which, not being inconsistent with the laws of the land, to them shall seem most expedient for promoting the purposes of said institution; which several functions they shall be free to exercise in the form of by-laws, resolutions, orders, instructions or otherwise, as they shall deem proper. "7. They shall have two stated meetings in every year, to-wit, on the first Mondays of April and October; and occasional meetings at such other times as they shall appoint, or on a special call, with such notice as themselves shall prescribe by a general rule; which meetings shall be at the University; a majority of them constituting a quorum for business, and on the death, resignation of a member, or failure to act for the space of one year, or on his removal out of the Commonwealth, or by the Governor, with the advice of Council, the Governor with the like advice shall appoint a successor. "8. The said rector and visitors shall be a body corporate, under the style and title of `The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia,' with the right, as such, to use a common seal; they shall have capacity to plead and be impleaded in all courts of justice, and in all cases interesting to the University, which may be subjects of legal cognizance and jurisdiction; which pleas shall not abate by the determination of their office, but shall stand revived in the name of their successors; and they shall be capable in law, and in trust for the University, of receiving subscriptions and donations, real and personal, as well as from bodies corporate or persons associated, as from private individuals. "9. And the said rector and visitors shall, at all times, conform to such laws as the legislature may, from time to time, think proper to enact for their government; and the said University shall in all things, and at all times, be subject to the control of the legislature. And the said rector and visitors of the University of Virginia shall be, and they are hereby required to make report annually to the president and directors of the literary fund (to be laid before the legislature at the next succeeding session), embracing a full account of the disbursements, the funds on hand, and a general statement of the condition of said University. "10. The said board of visitors, or a majority thereof, by nomination of the board, shall, once in every year at least, visit the said University; enquire into the proceedings and practices thereat; examine HISTORICAL SKETCH. the progress of the students, and give to those who excel in every branch of science, there taught, such honorary marks and testimonials of approbation as may encourage and incite to industry and emulation. "11. On every twenty-ninth day of February, or, if that be Sunday, then on the next, or earliest day thereafter on which a meeting can be effected, the Governor and Council shall be in session, and shall appoint visitors of the said University, either the same or others at their discretion, to serve until the twenty-ninth day of February next ensuing, duly and timely notifying to them their appointment, and prescribing a day for their first meeting at the University; after which, their meetings, stated and occasional, shall be as hereinbefore provided: Provided, that nothing in this act contained shall suspend the proceedings of the visitors of the said Central College of Albemarle; but for the purpose of expediting any objects of said institution, they shall be authorized, under the control of the Governor and Council, to continue the exercise of their functions, and fulfill those of their successors, until the first actual meeting of their said successors. "12. And be it further enacted. That the additional sum of twenty thousand dollars shall be, and the same is hereby, appropriated to the education of the poor, out of the revenue of the literary fund, in the aid of the sum heretofore appropriated to that object, and to be paid in the same manner and upon the same conditions in all respects as is prescribed by the fourth section of the act, entitled `An act appropriating part of the revenue of the literary fund, and for other purposes, passed the twenty-first day of February, eighteen hundred and eighteen.' "13. This act shall commence and be in force from and after the passing thereof." (Revised Code, 1819, ch. 34, p. 90.) The first Board of Visitors consisted of four members of the old board of Central Collegeânamely, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Joseph Carrington Cabell, and John H. Cocke; the additional appointees were James Breckenridge, Chapman Johnson, and Robert Taylor. The board met for the first time on March 29, 1819, and elected Thomas Jefferson Rector. Henceforth, until his death in 1826, Jefferson was the dominating and directing power of the University, not only evolving the entire system of education introduced, but actually devising, to the minutest detail, every feature of construction and administration. GOVERNMENT AND ORGANIZATION. The organization of the University, its government, discipline, and methods of instruction, were virtually prescribed by Jefferson alone; and in many respects they still retain the impression derived HISTORICAL SKETCH. from him. By virtue of its charter, the supreme government of the institution, under the General Assembly, is vested in the Rector and Visitors. Under the general direction of this board, and subject to its regulations, the affairs of the University were administered, for the first eighty years of its existence, by the Faculty and its Chairman, the latter being a member of the Faculty, who occupied temporarily the position of chief executive officer of the institution. As the University grew, it became more and more difficult for a member of the teaching staff to fill the position of chairman, and attend to the manifold executive duties attached to that office. In October, 1903, the Visitors decided that modern conditions rendered necessary the creation of the office of president; and in June, 1904, Edwin Anderson Alderman was elected first president of the University of Virginia. The scheme of instruction organized by Jefferson contemplated no fixed uniform curriculum of studies to be pursued by every student alike, without discrimination. Each distinct branch of knowledge was, as far as was practicable, assigned to an individual "School" with its own instructors; and the University was to consist of a collection of independent Schools. The origin of the elective system at the University of Virginia is found in the fact that students were permitted to matriculate in any School or Schools of the University for which they were prepared. The original organization consisted of eight independent Schools ânamely, Ancient Languages, Modern Languages, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Moral Philosophy, Chemistry, Medicine, and Law. The first seven Schools mentioned were opened to matriculates on March 7, 1825,âwith an aggregate attendance, during the first session, of 123 students. The School of Law was not opened until 1826. This original organization was, of course, gradually enlarged and modified. As early as 1837 the School of Medicine was elevated to a Department, consisting of three individual Schools; while in 1850 the School of Law was enlarged to a Department consisting of two Schools. Other Departments and Schools have been added from time to time, until the University organization arrived at its present condition, as described elsewhere in this catalogue. It was provided by the first Board of Visitors, in accordance with Jefferson's wishes, that but two degrees should be conferred by the University. The lower degree, characteristic of the institution for many years, was conferred upon a student who had completed all the work offered in any one School; to such a candidate the untitled degree of "Graduate" in the School in question should be given. The other, the higher degree, was to be the Doctor's HISTORICAL SKETCH. degree and was to be given to the graduate in two or more Schools who had, in addition, exhibited well developed powers of research. There is abundant evidence that, in planning the organization of the University of Virginia, Jefferson had in mind the so-called continental type of university. The first faculty were, however, with one or two exceptions, Oxford or Cambridge men. Naturally they had in mind the English type of university; the result of which was that they soon substituted (in 1831) for the Doctor's degree proposed by Jefferson, the Master's degree, common in England. The degree of "Master of Arts of the University of Virginia" was accordingly, for more than half a century, the leading degree conferred by this institution. Through the munificence of Mr. Andrew Carnegie, who donated to the General Alumni Association of the University of Virginia the sum of $500,000, upon condition that the same be held and the income therefrom be applied to the following schools and professorships: Engineering; Law; International Law; Political Science and Political Economy; English; Pathology: there were established in May, 1909, by joint action of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia and the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund, the following schools and professorships: The Andrew Carnegie School of Engineering; The James Madison School of Law; The James Monroe School of International Law; The James Wilson School of Political Economy; The Edgar Allan Poe School of English; The Walter Reed School of Pathology. As at present organized, the University comprises thirty distinct and independent Schools. The courses of instruction given in these are so coÃ¶rdinated as to form six Departments, two of which are academic, and four professional (or technical); viz: THE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS. The College, with the degrees of Bachelor of Arts; Cultural Bachelor of Science; Vocational Bachelor of Science. The Department of Graduate Studies, with the degrees of Graduate in a School; Master of Arts; Master of Science; Doctor of Philosophy. HISTORICAL SKETCH. THE PROFESSIONAL DEPARTMENTS. The Department of Law, with the degree of Bachelor of Laws. The Department of Medicine, with the degree of Doctor of Medicine. The Department of Engineering, with the degrees of Civil Engineer; Mechanical Engineer; Electrical Engineer; Mining Engineer; Chemical Engineer. The Department of Agriculture.* * Pending a reorganization of this department, the section of the catalogue treating of it is omitted for the current session. THE CORPORATION OF THE UNIVERSITY.

      <field name="fulltext">PART II. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS: ANNOUNCEMENTS AND REGULATIONS: EXPENSES: SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. For admission to the University of Virginia the general conditions are the following: 1. Sufficient Age.âThe minimum legal age is sixteen years; seventeen years or more are advised. 2. Good Character.âAs attested by a certificate from the school last attended or other valid proof. 3. Adequate Preparation.âAs shown by the certificate of an accredited school, or an equivalent examination. For admission to the College the candidate must offer fourteen units as specified below; of these three must be in English, two and one half units in Mathematics, and one in History. Candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Arts should offer in addition four units of Latin. Candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Science should offer in addition four units in two Modern Languages (French, German, Spanish). The remaining three and one-half units may be selected at will from the list given on page 73. For admission to the Department of Engineering the candidate must offer fourteen units as specified below; of these three must be in English, three and one-half units in Mathematics, one in History, and the residue selected at will. The candidate is advised to include in his preparation high school courses in Physics, Chemistry, and Physical Geography. Mechanical Drawing and Shop-Work are also recommended. For admission to the Department of Law the candidate must offer fourteen units as specified below; of these three must be in English, two and one-half units in Mathematics, one in History, and the residue selected at will. The candidate must also be at least eighteen years old. For admission to the Department of Medicine the candidate must fulfill the special requirements, set forth on page 204 of the section of the catalogue devoted to that department. The unit in the above estimates is the equivalent of the work which would consume one-fourth of the time of a student in the high school for one year. It should mean five periods of instruction a week of at least forty minutes each during at least thirty-six weeks. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. SUBJECTS ACCEPTED FOR ADMISSION. The Subjects accepted for Admission and their values in units are given in tabulated form on the opposite page. Fuller Definitions of the Units follow immediately after. The applicant for admission may enter either by certificate or by examination. For Admission by Certificate the candidate should file with the dean of the university not later than September first a Certificate of Preparation, made out on the blank form furnished by the university. This certificate must come from some recognized institution of collegiate rank or from an accredited high school, but admission by certificate from accredited public high schools in Virginia shall be extended only to graduates from four year high schools. It must bear in all cases the signature of the head of the school, must specify the character and content of each course offered for entrance credit; must give the length of time devoted to the course and the dates of the examinations; and must give the candidate's grades in percentages. Each unit in the entrance requirements is the equivalent of one full year of high school work, including five periods a week of at least forty minutes each during not less than thirty-six weeks. For schools in which the number of periods given to any study, or the length of the period, is below the standard here specified, the credit for such study will be reduced pro rata. In the scientific subjects two hours of laboratory instruction will be counted as the equivalent of one hour of recitation. High school courses in Physics and Chemistry, otherwise adequate, will be allowed half credit, when individual laboratory work is not done by the student or is not attested by proper note books filed with the certificate. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must in all cases take the entrance examinations. For Admission by Examination the candidate must present himself for test at the University of Virginia in June or in September, according to the dates given in the Programme of Entrance Examinations, page 85. The examinations are held under the honor system, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge. All candidates who take their examinations at the times appointed are tested free of charge. In case of delayed entrance, where the grounds of postponement are good, the president of the university may admit the candidate to a special examination, for which an additional fee of five dollars is charged. The fee is payable in advance and is in no case returned. Satisfactory certificates as to character and age are in all cases required. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS.

(One unit). Latin. The Latin units are construed in accordance with the following Report of the Commission on College-Entrance Requirements in Latin: I. Amount and Range of the Reading Required. 1. The Latin reading required of candidates for admission to college, without regard to the prescription of particular authors and works, shall be not less in amount than CÃ¦sar, Gallic War, I-IV; Cicero, the orations against Catiline, for the Manilian Law, and for Archias; Vergil, Aeneid, I-VI. 2. The amount of reading specified above shall be selected by the schools from the following authors and works: CÃ¦sar (Gallic War and the Civil War) and Nepos (Lives); Cicero (orations, letters, and De Senectute) and Sallust (Catiline and Jugurthine War); Vergil (Bucolics, Georgics, and Aeneid) and Ovid (Metamorphoses, Fasti, and Tristia). II. Subjects and Scope of the Examinations. 1. Translation at Sight. Candidates will be examined in translation at sight of both prose and verse. The vocabulary, constructions, and range of ideas of the passages set will be suited to the preparation secured by the reading indicated above. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. 2. Prescribed Reading. Candidates will be examined also upon the following prescribed reading: Cicero, orations for the Manilian Law and for Archias, and Vergil, Aeneid, I, II, and either IV or VI at the option of the candidate, with questions on subject-matter, literary and historical allusions, and prosody. Every paper in which passages from the prescribed reading are set for translation will contain also one or more passages for translation at sight; and candidates must deal satisfactorily with both these parts of the paper, or they will not be given credit for either part. 3. Grammar and Composition. The examinations in grammar and composition will demand thorough knowledge of all regular inflections, all common irregular forms, and the ordinary syntax and vocabulary of the prose authors read in school, with ability to use this knowledge in writing simple Latin prose. The words, constructions, and range of ideas called for in the examinations in composition will be such as are common in the reading of the year, or years, covered by the particular examination. Note. The examinations in grammar and composition may be either in separate papers or combined with other parts of the Latin examination, at the option of each individual institution; and nothing in any of the above definitions of the requirements shall be taken to prevent any college from asking questions on the grammar, prosody, or subject-matter of any of the passages set for translation, if it so desires. Suggestions Concerning Preparation. Exercises in translation at sight should begin in school with the first lessons in which Latin sentences of any length occur, and should continue throughout the course with sufficient frequency to insure correct methods of work on the part of the student. From the outset particular attention should be given to developing the ability to take in the meaning of each wordâand so, gradually, of the whole sentenceâjust as it stands; the sentence should be read and understood in the order of the original, with full appreciation of the force of each word as it comes, so far as this can be known or inferred from that which has preceded and from the form and the position of the word itself. The habit of reading in this way should be encouraged and cultivated as the best preparation for all the translating that the student has to do. No translation, however, should be a mechanical metaphrase. Nor should it be a mere loose paraphrase. The full meaning of the passage to be translated, gathered in the way described above, should finally be expressed in clear and natural English. A written examination cannot test the ear or tongue, but proper instruction in any language will necessarily include the training of both. The school work in Latin, therefore, should include much reading aloud, writing from dictation, and translation from the teacher's reading. Learning suitable passages by heart is also very useful, and should be more practised. The work in composition should give the student a better understanding of the Latin he is reading at the time, if it is prose, and greater facility in reading. It is desirable, however, that there should be systematic and regular work in composition during the time in which poetry is read as well; for this work the prose authors already studied should be used as models. In accordance with the above report, the following detailed description of the four units of Latin is given: ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. Latin A. Grammar, Composition, and Translation:âThe Roman pronunciation; habitual observance of accent and quantity; thorough mastery of the regular forms; the simple rules of word-formation and derivation; syntax of the cases, tenses, and modes; accusative and infinitive, relative and conditional sentences, indirect discourse, and the subjunctive.

A candidate may be admitted in spite of some deficiencies, provided these are not such as will impair the integrity of his academic work. But no such candidate will be conditioned except upon subjects actually taught in this university, nor will any candidate be conditioned on more than two units; and all conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the next session after initial registration. The courses taken for the removal of conditions of admission can in no case be counted as part of the work credited for any degree. SPECIAL STUDENTS. Applicants for registration who are more than twenty (20) years old, reckoning from the birthday preceding matriculation, and desire to enter for the pursuit of special elective courses, must present adequate proofs of good character and of the needful maturity and training. Such applicants may then be registered by the dean of the university as Special Students, and will be admitted without formal examination to the privileges of the university, but not as candidates for any titled degree. Such students must in all cases meet the specific entrance requirements as prescribed for the courses elected by them. Special students and conditioned students are advised and encouraged to make up their deficiencies by private study or by work in the Summer School. They will then be registered as regular students. But it is expressly ordered that no special student shall be ACCREDITED SCHOOLS. recognized as a candidate for any degree from the University of Virginia, unless he shall have completed all the entrance requirements at least one academic year before the date of his graduation. For Admission to the College with Advanced Standing from an accredited school, and for admission to any of the departments of the University with college or university credit for courses passed at another college or university, see the special regulations governing such admission on the following pages: The College, p. 168; The Department of Graduate Studies, p. 178; The Department of Law, p. 186; The Department of Medicine, p. 204; The Department of Engineering, p. 224. CONDITIONS FOR THE ACCREDITING OF SCHOOLS. A school desiring to be placed on the accredited list of the university should apply to the Chairman of the Committee on Accredited Schools. In response to the application, a blank form inquiring into the course of study, faculty, etc., of the school will be sent to the principal. Upon the return of this blank, properly filled out, a representative of the university will be sent to inspect the school. If his report is favorable and the Committee concurs, the school will be accepted and the principal duly notified. The name of the school will be entered upon the list of accredited schools and published in the catalogue of the university. No school will be placed upon the list in which the course of study covers less than four years of high school work based upon at least seven years of competent elementary instruction. Each school must offer at least sixteen units of high school instruction as defined in the entrance requirements of the University of Virginia in the current number of the catalogue (pp. 71-84). A unit consists of thirty-six weeks of instruction in one subject, in which there are five recitations of forty minutes each per week or the equivalent of one-fourth of a year's work. These sixteen units must include English A, B, and C, Mathematics A, B, C, and one unit of History, as outlined in the entrance requirements. Those schools which wish to prepare students for the study of Latin in the university must offer four units of Latin. The university will not consider any high school in which the teaching force consists of less than three teachers devoting their entire time to high school instruction. All high school teachers should possess college training and preference will be given to those schools in which the teachers are college graduates. ACCREDITED SCHOOLS. The number of daily recitation periods given by one teacher should not exceed seven. The university advises six. The number of daily recitation periods of one student should not exceed four. The quality of the instruction, the general intellectual and moral tone of the school, the efficiency of the equipment and the character of the text-books used are paramount factors, and a representative of the university must report satisfactorily upon these points before a school shall be accredited. The laboratory and library facilities should be adequate to the needs of the instruction in the subjects for which credit is asked. Each accredited school is required to report to the Committee on Accredited Schools when requested to do so. Any failure so to report will be considered cause for removal from the list. The principal is required to forward to the dean of the university upon a blank to be supplied upon request, a list of subjects in which each student entering the university from said school is properly prepared. The university reserves the right to cease to accredit at any time any school that employs inefficient teachers or fails to maintain the standard mentioned herein. High schools which do not fulfill all the requirements for a fully accredited school, but which offer four years of work and complete at least twelve units, may be partially accredited, upon those subjects which have been approved by the committee. Graduates of such schools will be credited with the twelve approved units and will be required to stand examinations upon the other units. LIST OF ACCREDITED SCHOOLS IN VIRGINIA. The following is a list of the schools within the State of Virginia at present accredited by the university. This list is revised annually by the Faculty Committee on Accredited Schools. Schools already on the list will be retained and new schools added provided they give evidence upon examination of meeting the entrance requirements stated above. Abingdon High School Abingdon, Va.

Certificates from schools outside the State of Virginia which are accredited by their own state universities, or other institutions of similar rank, may be accepted by the dean, provided the courses of instruction in such schools meet the requirements indicated in the foregoing pages. ANNOUNCEMENTS. ANNOUNCEMENTS. Charlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is a city of about 8,000 inhabitants in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake and Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The Sanitary arrangements of the university are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete; there are two athletic fields; the Fayerweather Gymnasium affords ample facilities for bathing and exercise; and in all ordinary cases of illness students receive treatment from the university physician, with skilful nursing, when necessary, in a well-equipped hospital. Faculty, Endowment, and Equipment.âThe faculty numbers ninety-five; the libraries contain more than 70,000 volumes. The university owns equipment, buildings, and grounds of an estimated value of $2,001,953; holds productive funds to amount of $1,416,766.98, and receives an annual appropriation from State of Virginia of $80,000. The annual expenditures for the session of 1911-1912 were $251,663.00. In scientific studies large facilities are offered by the Leander McCormick Observatory, the Rouss Physical Laboratory, the Chemical Laboratory and the Museum of Industrial Chemistry, the Lewis Brooks Museum, the Biological Laboratory, the Anatomical Laboratory, the Pathological Laboratory, Physiological Laboratory and the Hospital, and Dispensary. The Engineering Department possesses a well-equipped Mechanical Laboratory and Machine Shop. The Courses of Instruction are comprised in six departments, two of which are academic, and four professional. The former include the College and the Department of Graduate Studies: the latter the Departments of Law, Medicine, Engineering, and Agriculture.* * Pending a reorganization of the Department of Agriculture, no courses in that department are offered for the session of 1913-1914. In the various departments there are altogether thirty-four distinct schools, each affording an independent course, under the direction ANNOUNCEMENTS. of professors who are responsible for the systems and methods pursued. Elective System.âThe system of independent schools assumes that opportunities for study and instruction are privileges to be sought voluntarily and eagerly. Students are therefore allowed to elect for themselves the courses of study to which they are led by their individual tastes and proposed pursuits in life, as far as the time appointed for lectures and examinations permits. Nor is it alone to those who wish to make special attainments in single departments of knowledge that this freedom of election commends itself. It has decided advantages also for most of those students who seek the common goal of liberal education by ways which varying aptitude, varying preparation, or varying opportunities render of necessity different. The wisdom of the founder in establishing such a system has been amply vindicated in the history of this university; and in recent years many schools of higher education throughout the country have adopted methods involving this principle. The Session begins on the Thursday preceding the seventeenth of September, and continues, with a recess of ten days at Christmas, until the Wednesday before the nineteenth of June. The first three days of the session are given to registration, and all students, both old and new, are required during that time to place their names upon the books of the university and the rolls of their respective classes. Lecture courses begin upon the following Monday, and absences will be recorded against any student not present, from the opening lecture of each course. Students entering after the first three days will be charged a fee for registration. Religious Worship.âMorality and religion are recognized as the foundation and indispensable concomitants of education. The discipline of the university is sedulously administered with a view to confirm integrity, and to maintain a sacred regard for truth. Great efforts are made to surround the students with religious influences; but experience having proved that it is best to forbear the employment of coercion, the attendance on religious exercises is entirely voluntary. Divine service is conducted twice on Sunday in the University Chapel by clergymen invited from the principal religious denominations; and other religious exercises are directed by the Young Men's Christian Association. The Examinations in each class at this institution have, from the beginning (A. D. 1825), been held in writing. Oral examinations are held in some departments, but they are auxiliary to the written examinations, which, in conjunction with the class standing as determined by the daily work of the student, are the main tests of the student's proficiency. A special examination may be granted upon ANNOUNCEMENTS. physician's certificate of sickness on the day of examination, or other cause which the faculty of the department in question may accept as adequate ground. See also p. 96. The written examinations are, in every case, of a public character, and are conducted by a committee of three professors, one of whom is the professor whose class is examined. This committee is expected to remain in the room during the examination, supervise the proceedings, determine doubts, grant special examinations in cases covered by law, and make report to the faculty of the results of the examination. The committee, not the professor solely is responsible throughout. Reports.âReports are sent, at stated intervals, to the parent or guardian of each student. These reports give the number of times the student has been absent from lectures; and indicate, as nearly as is practicable, the nature of the progress made by him in his work at the university. Honor System.âFor eighteen years after the opening of the institution, honesty at the written examinations was sought to be secured by the strict surveillance of the committee alone. This was often found to be ineffectual. In June, 1842, Judge Henry St. George Tucker, Professor of Law, offered the following resolution, which the faculty at once adopted: Resolved, That in all future written examinations for distinction and other honors of the university, each candidate shall attach to the written answers presented by him on such examination a certificate in the following words: "I, A. B., do hereby certify, on honor that I have derived no assistance during the time of this examination from any source whatever, whether oral, written, or in print, in giving the above answers." This was the beginning of the honor system at this institution. In subsequent years the pledge was extended so as to preclude the giving as well as the receiving of assistance. The system has been in operation since 1842 without interruption. Its wisdom and its beneficial results have been abundantly demonstrated. Its administration imposes no burden upon the faculty. Experience shows that the students themselves are its sternest guardians and executors. Violation of examination pledges has been of rare occurrence. In every case the culprit has been quietly but promptly eliminated without need of faculty action. The spirit of truth and honor, thus fostered in the examination-room, has gradually pervaded the entire life of the institution, and all the relations between the student and professor. It is not believed to be essential to the honor system, nor indeed to be right, to expose the examinee to unnecessary temptation ANNOUNCEMENTS. to violate his pledge. The student is regarded as one to be shielded from such influences and to have his honorable tendencies carefully reinforced and not wrecked. Hence the examination is held in one place where all candidates are assembled, and in the presence of a committee of the faculty. Conversation among the candidates and absence from the room are discouraged. They are cautioned to avoid even the appearance of evil. These safeguards have been found to be in entire harmony with the absence of espionage. The fact that the candidate is not suspected, has been found to lead always to the avoidance of conduct which would give rise to suspicion. Degrees are conferred only upon examination after residence. The requirements for these degrees are given under the several departments. No honorary degree is conferred by the University of Virginia. Licentiates.âAny person of unexceptionable character and habits, upon producing to the faculty satisfactory evidence of suitable capacity, and attainments, may be licensed by the faculty to form classes for private instruction in any school of the university, in aid of and in conformity to the public teachings of the professor upon any subject taught therein. The employment and compensation of any such licentiate are matters of private agreement between him and the student. Students whose preparation is defective for the work of the university classes may often economize time and energy by securing the services of a licentiate at the same time that they are attending the regular course of lectures. Directions for New Students.âNew students will find it greatly to their advantage if, as soon as possible after reporting to the dean of the university, they will go to Madison Hall, where a committee of students will be found who will gladly be of any service in assisting them to get settled as quickly as possible. A general information bureau, a complete list of boarding houses with prices of board, a directory of the students with their addresses, a list of all forms of employment open to students, copies of the University Handbook, and other things of interest to the new men, will there be accessible to all. The General Secretary of the Association will be pleased to correspond with prospective students during the summer with regard to all such matters, and it is suggested that every man who expects to enter the university inform him of that fect. See p. 290. REGULATIONS. REGULATIONS. REGISTRATION. Registration of New Students.âApplicants seeking admission to the university for the first time must present themselves to the dean of the university at his office in the Administration Building at some time during the first three days of the session. Each candidate for admission must be at least sixteen years of age. In each instance a certificate of good moral character must be presented, signed by the proper official of the institution attended during the previous session, or by some person of known standing. Each candidate who satisfies these requirements, and also those for admission by diploma, certificate, or examination previously stated, will be directed to the dean of the department which he purposes to enter. The dean in question will, upon being satisfied that the candidate is fitted to enter upon the work of the department, issue to him a card containing the names of the courses which the candidate proposes to pursue during the session: this card must be presented in turn to each professor concerned, who will, on satisfying himself that the applicant is prepared to pursue the course in question with profit, sign the card and enter the applicant's name upon the roll of the class. The card must then be returned to the dean of the university, who will endorse upon it the amount of fees to be paid to the bursar. On payment of these fees the registration (for the session) of the applicant as a student of the university will be completed. Registration of Matriculated Students.âStudents who have already been matriculated as members of the university are required to present themselves directly to the deans of their respective departments upon one of the first three days of the session, and to conform, as regards their registration in their respective classes and the payment of fees, to the requirements stated in the preceding paragraph. Registration after the Christmas Recess.âOn the first week-day after the Christmas Recess every student is required to register with the dean of his department between the hours of nine a. m. and two p. m. Any student failing to register thus, will have his name dropped from the rolls of his classes until further order from the dean, but such student may be registered by the dean and restored to his position in his classes on payment to the bursar of the delayed registration fee of $3.00. REGULATIONS. In case the delay in the student's return is due to illness, or to other like providential cause, the dean is authorized to remit the fee and excuse the absence; in every other case the absences due to delayed return shall be recorded as unexcused absences; shall be so reported to the parent or guardian of the student; and shall be given serious adverse weight in considering the fitness of the student for graduation. Delayed Registration.âStudents are not permitted to delay their registration through carelessness or for inadequate reasons. Any student, new or old, who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session and between the hours of nine a. m. and two p. m. on the first week-day after the Christmas Recess will (except in the case of an applicant admitted to special examinations, as provided in a previous paragraph) be admitted to registration only upon the consent of the president, and will be charged a special registration fee of three dollars. RESIDENCE, ATTENDANCE AND GRADE. The Academic Year extends from the morning of the Thursday preceding the seventeenth of September to the evening of the Wednesday before the nineteenth of June. Thanksgiving Day is a holiday, and there is a Christmas recess beginning on the morning of the twenty-fourth of December and closing on the evening of the second of January. Attendance is required of each student throughout the entire session, with the exception of the days above indicated, unless he has received permission to be temporarily absent, or to withdraw before its close. Leave of absence is granted by the deans for sufficient reasons, and must in every case be obtained in advance. Voluntary withdrawal requires the written consent of the student's professors and of the dean of the university. While in residence each student is required to attend regularly all lectures and other prescribed exercises and all examinations in the courses which he pursues (unless excused for cause) and in every way to conform to the regulations of the university. Absence from the university is permitted upon the written leave of the dean of the department in which the student is registered, obtained in every case in advance. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or musical clubs on excursions will not be granted, except to the officers and members of the organizations. Absence of Athletic Teams and Other Student Organizations.â The laws relating to absence from the university of members of the Athletic teams are found in the section upon Physical REGULATIONS. Training (pp. 294-295). The same resolutions apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors, but only for sickness or like providential cause. Such excuses must be rendered on the day of the first lecture attended after the absence. Unexcused absences from lectures render the student liable to be disciplined by the faculty. In case of delayed entrance the student is regarded as having been absent from all lectures or other exercises that have been given, in the courses which he enters, since the beginning of the session. Absence from Examinations will not be excused except for sickness on the day of examination (attested by a physician's certificate) or other cause which the faculty of the department by special order may approve. An unexcused absence, or the presentation of an unpledged paper, is counted as a total failure in the examination in which it occurs. A student whose absence from examination is excused is admitted to the Fall Examination in the subject in question in each of the departments where such examinations are held. Where necessary, he is admitted to a special examination. Change of Schools, with transfer of fees, cannot be made except by special order of the faculty. But a student may change from one class to another of the same school with the advice and consent of the professors concerned. The Grade of the Student in any course, either for a term or for the session, is determined by the combined class standing and the result of examination, each being considered in such proportion as the professor in charge may decide for the course in question. Class Standing in any course is determined by the regularity of attendance of the student upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercises where included) in the course in question, and by the faithful performance of his work as indicated by his answers when questioned, by his written exercises, notebooks, the faithful performance of laboratory (or other similar) work, etc. Students are regarded by the faculty as under the law of honor in matters affecting class standing as in examinations. The Grades for Passing in any course, required by the various departments of the university, are as follows: in the College, the Department of Graduate Studies, the Department of Engineering, and the Department of Agriculture 75 per centum in the Department of Medicine 80 per centum in the Department of Law 83 per centum REGULATIONS. Re-examination in September.âA student of the College, of the Department of Graduate Studies, or of the Department of Engineering, who attains in any course a grade for the session below 75 per cent, but not below 65 per cent, may, upon written recommendation of the professor in charge of the course, be admitted by the faculty of the department at their final meeting in June to re-examination upon that course during the registration week of the following September. The fee for each re-examination is $5.00, and must be paid to the bursar on or before July fifteenth preceding the opening of the session. Minimum Grade Required of College and Engineering Students.â Any student in the College or in the Department of Engineering whose average grade on all courses for any term is less than 40 per cent will be dropped from the rolls of the university. Any student who makes an average of 40 per cent or more, at the end of any term, but whose grade on each of his courses is less than 65 per cent will be put on probation for the term next ensuing. The student on probation who again makes less than 65 per cent on each of his courses at the end of the current term, will be dropped from the rolls. A student in any department of the university who is evidently making no real progress in one of his courses of study may at any time, after due admonition, be required to drop the course in question. A student in the College or the Department of Engineering who falls under this rule will be put upon probation if he fails to attain a grade of 40 per cent in a single one of his remaining courses at a succeeding examination. Voluntary Withdrawal from the university requires the written consent of the student's professors and of the dean of the university. When a permit is granted upon the university physician's certificate that withdrawal is necessary on account of the student's ill-health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct, the fees are returned pro rata. Under no other circumstances will there be a return of fees. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the faculty for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the university. See also "Minimum Grade" above. CONDUCT. Conduct.âThe laws of the university require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the university, whether he be within the precincts or not. They require from the student regular and diligent application to his studies, and if, in the opinion of the faculty, any student be not REGULATIONS. fulfilling the purposes for which he ought to have come to the university, and be not likely to fulfill them, either from habitual delinquency in any of his classes, or from habitual idleness, or from any other bad habit, the president, upon recommendation of the faculty, may require him to withdraw from the university, after informing him of the objections to his conduct and affording him an opportunity of explanation and defense. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the president may dismiss from the university for the residue of the current session every student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. The keeping of Dogs by students within the university grounds is forbidden. In all cases of Discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. Prohibition of Credit.âAn act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting minor students. The license to contract debts, which the president is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity. DORMITORY, BOARD, MEDICAL ATTENDANCE. Dormitory.âStudents may reside in the university dormitories, in private houses approved by the president, or in their homes. Any change of residence during the session should be reported at the office of the registrar. Students desiring rooms in the university dormitories should make application to the Bursar, enclosing in every case the reservation fee of five dollars, which will be returned should there be no vacant room to let. The occupant of a dormitory has the first right to it, and may reserve it for the next session, by contract with the Bursar, and depositing $5.00 (which is in no case returnable), not later than May first. The balance of the rent shall be paid not later than the first registration day of the session, otherwise such preference or other right shall be forfeited. No dormitory may be sublet; nor shall the same be used for improper purposes. For rental of university dormitories, see p. 105. Boarding.âStudents may board and lodge either in the university precincts or at their homes, or in houses licensed by the faculty. REGULATIONS. It is the duty of the president to withdraw the license from any house in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Change of lodging should be reported at the registrar's office. Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the university physician; and, if necessary, to skilful nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for his maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, chronic cases, or to constitutional disorders of long standing from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the university. Students who take the responsibility of boarding at houses not approved by the Board of Health forfeit the right to this exemption. Students residing at their own homes, who waive this right, are entitled to the remission of a portion of the university fee. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the university physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. Physical Training.âNo student is permitted to undertake an amount of work greater than he may reasonably be expected to do well without detriment to his physical health; and every student is advised to take a due amount of daily outdoor exercise, for which ample opportunities are afforded upon the athletic fields, the tennis courts, the golf course, and in other forms; and in addition, to make systematic use of the facilities afforded without cost for definite and judicious physical training at the Fayerweather Gymnasium under the advice and instruction of the director and his assistants. Further information upon this important subject will be found upon a subsequent page. EXPENSES. EXPENSES. All tuition fees, university fees, the contingent deposit, rents of rooms in the university buildings, and charges for service in the same, are payable upon entrance. Under special conditions the president is authorized to allow credit; but these deferred payments are in all cases to be properly secured. Students permitted to register during a term are required to pay the full fees for the term in which they register. Under no circumstances will there be a return of fees except upon certificate from the university physician that withdrawal from the university is necessary on account of the student's illness, which must not be due to dissolute conduct. Upon receipt of the university physician's certificate, the president will return the fees, pro rata. A student's necessary expenses are as follows: I. University charges, which are the same for all students, except College and Graduate students from Virginia, as stated in a following paragraph; II. Department fees, which depend upon the course of study pursued; III. Cost of living, board, etc. I. University Charges.âUnder the first head are included (a) university fee, $40 ($10 for Virginians in Academic Departments), and (b) the contingent deposit, $10; as well as (c) the special Entrance Examination fee of five dollars, (d) the delinquent registration fee of three dollars, and (e) a fee for re-examination in any subject where any of these is incurred. (a) The University fee goes to the fund intended to defray the general expenses of the university. Payment of this fee entitles the student, without additional charge, to the use of the Library; to the privileges of the Gymnasium, with baths, private lockers, etc., and the advice and aid of the Instructor in Physical Culture; and to free medical attendance by the university physician in cases of illness. It also covers all regular examination and diploma fees. EXPENSES. (b) The contingent deposit is liable for any damage to the university property for which the student is responsible, or for violations of Library or other university rules. It is returned at the end of the session, less any charges that may have been made against it; it is therefore, not necessarily an expense, although mentioned in this connection. From this deposit there will be deducted the sum of $2.00 for the support of the Chapel Services and General Religious Work of the University, unless within one month after registration the student shall request the bursar not to deduct this contribution. It will be observed that this amount also (which is less than the average contribution made by the students who have given toward the Chapel Fund in past years) is not a necessary expense, as the support of the religious work of the university is left entirely to the option of the students and professors. This method of collection is intended merely as a substitute for the canvass formerly made, and it is the desire of the faculty that the students will thus unite with them in sustaining the religious work of the university. (c) The special entrance examination fee of five dollars is required of all applicants for admission to the university by examination who for good reason are unable to be present at the regular entrance examinations on the dates as set forth on p. 85 of the catalogue. All candidates who take entrance examinations on the regular dates, are examined free of charge. (d) The delinquent registration fee of three dollars is charged where the student or candidate, through carelessness or other inadequate reason, fails to present himself for registration, during the first three days of the session; or where the student fails to register with the dean of his department, between the hours of 9 a. m. and 2 p. m. on the first week-day after the expiration of the Christmas Recess, unless his late return be due to illness or like providential cause. (e) The re-examination fee: A student of the College who attains in any course a grade below 75 per cent, but not below 65 per cent, may, upon the written recommendation of the professor in charge, be admitted by the faculty at their final meeting in June, to re-examination upon that course, during the registration week of the following September. The fee for each re-examination shall be $5.00, payable to the bursar on or before July 15. II. Department Fees.âUnder the second head is comprised the charge for instruction, including the Tuition Fees proper, and in some cases, the cost of apparatus and materials consumed in laboratory work. EXPENSES. TABULATED STATEMENTS OF UNIVERSITY AND DEPARTMENTAL FEES. A. The College: To Students from Virginia To Students from other States University Fee $10 $40 Tuition 0 95 Contingent Deposit 10 10 $20 $145 Laboratory Fees.âIn addition to the charges above stated, students taking courses in natural sciences pay laboratory fees as follows: Laboratory Fee for Apparatus, etc. Botany $ 5 $5 Chemistry 10 Geology, Term Course 3 Physics 5 ZoÃ¶logy 5 Students Taking Less than Fifteen Session-Hours.âStudents, from other states than Virginia, who by special permission of the faculty, take courses aggregating less than fifteen session-hours in the College in any one session, must pay for tuition in any one academic school $50, in two schools $60, in three schools $75, in four schools $95. (See also p. 104.) B. The Department of Graduate Studies: To Students from Virginia To Students from other States University Fee $10 $40 Tuition 0 Average 75* * $50 in one academic school; $60 in two academic schools; $25 each in three or more schools. Contingent Deposit 10 10 $20 $125 Students from Virginia.âAs is seen from the statements above the university, in compliance with the statute (Virginia Code 1887, Ch. 68, Sec. 1554), offers to white male students from Virginia who are sixteen years or more of age, instruction, without charge for tuition, in all the Schools of the Academic Departments (excepting the courses in Analytical Chemistry and the laboratory courses in Botany, Chemistry, Physics, and ZoÃ¶logy), subject to the conditions EXPENSES. stated below. Such students are required to pay the university fee for Virginia students in the Academic Department of $10, and make the usual contingent deposit. They are also required to pay the regular laboratory charges for materials, etc., in the course of study where such charges occur. If they occupy rooms on the university grounds they are of course subject to the usual charges for rent and service. The saving to Virginia students varies from $105 to $130, according to the number of schools elected. To be entitled to free tuition as a Virginia student under the above mentioned statute, it is necessary that the applicant's parents be domiciled in the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; if he has attained his majority, it is necessary that he himself be domiciled here. One is domiciled in the State who is living in it at the time the application is made and has no present intention of removing therefrom in the future, or who, though absent from the State, has not lost his former domicile by acquiring one elsewhere. No other person can honestly avail himself of this privilege. White Male Teachers and Superintendents of the Public Schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Schools of the Academic Departments of the university without payment of fees, upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the Public Schools of the State during the year. Immediately after the Spring Examinations any of the following courses may be entered upon with profit by an applicant prepared for them; Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, German, English, English Literature and Rhetoric, History, Moral Philosophy, Mathematics, Astronomy, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Industrial Chemistry, Geology, and Descriptive Botany. Special courses for teachers will be offered in English and Mathematics, and perhaps in several other subjects during the approaching spring term, if the demand for them is sufficient. Applicants for admission as teachers are required to send in their names to the president of the university not later than March 5. Lodgings can be had near the university. The only necessary expense will be for board, lights, and washing, which will together cost from $5 to $7 a week. Ministerial Students.âMinisters of the gospel may attend any of the Academic Schools of the university without the payment of tuition fees. The same privileges will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet the expenses of education at the university without aid. EXPENSES. C. Courses in Analytical Chemistry: The courses in Analytical Chemistry, being professional courses, are not included under the regular tuition fees in the academic departments or among the courses in which free tuition is given to Virginians and other privileged students in the College and the Department of Graduate Studies. The fees for each course in Analytical Chemistry are: Tuition $40 Laboratory 10 Apparatus 10 (for students taking two courses $15 for both). $60 D. Department of Law: University Fee $ 40 Tuition 100 Contingent Fee 10 $150 Students taking an irregular course pay for tuition according to the proportion which the work taken bears to the regular course. For such course the tuition fee may be estimated approximately in dollars as 3-10 of the total number of lecture periods. E. Department of Medicine: University Fee $ 40 Tuition 100 Contingent Deposit 10 $150 Breakage Deposit in Organic and Physiological Chemistry.â Students taking courses in Organic and Physiological Chemistry are required to deposit in addition to the charges above stated $10 to cover cost of breakage in the laboratory. F. Department of Engineering: In the Department of Engineering the charges for tuition are uniform to all students, except that Virginians are relieved of tuition (p. 102) on courses offered in the college. In addition to the university fee of $40, the fee for each class taken will be $25, with the addition of the prescribed laboratory charges, which are $5 for each class in Applied Mechanics, Engineering, and Physics; $15 for Chemistry. For each class in Analytical Chemistry a special fee of $50 is charged for tuition and supplies plus $10 for apparatus. The fee for each class in Drawing is $10. EXPENSES. The statement made above may be averaged for the four years of the engineering courses as follows: To Students from Virginia To Students from other States University Fee $40 $ 40 Tuition and Lab. Fee 50 100 Contingent Deposit 10 10 $100 $150 III. Cost of Living.âUnder the third head fall the expenses of living and the cost of books and stationery. Dormitories. A student may, either alone or with a room-mate, rent a dormitory, and take his meals in the University Commons, or in an approved private boarding-house; or he may take both room and board in such boarding-house, in which case he pays no room-rent or servant hire to the university. Students desiring rooms in the university dormitories should apply to the Bursar, enclosing in every case the reservation fee of $5, which will be returned should there be no room to let. The rules governing the rental and occupancy of university dormitories are as follows; The rates given below are for the session of nine months. The rooms in the dormitories are unfurnished. The minimum cost of furniture for a single room may be placed at $15 for the session and can be secured from the local furniture dealers. All rooms are provided with either steam or hot water heat, electric light, and janitor service except where otherwise specified. Randall Building. This building contains 32 single and 10 double rooms which are assigned only to students taking board at the University Commons, and, any student occupying a room in this building, failing to remain at the commons for any portion of the session, will vacate the same. Single room $35.00 Double room 40.00 Double room with study (only one such room in building) 50.00 No janitor service is provided for rooms in this building. The single rooms are 10Ã14; 10Ã15, or 10Ã16. The double rooms are 14Ã15; 15Ã15, or 15Ã17. The study is 9â² 6â³Ã11â² 6â³. EXPENSES. East Range. Rooms in Old Gymnasium building (8) $60.00 Other rooms on East Range 72.00 West Range. Rooms, no heat, but provided with grate (4) 60.00 Other rooms 72.00 East and West Lawns. Rooms in Bachelor's Row (9) (smaller than others) 70.00 Other rooms 75.00 Dawson's Row. Rooms 75.00 Dawson's Row comprises seven detached 8-room houses, water closet in each house, lavatory with running water in each room. Bath house with shower is provided for this row. Monroe Hill. Single room, no heat, but provided with grate $54.00 The rooms on East and West Lawns, East and West Ranges, Dawson's Row and Monroe Hill, with the exception of Bachelor's Row on West Lawn, are commodious and are frequently occupied by two students, in which event no extra charge is made. Two students may rent a room together, each paying his half of the rent. Furnished rooms may be rented in private boarding houses outside the university grounds at prices ranging from $5.00 to $20.00 a month. Table board will be furnished at the University Commons at $15.00 per month, or may be obtained at private houses outside of the university grounds at prices ranging from $15 to $25 a month. Board and lodging can be obtained at private houses outside the university grounds at from $18.50 to $50.00 a month. With strict economy the cost of board, lodging, heat, light, and washing can be brought within $20.00 a month. The cost of books and stationery varies much with the branches studied. It is probably greatest in the Department of Law, where, for the entire three years' course, it amounts to about $165. But in this department, as in that of Medicine, the books purchased form the necessary nucleus of a professional library, and their cost does not belong to transient expenses. EXPENSES. Approximate Summary of All Expenses. The following tables may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of nine months. As necessary expenses are reckoned here, university and tuition fees, laboratory fees (average for three years), lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, travelling expenses or pocket money. For each department three estimates are given,âa low, an average, and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundry,â in other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. By sharing a room with another student, and by practicing the strictest economy, the expenses may possibly be reduced below the low estimate. A.

In accordance with the terms of this act, loans will be made "to needy and deserving students of talent and character, from Virginia, in the Academic Departments," in amounts not to exceed $100 in any one session to the student, at an annual rate of interest of 4 per centum. The applicant for such loan must have complied with all of the requirements for admission to the College or to the Department of Graduate Studies. For further information regarding such loans, apply to the Bursar, University, Virginia. The Harvard Loan Fund.âThe Harvard Loan Fund was established in February, 1909, by an alumnus of Harvard University, EXPENSES. who gave to the University of Virginia the sum of $5,000, as an evidence of the friendship and kindly relation existing between the two institutions. Loans from this fund will be made to needy and deserving students pursuing or intending to pursue studies in any of the departments of the university, in amounts not to exceed $100 in any one session to the same student, at an annual rate of interest of 4 per centum. The applicant must have complied with all requirements for admission to the university. Further information regarding such loans will be furnished on application to the Bursar, University, Virginia. Student Self-Help.âIn addition to the Loan Funds above mentioned, opportunity is also afforded as far as possible to those who are desirous of helping themselves by their own industry, and it may be safely stated that any student with sufficient resources to carry him through the first half of the session, can be reasonably sure of obtaining work enough to pay living expenses and university fees for the remainder of the college year. While it is difficult for any student to be assured of renumerative work before he reaches the university, correspondence with reference to such employment may be had by addressing the Secretary of the Committee on Student Self-Help, Madison Hall. The University Commons.âThis building, conveniently situated near the center of the university, provides an attractive Dining Hall, with accommodations for more than 250 students at once. Board is furnished at a rate not exceeding $15 per month, which means that students in straitened circumstances need not be deprived of daily association with their more fortunate fellows. The Commons is the means of greatly reducing a student's living expenses at the university. SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS. SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS. All inquiries concerning and all applications for scholarships and fellowships should be addressed to the dean of the university. The president may, after due warning to the holder, declare any scholarship or fellowship vacant at any time, if in the judgment of the president and faculty the holder fails to give satisfactory evidence of diligence or the faithful performance of his duties. GENERAL SCHOLARSHIPS. The following regulations with regard to the General Scholarships offered by the university have been adopted by the Board of Visitors: UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA ACCREDITED SCHOOLS SCHOLARSHIPS. The faculty is authorized to prepare a list of such schools and colleges as deserve special recognition. To each one of the institutions placed on this list, the Faculty is authorized to award a scholarship in the College; to each of the colleges, a scholarship in the Department of Graduate Studies, these scholarships to be known as the University of Virginia Scholarship in â School or College. The scholarship shall entitle the holder who must be a graduate of his institution of the preceding session, to the remission of all tuition and university fees, except the fees in Analytical Chemistry and laboratory fees in general, if he be a Virginian; and if he be not a Virginian, to the remission of all tuition fees, except in Analytical Chemistry and laboratory fees in general, and one-half of the university fee. The contingent fee must be deposited in either case. This list of schools and colleges may be extended from time to time and further scholarships assigned as above. In accordance with this regulation, the faculty has selected the following institutions for such recognition, and pending the consideration of other institutions, invites application for enrollment in this list from such schools as fall within the conditions prescribed above: Asheville High School Asheville, N.

VIRGINIA PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL SCHOLARSHIPS. The university offers to accredited public high schools of Virginia, one scholarship each in the college, on the conditions prescribed below. This scholarship, for one session (that following the incumbent's graduation from the high school), when awarded by the designated high school to a white male graduate, who has pursued and completed with credit the high school course, and who is endorsed by the principal of the high school in question as to both preparation and character, shall entitle the holder to a remission of all fees payable to the university, except the fees in Analytical Chemistry and laboratory fees in general. The holders of these scholarships are required to deposit the contingent fee. Any school accepting this scholarship shall make due announcement of it both to the scholars of the school and through the local papers; and at the end of the session shall, during the graduating exercises and through the public press, announce the award; and these appointments shall be duly certified to the dean of the university. This list of Virginia public high schools may be extended from time to time and further scholarships assigned as above. In accordance with this regulation of the Board of Visitors, the faculty has selected the following institutions for such recognition, and, pending the consideration of other institutions, invites applications for enrollment in this list from such schools as fall within the conditions prescribed above: Big Stone Gap High School Big Stone Gap, Va.

At the meeting of the Board of Visitors on March 2d, 1899, the following system of Alumni Scholarships was created: 1. These scholarships shall be known as Alumni Scholarships. 2. The incumbents shall be appointed by such local Alumni Associations as are members in good standing of the General Alumni Association and are so reported from year to year by its Secretary; and by such of these only as may have ten or more active members who are entitled to vote on the appointment of an incumbent. 3. No incumbent shall hold such scholarship for more than one year; but one who has passed satisfactory examinations at the university in one or more of his classes may be eligible for reappointment the following session upon the recommendation of the Faculty. 4. These scholarships shall be confined to those courses in the Academic Schools of the university to which Virginia students are now admitted without charge under the laws of Virginia (that is, all Academic courses, save the courses in Analytical Chemistry). The scholarship shall entitle the incumbent to exemption from tuition fees in the Schools referred to except laboratory fees in general, and to the remission, if he be a Virginian, of the university fee; if he be not a Virginian, one-half of the university fee. The contingent fee must be deposited in all cases. SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS. 5. Only such persons may be appointed as actually stand in need of such aid, and such as otherwise would not, in the judgment of the association making the appointment, be able to attend the university: and no student will be permitted to enjoy the privileges of an alumni scholarship while holding an endowed scholarship or fellowship. 6. The incumbent must be at least eighteen years of age, and must be one who, in the judgment of the association naming him, is studious, of good moral character, and prepared to enter the university. He shall be subject to the same entrance requirements as other students. 7. Every local alumni association, as above described, having ten or more active members, shall be entitled annually to have one appointee at the university; if hereafter such association ceases to have as many as ten active members, it shall not be entitled to make an appointment until that number be restored. 8. Every such local association having fifty or more active members shall be entitled to fill two such scholarships annually, as long as it shall continue to have as many as fifty such members, or as soon as it shall have reached that number. 9. By "active" members as herein, used, is meant alumni of the university, who have been admitted by the association as active members thereof, in accordance with the rules laid down by the Association. No alumnus shall be entitled to vote upon the appointment of an incumbent in more than one association during the same year, nor for this purpose shall an alumnus be considered as an active member of more than one association, at the same time. But graduation in any department or school of the university is not hereby required. 10. Only one association in any city or town shall be entitled to appoint incumbents to the scholarships hereby created. 11. The final appointment of each incumbent shall be made by a vote of the whole association, a majority of the active members voting for the applicant. It shall not finally be made by any committee or by any officer or officers of the association. But such committee or officers may be appointed by the association to nominate or examine candidates, and to report to the association. 12. A statement, which shall include the full name and address of the successful candidate, the fact of his appointment, and the specific compliance of the association and the candidate in question with conditions above stated, must be certified to the President of the University of Virginia, attested by the signature of the Secretary of the Association making the appointment. This certificate must be in the hands of the president on or before the fifteenth day of August preceding the opening of the session for which the incumbent SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS. is appointed. The president will send printed forms of such certificates upon application. 13. The above requirements having been complied with, the person or persons so appointed shall be entitled in each instance to attend the university for the session immediately following the appointment without payment of any tuition fees (save for the course in Analytical Chemistry), except laboratory fees in general, and to the remission, if he be a Virginian, of the university fee; if he be not a Virginian, of one-half of the university fee: the Contingent fee being deposited in each case; and shall enjoy the same privileges and be subject to the same restrictions as other students. 14. To guard against any possible ill-feeling or sense of injustice on the part of any local association in respect to the construction of these provisions, all such matters shall be referred to the Executive Committee of the General Alumni Association, the decision of which, when approved by the President of the University, shall be final. SPECIAL SCHOLARSHIPS. One of the Miller Scholarships, established in honor of the late Samuel Miller, is awarded by the faculty at the close of each session to the candidate who passes, with the highest aggregate of marks, in Physics B1, Chemistry B1, and Botany B1. The tenure is for two years; and the emolument is two hundred and fifty dollars a year, with free tuition. The holder is required during his tenure to pursue studies in the College only, and to elect each year one course in either the School of Analytical and Industrial Chemistry or the School of Biology: the laboratory fees are not remitted. There is no other restriction upon his election of courses, and all of the courses required for candidacy and tenure can be included in a program for a baccalaureate degree. The holder of a Miller Scholarship is required, during each year of his tenure, to serve as a student assistant in the Biological Laboratory. The amount of time required is three afternoons a week, or such equivalent amount of time otherwise distributed as may be agreed upon by the holder and the professor under whom the service is rendered. The McCormick Scholarship, established in honor of the late Leander J. McCormick, the founder of the Astronomical Observatory, is awarded by Mr. Robert Hall McCormick, of Chicago. The emolument is free tuition in any department of the university, with remission of the university fee. SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS. The Isaac Carey Scholarship is awarded by the Carey Trustees. Its value is about three hundred dollars a year. The Thompson Brown Scholarship is awarded by its founder. Its value is one hundred and twenty dollars a year. The Birely Scholarship, founded upon the bequest of the late Mrs. Evalena Seevers Birely, in honor of her husband, Valentine Birely, Esq., of Frederick, Maryland, is awarded by the Visitors to some students from the State of Maryland. Its value is about one hundred dollars a year. The Henry Coalter Cabell Scholarship is awarded by the Visitors to a graduate student upon the recommendation of the Committee of the School of English Literature. Its value is fifty dollars a year. The Isabella Merrick Sampson Endowment to the Engineering School. By the generous gift of Mr. W. Gordon Merrick of Glendower, Albemarle County, Virginia, made in July, 1910, there is provided the sum of one hundred dollars annually, to be granted by the trustees of the endowment to some deserving young man of Albemarle County, who is or may desire to become a student of the University of Virginia in the Engineering Department. If no applicant from Albemarle County applies, the trustees may select a student from some other section. Application should be made through the Dean of the Engineering Department to the trustees of the Isabella Merrick Sampson Endowment. The Harmon Scholarship in the Department of Law was established by the Rector and Visitors of the university June 11, 1912 and carries exemption from all tuition and university fees. The holder of the scholarship must be "a young Virginian of ability, character, and need." FELLOWSHIPS. The Vanderbilt Fellowships are supported out of the working fund of the Leander McCormick Observatory. They are assigned to advanced students who take Astronomy as their major subject and occupy a portion of their time in work connected with the Observatory.

Assistant in Philosophy EUGENE PRICE BROWN Student Assistant in Chemistry RAYMOND CARLYLE DINGLEDINE, Student Assistant in Physics The Academic Schools comprise the Schools of Languages, Mathematics, Sciences, History, Economics, Literature, Philosophy, and Education. In the undergraduate courses of these schools is comprised the work of the College leading to the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science; in the graduate courses is comprised the work of the Department of Graduate Studies, leading to the degrees of Graduate in a School, Master of Arts, Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy. The professors and instructors in the Academic Schools compose the Academic Faculty, which deals with questions concerning the work both of the College and of the Department of Graduate Studies. A full statement of the requirements for the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science will be found under the head of the College (pp. 168-176); of the requirements for the other academic degrees, under the Department of Graduate Studies (pp. 178-182). The courses given in the academic schools are arranged as Courses for Undergraduates, Courses for Graduates and Undergraduates, Courses primarily for Graduates. In the detailed account of the courses of the academic schools, given in the following pages, the numbers and letters used to designate a course have the following meaning: The numbers indicate merely the relative position which the course occupies in work of the grade indicated by the letters, and THE ACADEMIC SCHOOLS. have no application to the credit value of the course as work for any degree. The letters are used as follows: A: a course for undergraduates. Latin A1, Greek A2, Mathematics A1 and A2, English Literature A1 and A2 have a credit value toward a baccalaureate degree of three session-hours each, to which students who enter with advanced standing on any or all of these subjects are entitled (see p. 168). The other A courses (Greek A1, French A1, Spanish A1, German A1) have no credit value toward a degree, but may be taken either to gain admission into the first courses with a credit value offered in these subjects, or to remove entrance conditions. (See p. 85.) B: a course for undergraduates, with a credit value toward a baccalaureate degree of three session-hours, except in the case of courses in the scientific schools, which have a value of six session-hours each. C: a course for graduates and undergraduates. D: a course primarily for graduates. A term-course is a short course of three hours a week for one of the three terms into which the academic year is divided. Such courses have credit value as part of an elective-at-large, but not as any part of a group-elective. The Academic Schools are here arranged alphabetically. SCHOOL OF PRACTICAL ASTRONOMY.

Adjunct Professor McLemore. Required for admission to the school: The general entrance requirements. General Statement. The primary object of the courses open to undergraduates in the School of Greek is to enable the student to read and appreciate the masterpieces of Greek Literature. To that end at least two entire hours of the three weekly meetings of each course are devoted to the translation and interpretation of assigned portions of text, and to the treatment of those broader questions which must claim the attention of every intelligent student of literature. Owing to the limited number of courses which can be offered, no attempt has been made to group in a single course the authors of a particular period or of a particular field. The content of the courses has been determined solely by the comparative difficulty of the authors read. Those students, however, who complete the entire program will have made the acquaintance of at least one author of importance in each field and in each period, and will have some conception of the respective positions occupied by these authors in the history of literature. The study of grammar will not be treated as an end in itself, but the ability of the student to construe his authors satisfactorily will be constantly tested. To insure further a practical familiarity with grammatical principles, and to cultivate a feeling for idiom and style, exercises in prose composition will form an important part of the work of each course. Finally, since it is desirable that the broader aspects of ancient life be covered by the student in a more comprehensive way than can be done in the regular lectures and recitations, collateral reading in English on various subjects will be assigned for outside work, and questions based upon this reading will be included in each examination. For Undergraduates. Greek A1: For beginners. This course is designed to meet the needs of students who wish to gain in a short time a working knowledge of Greek, either as an aid to the study of other subjects (e. g., languages, history, theology), or with a view to entering upon a more extended study of Greek. It is to be especially noted that this course is by no means intended to supplant the work of the secondary schools, but to compensate the student, so far as may be, for his loss in having missed the much more normal and satisfactory training which the schools can give. The course consists of a rapid and THE ACADEMIC SCHOOLS. thorough drill in the forms and fundamental principles of the language, and of practice in translation, which receives an increasingly large proportion of emphasis as the session advances. By the end of the course the student should have acquired considerable facility in the reading of simple narrative prose.

The content of the course will vary according to the amount and the nature of the work already done by the SCHOOL OF HISTORY. student, and the object he has in view. In general, the course will consist of the rapid reading of Greek authors, and of an intensive study of some particular field of Classical Philology. Hours by appointment. Professor Webb. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF HISTORY. Professor Dabney. Mr. Earnest. Mr. Ramsey. Required for Admission to the Work of the School: The general entrance requirements, which must include Unit A of history (p. 78), for admission to this school. Students with adequate preparation may enter any of the courses in the School of History at the beginning of any term of the session, and will receive full credit for the course on completing the work of the remaining term or terms of the course in question during some subsequent session. The following courses are offered: For Undergraduates. The undergraduate courses in History will be based not only upon the idea that "the proper study of mankind is man," and that, therefore, all important human events, even those of the remote past, are of interest to human beings, but also upon the idea that every highly educated man should have an intelligent comprehension of himself and the age in which he livesâwhich intelligent comprehension it is as impossible to gain without a study of the past as it would be to comprehend thoroughly an oak tree without studying the acorn from which it sprang as well as the soil, climate and other features of the environment that have modified its development in the course of time. The barbarian tribes that overthrew the Roman Empire were the acorns from which the modern national oaks have sprung; and the literature, art, and thought of Greece, the law and the imperialism of Rome, and the Christian religion are the chief influences that have affected the development of these acorns through the centuries. No man can have a scientific understanding of himself and the modern world without a fair knowledge of these things; and every student who desires such an understanding is therefore advised to take at least the two courses, B1 and B2, in which they are treated. Credit will be given for either course separately; and under special circumstances both courses may be taken simultaneously.

For summer-school courses in History, on which college-credit will be allowed, see p. 278. SCHOOL OF LATIN. Professor Fitz-Hugh. Adjunct Professor McLemore. Mr. Bishop. Mr. Barton. Required for Admission to the Work of the School: Latin A, B, C, and D of the general entrance requirements, p. 81. Preparation.âThe Latin work of the university finds its logical place in the public school system as the continuation of the Latin SCHOOL OF LATIN. work of the High School. It presupposes accordingly four years of competent instruction in Latin, with daily recitations of at least forty minutes each, and it implies the use of the Roman pronunciation, the habitual observance of quantity and accent, regular drill in grammar and prose composition through all preparatory years, elementary reading (Viri RomÅ), Nepos (the Roman Lives), CÃ¦sar's Gallic War, Cicero's easier Orations, Ovid's Metamorphoses, and Vergil's Ãneid. If the preparation of the student justifies it, he will be admitted to advanced standing, with due credit for all work done elsewhere by him. Attention is specially invited to the importance of beginning Greek and at least one Romanic language for all who wish to reap the full cultural benefit of the university courses in Latin. The Greek illumines incomparably all parts of Latin study, which bears in turn a like relation to the Romanic. General Statement.âThe first five courses in Latin are devoted to the broad cultural study of the language, literature, and life of the Romans. The culture we enjoy to-day has its source in the culture of the Greeks and Romans. Greece is the fountain head of culture, and Rome its universalizer and transmitter to the modern world: thus Greek culture is the ultimate, Roman the immediate source of all modern culture. In the course of the instruction, therefore, the effort is made to exhibit as far as possible the relation of Roman civilization to the Greek, on the one hand, and to the Romanic and modern, on the other, and thus to emphasize the unity and continuity of all human culture. Hence the importance of the study of Greek and of at least one Romanic language is specially commended to the student of Latin. The work is organized in all years as follows: I. In Language: Systematic study of the Latin language, with oral and written exercises in prose composition. One hour a week. II. In Literature: Reading of authors in culture-historical series. Two hours a week. III. In Life: Systematic study of Roman culture-history in English, hand in hand with the study of the Latin authors. Students may enter any of the courses in Latin at the beginning of any term of the session, and will receive full credit for the course on completing subsequently the work of the remaining term or terms of the course in question. For Undergraduates. Latin A1: Latin A, B, C, and D of the general entrance requirements, p. 81. THE ACADEMIC SCHOOLS. I.

Latin D1: Course C1 or Course C2 or the equivalent of either, prerequisite.âThis course extends through three years and is intended for those who desire to specialize for one, two, or three years in classical philology. It contemplates especially the needs of those who choose Latin as their major elective for the degree of THE ACADEMIC SCHOOLS. Doctor of Philosophy. Roman civilization is the vital link between the Hellenic and the Romanic, and hence Latin philology, which is the science of Roman civilization, has vital points of contact with Greek philology on the one hand and with Romanic on the other. If the candidate's major elective be Latin, a respectable familiarity with Greek is required, since the language, literature, and life of the Romans are saturated with Greek influence. If the candidate's major elective be Romanic, the technical Greek requirement is waived as far as practically possible, and he is guided into the history of the Roman popular vernacular, the common source of the Romanic tongues, and into an acquaintance with the authors illustrating the Vulgar Latin in literature. Plan of Work.âIt is the aim of this course, as far as the teaching force and the resources of the School permit, to prepare the candidate to investigate independently the sources of our knowledge of the language, monuments (literary and objective), and life of the Romans. The following is therefore an outline of the course: I. In Language: Elements of comparative grammar (Giles, supplemented by Hirt and Sommer on Sounds and Inflections and by Brugmann and Schmalz on Syntax)âintroduction to Latin historical grammar (Lindsay, supplemented by Landgraf)âsystematic grammar (KÃ¼hner) with stylistic exercises, oral and written, in conjunction with Cicero's De Oratoreâreading of epigraphic and literary monuments illustrating the history of the Latin Language. II. In the Literary and Objective Monuments of the Romans: Reading of authors in groups systematically planned to illustrate the literary life of the Romansâhistory and interpretation of texts âelements of palÃ¦ography (Johnson, supplemented by Thompson), epigraphy (Lindsay, supplemented by Egbert and Cagnat, numismatics (Gnecchi, supplemented by Hill), topography and remains (Platner, Peterson, Huelson, Mau, Strack, FurtwÃ¦ngler). III. In Roman Life: Constructive study of Roman culture-historyâreading of authors illustrating the development of Roman civilizationâstudy of modern authorities in Roman culture-history (Philippson, Nissen, Mommsen, Marquardt-Mommsen, Preller-Jordon, Springer-Michaelis and Winter, Schanz, Windelband). Friday, Saturday, 12-2. Cabell Hall. Professor Fitz-Hugh, Adjunct Professor McLemore. Aids.âFor the sake of first-hand access to important modern authorities in Latin philology, the candidate is urged to acquire a good reading knowledge of German, French, and Italian. Such a mastery of German and French is imperative. For summer-school courses in Latin on which college-credit is allowed, see p. 278. SCHOOL OF MATHEMATICS. SCHOOL OF MATHEMATICS. Professor Echols.

To a student successfully passing one of these examinations will be given a certificate of proficiency in the work required in Course A1 or A2. Advanced standing on the work of Course A1 or A2 will in general, be granted a student entering from a secondary school only after he has passed here the prescribed examination on the course in question. Mathematics B1: (Course A1 prerequisite.)âThis class meets three times each week throughout the session. The work of the course consists of an advanced course in trigonometry, taking up the subject where left off in course A1. The major portion of the session's work, however, is given to the study of analytical geometry of two dimensions in cartesian and polar coÃ¶rdinates. A special study of the conic sections is followed by the study of a number of classical curves. This course is required of all students who elect mathematics for an undergraduate degree. (B. A. or B. S. credit, 3 session-hours.) Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 11-12. Cabell Hall. Professor Page. Mathematics B2: (Course B1 prerequisite.)âThis course is devoted to a preliminary study of the Differential and Integral Calculus. It extends throughout the session, the class meeting one hour three times each week during the nine months. The treatment of the subject involves the operations of differentiation and integration of functions, with applications to the expansion of functions in series, evaluation of illusory forms, maximum and minimum values, the applications to geometry of curves in the problems of tangency, contact and curvature, curve tracing, arc length, and areas, the volumes of revolutes and of special forms of other surfaces, areas of surfaces of revolution, and finally the solutions of the more important simple problems in ordinary differential equations. This course is an elective-at-large for students applying for undergraduate degrees. (B. A. or B. S. credit, 3 session-hours.) Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, 12-1. Cabell Hall. Professor Echols.

Students taking this course attend the lectures of Course B1, but the work done in the laboratory, in recitations, and in examinations is made more elementary in order to adapt it to students having the minimum preparation prescribed by the Department of Medicine. The number of THE ACADEMIC SCHOOLS. hours spent in laboratory work is smaller, but more time is given to recitations. Only students preparing to enter the Department of Medicine will be permitted to take this course, and no B. A. or B. S. credit will be allowed on it. Hours same as for Course B1. For Graduates and Undergraduates. Physics C1 and C2: Physics B1 and Mathematics B2 or the equivalent prerequisite.âEither of these courses may be a combination of two of the four subjects outlined below, each subject being pursued for one half of a year. The choice of subject in each case is determined by the purposes of the student, the approval of the professors concerned, and usually a sequence in time. Advanced laboratory exercises occupying six hours per week will be required. The character of this work may be varied to meet individual needs. The work of all these courses requires an elementary knowledge of the calculus. In order to attain this in the least passible time, the student desiring to specialize in Physics is advised to take up Mathematics A2 followed by Mathematics B3. Electricity and Magnetism.

The formal preparation necessary for these courses will vary SCHOOL OF ROMANIC LANGUAGES. somewhat with the nature of the subjects treated. What is necessary in a certain maturity of mind with reference to the subject. The student who has not had training in mathematics equivalent to Course C1 will probably be unable to follow with profit any D course dealing with the mathematical side of physics, while the student who has not had the equivalent of the corresponding C course in physics, will be unable to pursue a D course dealing with the experimental side. For the session of 1913-1914 courses will be offered in Thermodynamics and Kinetic Theory, and in General Dynamics. Hours by appointment. Associate Professor Hoxton, Adjunct Professor Sparrow. The Rouss Physical Laboratory is a commodious building, specially designed for and devoted to the work in physics. The building throughout is characterized by structural stability.

THE COLLEGE. THE COLLEGE. EDWIN ANDERSON ALDERMAN, D. C. L., LL. D. President JAMES MORRIS PAGE, M. A., Ph. D., LL. D. Dean Entrance Requirements. Required for Entrance upon the Work of the Department.âFor admission as a regular student, the preparation of the candidate should be at least the equivalent of that represented by four years of successful work in an accredited high school. For entrance to the college, as either a regular or a conditioned student, the candidate must either present satisfactory certificates, or pass the entrance examinations described in detail, pp. 71-85. The seven and one-half units which the candidate may select at will (p. 71) must be so chosen as to absolve in full the requirements for entrance upon the courses for which he desires to be registered. Admission with Advanced Standing.âThe preceding paragraph states the minimum requirements for admission to the college. Candidates for admission who have in addition completed, in an accredited secondary school, courses in English, Mathematics, Latin, or Greek, equivalent to the A courses in these subjects, and who are recommended officially and in writing by the principal of the school for such credit, may receive college credit for such courses, after conforming to the regulations regarding such advanced standing on the course in question. These regulations are given in connection with each course in the requirements for degrees in the college. Entrance with College Credit for Courses Passed at Other Colleges.âCandidates, who desire college-credit for work done at other colleges, must satisfy the entrance-requirements for regular students, and the programme of subjects offered by such candidates must conform in essentials to the degree-requirements in this college. The candidate must, in addition, file with the dean of the college a certificate covering the courses for which college-credit is desired. This certificate must be acceptable both to the dean and to the professor in charge of the course accredited. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the college; must specify the character and content of the course followed by the student; must give his grades, which should in no case fall below the standard seventy-five per cent of this university; and must recommend the student as worthy of admission to the University of Virginia in respect of both character and scholarship. The final validation of such certificates THE COLLEGE. is effected by the successful completion of the courses attended in this university. In no case will college-credit be given on more than 45 session-hours of work done elsewhere, and in every case the candidate must spend at least one regular session exclusively in college work in this university, no credit being given such candidates for the last 15 session-hours of the degree if passed in the Summer School or while enrolled in one of the professional departments. Special Students.âApplicants for registration who are more than twenty years old, and desire to enter for the pursuit of special elective courses, must present adequate proofs of good character and of the necessary maturity and training. Such applicants may then be registered by the Dean of the University as Special Students, and will be almitted without formal examination to the privileges of the university, but not as candidates for any titled degree. Such students must in all cases meet the specific entrance requirements as prescribed for the courses elected by them. Regulations. The Session-Hour.âAll undergraduate courses are measured in terms of the session-hour as a unit. The session-hour is one hour a week a session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week a session of laboratory work. Maximum and Minimum of Session-Hours in One Session.âEach student in the college is required to undertake each session courses aggregating not less than 15 nor more than 18 session-hours. Minimum Grade Required.âAny student whose average grade on all courses for any term is less than 40 per cent will be dropped from the rolls of the college. Any student whose average grade at the end of any term is more than 40 per cent, but whose grade on each of his courses is less than 65 per cent, will be put on probation for the term next ensuing. The student on probation who again makes less than 65 per cent on each of his courses will be dropped from the rolls. Grade Required for Passing.âThe grade required in the college for passing in any course is 75 per cent. Requirements for Degrees. Full opportunity has in the past been, and will in the future be, given to any student to carry out any definite plan of work which he may have in view on coming to the university, or which may have been prescribed for him by those under whose direction he is completing his education. Every student is, however, expected to come to the university for a definite purpose: and when no well considered plan as above indicated, has been outlined in advance, and THE COLLEGE. the end in view is that for which the great majority of students enter college, namely, the attainment of a liberal education, the student in question will be expected to enter upon the regular work of the college which leads to the degree of Bachelor of Arts, or to that of Bachelor of Science. Three degrees are offered candidates for graduation in the college. Each of these degrees requires four sessions of work of collegiate grade, aggregating not less than 60 session-hours. Two of these degrees, the Bachelor of Arts and the Cultural Bachelor of Science, are cultural; the Vocational Bachelor of Science in a special subject is a professional degree, designed for those students who wish to fit themselves especially in some branch of the mathematical or natural sciences as a vocation. Bachelor of Arts and Cultural Bachelor of Science. The Group System of Election. The requirements for each of the baccalaureate cultural degrees, Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science, are such as to permit of the large measure of freedom of election on the part of the individual student which has characterized the work of the university from the beginning: such restriction only being placed upon this liberty as is necessary to insure at the same time the thoroughness and the breadth of culture for which these degrees stand. In order to secure to the recipient of either degree in due measure an acquaintance with the methods of study and of thought characteristic of each of the leading departments of knowledge, as well as with their subject matter, as far as possible, his courses must be chosen,âsubject to the restrictions and exceptions detailed below,âfrom certain groups of subjects, as stated in the following sections. No elective offered by a successful candidate for one of the cultural baccalaureate degrees can be offered by the same candidate as part of the work required for the other cultural baccalaureate degree, nor can any work done toward the removal of entrance conditions be counted for any degree. A detailed account of the courses in the various groups as given below will be found under the Academic Schools, page 123, seq. A schedule of lectures and examinations in these courses will be found, p. 177. AâGroup-Electives. Group I: Languages. Each course in this group has a credit value of 3 session-hours. Nine session-hours are required in not less than 2 subjects. Candidates THE COLLEGE. for the B. A. degree must elect 6 session-hours in either Latin or Greek. Candidates for the B.

In addition to the session-hours required in group-electives, all candidates, except those who have already offered 6 hours in Latin and 6 hours in Greek, must offer 12 session-hours of electives-atlarge, chosen from the courses given in the groups above, or from the courses open to graduates and undergraduates in the graduate department (C courses). Candidates who have already offered 6 hours in Latin and 6 hours in Greek are required to offer only 9 hours of electives-at-large. English B1 may be offered as an elective-at-large either in Group I-Language, or in Group V-English. One C course offered as an elective-at-large will have a credit value of 6 session-hours. Of the 12 session-hours of electives-at-large, not less than 9 session-hours must be offered from some one group to be known as the candidate's major group. Substitutions Allowed for Electives-at-Large. Candidates who have completed in this college 48 session-hours of Group-Electives may offer, instead of 12 session-hours of Electives-at-large, the first year course in the Department of Law, or in the Department of Medicine, or 12 session-hours of technical courses in the Department of Engineering. Time Required for Obtaining the Degree of Bachelor of Arts or the Cultural Degree of Bachelor of Science. Students in the College are required to undertake each session courses aggregating not less than 15 nor more than 18 session-hours. For students, therefore, who enter without advanced standing the normal time required for graduation is 4 years. A student receiving advanced standing on not less than two A courses may obtain a baccalaureate degree in three years if he is able to complete the maximum course of 18 session-hours each session. College-credit will be given for courses in certain subjects offered in the Summer School of this university, so that a student by work in the Summer School may materially shorten the time required for obtaining a baccalaureate degree. Students entering from other colleges of recognized standing may be credited with not more than 45 session-hours, and must, therefore, spend at least one year in residence and complete not less than 15 session-hours of work in this college. The programmes of studies offered by such candidates must moreover satisfy all the requirements above stated, as to group-electives, electives-at-large and the major group. Requirements for Vocational Degrees of Bachelor of Science. A. Group Electives. Thirty session-hours. THE COLLEGE. Group I. Languages.

Major School and Electives-at-Large. Thirty Session-Hours Required. At least two years before the date of his expected graduation the candidate must select one of the schools of natural or mathematical sciences as his Major, or principal, School, and during the remainder of his candidacy must pursue work in that school. In addition to the work in his major school, the candidate shall pursue such other courses as electives-at-large as are prescribed by the professor or professors in charge of his major school and approved by the Academic Faculty. The courses in the major school and the other electives-at-large must aggregate not less than 30 session-hours. Title Conferred with Diploma. The name of the principal subject selected by the successful candidate shall be inscribed upon his diploma. For example, the THE COLLEGE. successful candidate who selected one of the schools of Chemistry, as his major school shall receive the title of "Bachelor of Science in Chemistry." Time Required for Obtaining the Vocational B. S. Degree. Undergraduate students are required to undertake in any one session courses aggregating not less than 15 nor more than 18 session-hours. Hence, the time normally required for obtaining the vocational degree of Bachelor of Science by a candidate who enters without advanced standing is four years. A candidate entering with advanced standing in Mathematics A1 and English Literature A1 may obtain the degree in three years, if he is able to complete the maximum course of 18 session-hours each session. By work in the Summer School of this university, the time required for obtaining the degree may be materially shortened. Students entering from other colleges of recognized standing may be credited with not more than 45 session-hours, and must therefore spend at least one year in residence and complete not less than 15 session-hours of work in this college. The programme of studies offered by such candidates must moreover satisfy all the requirements above stated as to group-electives, electives-at-large, and major subject. Requirements for the Vocational Degree of Bachelor of Science in Medicine. A. Group-Electives. Thirty Session-Hours. Group I. Languages. Six session-hours required, three in French and three in German. Group II. Mathematical Sciences. Three session-hours required in Mathematics A1. Group III. Natural Sciences.

Wednesday, June 10. DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. EDWIN ANDERSON ALDERMAN, D. C. L., LL. D. President RICHARD HEATH DABNEY, M. A., Ph. D. Dean Required for Enrolment in the Department.âThe possession of a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank; or, in the case of a graduate of an institution of such rank that does not confer a baccalaureate degree, presentation of a certificate of graduation in a course of study accepted by the academic faculty as fully equivalent to that ordinarily required for the degree in question. A candidate fulfilling these conditions will be registered as a graduate student if he is pursuing one or more graduate courses. Should he desire not only to enter this department, but also to become a candidate for the Master's or Doctor's degree, he should promptly secure from the Registrar of the University a blank form of application, which, when properly filled out, should be mailed to the Dean of this department, together with a catalogue of the institution from which the candidate received his baccalaureate degree. In case that institution has (1) a faculty of at least six professors giving their full time to college or university work; if it has (2) entrance requirements equal to those of this university; and if it has (3) a course of four full years in liberal arts and sciences; such candidate will not be required to do any undergraduate work here except such as the Committee on Rules and Courses or the professors in charge may consider necessary for the successful prosecution of the graduate courses elected for the higher degree. If, however, the institution in question does not meet the three conditions mentioned above, such candidate will be considered individually by the Committee on Rules and Courses, which will note especially his deficiencies, for the purpose of prescribing such courses as will supply them. Graduate in a School. Any student who successfully completes all the courses offered in any academic school is entitled to a diploma of graduation in that school; but a student thus pursuing graduate studies will not be registered as a member of this department unless he has satisfied the conditions above stated. DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. Master of Arts. The degree of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia will be conferred upon a Bachelor of Arts of this university who has completed the work in four fully organized graduate courses chosen by himself and approved by the academic faculty; each of which courses must be one in which the professor regularly meets the class not less than three hours a week. The four courses must be chosen from at least three distinct subjects distributed among three different academic schools, except by special order of the academic faculty; and three of the courses must be cognate, which means that they must be selected, for example, from such kindred groups of subjects as languages and literature, or mathematics and natural science, or history, economics and philosophy, or philosophy, education and biology, etc. Students who take such graduate courses in some subjects before receiving the B. A. degree will not be granted the M. A. degree unless they take at least two of their graduate courses in the academic year when the latter degree is conferred. Nor shall any student take the Master's degree until at least one year after the prerequisite Bachelor's degree has been conferred, except with the special consent of the Academic Faculty. A description of the courses open to candidates for the master's degree is given in its proper connection in that portion of the catalogue which treats of the work of the independent academic schools, pp. 123-167. None of these courses indicated by the letter "C" will be counted for the M. A. degree unless preceded by undergraduate work of "B" grade amounting to at least six session-hours in the same subject, or (in case only one three-session-hour course is offered in that subject) by one B course in that subject and another B course in the same Group (see p. 170); which B courses must be approved by the professor in charge of the "C" course in question. The courses indicated are also, in many cases, included among the advanced courses that may be offered as electives at large for the degree of Bachelor of Arts: credit can be obtained for any such course in but one of these capacities by the same candidate; work done for the lower degree being in no case counted again as part of the work required for the attainment of the higher degree. Master of Science. The degree of Master of Science of the University of Virginia will be conferred upon a holder of the cultural degree (p. 170) of Bachelor of Science, under regulations exactly similar to those under which the degree of Master of Arts is conferred upon a Bachelor of Arts. Candidates for the degree of Master of Science need DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. therefore,âin order to see in detail what will be required of them,â merely substitute the letters "B. S." for "B. A.," and the letters "M. S." for "M. A.," wherever "B. A." and "M. A.," respectively occur in the statement (p. 179) of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts. The degree of Master of Science will also be conferred upon the holder of the vocational degree of Bachelor of Science upon conditions similar to those required of the holder of the cultural degree; provided that the graduate courses pursued by the candidate shall be chiefly those in continuation of the principal subject of his work for the Bachelor's degree, and shall be chosen with the approval of the professor or professors concerned; and provided also that the name of this principal subject shall be inscribed upon his diploma. Doctor of Philosophy. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy of the University of Virginia will be conferred upon the holder of the B. A. or cultural B. S. degree of this university, or (under the regulations mentioned below) upon the holder of a similar degree from some other chartered institution of learning who possesses a reading knowledge of French and German, and who completes the prescribed graduate work in three cognate subjects (see p. 179), chosen by himself from at least two academic schools and approved by the academic faculty; this graduate work to be pursued for at least three years in the major subject, for at least two years in the primary minor, and for at least one year in the secondary minor subject. It is to be noted, however, that no "C" course can be counted for the Ph. D. degree unless preceded by undergraduate work of "B" grade amounting to at least six session-hours in the same subject, or (in case only one three-session-hour course is offered in that subject), by one "B" course in it and another B course in the same Group (see p. 170); which "B" courses must be approved by the professor in charge of the "C" course in question. It is also provided that any student taking the second or third year of graduate work in a subject may be required by the professor, with the approval of the academic faculty, to attend such lectures or courses in any of the academic schools as the professor may deem necessary. The "reading knowledge" of French and German mentioned above is intended to enable the candidate to pursue his chosen subjects through the medium of books and periodicals in the French and German languages. His ability to do this must be tested at the beginning of the first year of his candidacy by examinations on these languages in the presence of a committee consisting of the professor of the candidate's major subject and the professors of French and German. In case of failure on either or both of the DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. examinations, he will be required to enter the appropriate class or classes in one or both of the languages, and will not be regarded as a regular candidate for the doctorate until he has fulfilled the requirements in French and German. It is provided, however, that any student who has already passed on courses B1 and B2 in either or both of the languages at this university shall be considered as having the requisite knowledge of either or both of them, as the case may be. Graduate work done in other universities may be accepted in lieu of resident work done here, provided sufficient evidence is furnished by examination, written or oral, or both, that such work has been of a grade similar to that required here, and has been satisfactorily performed, and provided also that, while it shall be possible for a candidate to get credit in this way for the whole of his secondary minor subject, every candidate must take here at least one advanced course in his primary minor, and at least one year's work in his major subject. It is also provided that a candidate who is a professor, in charge of the subject selected by him as major, in a chartered college or university, may be allowed by the academic faculty to spend only two years in resident work at this university. The graduate work of the last year of candidacy shall in all cases be done at this university, unless the academic faculty shall for special reasons direct otherwise. Upon the completion of the approved courses, the candidate shall submit to the academic faculty a dissertation exhibiting independent research in some branch of his major subject. The dissertation must be submitted not later than April 15 of the year in which the candidate applies for the degree. Moreover, the copy presented for the faculty's approval shall be written (type-written, if feasible) on paper of prescribed quality and size; shall be bound; and shall have certain prescribed phrases on the cover and title page. If accepted as satisfactory by the faculty, this copy shall immediately become the property of the university. If approved, the dissertation must be printed at the candidate's expense before the degree is conferred, and one hundred copies deposited in the library of the university; or, if this be impracticable on account of lack of time, the candidate must deposit with the Bursar a sum of money sufficient to have a hundred copies of the dissertation printed. The instruction open to candidates for the doctor's degree in each of the academic schools is described in a preceding portion of the catalogue. No graduate course can be counted for the doctor's degree unless the professor regularly meets the class not less than three hours a week. DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses at the University for a Virginia student in the Department of Graduate Studies may be estimated at from $220 a year upward, according to the mode of living: for students from other states this minimum should be increased by a sum ranging from $90 to $130 for tuition fees. A fuller statement of expenses, including the conditions under which Virginia or other students are entitled to free tuition, will be found on pp. 102-103. Applicants for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy who are granted the privilege of non-residence during a portion of their candidacy, under conditions above stated, are required to matriculate and pay the annual university fee of $40 if not Virginians, and $10 if Virginians, during such period of non-residence.

Historical.âAmong the original schools contemplated in Mr. Jefferson's plan for the organization of the University of Virginia was "Law: Municipal and Foreign; Embracing the General Principles, Theory, and Practice of Jurisprudence, together with the Theory and Principles of Constitutional Government." Accordingly the School of Law was established in 1826, and has been in continuous operation since. From its inception until 1894, the course comprised the work of a single year. With the session of 1894-95, a two years' course was DEPARTMENT OF LAW. inaugurated, which continued up to the session of 1909-10, when the course was extended to three years. The aim of the Department of Law has always been to maintain a high standard as a requirement for graduationâthe degree being conferred only upon such students as are thorough masters of the prescribed course of study. This policy has been rigorously enforced, and its wisdom has been vindicated by the high position which the graduates of the law school are accustomed to attain at the bar or in public life. The course of instruction has been extended from time to time to conform to changing conditions and to meet the increasing needs of the profession. It is believed that the course exhibited in the following pages will enable those who complete it more surely to maintain that rank at the bar which the University has always expected of her sons. Minor Hall.âBy action of the visitors, the new home of the Law School has been named Minor Hall, in honor of the late John B. Minor, whose distinguished service of fifty years as a professor of the Law School, the University thus commemorates. The building is located between Dawson's Row and the southern end of West Range. The architecture is on classic lines, in keeping with the general design of the other university buildings. It contains on the first floor four large lecture halls, with convenient offices, cloak rooms, etc., and on the second floor a stack room, with ample space for books, two commodious reading rooms, and a number of small private rooms for special work. Liberal provision has been made for heat, light, and ventilation. Special care has been taken to provide comfortable seats and desks in the lecture halls. Law Library.âThe Library contains about eleven thousand volumes. Its financial resources, from appropriations by the Visitors, and from an endowment of ten thousand dollars by Mr. W. W. Fuller, of New York, make possible the addition of several hundred volumes annually. The Library contains the English Reports, from and including the Year Books to date; the United States Supreme Court Reports; reports of all the American States; the National Reporter System, complete; modern selected and annotated reports, such as the American Decisions, Reports and State Reports, Lawyers Reports Annotated, American and English Annotated Reports, English Ruling Cases, etc., together with modern search-books in the form of general Digests (including the Century and Decennial editions), and the leading Encyclopedias, besides a large collection of text-books, bound volumes of law magazines, etc. Law students have all the privileges of the general University Library, containing more than sixty thousand volumes, without extra charge. Suggestions as to Preliminary Education.âStudents, and their parents or guardians, are warned that the law is peculiarly an intellectual DEPARTMENT OF LAW. profession, and demands for its successful prosecution, whether in the Law School or in the broader fields of professional life, a well-trained mind. If it be true that untrained recruits, in rare instances, under diligent and persistent effort, develop into successful practitioners after entrance upon the practice, such exceptional cases but serve to illustrate the rule that out of a given number of young men entering upon the study of the law, those with sound preliminary training will have incomparably the advantage, while those without it are likely never to rise above mediocrity in their profession. The experience of the Law Facultyânay, of all law teachersâis, that the standing and progress of law students may, in general, be measured by their academic preparation. Young gentlemen are therefore advised not to begin their legal studies until they have completed an academic course approximating that required for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. So high a standard, however, is not exacted as a condition of entrance into the Law School. These conditions are shown in the following sections. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. Regular Students.âCandidates for the degree of Bachelor of Laws must have attained the age of eighteen years before entering the department, must produce a certificate of good character from the school last attended or other satisfactory source, and must conform to the general requirements following: For Admission to the Department of Law the candidate must offer fourteen units as specified below; of these three must be in English, two and one-half in Mathematics, one in History, and the residue selected at will. The Subjects accepted for Admission and their values in units are given in tabulated form on the following page. The applicant for admission may either enter (1) by certificate or (2) by examination. (1) For Admission by Certificate the candidate must file with the dean of the university not later than September first a Certificate of Preparation, made out on the blank form furnished by the university. This certificate must come from some recognized institution of collegiate rank or from an accredited high school; but admission by certificate from accredited public high schools in Virginia is extended only to graduates from four-year high schools. The certificate must bear in all cases the signature of the head of the school; must specify the character and content of each course DEPARTMENT OF LAW. offered for entrance credit; must give the length of time devoted to the course, and the dates of the examinations; and must give the candidate's grades in percentages. Each unit in the entrance requirements is the equivalent of one full year of high-school work, including five periods a week of at least forty minutes each during not less than thirty-six weeks. For schools in which the number of periods given to any study, or the length of the period, is below the standard here specified, the credit for such study will be reduced pro rata. In the scientific subjects two hours of laboratory instruction will be counted as the equivalent of one hour of recitation. High school courses in Physics and Chemistry, otherwise adequate, will be allowed half credit, when individual laboratory work is not done by the student or is not attested by proper note-books filed with the certificate. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must in all cases take the Entrance Examinations. (2) For Admission by Examination the candidate must present himself for test at the University in June or in September, according to the dates given in the Programme of Entrance Examinations, which may be had by applying to the Registrar. The examinations are held under the honor system, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge. All candidates who take their examinations at the times appointed are tested free of charge. In case of delayed entrance, where the grounds of postponement are good, the president of the university may admit the candidate to a special examination, for which an additional fee of five dollars is charged. The fee is payable in advance and is in no case returned. Satisfactory certificates as to character and age are in all cases required. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. SUBJECTS ACCEPTED FOR ADMISSION.

Such applicants may then be registered as Special Students, and will be admitted without formal examination to the privileges of the Law School, but not as candidates for the degree. With the admonition that over-zealousness is apt to beguile an ambitious student into the assumption of more work than he can thoroughly master in a given time, leading to cramming and DEPARTMENT OF LAW. inaccuracy, and often to complete failure, the special student is free to select his own work, within the limits permitted by the regulation set out below. Admission to Advanced Standing.âNo credit is given for attendance at another law school, nor for time spent in private reading. The candidate for graduation must spend three years in residence. Late Entrance.âRegistration commences Thursday, September 11, and the work of the Law School begins promptly on Monday following. Students are advised that late entrance is a serious hindrance to progress. The student who enters late must begin his work at the point to which the work has advanced at the time of his entrance: and credit for three years' attendance cannot be secured unless the student is in actual residence at least thirty weeks per session. No registration in absentia is permissible. As regards conditions of admission in case of late entrance, reference is made to the regulations concerning Registration, as stated in General University Catalogue. Expenses.âThe necessary expenses of a student in the Department of Law may be estimated at $350 per session of nine months. This minimum estimate includes all university and tuition fees, board, lodging, washing and books. An average estimate would be $450 per session, reckoning board, lodging, washing, and books at a somewhat higher figure. The University fee applicable to all law students (including those from Virginia) is $40; and the tuition fee is $100 for the regular work of each session. For Special Students who desire to take selected courses, the tuition fee is estimated according to the ratio which the work chosen bears to the whole. Three Years' Course.âThe course of study embraces three years of thirty-six weeks each, exclusive of holidays. Residence, for three years, with an attendance of at least thirty weeks a year, exclusive of holidays, is essential to graduation. Plan of Instruction.âThe course is planned with a view to acquaint the student familiarly and practically with the principles of his profession. Care is taken to teach him to think for himself, and to rely upon reason and principle, rather than upon memory; it being considered better that the student follow principle to its legitimate conclusion, though this be at variance with the decisions of the courts, than that he should arrive at a faultless result by the exercise of memory or by accident. The instruction is as thorough as possible, and is given partly through text-books and lectures, and partly through the study of cases. While convinced of the value of the combined text-book and lecture system, which has prevailed for more than half a century DEPARTMENT OF LAW. in the Law School, and from which, in the inauguration of the more extended course, it is not meant in any wise to depart, the Law Faculty have long appreciated the value which the study of cases possesses, in illustrating the practical application of legal principles, and in forcing the student to extract for himself the doctrine which the cases establish. The enlargement of the course gives opportunity for more emphasis upon this form of instruction, and the case-book will, therefore, be used more extensively than heretoforeânot as supplanting, but as supplementing, the text-book and lecture. The daily oral quiz has long been a marked and, as experience has proved, a most valuable feature of the system of instruction. As cross-examination exposes error and develops truth, so the daily quiz enables the instructor to discover and rectify misconception of legal principles on the part of the student. This oral quiz is supplemented by frequent written tests, the results of which are carefully recorded, and, in the professor's discretion, are considered in estimating the final grade of the student. Moot Court.âA Moot Court is organized by the students in the First Year's course for the discussion of legal questions. Its meetings begin at the opening and continue to the end of the session, with such interruptions only as are incident to the proximity of the examinations. Attendance is voluntary, as presence during the debates is intended to be a privilege and not a burden. But every candidate for the degree is required to argue at least one case in the Moot Court. The questions are chosen by the Law Faculty, one of whom presides over the discussions. Interest and life are added to the proceedings by the open debate held after the argument, the presiding judge acting as interlocutor, and leading into the debate those whom diffidence prompts to silence. Legal Argumentation.âThe addition to the work of the third year of an advanced course on Legal Argumentation, is contemplated. If established, the course will be elective for the sessions 1913-1914 and 1914-1915, and obligatory thereafter. Should the plan mature, this additional course, supplemented by the courses on Brief-Making and Forensic Debating will probably absorb the present work of the Moot Court. Practical Work.âIn the courses of Equity Procedure, Virginia Pleading and Practice, Code Pleading, Criminal Procedure, and Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, special stress is laid upon practical work. In the Pleading and Procedure courses, every student is required to draw, and submit for correction and criticism. all of the principal pleadings, orders, decrees, and other forms usual in actual litigation. In the course on Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, familiarity with Law books and their use is secured by lectures DEPARTMENT OF LAW. and demonstrations in the presence of the books, followed by oral and written quizzes, and finally by practical tests; and briefs on assigned topics are required to be prepared according to rigorous standards. Required for Graduation.âThe degree of Bachelor of Laws (LL. B.) is conferred upon such students as have attained the age of twenty-one years; have satisfied the entrance requirements; have attended three full sessions of the Law School; and have successfully passed the required examinations, with satisfactory performance of assigned practical work. More specifically, the candidate for graduation must have completed all of the obligatory courses (see Outline of Courses, below), the credit value of which is eight hundred and four (804) units, and elective courses of at least the credit value of forty-six (46) units âor a total of eight hundred and fifty (850) units. It follows that of the courses termed "elective," a required minimum is in fact obligatoryâthe candidate being permitted to exercise an election among them. OUTLINE OF COURSES. The entire course of three years embraces 1053 units (or lecture periods of one and a half hours each) and to each subject satisfactorily completed is attached a credit value of one unit for each hour and a half of class work comprised therein. Of the total units, 804 are classed as obligatory and the remaining 249 as elective. As stated, graduation requires the completion of all the obligatory courses (credit value 804), plus elective courses having a credit value of at least 46 unitsâor a minimum required total of 850 units. This contemplates an average of nine lecture periods (or 13 1-2 hours) per week during the first and second years, and eight periods (or 12 hours) the third year. Each session comprises 36 weeks, exclusive of holidays, and is divided into three termsâSept. 15 to Dec. 23âJan. 3 to March 21â and March 22 to June 6. Written examinations are held during the final week of each term, on the subjects completed during the term. See Schedule of Examinations, p. 199.

DEPARTMENT OF LAW. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. GENERAL REGULATIONS. 1. Registration of New Students.âBefore registration in the Law School, students who have not before been registered in any department of the University, must produce to the Dean of the Law School (office in Minor Hall), a certificate from the Dean of the University (office, No. 6 East Lawn), that entrance requirements have been fulfilled. 2. Registration Generally.âStudents must register in advance at the Dean's office and with the Registrar for every course taken, and no credit will be given for courses taken without proper registration. 3. Exchange or Omission of Courses.âAfter registration therefor, no course may be exchanged or omitted except on the written approval of the professor in charge and of the Dean. 4. Work for Which Student May Register.âNo candidate for the degree is permitted to register, in any year, for courses aggregating more than 450 unitsâincluding subjects taken but not completed in a previous year, nor, in any case, for new courses aggregating more than 350 units. No student, without special permission, and for good cause, may register for less than six periods per week. 4a. Advanced Work.âStudents of one year are not permitted to anticipate any of the courses of a subsequent year, without urgent reasons satisfactory to the Dean. 5. Late Entrance into Classes.âNo credit will be given for the completion of any course upon which the student has entered after fifty per centum of the lectures thereon have been delivered. 6. Optional Attendance.âA student who has attended the required lectures upon any subject may, on written application, with the endorsed approval of the professor in charge, and of the Dean, secure optional attendance on such subjects the following sessionâ provided the exercise of this privilege does not reduce his lecture periods below eight per week. 7. Attendance and Work.âEvery student of the Law School is required to attend all regular exercises of the classes of which he DEPARTMENT OF LAW. is a member, and to perform all the work assigned, including quizzes and examinations, unless excused for good cause by the Faculty. Students whose condition of health is too precarious to permit regular attendance upon lectures, but not serious enough to admit them as patients of the hospital, will be required to withdraw from the University until able to resume their regular work. 8. Conditions for Re-Admission.âAny student who, without satisfactory cause, has not attained for the session, on his examinations, a credit of 100 units, or, in lieu thereof, a grade of 75 per centum on each of two or more courses aggregating 150 units, will be excluded from the Law School the following session. The result of one or more special examinations, granted for cause under existing regulations, may be considered in determining whether this requirement has been met. The foregoing provisions do not affect third-year students applying for re-admission, nor students who have been permitted, for cause, to take less than two-thirds of a full year's work. Such students will be subject to exclusion or other conditions as the Law Faculty may prescribe. In this connection, attention is called to Regulation 4 foregoing, limiting the amount of work which any student may register for in a single year. 9. Students Admitted on Terms by reason of previous unsatisfactory record in the Law School, or other department of the University, shall be held to an average class grade (or examination grade, in classes in which class grades are not recorded) of eighty per centum, in the work of the first term. Failure to attain this grade without satisfactory cause shall operate to exclude such delinquent from the Law School for the remainder of the session. An average class grade of less than eighty per centum, at the end of any term, will be regarded as evidence of a lack of the diligence required by the terms of this condition. 9a. First-Year Students.âFailure on the part of any first-year student, without just cause, to attain, for the first term, an average grade of seventy-five per centum on the daily written quizzes, will place such student on probation for the remainder of the session, and the student and his parent or guardian will be so notified. Unless, in the opinion of the Law Faculty, a decided improvement in the character of such student's work is indicated at the end of the second term, he will be required to withdraw from the Law School. 10. Special Examinations.âNo special examinations are granted, save in cases of sickness on the day of examination (attested by DEPARTMENT OF LAW. physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause approved by the Law Faculty. In no case will such examination be granted, unless prompt application be made therefor. 11. Re-ExaminationsâThird Year Students.âCandidates for the degree, who have failed on one or more subjects during their third year, may return the following session, and stand the regular examinations on such subjects, without further attendance upon lectures. But this privilege may be exercised but onceâthat is to say, after a second failure the candidate must take the lectures over again, on the subject or subjects on which he has for a second time proved deficient. 12. Examination Fees.âThe fee for standing such examinations as are mentioned in the preceding regulation, is five dollars for each examination taken. Students who, under such circumstances, return for further lectures, and who have paid full matriculation and tuition fees for three years, pay a matriculation fee in proportion to the amount of work taken plus $5 for each course taken. There is no charge for special examinations granted for imperative cause. 13. Application for Degree.âCandidates for graduation are required to file a written application with the Dean, not later than November 15 of their third year, stating the courses completed, with the credit value of each, together with a schedule of the courses to be pursued during their final year, with the credit value of such courses attached. Blanks for this purpose will be supplied on application to the Dean. 14. Required Withdrawal.âThe right is reserved to require the withdrawal of any student who, in the opinion of the Faculty, is not profiting, nor likely to profit, by the instruction offered, or whose neglect or irregular performance of required duties, after admonition, indicates indifference or contumacy.

The number of students in the first year class is limited to thirty-six. Further information concerning the character of these requirements and forms for certificates may be obtained by addressing the Dean of the Department of Medicine, or Mr. Howard Winston, Registrar, at the University. Requirements for Admission to the Department of Medicine Beginning with the Session 1914-15.âApplicants for admission to the Department of Medicine are required to present the diploma of a recognized institution of collegiate rank; or a certificate of good standing in such an institution; or the diploma of a recognized public or private high school having a four years' course, or acceptable certificates which represent work equivalent in amount and character to such a high-school course; and, in addition, to present evidence of the completion of at least one year's work in Inorganic (General) Chemistry, Physics, and Biology at an approved institution of collegiate rank. Candidates for admission will be required also to present satisfactory evidence of a reading knowledge of at least one modern language besides English, preferably German. The completion of a year's work in ZoÃ¶logy or Botany will be accepted as satisfying the requirement in Biology. A student may be admitted conditioned on any one of the above subjects except Chemistry, this condition to be removed before entering on the work of the second year. The requirement in Biology may be waived in the case of graduates of approved colleges and universities. Facilities for and Methods of Instruction.âIn recent years many additions have been made to the laboratory facilities of the Department, so that there are now well equipped laboratories for the study of Organic and Physiological Chemistry, Gross Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Bacteriology and Pathology, Physiology, Pharmacology, Materia Medica, and Clinical Diagnosis. These laboratories are all presided over by trained teachers, to whom teaching and investigation are primary considerations. The number of hours assigned to the laboratory subjects is quite large and affords ample time for thorough study of the best methods. The student is brought into close contact with teachers who are both willing and able to guide him; he gains a very large part of his knowledge at first hand and by his own exertions, and thus acquires the habit of working out things for himself; he becomes self-reliant, a quality essential to the practice of his difficult profession. Trained in this manner he acquires an understanding of the medical sciences and the ability to apply the facts of these sciences to the subsequent DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. study of disease. For these reasons the great fundamental sciences receive the utmost consideration, constituting the entire work of the first two years. The methods of clinical instruction are based upon the belief that no clinical teaching is efficient which is not governed by essentially the same principles as those which govern the best laboratory teaching. This instruction is accordingly designed to enforce with the individual student a careful, thorough, face-to-face study of disease and its management. The facilities afforded by the University Hospital and Dispensary are described on a subsequent page. After two sessions devoted to laboratory training, the student is introduced in the third year, to the study of disease in living persons. In the dispensary and in the hospital he learns the methods of examining patients, of diagnosing their diseases, and of instituting rational treatment; and he learns these things in much the same way as he studied in the laboratory, that is to say, by doing them himself under the direction and criticism of the instructors. This practical training is accompanied by a systematic study of the various subjects by means of lectures, text-books, and recitations. With this preparation the student is ready to enter upon the hospital work in his fourth year. Here he has advantages for clinical training similar to those enjoyed by internes. Each clinical patient on admission to the hospital is assigned to a student, and that patient is regarded as his "case." The student conducts a complete examination, records his observations in a scientific manner, makes a diagnosis, states his view as to the treatment indicated, and keeps a complete record of the case, all under the advice and criticism of the physician or surgeon in charge. He is expected to keep himself informed of the progress of the case throughout its course; if it is one requiring surgical treatment, he assists at the operation, and thus is able to follow all the procedures of the operator at close range. In addition students make frequent visits to the wards with the attending physicians and surgeons, during which visits the nature, treatment, and progress of various cases are gone over in detail. To carry out this method of clinical instruction the Hospital had last year over 1,700 cases. Since the number of students in each class is relatively small, it is clear that the department offers capable young men clinical advantages which are distinctly exceptional. Opportunities are offered in the third and fourth years for more extended training in certain subjects with a view toward possible specialization after graduation. At the meetings of the Medical Section of the Philosophical Society reviews of important articles and results of original research are presented by the instructors and by invited guests. These meetings are open to the students. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Regulations.âThe records given after the regular examination on a course, with their explanations, are as follows: Passed indicates the satisfactory completion of the course and admits to all dependent subjects. Conditioned means that to obtain a clear record on the course the student must pass the next examination. Failure to take or to pass this examination is equivalent to a record of "failed." The record "conditioned" is not given in fourth year subjects, except in case of illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty. Deficient indicates that part of the work of the course has not been completed. Upon the satisfactory completion of this work within the time and in the manner prescribed by the professor in charge the student receives the record "passed;" otherwise the record is "failed" on the entire course. Failed indicates that the course must be repeated; except that when the laboratory or other practical work has been satisfactorily performed, the professor in charge may, at his discretion, excuse the student from repeating the same; and, by special vote of the faculty, the student may be granted optional attendance upon the course, in whole or in part. In general a student who is repeating a course will be required to attend all the exercises of the course, and will not be excused from any exercise thereof because of schedule conflicts with more advanced work. Absence from a regular examination, when excused because of illness or other equivalent cause, gives a record of conditioned; if not excused, a record of failed. To pass a regular or a special examination a grade of eighty per cent. is required. If the grade is less than eighty per cent. but not less than seventy per cent., the student is entitled to the record conditioned; but the record "conditioned" is not given in fourth year subjects, except under the conditions noted above. No student will be admitted to any subject of the second or the third year (save by the consent of the Dean and the professors concerned), if more than one-third of the work of the preceding year remains unfinished. If at the beginning of the year his deficiencies have not been made up by the satisfactory completion of courses at some school approved by the instructors in charge at this university, he may continue as a student in the Department of Medicine only by repeating the courses in which he has failed. In the interpretation of this rule the values of the subjects of the first and second years are estimated in points as follows: Anatomy 1, 16 points; Anatomy 2, 5 points; Organic Chemistry, 15 points; Histology, 14 points; Embryology, 6 points; Physiological Chemistry, 8 points. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Anatomy 3, 16 points; Physiology, 20 points; Bacteriology, 8 points; Pathology, 20 points; Pharmacology, 8 points. Students will not be allowed to undertake the work of the third or fourth year until they have completed that of the first year, save by special consent of the Medical Faculty. A student may not take any course, either in whole or in part (as explained under the above definition of "failed") more than two times. A second record of "failed" on the same course involves withdrawal from the Department of Medicine. Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine, who have less than one full year's course to complete, may be required to take such additional work and to pass such additional examinations as the medical faculty may prescribe. This additional work may be selected from any of the courses given in the Department of Medicine, even when such prescribed courses have previously been taken and passed by the candidate in question. Advanced Standing.âStudents are admitted to advanced standing in the second and third years under the following conditions: 1. Satisfaction of the requirements for entrance into this Department. 2. The presentation of a certificate from an accredited school of medicine showing that the applicant has completed work equivalent to that maintained by this Department in each subject for which credit is sought. Applicants complying with these conditions will be admitted to advanced standing without examination. Applicants who have not completed all of the work of the year or years preceding that to which they seek admission are admitted to the Fall Examinations under the conditions stated in the subsequent paragraph on Examinations. The right is reserved in every case to obtain satisfactory evidence of the genuineness of a certificate by correspondence with the proper authority of the school from which the applicant comes. Certificates of Attendance.âStudents who attend the whole regular course of one or more of the four years are entitled to certificates of attendance. Requirements for Graduation.âThe degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred by the University of Virginia upon candidates who have complied with the entrance requirements of this Department; attended a regular medical course of four years of at least eight months each, the last two of which must have been at this institution; and have satisfactorily completed all of the subjects included in the medical course. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Examinations.âThese are in writing, accompanied in many subjects by individual practical examinations. The regular examinations are held at stated periods during the session. In addition, examinations are held each year during the week immediately preceding the beginning of lectures. To the latter are admitted: 1. Students of the previous session who, from illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty, were unable to present themselves for examination in any particular subject at the regular time. 2. Students who at the regular examination in any first, second, or third year subject of the preceding session have attained a grade less than eighty per cent., but as much as seventy per cent. on one or more subjects, as explained in a preceding paragraph; or any student who has received the record of "conditioned" on a course taken in this University. 3. Certain applicants for advanced standing, who satisfy the requirements stated under "Advanced Standing," and meet the above conditions of this section. The Fall Examinations for 1913-1914 begin September eighth and close September thirteenth. Students entitled to admission to these examinations will be informed of the date of examination by the Dean. Expenses.âThe tuition fees for students entering the Department of Medicine prior to September 1912 are $110 for the first year, $100 for the second year, $80 for the third year, and $60 for the fourth year. For students entering after September 1, 1912 the tuition fee for each year is $100. The annual expenses exclusive of tuition are $40 for the university fee (which entitles the student to the use of the library, the gymnasium, to medical attention, etc.), an average of about $200 for living expenses, and $20 for books. In the courses in Organic and Physiological Chemistry a deposit of $10 is required to cover cost of breakage. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. In the following description of courses, the number of hours represents the amount of time each student devotes to the course. In addition to the hours scheduled in the third and fourth years of the course, each student devotes a considerable amount of time to practical work which does not appear in the schedule, but the satisfactory performance of which is essential to graduation. Thus the taking of histories, the visits to his cases in the hospital, assisting at operations, attendance upon cases of labour, the employment of microscopial and chemical methods of diagnosis in the hospital, require much time which it has not seemed possible to record in a rigid schedule. It should, however, be stated that each student in the fourth year gives at least two hundred hours to this required but unscheduled practical work. The session, exclusive of the time devoted to examinations, is divided into a fall term of twelve weeks, a winter term of ten weeks, and a spring term of ten weeks. FIRST YEAR. Anatomy 1.âSix hours weekly until November 1st; twelve hours weekly from November 1st to the end of the winter term. This course begins with a systematic study of the bones, on the completion of which a part (either the head and neck with the upper extremity and thorax, or the lower extremity and abdomen) is assigned to each student for dissection and study. For this purpose each cadaver is considered as composed of four parts; on the completion of this course and Anatomy 3 each student has dissected a lateral half of the body. Emphasis is placed upon the benefit to be derived by the student who obtains his knowledge at first hand and by his own personal efforts. While practical dissection and the consideration of topographical relations make up the essential features of the course, there are occasional lectures and frequent recitations, followed by a final written examination in March. The satisfactory performance of the laboratory work is essential to a passing grade. Dr. Whitehead. Anatomy 2.âSix hours weekly during the spring term. This course consists in a laboratory study of the anatomy of the central nervous system carried out in considerable detail. The gross anatomy of the spinal cord and brain is first considered, on the completion of DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. which sections of the more important regions are studied carefully with the aid of the microscope. For the purposes of the course the laboratory is well equipped. Fresh brains are obtained each year from the dissecting material of the departments; and several excellent series of sections of the cord and brain both of infants and adults stained by the Weigert-Pal method are thoroughly used. The laboratory work is supplemented by recitations and occasional lectures. Dr. Whitehead. Histology.âThree lectures or recitations and nine hours of laboratory work weekly during the fall and winter terms. The student's record in the course will depend upon his recitations, laboratory drawing books, and final examination, both written and practical. The course aims to acquaint the student primarily with the microscopic structure of cells, tissues, and organs. Cytogenesis and histogenesis are briefly considered in the case of many tissues studied; and the relation of the whole subject of histology to pathology is never lost sight of. The student is also given opportunity to acquaint himself with the principles and practice of histological technique. The laboratory is excellently equipped with microscopes, paraffin baths, microtomes, a micropolariscope, a projectoscope and other accessories essential to the most favorable presentation of this course. A record of seventy per cent. in this course is required for admission to Physiology, and of eighty per cent. for admission to Pathology. Dr. Jordan and Mr. Steele. Embryology.âNine hours weekly during the spring term. The laboratory work (six hours weekly) is accompanied by lectures, recitations, and the study of models and text-books. The course aims to give the student a knowledge of developmental processes, in the light of which he may the better understand the more abstruse normal conditions of adult anatomy, as well as many anomalies and variations, neoplasms and malformations. The close correlation of obstetrics is recognized, and a correct knowledge of the fetus and its membranes is taught from the embryological approach. The course is made as practical as possible for the student and practitioner of medicine. It begins with a consideration of maturation phenomena, fertilization, segmentation, and the development of the germ-layers. This study is made chiefly upon the ova and early stages of an invertebrate, followed by a comparison in an amphibian. The chick is used for the primary relations of the systems to one another; and this is followed by the study of pig embryos, where each system is taken up separately and the organology and histogenesis of its parts are studied. Finally, the fetal membranes and their relations to the fetus and uterus are studied in their variations among the amniota. Dr. Jordan and Mr. Steele. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Organic Chemistry.âLectures and recitations three hours weekly, laboratory work six hours weekly during the fall and winter terms. This course includes the systematic study of organic chemistry or the chemistry of the compounds of carbon, with special reference to substances of importance in their relation to medicine. The object of this course of study is to familiarize the student with the more important organic compounds and with the methods at present employed in chemical synthesis and to lay the foundation for subsequent work in physiological chemistry, pharmacology, etc., etc. A record of seventy per cent. on this course is required for admission to Physiological Chemistry. Dr. Edgar and Mr. Diggs. Physiological Chemistry.âThree lectures, three recitations and nine hours of laboratory work weekly during the spring term. This course has for its object to afford instruction in the fundamentals of physiological chemistry, especially the chemical structure, properties, and reactions of the most important compounds with which the student must deal in his subsequent studies of physiology. The laboratory work, for which ample facilities are provided, consists of the thorough study of the properties of the carbonhydrates, fats, soaps, fatty acids, and proteins, and of the more important members of each of these groups; the composition of blood, milk, muscle, pancreas, and other organs; the action of the more important digestive enzymes and of the bile; and the chemistry of the urine. Accurate quantitative determinations are required of urea (Folin), total nitrogen (Kjeldahl), uric acid (Hopkins-Folin), ammonia (Folin), sugar (Fehling and Benedict), and kreatinin (Folin). Other processes of quantitative analysis, such as the Soxhlet method of fat determination and the silver nitrate method of determining the total purins, are either demonstrated or their essential manipulations carried out by the student himself. The exceptional preparation of students not only in general but also in organic chemistry makes it possible to acquire in this course both a clear understanding of the problems of physiological chemistry, and also skill in the use of the fundamental qualitative and quantitative methods. A grade of seventy per cent. on this course is required for admission to Physiology. Dr. Hough, Dr. Edgar, and Mr. Diggs. SECOND YEAR. Anatomy 3.âTen hours weekly from October 1st through the fall and winter terms. This course is the continuation of Anatomy 1, and consists of the systematic dissection and study, by essentially the same methods, of the parts not studied during the first year. Mr. Williams. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Physiology.âFour hours weekly of lectures, recitations, and demonstrations throughout the year; six hours weekly of laboratory work in the fall and winter terms. The physiology of muscle and nerve; blood and lymph; the circulation; respiration; secretion; digestion and nutrition; excretion; the sense organs; and the central nervous system. The laboratory is equipped with kymographs, induction coils, signals, muscle and heart levers, tambours, manometers, apparatus for gas analysis, etc., for thirty men working at one time in pairs. The work of the laboratory closely follows the lectures and is an integral part of the study of each subject. The student becomes practically acquainted with the methods of modern physiological investigation and is required to hand in tracings or other records together with full descriptions of his experiments. The satisfactory completion of the laboratory work is as necessary to a clear record on the course as is the passing of the final examinations. Open only to students who have obtained a grade of seventy per cent. in Histology and in Physiological Chemistry. The satisfactory completion of the laboratory work of this course is necessary for admission to Pharmacology. Dr. Hough and Dr. Crider. Bacteriology and Pathology.âThirteen hours weekly throughout the year, and two additional hours a week in the third term. In Bacteriology the student is taught to prepare culture media and to employ the usual methods necessary for the isolation and identification of bacteria, and he studies the microÃ¶rganisms concerned in the common bacterial diseases. After a few days have been spent in making culture media, sterilization, etc., the general technique is learned by isolating the bacteria from the air, soil, water and milk, and from exposed body surfaces. Bacterial counts are made from water and milk. Following this, the pathogenic bacteria are taken up serially. Those receiving special attention are the bacteria concerned in wound infections, in respiratory and intestinal diseases, and in tuberculosis. At intervals mixed cultures are given out to the class and the students are required to isolate and identify the bacteria in the mixtures. Experimental work upon infection and immunity accompanies the course in Bacteriology and Pathology. The students inoculate animals with certain pathogenic bacteria and report to the class upon the course of disease resulting from the inoculation. In fatal cases the students perform autopsies upon the experimental animals and attempt to recover the bacteria in cultures. Sections are made from the organs of the animals which succumb to inoculation and are studied by the students. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Groups of students prepare vaccines and immunize animals. The serum of these animals is employed by the class in studying the technique of the more important immunity reactions. In this way the work in Bacteriology is integrally combined with the work in Pathology, the two courses overlapping. The lectures and quizzes which accompany the Laboratory work are designed to set forth clearly the relations existing between bacteria and disease and to give a knowledge of the fundamental facts and theories of immunity and of the important principles of preventive medicine. The course in Pathology extends from January to June. The greater part of the practical work is devoted to the study of the microscopic changes occurring in disease. This is supplemented by the study of autopsy material and museum specimens. Selected types of diseases are studied experimentally. The practical work includes the consideration of the vascular disturbances, degeneration, inflammation, regeneration, and of benign and malignant tumors. The diseases produced by animal parasites are considered briefly. During the course the student has an opportunity to learn the standard methods employed in preparing tissues for examination, and he is called upon to witness and assist in the autopsies. A lecture and quiz precedes the practical work each day and in addition selected topics are discussed more fully in lectures. Both in Bacteriology and Pathology frequent recitations are held and the standing of the student is determined largely from these and from the character of his daily practical work. In addition to the regular course outlined above, opportunity is afforded for qualified students and doctors to engage in advanced work. During the present session, six selected students, who have completed their work in Bacteriology and Pathology, and one interne from the Hospital are engaged in advanced work upon problems relating to pathologic histology and bacteriology. A special room is reserved for this purpose. The work in Pathology is open only to students who have obtained a record of eighty per cent. in Histology. Dr. Marshall, Dr. Mundy, Mr. Dale, and Mr. Jackson. Pharmacology.âFive hours of lectures, recitations, and demonstrations and six hours of laboratory work weekly during the third term. In this course a study is made of the chemical characteristics and physiological action of representative drugs from the different pharmacological groups. The satisfactory completion of the laboratory work of Physiology is required for admission to the course. Dr. Waddell and Dr. Crider. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Physical Diagnosis.âFour hours weekly during the spring term. Instruction is given in the principles and methods of physical examination. Attention is especially given to study of the normal subject. Dr. Flippin. THIRD YEAR. Materia Medica.âThree hours of lectures and recitations and four hours of laboratory work weekly during the first half of the third year. The more important drugs and preparations of the Pharmacopeia, together with newer non-official remedies which bid fair to attain or have attained considerable use, form the subject of study. In the laboratory the student becomes familiar with the peculiarities and methods of preparation of the different preparations of the Pharmacopeia, as well as with the solubilities and other characteristics of the more important drugs. Especial attention is paid to chemical and pharmaceutical incompatibility. Prescription writing is dealt with by lecture and frequent practical exercises. Dr. Waddell. Toxicology.âThree hours of lectures and recitation and three hours of laboratory work weekly during the last half of the second term. This course is to a considerable extent a review of the pharmacological actions of poisons and their antagonists. The treatment of poisoning is dealt with in detail. Some attention is given to the methods of separation and identification. Dr. Waddell. Clinical Diagnosis.âSix hours weekly during the fall and winter terms. In this course the student is made familiar with those modern laboratory methods which are practically helpful in the diagnosis of disease. These include, among others, the systematic examination of blood, sputum, urine, gastric contents, feces, exudates, transudates, and milk. The student is not only required to understand the methods employed in such examinations, but by practice to acquire the skill necessary for accurate results. The instruction is given in the new Clinical Laboratory, situated in the north wing of the Hospital. This laboratory is well equipped with instruments and apparatus, and the wards of the Hospital furnish ample material for the proper presentation of the subject. Dr. Flippin and Dr. Woodberry. Theory and Practice of Medicine.âThree hours weekly of lectures and recitations throughout the year; nine hours weekly in the clinics for one half the session. A systematic course of lectures, supplemented by work in the Dispensary and Hospital. The class is divided into two sections, each of which devotes itself for half the year to the medical service in the Dispensary and also twice a week receives instruction on selected cases in the wards of the Hospital. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. There is a general medical clinic once a week in the hospital amphitheater for the third and fourth year students. Dr. Davis, Dr. Flippin, Dr. Magruder, Dr. Nelson. Surgery and Gynecology.âFive hours weekly of lectures and recitations, and two hours weekly of surgical clinic throughout the session, with six hours weekly in the Dispensary for one half the session. The study of Surgery begins in the third year and continues through the fourth year. In the third year the class room work consists of lectures and recitations, as arranged in the schedule, in which the Principles and Practice of Surgery, Surgical Diseases, Surgical Diagnosis, etc., are thoroughly discussed. This also includes the surgical specialities, Orthopedics, Genito-urinary Surgery, etc. The Dispensary course in the third year gives opportunities for diagnosis and treatment of clinical cases under close personal supervision. Experience in dressings, bandaging, anesthesia, and minor surgery is afforded. Surgical appliances and technique are demonstrated to the students, divided into small groups. The work in Gynecology follows closely the outlines already described for surgery. The general principles of gynecology are taken up in lectures and recitations. In addition, the dispensary affords practice in palpation, diagnosis and treatment. Dr. Watts and Dr. Goodwin. Obstetrics.âThree hours weekly of lectures, recitations, and manikin demonstrations during the year, supplemented by work with living subjects in the wards of the Hospital. The class is divided into sections of five for manikin instruction and for examination of patients in the Hospital. The manikin course forms an important part of the work, not only for teaching presentation, position, and posture, but also the mechanism of normal and abnormal labor and the application of forceps. When the section is taken into the wards of the Hospital, the methods of examination, particularly abdominal palpation, are practiced on the living subject. Dr. Macon. FOURTH YEAR. Theory and Practice of Medicine.âThe same plan is followed in the clinical work as that already described for the third year, each of the two sections of the class devoting itself for half the year to the medical service in the wards of the hospital. Full histories are taken of every case, thorough examinations made, and management indicated by the students of each division. The records thus obtained are kept up by the student assigned to the case, which he is DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. expected to follow until its discharge. The accuracy and completeness with which this is done constitutes a large element in the determination of fitness for graduation. The subjects treated with the approximate division of time between them are as follows: Nervous Diseases and Insanity.âThree lectures and recitations weekly supplemented by clinical work during the fall term. In this course is given also instruction in electro-therapeutics. Dr. Davis Pediatrics.âThree lectures and recitations weekly supplemented by clinical work during the winter term. This course of lectures is intended to point out in a brief way how disease is modified by childhood and to indicate how the difficulties of diagnosis and treatment due to early age may best be encountered. The principles of infant feeding are emphasized and the student is taught how to prepare the food. Instruction in the practical details of the subject is given by work at the dispensary and in the wards of the Hospital. Dr. Davis and Dr. Rea. Dermatology.âA brief course of lectures is given on this subject embodying a consideration of the commoner diseases met with in medical practice. At the Dispensary two clinics a week throughout the year are devoted to the diseases of the skin. The senior class is divided into sections for the work in this branch. After a brief review of the anatomic and histologic structure and of the physiology of the skin, the diseases most commonly met with are discussed. The clinical material available at the University Dispensary is utilized to the best advantage to give the students a practical working knowledge of the diagnosis and treatment of affections of the skin. Dr. Davis and Dr. Rea. Case Teaching, Medical Ethics and Economics, and Insurance Examinations.âTwo hours weekly during the spring term. Dr. Davis. Therapeutics.âTwo lectures weekly during the fall and winter terms, with five hours weekly of ward rounds for one half the session. The treatment of internal diseases is discussed in a systematic course of lectures and practically demonstrated in the wards of the Hospital. Especial attention is given to the clinical side of the teaching of this subject, the student being required to suggest treatment for cases assigned to him and to follow closely and make a record of the results of the therapeutic agents employed throughout the course of the disease. The course includes a discussion of the preparation of food for the sick; demonstrations of the preparation of stupes, plasters, and DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. poultices; and the methods of giving therapeutic baths, electrical treatment, massage, and other therapeutic measures. Dr. Flippin. Surgery and Gynecology. Two hours weekly of surgical clinic throughout the session; three hours weekly of ward classes, supplemented by clinical work in the wards and operating room for one half the session with each of the two sections of the class. Instruction in Surgery is carried on by clinics and bedside demonstrations in the hospital. In the wards the students are assigned cases, whose histories they must take, make complete physical and clinical examinations, urine analyses, blood examinations, etc. In the ward rounds the diagnosis, operative and other treatment, postoperative care of the cases, complications, prognosis, etc., are discussed in detail. A large variety of cases is available, and the close contact of the students with their cases and with the routine of hospital management offer many of the opportunities that an internship affords. In the operating rooms the students, in small groups, take part in the operations, thus acquiring familiarity with technique, anesthetization, etc. Those of the class who are not assisting, witness the operations, whose important features are demonstrated to them. In gynecology the students have the same general work as in surgery, consisting of the examination and recording the cases in the public wards, attendance on ward rounds, at which the cases are discussed, and observation and assistance in the operating rooms. Dr. Watts and Dr. Goodwin. In addition to the above course, required of all students, the following elective course is offered in the Department of Surgery. Surgical Pathology.âTwo hours weekly during one half of the year. The work in this course comprises lectures upon the pathology of surgical lesions, with especial emphasis upon the clinical diagnosis of tumors and inflammations, the examination of microscopic sections, and the study of fresh tissues in the gross, obtained from the operating room. The purpose of the course is to supplement the general courses in pathology and surgery, and to acquaint the student with the appearance of fresh pathological material from surgical cases. Dr. Goodwin. Obstetrics.âThe student attends, under the guidance of an instructor, the labour cases in the Hospital, is required to prepare the history of patients, and to follow up the cases through the puerperium. Instruction is also given in the case of the new born. In addition the student has the opportunity of attending patients in the outpatient department and each student is expected to attend at least six cases of labour. Dr. Macon. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Forensic Medicine.âOne lecture weekly during one term of the fourth year. Diseases of the Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat.âTwo lectures weekly from the beginning of the session to the first of March, supplemented by regular clinics twice weekly throughout the year and clinical lectures to sections of the class as suitable cases occur. No attempt is made to train specialists, but every effort is made to render the class familiar with such common diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat as the general practitioner meets in his daily work. To this end the class is divided into small sections and each student is taught the methods of examination and the use of the ophthalmoscope, head-mirror, and of the laryngeal and post-nasal mirrors. In the clinics each patient is assigned to a student who must take the history and keep the record of that patient; the case is then demonstrated by the professor in charge, and, if possible, each student makes his own examination under the personal supervision of the attending physician. Clinical cases are abundant, and during the year the student sees and handles practically all the common diseases of the eye, ear, and upper respiratory tract. At the operations in the Hospital only as many students are allowed to be present as can really see and appreciate what is being done. Valuable work is also given in the dissecting room, where the technic of operative work is shown in a way that cannot be employed with the living patient. Students do this work as far as possible for themselves, especially in tracheotomy and intubation of the larynx. Finally the attempt is made so to ground the student in the anatomy, physiology, general pathology, and in methods of examination and treatment that he may diagnose and treat intelligently many of the cases that cannot afford to go to a perhaps distant specialist; that he may treat successfully that large class of emergency cases that first come to the general practitioner and in which immediate treatment is imperative; and, lastly, that he may recognize and intelligently refer those cases that need the services of one specially trained to this branch of work. Dr. Hedges and Dr. Compton. Hygiene.âThree hours weekly throughout the year. The course begins with a historical sketch of the development of preventive medicine, including short biographical sketches of the pioneers of Hygiene. With this introduction the story of the natural history of contagious and infectious diseases, modes of propagation DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. and methods of prevention engage the attention of the student. With this preparation, the chemical and bacteriological contamination of food, water, air, and soil is made an important study. Instruction is also begun in the proper location and construction of habitation, hospitals, schoolhouses, etc., with special reference to the modern methods of heating, ventilating, and draining. Notice is taken of the special relations involved in military and naval hygiene. Dr. Lambeth. FACILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESEARCH. The Department of Medicine not only fosters in its methods of instruction the inductive study by the student himself of the phenomena presented by the human body in health and disease, but also encourages the spirit of investigation of unsolved problems of medical science and practice on the part of the instructors and students. During the past few years there have appeared annually a number of papers from its laboratories embodying the results of such investigations, and it is the policy of the department to enlarge this feature of its work in the future. Students are encouraged to engage in research as they are prepared for it, usually assisting an instructor in some special study or else conducting the research under his guidance and advice. For this purpose the scientific and clinical laboratories offer the necessary facilities and heads of departments will always be glad to suggest and outline problems for investigation by any medical student or by others possessing the necessary training therefor. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HOSPITAL. This Hospital is the property of the University, and is under the exclusive control of its Medical Faculty. It was designed and is administered as a teaching hospital, being so arranged that free use can be made of its clinical material without in any way disturbing or violating the privacy of other patients. The buildings are arranged upon the pavilion system, consisting of a central structure, four stories in height, devoted to the purposes of administration, and two wings. The administration building contains, on the main floor, reception and consultation rooms, an amphitheater and private operating rooms, with sterilizing and anesthetizing rooms attached, and an X-ray room. The upper floors furnish accommodation for the nurses of the training school, while the basement contains the heating plant, laundry, kitchen, etc. From this building corridors in three stories lead out to the wards. These wards, having a capacity of about eighteen beds each, are beautifully lighted, have direct indirect hot-water radiators, and forced ventilation. Opening from each ward on the east is a large protected porch, of great value to convalescents. The south wing has been in use for several years; the new north wing, completed in 1907, gives the Hospital a capacity of about 100 beds, 80 of these being in the public wards. The equipment throughout is new, and conforms in all respects to the best usage of the day. Attention is particularly called to the fact that this hospital, with its associated dispensary, constitutes a valuable adjunct to the teaching facilities of the Medical School. The variety of cases presented, and more especially the opportunities offered for a thorough study of the individual case, afford unusually satisfactorily conditions for clinical instruction. HOSPITAL STAFF. Hospital Board: Drs. Whitehead, Davis, Watts, Hedges, Macon, Marshall, Compton, Flippin, Goodwin. Visiting Staff: The visiting staff consists of the Hospital Board and the Clinical Instructors in the Dispensary. Director of the Hospital: Dr. Watts. House Surgeon: Dr. Neff. Internes: Drs. Bibb, Bray, Hume, and Laughlin. Superintendent of Nurses: Miss M. J. Hurdley. Assistant Superintendent: Miss Carrie Wright. Night Superintendent: Miss Bessie Scrimger. In Charge of Operating Room: Miss Tabitha Grier. Dietetic Nurse: Miss Shaw. Pathologists: Drs. Marshall and Mundy. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. THE DISPENSARY. CLINICAL INSTRUCTORS. Dr. Flippin. Dr. Magruder. Dr. Hedges. Dr. Davis. Dr. Compton. Dr. Goodwin. Dr. Rea. Dr. Nelson. The Dispensary has been renovated and newly equipped, so that it now affords the necessary facilities for conducting useful and scientific clinics. In the past about fifteen hundred cases have been treated annually, and this number should now increase. The students are divided into small sections, and are required to examine, record, treat, and follow each case that comes to the clinic. The work is done under the close personal supervision of the various instructors, and gives experience in handling patients which can only be obtained from actual practice. The work is divided as follows: General Medicine, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 3 to 5 p. m. General Surgery and Gynecology, Genito-Urinary, Tuesday and Thursday, 3 to 5 p. m. Pediatrics; Dermatology; Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat, Tuesday and Saturday, 3 to 5 p. m. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HOSPITAL TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES. This school was established in 1901, and its first class was graduated in June, 1903. Its aim is to give young women, desirous of acquiring the art of nursing, the same care and thorough training in their calling which is now afforded young men studying the science of medicine. Instruction in the primary branches of medicine is given to pupil nurses by the professors in the Medical Department of the University of Virginia, while the clinical instructors at the University Hospital give lectures upon their respective courses. Three years is the required time for graduation, and all candidates must enter prepared to go through the full course of instruction and hospital training.

ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. For admission to the regular Freshman Class in the Department of Engineering the candidate must be at least sixteen years old. He must present a certificate of honorable withdrawal from the school last attended, or other valid proof of general good character. And DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. he must satisfy the Dean of the University as to his adequate preparation for the work by passing the Entrance Examinations specified below or by the presentation of equivalent certificates of preparation signed by the President of a recognized institution of collegiate rank, or by the Principal of an accredited high school. The topics required for entrance and their values in units are as follows: English A.âGrammar and Grammatical Analysis 1 English B.âComposition and Rhetoric 1 English C.âCritical Study of Specimens of Literature 1 Mathematics A.âAlgebra to Quadratics 1 Mathematics B.âQuadratics, Progressions, Binomial Formula Â½ Mathematics C.âPlane Geometry 1 Mathematics D1.âSolid Geometry Â½ Mathematics D2.âPlane Trigonometry Â½ History.âAncient; MediÃ¦val; English; American (any one) 1 Electives 6Â½ Total 14 The candidate is recommended to include among his electives Physical Geography, Chemistry, Physics, Mechanical Drawing, and Shop-work (valued at one unit each). Other electives which may be offered are History (3 units), Latin (4 units), German (2 units), French (2 units), Spanish (2 units), Botany (half unit), ZoÃ¶logy (half unit). COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. The candidate who has satisfied the requirements for entrance as above defined is matriculated as a student of Engineering and admitted to the regular Freshman Class. The studies of this class comprise lecture-courses in Mathematics, Chemistry, Engineering, with associated laboratory courses in Chemistry, Drawing, Shop-work and Field-work. For advancement to the Sophomore Class the student must have completed at least two-thirds of his Freshman work. Upon entering this class he elects his specialty. The courses thereafter diverge according as the student is an applicant for a degree in Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Mining, or Chemical Engineering. Programmes of study for each degree are given below. The degree courses are distinguished by Roman numerals as follows: Course I.âCivil Engineering. Course II.âMechanical Engineering. Course III.âElectrical Engineering. Course IV.âChemical Engineering. Course V.âMining Engineering. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. The courses are so ordered that the specified entrance requirements are adequate for the work of the Freshman Year. Each succeeding year presupposes the completion of the work for all the foregoing years. Students are advised to adhere strictly to the regular programmes. The arrangements specified in them have been carefully planned and are the best. Departures from the curriculum will in almost every case produce conflicts in lecture hours or laboratory periods and may cost the student a year's time. Haphazard election is discouraged and in extreme cases will be prohibited. No student will be registered for a course unless in the opinion both of the Dean and of the professor his preliminary training has fitted him for the profitable pursuit of that course. Students are especially advised against the attempt to crowd too many studies into their scheme of work, and are warned that admission to advanced courses will be granted only to those who have adequate mathematical and scientific training to profit by them. Men overloaded with work, too great in volume or in difficulty for their powers, suffer inevitable discouragement and incur almost certain failure. Every candidate for a degree in Engineering will be required at the beginning of his graduating year to submit to the Dean some subject for independent study suited to the student's especial course and aims. After such subject has been approved by the Dean and the professor in charge, the student will be expected to carry out for himself the necessary literary and laboratory researches and to present his results in the form of a Graduating Thesis. Such thesis must be typewritten on standard sheets, 8 by 10Â½ inches, bound in a proper cover, and handed in for final approval not later than May 25th. All necessary computations and drawings must accompany the thesis. Serious weight will be given to this work in estimating the student's fitness for graduation. In the following matter describing subjects of instruction and in the various programmes of courses, of examinations and in lecture and laboratory schedules, these subjects of instruction are grouped into nine classes, each subject being designated by a distinctive number for each term, and the lectures and the laboratory are likewise differentiated. The grouping by classes follows the arrangement shown herewith. Mathematics 100 to 199 Physics 200 to 299 Chemistry 300 to 399 Geology and Mining 400 to 499 DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING.

This course furnishes a general introduction to Theoretical Mechanics. The fundamental principles of the Kinematics of a particle are followed by a study of the Newtonian Laws of Motion. On this basis the more important propositions in the Statics of the material particle, of the plane lamina, and of solid bodies in three dimensions are then developed. Applications are made to the problems of equilibrium of rigid bodies with and without friction and of flexible cables and to the determination of centers of gravity by both elementary and advanced methods. The principle of work and the application of the law of virtual work to problems of equilibrium are discussed and illustrated. The motions of material particles under the action of constant forces are then considered and the cases of uniform motion, uniformly varied motion, and projectile motion are fully discussed. Special attention is given throughout the course to illustrative problems, many of these being selected from the engineering field. [Required, Fall, in Courses I, II, III, V (3); IV (4).] 501 Dynamics of a Particle. [Thornton.] Lectures 10-11, Monday, Wednesday, Friday. In this course the motions of material particles under varied forces are systematically studied. Simple and compound harmonic motions, motions in resisting media, pendulum motions, and planetary motions are discussed and illustrated. Problems are introduced freely and are drawn not only from the usual ranges of theoretical mechanics, but also from the engineering and industrial applications of the science; as for example the acceleration and retardation of railway trains under the varied traction of the locomotive, the motion of projectiles through atmospheric air, the descent of heavy particles through water in the processes of ore dressing and so on. The course concludes with an elementary discussion of moments of inertia and of the motions of revolving and rolling bodies under finite and under impulsive forces. [Required, Winter, in Courses I, II, III, V (3).] DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. 502 Dynamics of a Rigid Body. [Thornton.] Lectures 10-11, Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

Moments of inertia are investigated by more powerful methods and the motions of rigid bodies about fixed axes, parallel to fixed planes, and about fixed points are submitted to both kinematical and dynamical analysis. Numerous applications are made to the dynamics of machines. The inertia forces developed in the moving parts are studied and the problems arising in the balancing of engines, and in gyroscopic movements are used to illustrate the fundamental doctrines of theoretical mechanics. [Required, Spring, in Courses I, II, III, V (3).] 503 Strength of Materials. [Thornton.] Lectures 9-10, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. The fundamental laws of stress and strain, as developed from the point of view of applied mechanics and illustrated by experimental tests in the laboratory, are made the basis of this course. Systematic studies are made of the strength and elasticity of ties and struts, of beams of constant and of varied sections, of solid and hollow shafts under torsion and bending, of helical springs, of columns under both axial and eccentric loads, of struts and ties under lateral loads, of reinforced concrete slabs and beams, of earth pressure and retaining walls, and of the distribution of pressures in massive masonry and in foundations. Attention is given not only to the classical methods of solution, but also to the more modern accelerated methods based on the principle of work and using graphical as well as analytical processes. Illustrations are drawn throughout from standard engineering practice. Especial care is given to the discussion of the rules and formulÃ¦ on which laboratory tests of structural materials must be based, and to the interpretation of actual tests. [Required, Fall, in Courses I, II, III (3); V (4).] 504 Hydrostatics and Hydraulics. [Thornton.] Lectures 9-10, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. The fundamental laws of the equilibrium of fluids are studied and applied to such illustrative problems as are furnished by the pressures in boiler shells and tanks, the stability of reservoir walls and dams, and the equilibrium of floating bodies. The elementary principles of the movement of fluids are then discussed and applied to deduce rules for efflux from orifices and weir notches, for flow in pipes and open canals, and for gauging the flow of water in both natural and artificial channels. The views of modern hydraulic engineers are fully discussed and their bearings on professional practice are carefully explained. A great variety of problems, drawn DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. as far as possible from current practice, is incorporated into the course. Many of these are assigned to the class for independent solution. Care is taken to make the tests executed by the student in the hydraulic laboratory adequate illustrations of the theoretical principles expounded in the lectures. [Required, Winter, in Courses I, II, III, (3); IV, V (4).] 505 Hydraulic Motors and Pumps. [Thornton.] Lectures 9-10, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. The course is based upon the principles of angular and linear momentum, and the laws of action of hydraulic motors and pumps are developed from these principles. Only such attention is given to the older types of hydraulic machinery as their historic interest justifies. The body of the course is a careful study of the modern types of the turbine as a motor and as a pump. The principles of action of these machines are systematically developed and their operation is illustrated from examples taken from the current practice. Free use is made of problems, and the student is required to design hydraulic machinery and to predict the performance under test of such machines. The inertia effects of moving masses of water on the conduits which carry them are also examined, and the methods for limiting the consequent strains are explained. [Required, Spring, in Courses I, II, III (3); IV, V (4).] 506 Stability of Structures. [Thornton.] Lectures 10-11, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. In this more advanced course in the principles of applied mechanics careful studies are made of the continuous girder, of the cable in its applications to aerial lines for electrical and power transmission and to suspension bridges, of the elastic arch as a structural element, of the hook and ring and chain, of thin and thick pipes under fluid pressure, of the analogous problems arising in shrinkage and forced fits, of whirling discs and cylinders, and of vibratory strains and stresses arising in beams and shafts and other structural elements. Free use is made of the principle of least work in the analysis of complex structural problems. Illustrations are drawn as far as possible from standard modern engineering practice. [Required, Winter, in Courses I, II, III (4).] 507 Canal and River Engineering. [Thornton.] Lectures 10-11, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. A study of the general laws of river flow, of the standard methods of gauging such flows, and of the works needed for the control of floods, serves as an introduction to the discussion of canalized rivers and canals as elements in a system of internal navigation. The principles upon which are based the construction of locks and their DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. accessories, the design of weirs and navigation passes, and the erection of movable dams are carefully studied. Illustrations are drawn from such works of national importance as the Isthmian canal, the Erie canal, and the canalized rivers of the United States.

Written Examinations are held at the end of each term covering the work of that term and the results of these examinations, combined with the student's class standing, give his Term Grade. Regular Reports are sent out at the end of every term to the student's parent or guardian. These state for each course followed the term grade and the number of absences. Further comment may be added by the Dean or the professor, if it appears probable that such comment would be helpful to the student. Parents are urged to examine these reports carefully, and to exert such parental influence as may seem needed to establish and confirm the student in habits of industry and order. Special Reports are sent to parents at the end of each month for students delinquent in attendance or studiousness and for delinquents only. When a student is making steady progress and showing due diligence in his work only the regular reports are sent. The receipt of a special report is evidence that, in the judgment of the Faculty, prompt and pointed parental admonition is urgently needed. Re-examinations are held during registration week in September. To these re-examinations the Faculty will admit, on the recommendation of his professor, any student of the previous session who in any course fell below the pass mark of seventy-five per cent., but made at least sixty-five per cent. at the regular examination. For every such re-examination the student must pay to the Bursar on or before July 15th a fee of $5, which fee is in no case returnable. The student who fails in any course and does not make up his deficiency on re-examination will be required to register anew for that course and attend the lectures and pass the regular examination, unless relieved by special vote of the Faculty. The Dean will send to every student eligible for re-examination a programme of the dates of the September examinations. DEGREES. Upon the completion of the four years' course as defined in any one of the Programmes of Study and the presentation of an acceptable graduating thesis the Faculty will award to any student in regular and honorable standing the appropriate Degree of Civil Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Mining Engineer, or Chemical Engineer. In each programme will be found the Topics of Study for the several years. The hours for lectures and laboratory exercises will be found in the Schedules. The dates for the examinations are given in the Examination Programme. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. PROGRAMME OF EXAMINATIONS. 1913-1914. Dec. Mar.

EXPENSES OF REGULAR STUDENTS. The average annual expenses of a student who pursues the regular course in Engineering will be: Outside Students. Virginians. University Fee $ 40 $ 40 Tuition and Laboratory Fees (average) 100 50 Living Expenses (for nine months) 225 225 Books and Drawing Materials 20 20 Incidental Expenses (for nine months) 45 45 Total for average conditions $430 $380 The charges for Tuition are uniform to all students, except that Virginians are relieved of tuition on courses offered in the College. The fee for each class taken will be $25, with the addition of the prescribed laboratory charges, which are $5 for each class in Applied Mechanics, Engineering, and Physics; $15 for Chemistry. For each class in Analytical Chemistry a special fee of $50 is charged for tuition, plus $10 for apparatus and supplies. The fee for practical instruction in each class in Drawing is $10. The University Fee entitles the student to the free use of the Library, Gymnasium, Shops, and Laboratories; to free medical attention; to the services of the Instructor in Physical Culture; to the facilities of the Hospital in case of need; and covers all fees for the regular examinations, degrees, and diplomas. The Living Expenses include board, lodging, fuel and lights, servant and laundry; the average is $25 a month, the minimum $18, and a reasonable maximum $32. Books and Drawing Materials will cost about $80 for the four year course. Incidental Expenses ought to be kept within modest bounds; the above estimate is sufficient; large allowances of pocket money promote idleness and attract companions of the baser sort. No allowances are made for clothing or traveling expenses, which vary too much to be introduced into any general estimate. The following are payable on entrance: University Fee ($40); Tuition and Laboratory Fees ($100); Contingent Deposit ($10); Books and Instruments ($20); and one month's Living Expenses ($32-18). The student will need at entrance about $200. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. SPECIAL COURSE IN HIGHWAY ENGINEERING. In recognition of the growing interest in Good Roads in Virginia and the immense economic importance of the construction of such roads in all parts of the Commonwealth, the courses of instruction relating directly to this topic have been grouped together to form a Special Course in Highway Engineering. This course is given in the Spring Term and embraces: 703. Location, Construction and Maintenance of County Roads and of City Streets and Pavements, with Laboratory tests of road materials. [Newcomb]. 753. 700. Plane Surveying with especial reference to land and topographical surveying and to highway location. [Newcomb]. 652. Topographical Drawing, embracing contoured maps, colored topography, map lettering, tracing and blue printing. [Hancock]. 655. Structural Drawing, with especial reference to county road bridges, and to culverts and retaining walls for highways. [Thornton and Assistant]. 750. Field Surveying, with the adjustments and uses of the compass, transit, level and plane table. [Newcomb and the Field Assistants]. The regular fees for this special course aggregate $40.00, but to a limited number of adequately prepared applicants, citizens of Virginia, nominated by the County Board of Supervisors of their respective counties, free scholarships will be given. Such students pay only a registration fee of $5.00, for the use of field instruments and laboratory apparatus. REQUIREMENTS FOR ADVANCED STANDING. Applicants from other colleges will be admitted provisionally to advanced standing as candidates for a degree in Engineering upon presentation of proper certificates covering the courses for which credit is desired. Such certificates must be filed with the Dean, and must be acceptable both to him and to the professors in charge of the accredited courses. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the college; must specify the character and content of the course followed by the student; must give his marks, which should not fall below the standard seventy-five per cent. of this university; and must recommend the student as worthy of admission to the University of Virginia in respect of both character and scholarship. The final validation of such a certificate is effected by the successful completion of the courses attended in this university. The programme of studies offered by such a candidate for his degree in Engineering must satisfy all the requirements for that DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. degree as here established. He must devote at least two full sessions to engineering studies in this university. Credits on Practical Work will be allowed to applicants, who have accomplished successfully courses in Drawing, Field-Work, or Shop-Work equivalent to those given in this university, or have acquired in professional practice the training which these courses represent. To secure credit for such work the student must make written application to the Dean of the Department, and with this application must file the certificate of the chief draftsman or other officer under whom the work was done. Applicants for admission to the Engineering Department, who are over twenty years old, and desire to enter for the pursuit of special elective courses, must present adequate proofs of good character and of the needful maturity and training. Such applicants are then registered as Special Students, and are admitted without formal examination to the privileges of the university, but not as candidates for any titled degree. HUMANISTIC STUDIES. Students, who have enjoyed the benefits of sound preliminary training in good high schools, are advised in all cases to enrich and liberalize their professional course by the introduction of humanistic studies. Under the elective system of this university it is easy to plan a schedule of work for a well-prepared matriculate, which will at the end of six years give him in addition to his professional degree the general culture degree of Bachelor of Science or of Bachelor of Arts. The additional courses required are three in two languages (selected from French, German, and Latin), two in historical science (History or Economics), three courses in English, English Literature, or Biblical History and Literature, and two courses in Philosophy (Logic, or Ethics, or Psychology). DRAFTING ROOMS. The drafting rooms are abundantly lighted and are provided with solidly constructed tables with locked drawers for instruments and materials. Each student is assigned to a table and has a drawer for his exclusive use. The regular Drawing Classes execute each one plate a week under the supervision of the Instructor in Drawing. The more advanced students have such additional drawings assigned by their respective professors as are needed for the full development of the courses of study. Careful attention is given to the training of the students in lettering, in the conventional signs of mechanical drawing, in the DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. proper lay-out of drawings, and in neat and accurate execution. Exercises are required also in tracing and in blue-printing, the rooms for which are conveniently arranged and in close contiguity to the drafting rooms. While, however, technical dexterity is demanded, the graphical method is taught and used primarily as a powerful and indispensable instrument of research, the thoughtful mastery of which is essential for the instructed Engineer. The construction and theory of the Polar Planimeter, the Slide Rule, and the Pantograph are carefully taught, and the student is trained in the practical use of these appliances for the rapid and accurate production of estimates and copies from finished drawings. SHOPS. The Shop Equipment is throughout of the best quality, the machines being all from good makers and of sizes ample for the purposes of instruction. A full outfit of hand tools is maintained at all times. Each shop is equipped for the instruction of a squad of sixteen students, this being as large a number as one instructor can properly direct at once. The Machine Shop is provided with four first-class engine lathes, illustrating the practice of the best American makers; with a planer, a shaper, two drill presses, a universal drilling machine (Brown and Sharpe), and a universal grinder (same makers); also with a gas forge for tempering tools, a cut-off saw for metal rods, an emery wheel, and so on. The Wood Shop is furnished with several small lathes, a large pattern maker's lathe, a jointer, a planer, a saw bench for slitting and cross-cutting, a band-saw, jig-saw, and a wood trimmer for pattern making. The Foundry has a cupola furnace for working cast iron, a brass furnace, a core oven, and all needful accessories for moulding and casting; the blast for the cupola is furnished by a special blower, driven by a small high-speed steam engine. The Forge Room is equipped with Buffalo down-draft forges; and the necessary smith's tools; the draft is furnished by an engine-driven blower, and the exhaust is operated by a fan driven also by the engine. Shop instruction is given for its educational value. The purpose of this Department is to train engineers, not artisans; and the claims of the shops are not permitted to infringe on the truly vital functions of the laboratories, the drafting rooms, and the lectures. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. FIELD INSTRUMENTS. The outfit of Field Instruments contains compasses, transits, and levels of various approved makes; a solar transit, furnished also with stadia wires and gradienter for tachymetric work; hand-levels and clinometers for railway topography; plane tables; a sextant; together with an adequate supply of leveling rods, telemeter rods, signal poles, chains, tapes, pins, and so on. For hydraulic work and hydrographic surveys a hook gauge and a current meter are provided. All students are instructed in the theory and adjustments of the field instruments and in their practical use in the field. They are also required to make up their field-books in standard forms; to reduce their surveys and execute all the necessary profiles, plans, and maps; and to determine lengths, areas, and volumes both from the maps and from the original notes. Polar planimeters are provided for facilitating such estimates and a pantograph for making reduced copies of finished drawings. ROAD MATERIAL TESTS. In the Road Material Tests the machines used are mainly those devised by Dr. Logan Waller Page, director of the United States office of public roads. For measuring the strength of the stone cylindrical samples are cut out with a diamond drill and tested under impact and in a 40,000-pound compression machine. The resistance to abrasion is measured on fragments of the stone, rotated in heavy cast iron cylinders mounted on their diagonals. The binding power of the dust is measured by impact tests on cylindrical briquettes formed under heavy hydraulic pressure. The dust for these briquettes is produced in a ball mill fed with a fine stone broken in a small crusher. This part of the testing outfit has been installed largely by the generous aid of Dr. Page. Useful experimental researches on the road-building rocks and gravels of Virginia are carried out with it each year, as well as class demonstrations of the standard tests for road materials. LABORATORY WORK IN STRENGTH OF MATERIALS. The Sinclair Laboratory for work in Strength of Materials.â This was founded on the original donation of Mrs. John Sinclair, of New York City, as a memorial to her late husband. The collection has since been considerably enlarged. It contains Riehle and Olsen machines, each of 100,000 pounds capacity, arranged for tensile, compressive, and transverse tests; an Olsen torsion machine of 50,000 inch-pounds capacity; an Olsen compression machine of 40,000 pounds capacity; a Ewing tester for the elasticity of rods; hand machines for testing rods and wires under pull and small specimens of timber and cast iron under transverse loads; Fairbanks and Olsen DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. cement testers of 1,000 pounds capacity each; apparatus for torsional tests on both long wires and short wires; together with the necessary accessory apparatus for utilizing these machines. LABORATORY AND FIELD-WORK IN HYDRAULICS. The equipment for this work comprises a steel tank for weir experiments with adjustable bronze notches; a hook gauge for accurate measurement of surface levels; a cast-iron stand pipe for experiments on efflux with adjustable bronze orifices; a series of pipes with bends, elbows, and tees for measuring pipe friction; and the proper manometers and gauges for reading pressures. For the field-work the outfit of field instruments has been enlarged by a current meter of modern construction and a set of hollow copper ball floats for direct stream velocity measurements. ENGINE AND BOILER TESTS. The Steam Engine Tests are made on the high-speed Ball engine, which operates the shops. This motor has been specially equipped for the purpose. It receives steam from the main line through a Sweet separator; humidity determinations are thus made twiceâonce by a separating calorimeter before the steam enters the separator, and again by a throttling calorimeter as it enters the cylinder. It is fitted with proper indicators, and permanent indicator rigging so that at any time cards may be taken and the indicated horse-power determined. In like manner a rope friction brake is so arranged that it may be at once applied for the determination of brake horse-power. Connections are so made with a Wheeler surface condenser that the engine may at will be operated either condensing or non-condensing. Provisions are made for measuring the temperatures and the amounts of the condensation water and the condensed steam produced during the run. With these data a complete heat balance of the experimental run is attainable. For Steam Boiler Tests the boilers of the university heating and lighting plant are available. The department is equipped with the necessary apparatusâthermometers, gauges, steam calorimeters, fuel calorimeters, gas analyzers, scales, tanks, and so on. Students of Mechanical Engineering are taught by practical lessons in the boiler room the standard methods for boiler trials, and the class makes each session at least one complete trial. The Gas Engine Tests are made on an Otto machine of 15 I. H. P. and 12 B. H. P. This is also provided with its friction brake, indicator rigging, and indicator. The cooling water is run in from calibrated tanks and provision is made for observing not only its amount but the initial and final temperatures. Gasoline or alcohol is used as fuel, and is run in from a graduated wrought-iron DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. bottle, so that the amount consumed is determined. The heating power is obtained by an independent test with a Rosenhain calorimeter. Samples of the burnt gases are drawn from the exhaust pipe and analyzed in an Orsat gas apparatus. With these data, and the observed numbers of revolutions and explosions, the heat balance is worked out. The Refrigerating Tests are made on a Remington Ice Machine of one ton capacity. This is an ammonia compression machine driven by an electric motor. Instead of brine, plain water is used, heated by a steam jet to 100 degrees and then cooled down to 40 degrees by the machine. A run is first made with the pipes empty in order to determine the friction horse-power. The ammonia is then turned on and the run is made under load. In both cases the power consumed is measured both by wattmeter and by ammeter and voltmeter readings. The tanks are accurately calibrated and careful measurements of the temperature are made through the run. Indicator cards are also taken from the ammonia cylinders and the number of revolutions is registered by counter. With these data the mechanical and thermodynamic performance of the machine are figured out. LABORATORY WORK IN ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING. The Scott Laboratory of Electrical Engineering.âThis laboratory was initially equipped and endowed by Mrs. Frances Branch Scott, of Richmond, Va., as a memorial to her late son, an alumnus of this university. During the year 1910 the equipment was substantially increased through the generosity of the Hon. Charles M. Crane, of Chicago, Ill., a friend of the university. During 1912, still further substantial additions have been made, consisting of measuring instruments, auxiliary control apparatus, and more particularly a steam-turbine driven alternating current, three-phase, generator with exciter and control switchboard. In addition to full sets of electric meters with the appliances for testing and calibrating them, galvanometers of the best modern types, standard cells and resistances, standard condensers, and other pieces of apparatus for minor tests, it contains numerous pieces of the very best construction. Such are the Wolff Potentiometer, the Siemens and Halske Thomson Double Bridge, the Koepsel Permeameter, the Duddell Double Projection Oscillograph, the Station Photometer with Lummer-Brodhun screen, the Carey-Foster Bridge and others. For the work in machine testing there are a number of direct current generators and motors, series, shunt and compound, an interpole motor, a double current generator, a two phase alternator, a General Electric experimental test set for alternating current comprising a generator furnishing single, two, DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. three, six or twelve phase current and in addition offering three types of induction motors with all necessary starting and controlling devices, a single phase repulsion motor, a two phase induction motor, two three phase induction motors, several pairs of constant voltage transformers, a constant current transformer, frequency meters, power factor indicator, synchronism indicator, ground detector and the auxiliary apparatus used in testing these machines. The laboratory has been arranged with a system of universal plug and receptacle connections to facilitate the setting up of all experimental combinations. The laboratory work is carried on in squads or groups of two or three students and the work is so arranged that each student will become familiar with all the details and connections of each particular test. A most important feature of the laboratory instruction is the required preparation of a preliminary report on each experiment before the actual test is carried out. These preliminary reports are written up in the classroom at assigned hours and consist of a complete rÃ©sumÃ© of the test under discussion. The object, the theory, the scheme of connections necessary, the choice of measuring instruments and all auxiliary devices needful for the proper performance of the experiment are here worked out and this preliminary report is handed in for correction or approval. After approval the test is assigned for a definite laboratory hour and the work is then carried through. A final report is then handed in consisting of the preliminary and the additional data in tabulated and in graphical form. Such a final report comprises a complete text on any given experiment and will prove of great value in later work in commercial fields. It is recognized that the outlined method for laboratory work is of the greatest benefit to the student inasmuch as it requires a thorough understanding of each given test, and at the same time inculcates habits of self-reliance and a spirit of originality which cannot prove to be other than beneficial in the later work when the engineer must rely upon his own ingenuity to a great extent. BUILDINGS. The buildings devoted wholly or in part to the work of the Department of Engineering are the following: The Mechanical Laboratory is the main seat of the instruction in technical studies. It is 180 by 70 feet and contains on the main floor the Dean's office and the offices of the three other professors; the main lecture room; the laboratory of electrical engineering; and the drafting room for the First and Second Year students. Above are a smaller drafting room for advanced students, and blue-print and photographic rooms. Below on the ground floor are another classroom, the reading-room, the testing laboratory, the wood shop, DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. the metal shop, apparatus and store rooms, the tool room, and the students' lavatory. The Power House is a single-story building 110 by 40 feet. In addition to the university boiler plant and the electric lighting plant this contains the foundry and the forge room. The boiler plant consists of two horizontal return-tubular boilers, each of 140 horsepower. The lighting plant consists of three electric generators directly connected to high-speed engines, the respective capacities being 25, 50, and 75 kilowatts. The whole plant is available for purposes of instruction, study and experiment. The Laboratory of General Chemistry, situated at the southern end of West Range, is one of the older buildings recently remodelled and fitted up for the work of instruction in undergraduate chemistry. It is furnished with all the necessary apparatus and supplies, and is comfortably heated and lighted. The engineering students, who are taught in a separate section, have three hours in lecture each week and six hours in the laboratory. The work is specially adapted to their needs. The room used for work in Organic Chemistry is at the northern end of West Range. The Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry is 150 by 60 feet. It is a single-story building, containing the lecture room, the laboratory of analytical chemistry, the rooms for assaying, the balance rooms, the offices and private laboratories of the professor of Industrial and Analytical Chemistry, and a number of store rooms. These contain not only the usual laboratory supplies, but an extensive collection of specimens, illustrating very completely the processes and products of industrial chemistry, and of especial interest to engineering students. The Geological Museum is 120 by 50 feet. It is a three-story building. The main floor is devoted to the very extensive geological collection of specimens, charts, relief maps, and so on. The gallery above contains an equally good collection of minerals and numerous models of typical crystallographic forms. The upper floor contains the lecture rooms and the laboratories of Economic Geology. In the basement are stored subsidiary collections and new material accumulated in more recent geological surveys. The Physical Laboratory faces the Mechanical Laboratory on the opposite side of the quadrangle, and has almost the same proportions. The main floor contains the lecture room, the professors' offices, the laboratory of experimental physics, and the store room for the very large collection of apparatus used in the lectures. On the ground floor is the laboratory of theoretical electricity, the storage battery room, a well-equipped shop for the repair and manufacture of apparatus, and numerous smaller rooms for the work of graduate students.

From Virginia 1,015 From twenty-two other States 270 Total 1,285 SUMMER SCHOOL. ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR THE SUMMER SCHOOL FOR 1913. The session will begin Tuesday, June 24th, and close Thursday, Aug. 7th, 1913. Tuesday, June 24th will be devoted to the registration of students. All students should register on this day. The entire faculty of the Summer School will be in the room adjoining the Registrar's office during June 24th, for consultation. Students should consult freely with members of the faculty in case of difficulty in choosing courses. No certificate will be granted to students who fail to register before Tuesday, July 1st. Fees.âNo registration fee will be charged. A tuition fee of five dollars will be charged for admission to each course in the courses later denominated as receiving University credit or credit on the Summer School Professional Certificate or credit on the Special Certificate. A single fee of six dollars will be charged to Virginia students for the courses (not more than five) taken in one summer from the group counting towards the Professional Elementary Certificateâ Grammar Gradesâor the Professional Elementary Certificateâ Primary Gradesârespectively. All students from other States than Virginia will be charged ten dollars. A single fee of six dollars will be charged for the courses (not more than six) taken from the group of elementary courses which prepare for the First Grade Certificate examination, to all students from other States than Virginia. The Department of Public Instruction of Virginia has provided by special appropriation that Virginia teachers shall pay only three dollars for the courses (not more than six) selected from this group. Students not desiring credit will be charged at the same rate. Credit.âCertificates will be granted in each course in the University Department to those students who attain a grade of 75%. This grade will be the average of the recitation and examination marks. No student will be permitted to take more than three courses for the Summer School Professional Certificate or University credit without the permission of the director. The Summer School Professional Certificate.âThe following regulations with reference to the Summer School Professional Certificate have been passed by the State Board of Education. "That the work for the Summer School Professional Certificate shall not be given at any of the summer schools except at the University of Virginia Summer School. Entrance to the work leading to the Summer School Professional Certificate shall be restricted to those holding First Grade Certificates or to those holding High School Certificates who have had at least six months teaching experience. To procure such certificate the applicant shall study at the University of Virginia Summer School or one of similar rank for at least two sessions of six weeks each and shall make an average of 75 per cent on class work and examination in six courses other than elementary school subjects. Such certificates shall continue in force for seven years, subject to renewal from time to time. The six courses required shall include at least four subjects. One of the six courses required for the Summer School Professional Certificate shall be taken in the subject of English, another shall be taken in Education. The other four courses shall be chosen from any of the following groups, provided that not more than two of the six courses shall be chosen from any one group; Subjects in Industrial Education; Science; Mathematics; History; Education and Philosophy; Language." Industrial Education includes Agriculture, Manual Training, Drawing, and Domestic Economy. Special Certificate.âAny teacher who complies with the entrance requirements for the Summer School Professional Certificate as given above, and who attends the University Summer School for two sessions of six weeks each and completes satisfactorily at least one course in Educational Psychology, and in addition three courses in any one subject, to be selected from courses prescribed for this certificate in the University Department, will be given a Special Certificate to teach the subject specialized in. This certificate will be good for five years and renewable from time to time. Professional Elementary Certificates.âTwo Professional Elementary Certificates will be issued by the Virginia State Board of Examiners: The Professional Elementary CertificateâPrimary Grades; and the Professional Elementary CertificateâGrammar Grades. These certificates will be issued for a term of seven years and will be renewable for a similar period from time to time. The requirements for entrance to the work leading to the Professional Elementary Certificates are the same as those for the Summer School Professional Certificate as outlined above. In addition to the completion of the courses below leading to the Professional Elementary Certificates, a teacher must have had at least nine months successful experience in Primary or Grammar Grade school teaching, as certified to by the superintendent and principal, before the certificate can be issued. SUMMER SCHOOL. The above regulations may be slightly modified by the State Board of Education before the Summer School Catalogue is issued. Credit Allowed by Other States than Virginia.âApplication has been made to other Southern States for credit equal to that accorded by the Virginia Board of Examiners. Credits are now allowed toward the extension of the certificates by certain other States. Some States authorize the University Summer School instructors to hold State examinations. In other States arrangements may be made upon application of the teachers from those States. All persons wishing to arrange for credits with their respective school authorities should correspond with the Director of the Summer School. University of Virginia Credit.âBelow are stated the conditions upon which credit in the University of Virginia may be granted for work done in the Summer School. (a) The student must satisfy the entrance examination requirements of the University of Virginia and matriculate before he can receive credit in the College for any work done in the University of Virginia Summer School. (b) The Dean of the College will accept the completion of the courses in the Summer School in lieu of the entrance examinations in the same subject, provided that in his judgment the courses are equivalent to those required for entrance to the University of Virginia, and provided, that the certificates of courses completed be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned. (c) The Dean of the College and the professor in charge of the school in which credit is desired will accept certificates of completion of summer courses in lieu of "A" courses in the University of Virginia, provided that such summer courses be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned as the full equivalent in character and scope of the corresponding "A" courses in the University. (d) Certificates of completion of certain summer courses approved by the Academic Faculty will be accepted in lieu of portions of "B" courses, provided that in each case the Dean of the College, the Faculty Committee on Degrees, and the professor in charge of the courses for which credit is desired certify in writing that the summer courses completed are equivalent in character and scope to that portion of the regular sessional work for which credit is desired. (e) The character of the examinations and the numerical standard (75 per cent) required for their successful completion shall be the same as those of the sessional examinations. SUMMER SCHOOL. Courses Which Were Taken for University Credit 1911.âAstronomy 1, 2, 3, 4; Biology 1, 2, 3, 4; Chemistry 3, 4; Latin 5, 6, 7; English 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; French 1, 2; German 1, 2; Mathematics 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; Philosophy 1, 2, 3; Physics 5, 6; Psychology 1, 2. No student applying for University credit is allowed to take more than three courses in one summer, except by permission of the Director of the Summer School. It is the desire of the Summer School management to provide a sufficient number of University credit courses to enable any student in three summer sessions to earn one year's work towards his B. A. degree. Those wishing University credit which does not appear above, should correspond with the Director of the Summer School. Teachers' Positions.âThe University Bureau of Appointments receives more demands for men teachers than it is ever able to fill. This Committee will be glad to have well qualified teachers who are in attendance upon the Summer School leave their applications with the Director, who is a member of the Committee. Board and Rooms.âBoard and rooms may be had at prices ranging from $4.00 per week, where several stay in the same room, upwards, according to accommodations, the average being $4.50 per week. Many of the boarding-houses are situated on, or immediately adjoining, the university grounds. A limited number of students may, upon application, procure rooms in the university buildings at a nominal rental to cover actual expenses of furniture and attendance. The Commons, the handsome new dining hall on the university grounds, is now at the service of Summer School students. The cost of board in the dining hall will not exceed $4.00 per week. Applications should be made as early as possible. Reduced Railway Rates.âAll students coming to the Summer School from points south and west of Virginia should apply several weeks in advance to their local agents for reduced rates. In case the agent has received no instructions for selling reduced rate tickets to Charlottesville, Virginia, the Director of the Summer School should be written to promptly for information.

The general library is open daily, Sunday excepted, from 9 a. m. to 4 p. m.; the Law Library from 9 a. m. to 2 p. m., from 3 to 5 p. m., and from 7.30 to 10.30 p. m.; and the Medical Library from 9 a. m. to 4 p. m., and from 7.30 to 10 p. m. Books in the general library may be lent only to the following classes of persons: (1) Regularly matriculated students; (2) members of the faculty and officers of the university; (3) persons whose former official connection with the university entitles them to consideration; and (4) other persons who deposit $5.00 and pay a fee of $1.00 a year, or shorter time. The deposit will be returned on request, less penalties, if any, for detention or injury of books. In this class, applicants for the privilege of borrowing books must be recommended by a professor or an officer; but no professor, officer, or student may borrow books for the use of others. THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. No book may be taken from the library until it has been charged at the desk. Usually books are lent for two weeks, but there are exceptions, and the loan expires on the date stamped in the book. It may be renewed unless another person entitled to the privileges of the library has applied for it. Books in the reference collection are not to be removed from the library, but may be freely consulted. All bound magazines are classed as reference books. Books in current general use in connection with any course of instruction may be temporarily placed on the reference shelves and made subject to the above rule. Reference works, and books of special value or peculiarly liable to injury, are not available for circulation. New periodicals are withheld from circulation until one month after they are placed on the shelves.</field>

THE BARBOUR-PAGE LECTURE FOUNDATION: THE JAPANESE EXCHANGE PROFESSORSHIP: LITERARY SOCIETIES: RELIGIOUS WORK: PHYSICAL TRAINING: ALUMNI ASSOCIATIONS: COLONNADE CLUB: REGISTER OF STUDENTS, 1912-1913: INDEX. THE BARBOUR-PAGE LECTURE FOUNDATION. THE BARBOUR-PAGE LECTURE FOUNDATION. The University of Virginia is indebted for the establishment of the Barbour-Page Foundation to the wisdom and generosity of Mrs. Thomas Nelson Page, of Washington, D. C. In 1907, Mrs. Page donated to the University the sum of $22,000, the annual income of which is to be used in securing each session the delivery before the university of a series of not less than three lectures by some distinguished man of letters or of science. The conditions of the foundation require that the Barbour-Page lectures for each session be not less than three in number; that they be delivered by a specialist in some branch of literature, science, or art; that the lecturer present in the series of lectures some fresh aspect or aspects of the department of thought in which he is a specialist; and that the entire series delivered each session, taken together, shall possess such unity that they may be published by the Foundation in book-form. Lecturer on the Barbour-Page Foundation. 1911. William Henry Welch, M. D., LL. D., Baxley Professor of Pathology in the Johns Hopkins University. Subject: The Development of Medicine as a Science. Three Lectures. THE JAPANESE EXCHANGE PROFESSORSHIP. THE JAPANESE EXCHANGE PROFESSORSHIP. In 1911 there was founded an exchange professorship between the United States and Japan for the promotion of a better mutual understanding between the two nations. Sharing in this foundation are the following six American universities: Yale University, Columbia University, the Johns Hopkins University, the University of Virginia, the University of Illinois, the University of Minnesota. By the terms of the foundation, each of the above six universities will be visited every other session by a professor from some one of the imperial educational institutions of Japan, who will give in each university a short course of lectures, treating some aspect or aspects of Japanese life. In the alternate years the six American universities forming the foundation will send a similar representative to Japan. The first course of lectures on this foundation was given during the spring term of 1911-1912. Japanese Exchange Professor, 1911-1912. Inazo Nitobe, Ph. D., President of the First Imperial College of Japan. Course: Eight Lectures on the History and Institutions of Japan. STUDENTS' LITERARY SOCIETIES. STUDENTS' LITERARY SOCIETIES. Connected with the University are two literary societies of long standingâthe Jefferson Society and the Washington Society. At weekly meetings in their respective halls, they hold debates and practice extemporaneous and other forms of public speaking. Jointly they form the Congress of the Debating Union and follow a procedure similar to that of the national House of Representatives. Each society annually offers gold medals for excellence in debating and oratory, and each organization contests for intersociety prizes. All intercollegiate contests are managed for the societies by the Debating and Oratorical Council. It sends competitors for the prizes of the Southern Inter-State Oratorical Association and the Virginia State Oratorical Association, and conducts a triangular debate with two other universities. Its present officers are D. H. Rodgers, President; J. M. Barker, Vice-President; J. I. Viney, Secretary; C. W. Paul, Adjunct Professor of Public Speaking, Treasurer, and W. B. Hackley, Assistant Treasurer. MEDALISTS. 1911-1912.

The Colonial Dames Prize is awarded to the best essay on any Colonial Virginia subject. The Winners of the Prizes for 1911-1912. Colonial Dames Prize Thomas Elbert Wright Linden Kent Prize Peyton Randolph Harris Bryan Prize John Walter Smith RELIGIOUS WORK. RELIGIOUS WORK. I. YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION, INCORPORATED. WHITEFIELD WALTON BROCKMAN, B. A., General Secretary Object.âThe Young Men's Christian Association, founded in 1858, is the largest student organization in the university, and is the oldest student Young Men's Christian Association in existence. It stands for a higher spiritual life among the members, and for united effort to help others in the attempt to live consistent Christian lives. Work.âThe distinctive work of the association consists in promoting individual study of the Bible and Foreign Missions by means of small classes under student leaders, in maintaining a weekly Prayer-Service, held on Wednesday night at seven-thirty o'clock, in assisting, through some of its members, the work of the churches and Sunday schools in the vicinity of the university, in inviting eminent Christian workers to address the students on religious matters, and in promoting social intercourse among the students by means of lectures, entertainments, and other social events. The English Bible.âThe Young Men's Christian Association offers the following courses in Bible Study, open to all students: Studies in the life of Christ. Studies in the Psalms. Studies in the Social and Political Teaching of Jesus. The above courses are conducted by student leaders. In addition to these there is a class which is addressed by members of the university faculty on Biblical topics, and also a class for students engaged in athletics taught by Dr. W. A. Lambeth. The Y. M. C. A. Equipment.âThrough the munificence of Mrs. William E. Dodge and family, of New York City, the Association possesses one of the handsomest and most conveniently arranged college association buildings in the world, which was erected at a cost, including furnishings, etc., of about $75,000. The students, alumni, and friends of the university have subscribed an endowment fund of nearly $20,000 for the maintenance of the property. This building, called "Madison Hall" in honor of President Madison, who was so intimately connected with the early history RELIGIOUS WORK. of the university, faces the north front of the Rotunda. It contains editorial rooms for the college publications, a reception room, reading room, meeting room, parlor, office, writing room, auditorium, guest room, bed rooms for the officers, and rooms for the Bible and Missionary departments of the Association. In addition there is a kitchen, a club room, where dinners may be served, a barber shop, lockers and elaborate shower baths. A library of nearly a thousand volumes of the best religious works and fiction has been donated by a member of the Dodge family. The tennis courts, nineteen in number, for the use of the students of the university, are on the Association grounds immediately in the rear of the building, and form one of the most beautiful tennis fields in the country. Help for New Students.âThe Association publishes during the last week of August a Handbook of useful information concerning the university and community, and also a detailed report of the religious work of the session. The General Secretary will gladly send either of these publications, or give any further information desired, upon application of any prospective student. New students are requested to come direct from the trains to Madison Hall, where the Association conducts a general Information Bureau, including a complete boarding house register, a directory of the students, and a list of all forms of employment open to students. The boarding house list, with locations and prices, is not made up till the first week in September. It is suggested that new students arrive a day or two before the session opens, so that they may choose a boarding place for themselves and get well settled before their work begins. All correspondence with regard to rooms in the University dormitories should be directed to the Bursar. Membership.âThe membership of the Association consists of two classes, active and associate; any member of an evangelical church, who wishes to take some part in the work of the Association, may become an active member of the Association; any young man of good moral character may become an associate member. The annual fee is $2.00 for all members, an extra charge being made for the use of the baths and tennis courts. Indorsement.âThe Visitors and the faculty of the university heartily commend the work of the Association, and it is earnestly desired that every parent or guardian see to it that the student under his care be encouraged to join the Association as soon as he reaches the university. RELIGIOUS WORK. II. CHAPEL SERVICES. The religious services of the university consist of the regular preaching service in the chapel on Sunday morning, conducted by representative ministers of all evangelical denominations, invited mainly from Virginia and adjacent states, and occasional evening meetings addressed by men of eminence from the laity and clergy. The general oversight of the Christian work is entrusted to the Association Secretary. All the details of this plan, which takes the place of the chaplain system used in former years, are entrusted to a Committee on Religious Exercises composed of five members of the faculty. The list of the university preachers for the year 1911 is given on page 29. PHYSICAL TRAINING. PHYSICAL TRAINING. WILLIAM ALEXANDER LAMBETH, M. D., Ph. D., Director of the Gymnasium HENRY HADEN LANNIGAN Associate Director of Athletics ARTHUR G. NOEHREN Instructor in Physical Training SAMUEL SAUNDERS Assistant in Physical Training The method of instruction pursued does not adhere blindly to any system, so called. Proper recognition is given to any method the whole or parts of which have been useful or which indicate efficiency; for, however valuable any system may be, it cannot be maintained in its entirety without the consideration of hereditary tendencies, and of individuality in physical possibilities, physical conditions, and physical tastes. The plan of individual training is encountered in every case, and especially where an examination discloses the student's inability to pursue general or concerted exercises, either from threatened injury on inability to profit by such work. Students, upon entering the university, are entitled, without cost, to a thorough physical examination by the Director. The examination includes an accurate measurement of his physical proportions, a careful examination of the condition and action of the heart and lungs and the strength of the principal muscular groups; at the same time information is solicited concerning his heredity. Upon the basis of the information so gathered instruction will be given as to particular exercises and the use of the various developing appliances, as indicated. The examinations are repeated at intervals, the changes noted and new work suggested, if desirable. In addition to individual work, daily classes are given in light gymnasticsâmarching, figure running, calisthenics, dumb-bells, and clubs, adapted as nearly as possible to individuals of all ages and physical conditions. The exercises are gradual and progressive, commencing with the simplest movements and proceeding to the more complicated and arduous when the more rudimentary forms have been mastered. During the winter months gymnastics which require great strength and agility are indulged in by those who are fitted for these classes by previous training. This work, of admitted spectacular character (yet having its usefulness), is terminated by an annual gymnastic tournament, usually in the first half of March. PHYSICAL TRAINING. The faculty regulations on athletics require that members of the university athletic teams shall give evidence of satisfactory physical conditions by making the following strength tests when deemed necessary, in addition to the regular physical examination: Members of the football teams are required to make a strength test of 1,300 points; members of the baseball team a test of 1,100 points. The points are reckoned as follows: The strength of back in pounds, the strength of legs in pounds, strength of chest in pounds, strength of forearms in pounds (pressure), added to one-tenth of the weight (in pounds), multiplied by the number of times the body is lifted by the upper arms. The Fayerweather Gymnasium, the gift of Daniel Fayerweather, of New York, is a handsome and commodious structure on classical lines, situated on the eastern slope of Carr's Hill, overlooking the Athletics Campus. The first floor contains a spacious exercise hall, equipped with the best and most approved developing appliances, as well as apparatus for light and heavy gymnastics, a one-twentieth mile concave-inclined running track, a visitor's gallery, lavatory, trophy-room, and the various offices. The basement floor is concrete throughout and contains the bathsâneedle, shower, spray, tub, and plungeâsupplied with both hot and cold water; bowling alleys, ball-cage, boiler-room, lockers, locker-room, dressing-rooms, and barber shop. The building is heated by a hot water system, ventilated by airshafts, registers, and skylights, and lighted by gas and electricity. The gymnasium is open from 8 a. m. to 7 p. m. every day except Sunday. Attendance is voluntary and free of cost to every regularly matriculated student. Classes are arranged at such hours as not to conflict with other university duties. The Athletic Park contains twenty-one acres, a part of which has been laid out into a driving park, set with trees and hedges, containing the site for the proposed Athletic Clubhouse. Two hundred thousand surface feet have been perfectly graded, drained, and fenced for football, baseball, and track work. This surface was completed at a cost of about ten thousand dollars, and the removal of forty-eight thousand cubic yards of earth. A grandstand and bleacher have been erected, each seating a thousand persons. The work of turfing, protection, and decoration is going steadily on, and will, it is estimated, cost ten thousand dollars more. ATHLETICS. Games and sports of all kinds are under the special direction of the General Athletic Association, a student organization whose object is to promote this class of physical exercises. The faculty, by means of its committee on athletics, exercises a general advisory ATHLETICS. control, endeavoring to foresee and avert dangerous tendencies or excess in physical exercises, while giving to the students, as far as possible, entire liberty of management: a strict limit is placed upon the character of intercollegiate games and the number played away from the university. REGULATIONS OF THE GENERAL FACULTY CONCERNING ATHLETICS. 1. The Faculty Committee on Athletics is intrusted with the general oversight of athletics, and is authorized to forbid any features in these exercises which endanger the health or morals of the participants, and to foster the true spirit of amateur sport among them. 2. No student shall play upon the university athletic teams except after physical examination by the Director of the Gymnasium (or by a responsible expert officer of the university acting in his stead and by his request) and with the approbation of the Director. 3. Only students who act as regular or substitute members of the Athletic teams will be granted leaves of absence to accompany them on trips away from the university, except during vacation and holidays. 4. Special reports may be made to the president from time to time by any minor faculty with respect to the class-standing and progress in study of each regular and substitute player on the athletic teams, and if the president and such faculty are convinced that his class-standing is discreditable, such student may be required to sever his connection with such team. 5. The athletic teams should not have contests elsewhere than upon the university grounds with any except teams from other institutions of learning. 6. Before any student can become a member of substitute member of any athletic team in the university and take part in any intercollegiate contest, he shall make application in a prescribed form in writing to the Faculty Committee on Athletics, and secure the endorsed approval of the committee to his application. It shall be the duty of the Athletic Committee to have the executive officers of the university endorse such application to the effect that the applicant is an unconditionally registered student of the university. 7. It shall be the duty of the Athletic Committee to inquire into and make a record of the athletic experiences of the applicant, and it shall be the duty of the applicant to appear before the Committee and answer on his honor such questions as the Committee may see fit to ask. 8. It shall be the duty of the Athletic Committee, before it endorses an application, to require a pledge in writing of the applicant certifying on his honor that he has never accepted directly or indirectly remuneration, compensatory gift, valuable consideration or the promise thereof for or on account of his athletic services, and that he is in the proper and strict sense of the word an amateur athlete. 9. No student who has been a member or a substitute member of a football or baseball team of another college or university shall be permitted to become a member of either team of this university during his first session; but in no case shall such student be eligible for these teams at this University unless he shall have been a student here at least five months. The above provision shall also apply to all students who enter this university with less than 10 units.* * This rule went into effect September, 1908. It does not, however, apply to such students as entered this university under our previous "five months' residence rule." 10. No person whose name appears in the catalogue list of officers of instruction and administration of the university, and who receives remuneration therefrom, shall be a member of any athletic team representing the university. 11. It shall be the duty of the President of the Athletic Association, the Executive Committee of that Association, the Manager and the Captain of the team concerned, the Director of the Gymnasium, the Associate Director of Athletics, and the Treasurer of the Association, to furnish, on request, a statement to the effect that each member of an athletic team is above their suspicion as to his eligibility to represent the university as a proper amateur player, before such player shall be allowed to take part in any contest. ATHLETICS. 12. No "coach," not an alumnus, and no "trainer," not an officer of the university, shall be employed for the purpose of instructing or training any athletic team in this university.â  â  The Faculty Committee on Athletics may permit the employment of coaches other than alumni for a period not exceeding two weeks for any one individual during any one season. But in no case shall such coach be in responsible charge of the team. 13. The Faculty Committee on Athletics is authorized and instructed to establish a maximum period after which a player on a team representing any branch of athletic sport at this or any other university or college shall be ineligible to become a member of any athletic team of this university. 14. The Faculty Committee on Athletics is directed to assume responsible charge of the details of the Athletic situation and to permit the playing of intercollegiate games with such colleges only as express a general conformity with the code of rules adopted by this faculty. 15. The members of any athletic team may be allowed not more than eight days leave of absence from the university for the purpose of engaging in athletic contests; but no student who is a member of more than one athletic team shall be allowed more than sixteen days leave of absence during the entire session for such purpose. REGULATIONS OF FACULTY COMMITTEE ON ATHLETICS. 1. "Training Tables" for football, baseball and track teams are hereby abolished. 2. No student of this university shall be eligible for any athletic team who shall have played upon, or been a member or substitute member of any of the professional or league teams named in Classes A, B, C, and D, in the publication of the American Sports Company. To the list of professional teams thus prescribed shall be added all league teams in any state or states, which the leading university of such state or states declares professional and from which it debars its own players. 3. The term "college" as used in the Faculty Regulations concerning athletics is hereby interpreted to mean any college named in Table 28 of the Report of the U. S. Commissioner of Education of 1902, which has not less than 150 male students of at least collegiate grade recorded in the catalogue of the institution in question as students of the session preceding the applicant's entrance into this University. In case such faculty fails to distinguish between students of collegiate and preparatory grade, the president of the college concerned shall be requested to render or to authorize an official decision of the members belonging to each head. 4. The term "substitute" is interpreted to mean a student who has taken part in an intercollegiate contest. 5. The term "general conformity," as used in the faculty regulations, is interpreted by the faculty to mean conformity in regard to period of residence, maximum period of eligibility and amateur standing. 6. The maximum period of eligibility for baseball and football shall be four years. In estimating the period of eligibility the years of baseball and football shall both be taken into account; but in no case shall a player be charged with four years' athletic work, unless at least four calendar years have elapsed from the time he entered upon his first intercollegiate contest, omitting from the calculation any sessional intermission by non-attendance. In case the player does not participate in either baseball or football during a college session, such session shall not be counted, but if such player does play on either the baseball or the football team during any intermediate session, this shall count as if the player had played on both teams during such session. College Topics is a semi-weekly newspaper, published under the auspices of the General Athletic Association, devoted to the interests of athletics and the university at large.

COLONNADE CLUB. THE COLONNADE CLUB. Incorporated in October, 1907, under a perpetual charter granted by the State, the Colonnade Club was formed to serve the University of Virginia effectively along the various social lines so vitally important to its growthâboth through improved coÃ¶peration among the members of the teaching staff, and in other ways. The value of the services thus far rendered has repeatedly been warmly acknowledged by the university authorities. The club occupies Pavilion VII, West Lawnâthe interior having been tastefully remodelled, making it suitable for assembly, reading, writing, chess, sleeping, pool, billiard and bathing purposes. At this writing (December 15, 1912), the Resident Membership, about 100 in number, includes all the administrative officers, and nearly all the teaching staff, together with a number of local alumni and friends of the university. One of the club's most significant features is its Non-Resident Membership, now numbering over 800 and including many distinguished names. Nearly 400 live in Virginia, the remainder being dwellers in 42 states, as also in countries distant 6,000 to 10,000 miles. The club's founders earnestly desire that, in addition to being a center of influence favorable to the university's greater prosperity, it shall become the center of the alumni-life of the universityâone at which the returning alumnus can always feel thoroughly at home, thus inducing him frequently to renew the old associations of his college days. It is therefore one of the club's most important functions to help the widely scattered alumni to keep in closer touch with their Alma Mater and with each other than would otherwise be practicable. Through the club's influence, more alumni are revisiting the university than ever before, both singly and in class reunions. The club is also proving useful as a headquarters for visiting educators and other influential university visitors. It now maintains three large and pleasant sleeping-rooms, ready for use without formality and with or without notice (rate, $1 a day, including light, heat, attendance, and use of bath). The club's non-resident dues are $4 a year; or this rate may be commuted to $25 for ten years or $50 for life. The present officers are: Richard Heath Dabney, President; Howard Winston, Treasurer; Russell Bradford, Secretary. REGISTER OF STUDENTS. REGISTER OF STUDENTS. 1912-1913.
