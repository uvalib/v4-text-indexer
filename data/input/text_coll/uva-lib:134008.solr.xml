      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION HISTORICAL SKETCH By an act of the Legislature of Virginia, dated January 12, 1803, certain citizens of Albemarle County were incorporated under the style of "Trustees of Albemarle Academy," and were empowered to take such steps as seemed practicable to raise the funds necessary for erecting buildings and putting the Academy into operation. Albemarle Academy was destined never to exist except on paper, but under the guidance of Thomas Jefferson, who was elected to the board of trustees on March 23, 1814, a process of development was begun leading first to the organization of Central College, and afterwards to that of the University of Virginia. On August 19, 1814, the committee of the trustees appointed to select a site reported that it would be desirable to locate the Academy in the vicinity of the town of Charlottesville, distant not more than half a mile therefrom. By an act of February 14, 1816, the Legislature authorized the establishment of "Central College, in the County of Albemarle, at the place which has been, or shall be, selected by the trustees of Albemarle Academy, and in lieu of such Academy." All rights and claims of Albemarle Academy were, by the same act, vested in Central College. The board of visitors of the College consisted of six members, of whom Jefferson was the only one who had been a member of the Academy board. The other five members were James Madison, James Monroe, Joseph Carrington Cabell, David Watson, and John H. Cocke. On May 5, 1817, Jefferson was elected Rector of the College, and, on the same day, the board authorized the purchase of a farm of about two hundred acres laying one mile west of Charlottesville as a site for the College. This tract now forms a part of the grounds of the University of Virginia. The cornerstone of Central College was laid on October 6, 1817, in the presence of Thomas Jefferson, Rector, and of James Madison and James Monroe âthe latter then President of the United States. This building, located on what is known as the West Lawn of the University, is now utilized as the Colonnade Club. Jefferson's plan was to erect a distinct building, a "pavilion," for each individual professorâthe buildings to be arranged around a rectangular lawn. Each pavilion was to contain "a schoolroom and apartment for the accommodation of the professor," and one-story dormitories for the students were to be erected adjacent to the pavilions. Jefferson drew most of the sketches for the buildings with his own hands, basing them upon designs by Palladio; and his ideas of architectural effect and groupings were carried out in detail when Central College was merged into the University of Virginia. The prime object in Jefferson's mind, while Rector of Central College, was to get the college well under way, and then have it adopted by the Legislature as the State University. Accordingly, in the first report of the visitors to the Legislature, on January 6, 1818, it is recommended that a state university be established on the site of Central College. By an act of February 21, 1818, the Legislature authorized the appointment by the Governor of a board of twenty-four members, to be known as the "Board of Commissioners of the University." It was the duty of this board to meet on August 1, 1818, at the Tavern in Rockfish Gap, on the Blue Ridge Mountains, and report upon the following points regarding the organization of a state university: 1. A proper site for the projected university. 2. A plan for the building thereof. 3. The branches of learning which should be taught therein. 4. The number and description of professorships; and 5. Such general provisions as might properly be enacted by the Legislature for the better organizing and governing of the University. Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe were present at the meeting of the Commissioners, and their able and elaborate report to the Legislature (indicating much careful thought) had probably been prepared by Jefferson before the meeting was held. This report, recommending, among other things, the site of Central College as the most advantageous one for the University, was forwarded in duplicate to the Speaker of the House and the Speaker of the Senate on August 4, 1818. On January 25, 1819, the Legislature adopted a formal act "for establishing an university," and this date must be reckoned as the year of the origin of the University, although the institution was not opened to students until March 7, 1825. Although Jefferson's was the dominant spirit and the shaping hand in the whole movement for the establishment of a state university, it should be stated that but for the influence and efforts of Joseph Carrington Cabell, the close personal friend of Jefferson, the acts of February 21, 1818, and January 25, 1819, would probably have failed of adoption by the Legislature. The act of January 25, 1819, establishing the University, is as follows (Revised Code, 1819, ch. 34, 9): "1. Be it declared by the General Assembly of Virginia, That the conveyance of the lands and other property appertaining to the Central College in the County of Albemarle, which has been executed by the proctor thereof, under authority of the subscribers and founders, to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund, is hereby accepted, for the use and on the conditions in the said deed of conveyance expressed. "2. And be it enacted, That there shall be established, on the site provided for the said College, an University, to be called the University of Virginia; that it shall be under the government of seven Visitors to be appointed forthwith by the Governor, with the advice of Council, notifying thereof the persons so appointed, and prescribing to them a day for their first meeting at the said University, with supplementary instructions for procuring a meeting subsequently, in the event of failure at the time first appointed. "3. The said Visitors, or so many of them as, being a majority, shall attend, shall appoint a Rector, of their own body, to preside at their meetings, and a secretary to record, attest, and preserve their proceedings, and shall proceed to examine into the state of the property conveyed as aforesaid; shall make an inventory of the same, specifying the items whereof it consists; shall notice the buildings and other improvements already made, and those which are in progress; shall take measures for their completion, and for the addition of such others, from time to time, as may be necessary. "4. In the said University shall be taught the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages; French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Anglo-Saxon; the different branches of Mathematics, pure and physical; natural philosophy, the principles of agriculture; chemistry; mineralogy, including geology; botany; zoÃ¶logy; anatomy; medicine; civil government; political economy; the law of nature and nations; municipal law; history; ideology; general grammar, ethics, rhetoric; and belles lettres; which branches of science shall be so distributed, and under so many professors, not exceeding ten, as the Visitors shall think proper and expedient. "5. Each professor shall be allowed the use of the apartments and accommodations provided for him, and those first employed such standing salary as the Visitors shall think proper and sufficient, and their successors such standing salary, not exceeding one thousand dollars, as the Visitors shall think proper and sufficient, with such tuition fees from each student as the visitors shall from time to time establish. "6. The said Visitors shall be charged with the erection, preservation, and repair of the buildings, the care of the grounds and appurtenances, and of the interests of the University generally; they shall have power to appoint a bursar, employ a proctor, and all other necessary agents; to appoint and remove professors, two-thirds of the whole number of Visitors voting for the removal; to prescribe their duties and the course of education, in conformity with the law; to establish rules for the government and discipline of the students, not contrary to the laws of the land; to regulate tuition fees, and the rent of the dormitories occupied; to prescribe and control the duties and proceedings of all officers, servants, and others, with respect to the buildings, lands, appurtenances, and other property and interests of the University; to draw from the literary fund such monies as are by law charged on it for this institution; and, in general, to direct and do all matters and things which, not being inconsistent with the laws of the land, to them shall seem most expedient for promoting the purposes of said institution; which several functions they shall be free to exercise in the form of by-laws, resolutions, orders, instructions, or otherwise, as they shall deem proper. "7. They shall have two stated meetings in every year, to-wit, on the first Mondays of April and October; and occasional meetings at such other times as they shall appoint, or on a special call, with such notice as themselves shall prescribe by a general rule, which meetings shall be at the University, a majority of them constituting a quorum for business; and on the death, resignation of a member, or failure to act for the space of one year, or on his removal out of the Commonwealth, or by the Governor, with the advice of Council, the Governor with the like advice shall appoint a successor. "8. The said Rector and Visitors shall be a body corporate, under the style and title of `The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia,' with the right, as such, to use a common seal; they shall have capacity to plead and be impleaded in all courts of justice, and in all cases interesting to the University, which may be subjects of legal cognizance and jurisdiction; which pleas shall not abate by the determination of their office, but shall stand revived in the name of their successors; and they shall be capable in law, and in trust for the University, of receiving subscriptions and donations, real and personal, as well from bodies corporate or persons associated, as from private individuals. "9. And the said Rector and Visitors shall, at all times, conform to such laws as the legislature may, from time to time, think proper to enact for their government; and the said University shall in all things, and at all times, be subject to the control of the legislature. And the said Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia shall be, and they are hereby, required to make report annually to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund (to be laid before the legislature at the next succeeding session), embracing a full account of the disbursements, the funds on hand, and a general statement of the condition of said University. "10. The said Board of Visitors, or a majority thereof, by nomination of the Board, shall, once in every year at least, visit the said University; enquire into the proceedings and practices thereat; examine the progress of the students, and give to those who excell in every branch of science there taught, such honorary marks and testimonials of approbation as may encourage and incite to industry and emulation. "11. On every twenty-ninth day of February, or, if that be Sunday, then on the next, or earliest day thereafter on which a meeting can be effected, the Governor and Council shall be in session, and shall appoint Visitors of the said University, either the same or others at their discretion, to serve until the twenty-ninth day of February next ensuing, duly and timely notifying to them their appointment and prescribing a day for their first meeting at the University; after which, their meetings, stated and occasional, shall be as hereinbefore provided: Provided, that nothing in this act contained shall suspend the proceedings of the Visitors of the said Central College of Albemarle; but for the purpose of expediting any objects of said institution, they shall be authorized, under the control of the Governor and Council, to continue the exercise of their functions, and fulfill those of their successors, until the first actual meeting of their said successors. "12. And be it further enacted, That the additional sum of twenty thousand dollars shall be, and the same is hereby, appropriated to the education of the poor, out of the revenue of the Literary Fund, in the aid of the sum heretofore appropriated to that object, and to be paid in the same manner and upon the same conditions in all respects as is prescribed by the fourth section of the act entitled `An act appropriating part of the revenue of the Literary Fund, and for other purposes, passed the twenty-first day of February, eighteen hundred and eighteen.' "13. This act shall commence and be in force from and after the passing thereof." The first Board of Visitors consisted of four members of the board of Central Collegeânamely, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Joseph Carrington Cabell, and John H. Cocke; the additional appointees were James Breckenridge, Chapman Johnson, and Robert Taylor. The Board met for the first time on May 29, 1819, and elected Thomas Jefferson rector. Henceforth, until his death in 1826, Jefferson was the dominating and directing power of the University, not only evolving the entire system of education introduced, but actually devising, to the minutest detail, every feature of construction and administration. The organization of the University, its government, discipline, and methods of instruction, were virtually prescribed by Jefferson alone; and in many respects they still retain the impression derived from him. By virtue of its charter, the supreme government of the institution, under the General Assembly, is vested in the Rector and Visitors. Under the general direction of this Board, and subject to its regulations, the affairs of the University were administered, for the first eighty years of its existence, by the Faculty and its Chairman, the latter being a member of the Faculty, who occupied temporarily the position of chief executive officer of the institution. As the University grew, it became more and more difficult for a member of the teaching staff to fill the position of Chairman, and attend to the manifold executive duties attached to that office. In October, 1903, the Visitors decided that modern conditions rendered necessary the creation of the office of president; and in June, 1904, Edwin Anderson Alderman was elected first president of the University of Virginia. The scheme of instruction organized by Jefferson contemplated no fixed uniform curriculum of studies to be pursued by every student alike, without discrimination. Each distinct branch of knowledge was, as far as was practicable assigned to an individual "School" with its own instructors; and the University was to consist of a collection of independent Schools. The origin of the elective system at the University of Virginia is found in the fact that students were permitted to matriculate in any School or Schools of the University for which they were prepared. The wisdom of the Founder in establishing such a system has been amply vindicated in the history of this University and in the adoption by almost all schools of higher education in the country of methods involving this principle. The original organization embraced eight independent Schoolsânamely, Ancient Languages, Modern Languages, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Moral Philosophy, Chemistry, Medicine, and Law. The first seven Schools mentioned were opened to matriculates on March 7, 1825, with an aggregate attendance, during the first session, of 123 students. The School of Law was not opened until 1826. This original organization was gradually enlarged and modified. As early as 1837 the School of Medicine was elevated to a Department, consisting of three individual Schools; while in 1850 the School of Law was enlarged to a Department consisting of two Schools. Other Departments and Schools have been added from time to time. A most notable addition was made in May, 1909, when, through a gift from Mr. Andrew Carnegie to the General Alumni Association, six new Schools were established by joint action of the Rector and Visitors and the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund: The Andrew Carnegie School of Engineering, The James Madison School of Law, The James Monroe School of International Law, The James Wilson School of Political Economy, The Edgar Allan Poe School of English, The Walter Reed School of Pathology. In April, 1919, was founded through the generous gift of Mr. Paul Goodloe McIntire, the McIntire School of Fine Arts, embracing instruction in Art, Architecture and Music. It was provided by the Board of Visitors, in accordance with Jefferson's wishes, that but two degrees should be conferred by the University. The lower degree, characteristic of the institution for many years, was conferred upon a student who had completed all the work offered in any one School; to such a candidate the untitled degree of "Graduate" in the School in question should be given. The other, the higher degree, was to be the Doctor's degree and was to be given to the graduate in two or more Schools who had, in addition, exhibited well-developed powers of research. There is abundant evidence that, in planning the organization of the University of Virginia, Thomas Jefferson had in mind the so-called continental type of university. The first faculty were, however, with one or two exceptions, Oxford or Cambridge men. Naturally they had in mind the English type of university, and the result was that in 1831 the faculty substituted for the Doctor's degree proposed by Jefferson, the Master's degree, common in England. The degree of "Master of Arts of the University of Virginia" was accordingly, for more than half a century, the leading degree conferred by this institution. THE HONOR SYSTEM For eighteen years after the opening of the institution, written examinations were conducted under the surveillance of a committee of three professors. This was not altogether satisfactory, and in June, 1842, Judge Henry St. George Tucker, Professor of Law, offered the following resolution, which the Faculty at once adopted: Resolved, That in all future written examinations for distinction and other honors of the University, each candidate shall attach to the written answers presented by him on such examination a certificate in the following words: "I, A. B., do hereby certify, on honor, that I have derived no assistance during the time of this examination from any source whatever, whether oral, written, or in print, in giving the above answers." This was the beginning of the Honor System at this institution, and it has been in operation ever since without interruption. Later the pledge was extended so as to preclude the giving as well as the receiving of assistance. Still more recently the scope of the Honor System has been enlarged so as to cover other phases of student conduct. Its administration is entirely in the hands of the students, the essence of the system being that the violation of a student's word of honor is an offense not against the University authorities, but against the whole student body, and on the rare occasions on which it has occurred, the students themselves have quietly and promptly sent the offender away from the University without need of faculty action. Examinations are required to be held in one place and in the presence of the professor in charge of the course or one of his assistants. These regulations in no way conflict with the spirit of the Honor System, but are regarded as being necessary to give a proper dignity and formality to the occasion.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS For admission to any department of the University, the general conditions are the following: 1. Sufficient Age.âThe minimum legal age is sixteen years. 2. Good Character.âThis must be attested by a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended, or by other valid proof. 3. Adequate Preparation.âThis must be such as will enable the candidate to meet the requirements for admission to the several departments of the University as detailed below. For admission to the Department of Graduate Studies, see page 272. For admission to the Department of Law, see page 367. For admission to the Department of Medicine, see page 381. For admission to the Department of Education, see page 286. For admission to the College of Arts and Sciences, or the Department of Engineering, the candidate must present a certificate or pass an equivalent examination. In either case the amount of preparation required is measured in terms of units. A unit represents a year's study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year's work. This definition of a unit takes the four-year high-school course as a basis and assumes that the length of the school year is from thirty-six to forty weeks, that a period is from forty to sixty minutes in length, and that the study is pursued for four or five periods a week; but under ordinary circumstances a satisfactory year's work in any subject cannot be accomplished in less than one hundred and twenty hours, or their equivalent. For the requirements as to the number and selection of the units required for entrance, see, for the College of Arts and Sciences, page 186, for the Department of Engineering, page 307. Admission of Women.âThe admission of women to the several departments of the University is subject to the following conditions: 1. General Requirements: The applicant must be at least twenty years old on the birthday preceding matriculation; must present a certificate showing graduation from an accredited public high school, or not less than four years' attendance in an accredited private school, with credit for not less than 15 college entrance units obtained at least two years before admission to the University; and must in addition show by proper certificate the completion in a standard college, subsequent to the credit obtained for 15 entrance units, of at least 30 session-hours (60 semester-hours), of courses of college grade, in not less than eighteen calendar months. 2. Specific Departmental Requirements: These will be found in the requirements for admission to each of the several departments. ADMISSION BY CERTIFICATE For admission by certificate from a secondary school the applicant should file with the Dean a certificate of preparation, made out on a blank form furnished by the University. This certificate must come from an accredited public high school or from an accredited private secondary school. For admission from an institution of collegiate rank, an official transcript of the applicant's record, made out on the form used by the institution in question, must be submitted. In addition, each applicant, whether from a secondary school or a college, should submit a formal application for admission, on a blank from supplied by the University. The candidate for admission from a public high school must be a full graduate of an accredited four-year high school. The candidate for admission from a private secondary school must be a full graduate of the school, or must present a certificate showing that he has completed at least the equivalent of four years of satisfactory secondary school work of standard grade, covering at least 15 entrance units. Certificate credit for any unit is invalidated by failure in a college entrance examination on the unit in question in the year admission is desired, unless the applicant ranked in the highest quarter of his class. An applicant for admission who ranked in the lowest quarter of his class, or who failed on more than two subjects in secondary school, will not be admitted unless he presents positive evidence that he is likely to succeed in college in spite of his secondary school record. An applicant for admission from outside of Virginia may be required to supplement his application by an interview with a representative of the University. In every case the applicant must have a general character recommendation from the principal of his school, and personality and promise, as well as scholarly attainment, will be considered in determining admission. The University accredits all four-year public high schools and all private secondary schools which are fully accredited by the State Board of Education of Virginia. Schools outside of Virginia which are fully accredited by their own state universities or institutions of equal rank, by their own state departments of education or by recognized regional associations of secondary schools, are also accredited by the University. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must in all cases pass the entrance examinations. ADMISSION BY EXAMINATION For admission by examination, the candidate must present himself at the University in September, according to the dates given in the Schedule of Entrance Examinations. The examinations are held under the Honor System, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge, and they are held only on the dates given in the Schedule. A fee of one dollar is charged for each examination taken. This fee is payable in advance and is in no case returned. In order to take the examinations it is only necessary for the candidate to register for them at the Dean's Office, after his arrival here. The entrance examinations of the University are similar, in many respects, to those of the College Entrance Examination Board. The University does not furnish sample copies of its entrance examinations. Official records of the examinations of the College Entrance Examination Board or of the University of the State of New York may be submitted in lieu of taking entrance examinations here.

      <field name="fulltext">GENERAL REGULATIONS REGISTRATION Registration.âApplicants seeking admission to the University should present themselves to the Deans of their respective Departments at some time during the first three days of the session. Delayed Registration.âAny student who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session will not be admitted unless he can explain his delay in a manner satisfactory to the Dean and will be charged a delayed registration fee. Registration after the Christmas Recess and the March Examination Period.âAfter the Christmas Recess and the March examination period, every student is required to register by attending the first meeting of each class and laboratory section for which he is enrolled. No further formality is necessary. Any student failing to register thus will be required to pay the delayed registration fee, and will be liable to penalties imposed for unexcused absences. But if the delay is due to illness or other providential cause the Dean is authorized to remit the fee. RESIDENCE AND ATTENDANCE The Academic Year begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September and continues for thirty-nine weeks. Thanksgiving Day and Jefferson Day are holidays, and there is a Christmas recess beginning on the last week-day before the twenty-third of December and closing on the evening of the second of January. Attendance is required of each student throughout the entire session, with the exception of holidays, unless he receives permission to be temporarily absent, or to withdraw before the close of the session. While in residence each student is required to attend regularly all lectures and other prescribed exercises in the course which he pursues, or else suffer such penalties as may be imposed for unexcused absences. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the Department in which the student is registered. For the conditions governing the return of fees upon withdrawal, see page 153. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the several departmental faculties for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also the regulations as to delinquent students in the various departments. Absence from Examinations.âWritten examinations are an essential part of the work of every course in the University, and attendance upon them is required of every student. Absence may be excused only on the ground of sickness on the day of examination (attested by a physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause which may be approved by the several faculties of the University. Special Examinations are granted only upon prompt application therefore, and in case the applicant's absence from the regular examination has been excused. Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the Honor System, and an unpledged paper is counted a total failure. In matters of class standing as well, students are expected to regard themselves as governed by the law of honor. Prohibition of Credit.âAn act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting minor students. The license to contract debts, which the President is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity. CONDUCT Conduct.âThe laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or anywhere else. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University for the residue of the current session every student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. The President will dismiss from the University every student convicted of public drunkenness, or of other conduct reflecting serious discredit upon the University. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objection to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The publication or sale of anonymous publications is forbidden. Motor driven vehicles either owned or operated by students are prohibited from parking in the roadways or elsewhere on the University grounds between the hours of 9:00 a. m. and 3:30 p. m. At no time may they park in the alleys, near fire hydrants, or on curves. However, students suffering from serious physical disability may be granted permits to park. MEDICAL ATTENDANCE Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the University Physician; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for his maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, treatment of the eye, ear, nose and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of students, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Students who take the responsibility of boarding at houses not approved by the Board of Health forfeit the right of medical attendance. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the University Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. EXPENSES Payment of Fees.âWhen the aggregate charge for University fee, tuition fee, laboratory fees and room rent does not exceed $50 for the session, the total amount shall be paid upon registration. If said fees aggregate more than $50, but do not exceed $100, one-half thereof shall be paid upon registration and the remainder at the beginning of the second term. When the fees aggregate more than $100, payment shall be made one-third upon registration; one-third at the opening of the second term and the remainder at the opening of the third term. If any payment remain unpaid for fifteen days after the date on which it is due, the Bursar shall immediately notify the Dean of the Department in which such student is entered of the delinquency, and such student shall by him be required at once to cease attending lectures, using laboratories, library, gymnasium, athletic grounds or buildings, boarding at the dining hall, and making use of any other privileges as a student until his financial relations with the University have been arranged satisfactorily with the Bursar. Return of Fees.âA student withdrawing within five days after registering shall have his fees refunded in full, except the sum of $5 to cover cost of registration, and his name shall be stricken from the rolls. If he withdraw or is dropped from the rolls for any cause after the fifth day of the term and before the middle thereof, his fees shall be returned pro rata. If he withdraw or be dropped from the rolls for any cause after the middle of any term no refund shall be made for that term, except in case of sickness when the refund shall be pro-rated upon certificate of the University Physician or other reputable medical practitioner. In any case a minimum charge of $5 shall be made to cover cost of registration. Laboratory fees shall be refunded upon statement of professor in charge except where the withdrawal is within five days after registering. Regulation Concerning Registration as Virginia Student.âIn order to be considered a Virginia student, it is necessary that the applicant's parents be domiciled in the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; or if he has attained his majority, that he himself be domiciled in said State; and that either his parents or the applicant for admission shall have been bona fide taxpayers in the State of Virginia for at least two years prior to said application. Sons of Regular Officers of the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or Public Health Service, whether on the active or retired list, irrespective of the location of their posts of duty, are accorded the privilege of registering under the rules applicable to the registration of Virginia students. Superintendents and Teachers of Public Schools Exempt from Fees.â White male teachers and superintendents of the public schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Academic Schools of the University without payment of fees (except those charged in laboratory courses), upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the public schools of the State during the year. Applicants for admission as teachers are required to send in their names to the President of the University not later than March 5. Ministers of Religion and Candidates for the Ministry.âMinisters of religion may attend any of the Academic Schools of the University without payment of the tuition fee. The same privilege will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet without aid the expenses of an education.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">UNIVERSITY CHARGES** ** These charges are for three or more courses. For one course the student will pay one-third, and for two courses, one-half of the University fee and tuition, for the session. University and Tuition Fees* * The University fee goes to the fund intended to defray the general expenses of the University. Payment of this fee entitles the student, without additional charge, to the use of the library; to the privileges of the gymnasium, with baths, etc. (but not private lockers), and the advice and aid of the physical training staff, and to free medical attendance by the University Physician in case of illness.

APPROXIMATE SUMMARY OF NECESSARY EXPENSES The figures in the following tables may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of nine months. As necessary expenses are reckoned here University, tuition, athletic and Topics fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. For each department three estimates are givenâa low, an average, and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundryâin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. If a student shares a room with another student, and practices the strictest economy, he may possibly reduce his expenses below the estimate.

Opportunities for employment are not infrequent, but no new student should attempt to attend the University unless he has sufficient private resources to defray at least half of the expenses of his first session. After a student has arrived at the University, the Bureau will make every effort to find suitable work for him, but no assurance of employment can be given until after the student's arrival. Students who desire the assistance of the Bureau are invited to apply for information by addressing the Director, Box 1487, University, Virginia. Loans will be provided for deserving students. See page 174. BOARD AND LODGING Dormitories.âStudents may reside in the University dormitories, in their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. The President will withdraw from the approved list any house in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Any change of residence during the session should be reported at the office of the Registrar. The Halls are reserved for first-year college and engineering students from high schools or preparatory schools who are required to live in them unless excused for special reasons by the Dean of the University. Supervision is provided by Counselors living in each unit of the Halls. These Counselors are responsible to the Dean for maintenance of order and the enforcement of University regulations, and are prepared to be of assistance to the occupants in an advisory capacity. For rules governing the rental and occupancy of University dormitories, and the rates charged for the same, see below. For list of private lodging houses, with rates, apply to Bursar. The University Dormitories The dormitories of the University of Virginia consist of The Halls, East Lawn and West Lawn, East Range and West Range, Dawson's Row, and Randall Building. Hot water heat and electric light are furnished throughout the dormitories. Each occupant of a dormitory room must provide a pillow, pillow cases, single sheets, blankets, towels, etc., and whatever rugs, curtains, etc., he may desire. Description and Rates The Halls.âThe most comfortable, best-equipped, and most modern rooming accommodations in the University or in the city are to be found in the new University dormitories, erected in 1929. This group of eight buildings stands on the crest of the slope west of Monroe Hill, with an outlook on the Ragged Mountains and the range of the Blue Ridge, and is within less than three minutes walking distance from the gymnasium, the academic, engineering and law class-rooms, and the University Commons. These eight buildings are divided into twelve separate units, known as Halls, each with its individual entrance, and each bearing the name of some professor, distinguished in the history of the University. The buildings are of three stories and of full fire-proof brick and cement construction throughout. They provide one hundred and fifty-three two-room apartments, of living-room and bedroom, each apartment intended to accommodate two students. All of the rooms are approximately fifteen feet square. Each living-room has an open fire-place and is furnished with a desk with drawers, a table with drawer, a steel waste-basket, two rocking-chairs, two straight chairs and floor-plugs for reading lamps. Each bedroom has two large built-in clothes closets, and is furnished with two single beds, two chiffoniers, and two straight chairs. All furniture is new, of excellent quality and attractive design, the bed-springs and mattresses of especially high grade. There is an average of one bathroom to every five students. The bathrooms, each equipped with showers and an individual built-in steel locker and a medicine chest with mirror for each student using it, are so placed that every bedroom, with one sole exception, opens directly into a bath. Telephone service is provided in each Hall. Trunks and packing cases will not be permitted in the apartments of The Halls dormitories. They must be delivered to the trunk room in each Hall from which the student will remove the contents to his room. Trunks and packing cases will be stored in dry racks located in the basement. Each apartment will ordinarily be occupied by two students. The rental for the nine months of the regular session is $125 per student (or $250 for each apartment). East Lawn and West Lawn are of one-story brick construction. They contain thirty-eight rooms, each approximately twelve feet square, located between the pavilions and opening into colonnades running the entire length of "The Lawn." The rental of twenty-seven of the rooms, for the session, is $125 for one occupant or $170 for two occupants. The remaining nine rooms, called Bachelors' Row, rent for $115 for one occupant, or $160 for two occupants. These rooms are reserved for applicants for senior degrees. East Range and West Range consist of forty-six one-story brick rooms, approximately twelve feet square, built in sections running the entire length of "The Ranges," and opening into arcades. In addition, there are two two-story brick houses called the Old Gymnasium and the Club House, containing fourteen rooms, approximately fifteen feet square. The rental of the rooms on the Ranges, for the session, is $125 for one occupant or $170 for two. The rooms in the Old Gymnasium and the Club House rent for $80 for one occupant or $110 for two. Dawson's Row consists of a series of four eight-room two-story brick houses, and a six-room one-story brick house, located on the southwest side of the grounds. The rooms are approximately fifteen feet square. The rental of fifty-one of the rooms, for the session, is $95 for one occupant or $130 for two. Four of the rooms rent for $60 for one occupant or $80 for two. All of the rooms on the Lawns and Ranges and in Dawson's Row are provided with running cold water. For each of the Lawns and Ranges one bath-house is provided and there is a bath-house in Dawson's Row. Randall Building.âA two-story brick building, located at the south end of East Range, containing thirty-one single rooms ten by fourteen, ten by fifteen and ten by sixteen; eight double rooms fourteen by fifteen, fifteen by fifteen and fifteen by seventeen; one double room with study-room attached. Single rooms rent at $80 to $90; double rooms $125 for one occupant or $150 for two occupants. Double room with study-room attached, for one occupant $135, or $180 for two occupants. The furnishing of the rooms on the Lawns and Ranges, in Dawson's Row and Randall Building is as follows: For one occupantâan enameled iron bed with comfortable springs and mattresses, a chiffonier, a table, a straight chair and a rocking-chair. For two occupantsâtwo single beds or one double-deck bed with springs and mattresses, one chiffonier, one desk or two tables, one rocking-chair and two straight chairs. BOARD Board.âStudents may board at the University Commons, at their homes, or in private boarding houses or restaurants approved by the President. For cost of board at the University Commons, see below. For list of private boarding houses, with rates, apply to the Bursar. University Commons Meals may be had at the University Commons, a handsome building overlooking the McIntire Theatre and within two minutes walk of the dormitories. The interior of the beautiful penelled main room makes a charming atmosphere for dining and the furnishings are attractive. The meals are prepared by an experienced chef under the supervision of a trained dietitian and careful attention is given to quality and service. Board is supplied at cost and it is expected that the rate will in no event exceed $25 per month. Since the capacity of the Commons limits the number accommodated to about 350, it is essential that students make early application for reservation to Dr. E. A. Kincaid, Manager, 15 Monroe Hall.</field>

The award is made by a committee consisting of the professorial staff of the Miller School of Biology. The John Horsley Memorial Prize in Medicine with the emolument of $1,000. Founded in 1925 by Dr. J. Shelton Horsley, of Richmond, Va., as a memorial to his father, Mr. John Horsley of Nelson County, Va. The prize will be awarded every two years by a committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Virginia for the best thesis upon some subject in general surgery. The term "general surgery" is used in a broad way and includes the specialties commonly associated with general surgery such as orthopedic surgery, urology and gynecology but not the specialties of the surgery of the eye, ear, nose and throat. The prize is open to all graduates of the Department of Medicine of the University of Virginia of not more than fifteen years' standing. The award for the first time was made at the finals exercises in June, 1927. For further information address the Dean of the Department of Medicine, University, Va. The Lambda Gamma Chapter of Chi Omega Prize of $25.00 in cash is awarded to the woman student who possesses the highest qualifications in scholarship and promise of efficiency and adaptability. The award is made annually by a faculty committee composed of the Dean of Women, and the Deans of the Departments of the College, Education, Medicine, Law, Engineering and the Graduate School. (The prize was recently established and awarded for the first time in June of the session 1934-35.) The President and Visitors' Prize with an income of $100.00 in gold. Established in 1925 upon the gift of Mr. Hollis Rinehart, of Charlottesville, Va. Award to be made to a member of the academic staff of the University of Virginia for the most meritorious piece of scientific research during the year. The John White Stevenson Fund Prize in Political Science, with an income of $100. Established in 1930 by a gift from Judith Winslow. The prize will normally be awarded annually during the first week in May on the basis of merit displayed in competitive examination on certain announced classics of political literature. The Virginia Society of the Cincinnati Prize in American History, established by the Society of the Cincinnati in the State of Virginia. This prize is awarded annually and any male student of the University in good standing is eligible to compete. Each competitor shall present before the first of June in each academic year a study done by himself, and so certified, upon some phase of American History, preferably Virginian, of the period from 1750 to 1800. The papers are to be read and the award made by the staff of the School of History, or by a committee of that staff. The winner must submit to the University of Virginia for transmittal to the Secretary of the Society in Virginia a typewritten copy of the winning essay. The award consists of a check for $100 and a bronze medal especially designed and struck for this purpose. The medal on the reverse bears the seal of the University of Virginia and on the obverse the eagle of the Cincinnati with the legend, "Presented by the Society of the Cincinnati in the State of Virginia."</field>

He must offer, either by certificate or by examination, 15 units, of which 3 must be in English and 2Â½ in Mathematics (1Â½ in Algebra, 1 in Plane Geometry). The remaining 9Â½ units may be selected at will, but no credit will be given for less than 2 units in any foreign language, and credit will not be given for more than 4 vocational units. Admission from Other Colleges.âAn applicant for admission to the College of this University from an institution of collegiate rank may be admitted upon presentation of a satisfactory transcript of his record at his former college. No student suspended from another college for scholastic deficiency or on probation in another college for scholastic deficiency will be admitted to the College of this University in the immediately succeeding session, unless he passes at least one year-course, or the equivalent, in one term of the Summer Quarter of this University. No student from another college will be admitted to the College of this University if he has ever been suspended or on probation more than once, or if he has ever been both on probation and suspended. Credit for Work Done in Other Colleges.âCredit toward a degree may be allowed for work completed in another college upon presentation of a satisfactory transcript of record. In no case will credit be given for more than fifteen courses completed elsewhere. (See definition of a course under Requirements for Degrees.) A maximum credit for five courses may be granted for one year of work in another college, and a credit of eleven courses for two years. The final validation of credit granted on transcript of record is effected by the successful completion of not less than four courses during the candidate's first session here. In every case, the last session of candidacy for a degree, which must be a regular session of nine months or three full summer quarters, must be spent exclusively in college work in this University; and all courses offered in a Field of Concentration for the Bachelor of Arts or cultural Bachelor of Science degrees must be completed in residence in this University. In general, credit will not be granted for work completed elsewhere with the lowest passing grade, if the grades are given as letters, or with a grade below 75 per cent, if the grades are given as percentages, unless the student passes an advanced course in the same subject here. Conditioned Students.âA candidate for admission must offer 15 acceptable entrance units. A student who, while able to offer 15 units, cannot offer second-year (intermediate) algebra or plane geometry, may be admitted with a condition in either or both of these subjects. An entrance condition should be absolved before the beginning of the session following initial registration. This may be done by passing entrance examinations or by summer work. A student with an entrance condition should not attempt to study mathematics here, and no conditioned student may be awarded a degree until his condition is absolved. Special Students.âA candidate may be admitted as a special student without fulfilling the entrance requirements above specified, provided that, if he is a Virginian, he is more than twenty years old, or, if he is not a Virginian, he is more than twenty-three years old, on the day of registration, and gives adequate evidence of serious purpose and of the training needed to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for a degree; but such students are permitted and encouraged to make up their deficiencies by private study or by taking courses in the Summer Quarter. They will then be admitted as regular students, and may be accepted as applicants for degrees, provided all entrance requirements are met at least one academic year before the date of graduation. An applicant who has regularly attended a secondary school until he is twenty years of age without, because of failure, obtaining credit for 15 acceptable entrance units, will not be admitted as a special student. Admission of Women.âWomen are admitted as candidates for the vocational degrees of Bachelor of Science in Architecture, Bachelor of Science in Chemistry and Bachelor of Science in Commerce. They are not admitted as candidates for the B.A. or cultural B.S. degrees, as pre-professional students, or as special students. In order to be admitted as a candidate for a vocational degree, an applicant must be at least twenty years old on the birthday preceding matriculation; must present a certificate showing graduation from an accredited public high school, or not less than four years' attendance in an accredited private school, with credit for not less than 15 college entrance units obtained at least two years before admission to the University; and must in addition show by proper certificate the completion in a standard college, subsequent to the credit obtained for 15 entrance units, of at least ten courses (30 session-hours or 60 semester-hours) of college grade, in not less than eighteen calendar months. Admission during the Session.âNo applicant for admission to the College of Arts and Sciences will be admitted after the second week of lectures, unless the Committee on Admissions is satisfied that, in view of his record, he is likely to prove successful with the work undertaken in spite of the handicap of late entrance. A few students, of exceptional preparation and ability, may be admitted at the beginning of the second term, January 4. No students are admitted in February. COLLEGE REGULATIONS (1) Definition of a Course.âAn academic course is the work covered in an organized, scheduled class, meeting at least three hours a week throughout the session. Beginners' courses in foreign languages and certain first-year courses in mathematics may meet four or five hours weekly. Science courses with three hours of class work and six hours of laboratory work weekly are designated double-courses and are counted as two courses. (2) Maximum and Minimum Number of Courses to be Carried.âEach College student is required to carry five academic courses except under the conditions stated below: 1. A student on probation may carry only four courses. 2. Special permission to carry a reduced number of courses may be granted by the Dean for adequate reason, such as outside remunerative work, ill health, etc. 3. A student who has passed all of his courses in any term may carry an additional course in the succeeding term. 4. A student may carry an additional course if he is in his graduating year and needs for his degree only one course in excess of the number for which he is otherwise eligible. (3) Grade.âThe grade of a college student in any course, either for a term or for the session, is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Class standing in any course is determined by the regularity of the student's attendance upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercise) of the course, and by the quality of his work, as indicated by his recitation grades, written tests, laboratory work, etc. For passing in any course in the college a grade of 75 per cent. is required. (4) Exclusion from Courses, Probation and Suspension: (I) Exclusion from Courses: 1. A student who is evidently making no real progress in a course, may, at any time during the session, be excluded from the course by the Dean upon recommendation of the instructor concerned. 2. A student whose term grade in a course is less than 50 per cent., or who discontinues the course without permission of the Dean, or who is absent without excuse from the term examination, will be excluded from the course. (II) Probation and Suspension: 1. Probation is a state of warning, involving withdrawal from the student of certain privileges enumerated below. Suspension means enforced withdrawal from the College. 2. A student will be placed on probation if, in any term, he does not pass at least two courses, and, if he shall be excluded from a course or courses, he must, in order to avoid probation, pass at least two courses in excess of the number from which he is excluded. A student will be suspended if, in any term, he does not pass at least one course, and, if he shall be excluded from a course or courses, he must, in order to escape suspension, pass at least one course in excess of the number from which he is excluded. 3. A student on probation must carry at least four courses or be suspended. A student not on probation must carry at least five courses or be placed on probation. (But see (2) above.) 4. No student may remain on probation for more than two terms in his entire college course. If his record is such as to invoke probation a third time, he will be suspended. No student suspended a second time may reenter the College. 5. No student on probation may be a member of any student organization which publicly represents the University, such as an athletic team, a musical club or a student publication. 6. Suspension, if imposed during the session, applies to the remainder of the regular session; if imposed at the end of the session, it applies to the whole of the subsequent session. 7. Probation or suspension may be absolved by the passing of one year-course, or the equivalent, in one term of the Summer Quarter. 8. A student who is permitted to withdraw from the University during the session will be re-admitted only on probation if, at the time of his withdrawal, he was on probation. A student previously suspended will be readmitted only on probation. 9. The application of these regulations is automatic. A student may, however, appeal in writing to the Committee on Rules and Courses for relief from their application. The Committee will not accept remediable defects of vision or outside remunerative work as excuses for failure. A student is expected to have visual defects corrected, and, if much outside work is done, to carry a reduced schedule of courses. (5) Absence from Examinations will not be excused except for sickness on the day of examination attested by a physician's certificate or for other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. A student excused from more than one-half of his term examinations on account of illness may not be a member of any student organization which publicly represents the University, such as an athletic team, a musical club, or a student publication, until he has taken his examinations. No student may remain in the College if he misses all the examinations of two consecutive terms on account of illness. (6) Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, in accordance with (5) above, is entitled to a special examination on a date during the regular session to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge of the examination. (7) Re-Examinations.âA student who fails on the Final Comprehensive Examination for his degree may take a re-examination at the end of the succeeding session, on recommendation of the Academic School concerned, without further class attendance. Only one re-examination is permitted unless the student attends the University for a full session after his failure. There are no re-examinations on the work of separate courses. (8) Reports.âReports are sent at the end of each term to the parent or guardian of each College student. In addition to the above, a report on the standing of each first-year student in the College is sent to the student's parent or guardian early in November. (9) Voluntary Withdrawal.âVoluntary withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean, as well as the consent of the student's parent or guardian, if he is a minor. Any student who withdraws without permission will be recorded as having been suspended. A student who withdraws immediately before an examination period, except for providential reasons, is not permitted to re-enter the University for the succeeding term. (10) Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also Suspension, above. (11) Change of Studies.âNo change can be made in a student's program of studies except with the written consent of the Dean, together with official notification by the Registrar. No permit for change of courses will be issued after the end of the first week of each term. Any student who drops a course without permission will receive a grade of zero in that course; and no credit may be received for any portion of a course attended before formal permission has been granted as outlined above. (12) Absence from Lectures may be excused by the Dean, but only for sickness or other imperative cause. Any explanation of an absence which a student has to offer must be made in writing to the Dean within one week after the absence. But no excuse for an absence may be submitted after the beginning of an examination period. Any student not on probation is allowed 2 absences without penalty each term in each course, and a student who passed, in the preceding term, on all courses taken, aggregating not less than five, is allowed 4 absences without penalty each term in each course. But the performance of written work and laboratory work is not affected by the allowance of absences without penalty. Each unexcused absence (in excess of absences without penalty) from a class exercise in any term will cause one point to be deducted from the student's term grade. A total of more than 10 unexcused absences (in excess of absences without penalty) in any term will cause a student to be placed on probation. Probation imposed for absences is called "attendance probation," and it carries the penalties of probation imposed for failure in courses. If a student incurs attendance probation while on probation for failure in courses he will be suspended. No student who was, for any reason, absent from more than 50 per cent. of the lectures of a course in any term can receive a grade on the course in that term. This regulation does not apply to students on the Dean's List or to holders of Intermediate Honors. The laws relating to absence from the University of members of athletic teams are found in the General Catalogue. The same regulations apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. (13) The Dean's List.âAny student who passed, in the preceding term, on all courses taken, aggregating not less than five, with an average grade on all courses of at least 85 per cent., will be placed on the Dean's List. A student on the Dean's List is not subject to the regulations limiting absence from classes, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class standing, imposed for absence alone. But the performance of written work and laboratory work is not affected by these regulations. (14) Physical Education Requirement.âAll first-year and second-year students in the College of Arts and Sciences, except professional students of Architecture, are required to take the course in Physical Education unless excused on a physician's certificate. (15) Schedule of Qualifying Examinations.â(See Requirements for Degrees.) The examinations will be held at 2:30 p. m., on the days indicated, in the first week of lectures. English A1: Monday and TuesdayâRoom 11, Cabell Hall. Mathematics A: Trigonometry, Monday; Analytical Geometry, Tuesdayâ Room 11, Mechanical Laboratory. French A2: WednesdayâOffice, Romance Pavilion. German A2: WednesdayâRoom 2, Minor Hall. Greek A2: ThursdayâRoom 103, Cabell Hall. Italian A2: ThursdayâOffice, Romance Pavilion. Latin A2: FridayâRoom 103, Cabell Hall. Spanish A2: FridayâOffice, Romance Pavilion. Note.âA properly prepared student who enters a B course in a language and passes it, will be exempted from the qualifying examination in that language and will receive credit toward a degree for the B course. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES Full opportunity is given to any student to carry out any definite plan of work which he may have in view on coming to the University, or which may have been prescribed for him by those under whose direction he is completing his education. But when no well-considered plan has been outlined in advance, and the end in view is that for which the great majority of students should enter college, namely, the attainment of a liberal education, the student will be expected to enter upon regular work of the college leading to a baccalaureate degree. Five degrees are offered candidates for graduation in the College of Arts and Sciences. Two of these, the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science, are cultural; the Bachelor of Science in Architecture, the Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, and the Bachelor of Science in Commerce, are vocational degrees, designed for those who wish to fit themselves especially for professional work. No course offered by a successful candidate for one of the cultural baccalaureate degrees can be offered by the same candidate as part of the work credited toward the other cultural baccalaureate degree, nor can any course which has been counted as credit toward a vocational degree be subsequently counted as credit toward a cultural degree; and no work done to remove an entrance condition can be counted for any degree. The normal time required for obtaining a baccalaureate degree is four years, assuming that the student completes each year courses which aggregate the regular minimum of five. A student may, however, materially shorten the time required for obtaining a degree by taking courses in the Summer Quarter for which college credit is given. For credit for work done at other colleges, see page 186. The requirements for the cultural baccalaureate degrees are such as to allow a large measure of freedom of election on the part of the individual student, such restriction only being placed upon this liberty as is necessary to insure at the same time the thoroughness and the breadth of culture for which these degrees stand. In order to secure to the recipient of a degree a due measure of acquaintance with the methods of thought characteristic of each of the leading departments of knowledge, as well as with their subject matter, his courses must be chosen subject to the specific requirements detailed below. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS Degree requirements are stated in terms of courses. An academic course is the work covered in an organized, scheduled class, meeting at least three hours a week throughout the session. Beginners' courses in foreign languages and certain first-year courses in mathematics may meet four or five hours weekly. Science courses with three hours of class work and six hours of laboratory work weekly are designated double-courses and are counted as two courses. For graduation from the College of Arts and Sciences the candidate must have taken and passed a total of twenty courses, completed in conformity with the regulations prescribed for the several degrees. Exemption from certain Required Courses may be obtained as set forth below. Such exemption increases the student's freedom of election, but does not reduce the total number of courses (20) required for a degree. Qualifying examinations are scheduled at the beginning of the session, and no such examination may be taken more than once. BACHELOR OF ARTS AND BACHELOR OF SCIENCE The candidate must complete a total of twenty courses, chosen in accordance with the following regulations: I. Required Courses The eight courses prescribed below must be completed at least one year before graduation. Not less than six of them must be completed at least two years before graduation. English: English A1. Students passing a qualifying examination on English A1 will be exempted from further requirement in English. Foreign Languages: A first-year college course (A1) and a second-year college course (A2) in each of two foreign languages. A candidate for the degree of Bachelor of Arts must offer two courses in Greek or Latin. A candidate for the degree of Bachelor of Science must offer two courses in French or German. A student who presents admission credit for two units of German, Greek or Latin, or for three units of French, Italian or Spanish, must enter the A2 course if he wishes to study the language in question. If he passes the A2 course he will be exempted from further requirement in that language. Students passing a qualifying examination on the A2 course in any language will be exempted from further requirement in that language. Mathematics: Mathematics A1 or A2. Students passing a qualifying examination on Mathematics A will be exempted from further requirement in mathematics. Natural Science: Biology B1 or Chemistry B1 or Geology B1 or Physics B1. II. Field of Concentration A student who has passed not less than six of the Required Courses two years before graduation, shall at the beginning of his next session select as his Field of Concentration a Major Subject taught in one of the Academic Schools. Before registration he must present, as part of his plan of study for the next two years, a program of not less than five nor more than seven courses approved in writing by an official adviser for his Major School. This program must include not less than three courses offered in the Major School and not less than two courses in subjects related to the Field of Concentration. No course offered by the candidate as a Required Course may be counted as part of the major program. All courses included in a Field of Concentration must be completed in this University. III. Electives The remaining courses needed to make up the required twenty may be elected from courses in the Academic Schools for which the candidate has adequate preparation. Final Comprehensive Examination A candidate for a degree must make a satisfactory standing in a final comprehensive examination on his Field of Concentration, set by the faculty of his Major School. This examination shall be in lieu of separate final examinations in all courses in the Field of Concentration, taken in the session of graduation, which the Major School may include in it. It may be wholly a written examination, or partly written and partly oral. Professional Courses in Field of Concentration The first-year course in the Department of Law or the first-year course in the Department of Medicine, of this University, may be substituted for four academic courses in the Field of Concentration. This substitution cannot be made unless the candidate has spent three full sessions in the College of Arts and Sciences of this University and has obtained credit for sixteen courses, including: 1. The eight Required Courses (not less than six of which must be completed at least two years before graduation). Exemption from Required Courses, as provided above, increases the student's freedom of election, but does not reduce the total number of courses (16) which must be completed in the College. 2. A program of four courses, to be taken during the candidate's third year in the College, and to be approved in writing before registration by an adviser designated by the Dean of the College. 3. Electives, chosen from courses in the Academic Schools for which the candidate has adequate preparation. A candidate who includes the first-year course in Law or Medicine in his Field of Concentration is exempted from the Final Comprehensive Examination. Physical Education In addition to satisfying the requirements for graduation stated above, a candidate must complete a two-year course in physical education, unless excused on a physician's certificate. This work must be taken during the first two years and must be completed at least one year before graduation. SUGGESTIONS TO STUDENTS ON PLANNING A BACHELOR OF ARTS OR BACHELOR OF SCIENCE DEGREE Since all but two of the Required Courses must be completed two years before graduation, the student is in general advised to confine himself to such courses in his first year and to postpone freedom of election. In the second year, election of courses should be made primarily with a view to exploring academic fields in which the candidate may wish to major. In general the B1 courses in important subjects which are not represented among the Required Courses should be elected in the second year. The following are suggested as suitable electives to introduce a student to possible Fields of Concentration: Archaeology B1, Astronomy B1, Biblical Literature B1, Economics B1, Government B1, History B1, B2 or B5, Philosophy B1, Psychology B1, Rural Social Economics B1, Sociology B1. Courses in Commerce, Education, the Fine Arts, Forestry or Public Speaking may be elected by students interested in these subjects. As many as two of the Required Courses may be completed as late as the third year. However, it should be noted that an A1 course in a Required language should not be taken later than the second year. If such a course be postponed until the third year, the A2 course in that language must be completed in the following summer, since all Required Courses must be passed at least one year before graduation. It is not advisable to take A1 courses in two foreign languages in the same year. Examples of degree programs are given below. Variations are often desirable. A student who passes qualifying examinations will have greater freedom of election than is indicated. A Field of Concentration, in the programs, is assumed to include six courses. 1. For students who present less than two entrance units in foreign language: First Year: English A1, Language A1, Science B1, Mathematics A1 or A2, Physical Education. Second Year: Language A2, Language A1, Elective, Elective, Elective, Physical Education. Third Year: Language A2, Major, Major, Major, Elective. Fourth Year: Major, Major, Major, Elective, Elective. 2. For students who present entrance units sufficient to enter the A2 course in one foreign language: First Year: English A1, Language A2, Science B1, Mathematics A1 or A2, Physical Education. Second Year: Language A1, Elective, Elective, Elective, Elective, Physical Education. Third Year: Language A2, Major, Major, Major, Elective. Fourth Year: Major, Major, Major, Elective, Elective. 3. For students who present entrance units sufficient to enter the A2 course in each of two foreign languages: First Year: English A1, Language A2, Science B1, Mathematics A1 or A2, Physical Education. Second Year: Language A2, Elective, Elective, Elective, Elective, Physical Education. Third Year: Major, Major, Major, Elective, Elective. Fourth Year: Major, Major, Major, Elective, Elective. DEGREES WITH HONORS The courses required for the B.A. and cultural B.S. degrees are adapted to the powers of the average student, and any graduate of an accredited school, who has, either by certificate or examination, satisfied the requirements for admission to the College of Arts and Sciences, if he is reasonably industrious and regular in his studies, should obtain one of these degrees without great difficulty in four sessions' work. In every body of students, however, there are a number who possess greater ability and application than the average, and whose ambition aims higher than a bare pass-mark on their work. For the proper stimulation of such students toward the best that they can do, and for due and authoritative recognition of unusual ability and high achievement in studies, the Academic Faculty has instituted the following system of Special Honors: Intermediate Honors A certificate of Intermediate Honors is conferred by the Academic Faculty on the student who, during his first two regular sessions in the College of Arts and Sciences of this University, has passed not less than ten academic courses, including six of the eight Required Courses, without failure on any course, and with an average grade on all courses of 85 per cent. or more each session. The holder of a Certificate of Intermediate Honors, so long as he has no grade below 75 per cent. on the work of any term in any course, is not subject to the rules limiting absence from the University, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class-standing, imposed for absence alone. The Certificates of Intermediate Honors are publicly conferred at the Annual Convocation of the University following the session in which the honors have been attained. The names of the holders of these certificates are published under a separate heading in the annual catalogue of the University. Final Honors Final Honors are conferred only on graduation, and the diploma of B.A. or B.S. with Final Honors states that the honors were won in a given academic school. A student who wishes to attain Final Honors must be accepted as a candidate for honors two sessions before graduation. Any student who has met the requirements for the Dean's List for two sessions may apply to become a candidate for Final Honors. Application must be made first to the Dean, and, if approved by him, must also be approved by one of the academic schools which offer work for honors. A list of such schools is published annually. Final honors are conferred on the basis of a final comprehensive examination, both oral and written, on some field of knowledge, and not for work done in any or all of the regular courses required for a baccalaureate degree. Honors work involves wide and independent reading for two years, under the general direction of the professors of an academic school. It does not require regular attendance upon lectures or the passing of any tests or examinations, except the final examinations, though consultations and reports may be required. Its aim is the development of a capacity for scholarly work in a field of knowledge, rather than a mastery of required details of subject matter. The completion of work for Final Honors may be counted as credit towards a B.A. or cultural B.S. degree in lieu of two courses, other than Required Courses. In the event that the work for honors is not of sufficiently high quality for Final Honors to be conferred, credit for two courses toward a degree without honors may be granted upon recommendation of the academic school in charge. BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN ARCHITECTURE The candidate must complete the courses in the following program. Exemption from Required A courses in English, mathematics and language may be obtained as in the case of the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees. Such exemption increases freedom of election, but does not reduce the total number of courses required for the degree. At the beginning of his first and each subsequent year of candidacy for this degree the student must have his program of study approved in writing by an official adviser for the School of Architecture. First Year: Mathematics A1 or A2 English A1 Approved Modern Language or Elective Architectural Drawing B1 Projective Drawing B1 Freehand Drawing B1 Second Year: Architectural Construction B1 History of Art B1 Approved Modern Language or Elective Architectural Design B1 Freehand Drawing B2, first and third terms Modeling B1, second term Projective Drawing B2 Pure Design, second and third terms (Alternate years with History of Ornament) Third Year: Architectural Construction B2 History of Art B2 Economics B1, first and second terms Commercial Law for Architects, third term Architectural Design B2 Water Color B1, first and third terms Modeling B2, second term Elements of Surveying, first term History of Ornament, second and third terms (Alternate years with Pure Design) Fourth Year: Reinforced Concrete Design, first term Mechanical Equipment of Buildings, second and third terms History of Art B3 Architectural Design B3 or B4 Outdoor Sketching, first term Freehand Drawing B3, third term Professional Practice, second term (Given in alternate years) One elective in the second term selected from the following: Colonial Archaeology Perspective Rendering Special Architectural Studies Modeling B3 BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN CHEMISTRY The candidate must complete a total of twenty courses, chosen in accordance with the following program. Exemption from Required A courses in English, mathematics and language may be obtained as in the case of the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees. In addition, a student who presents admission credit for three units of French is exempted from the requirement of French A1. Such exemption from Required Courses increases freedom of election, but does not reduce the total number of courses (20) required for the degree. Applications for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Chemistry must be approved in writing by an official adviser for the School of Chemistry not later than two years before graduation. First Year: Chemistry B1 English A1 French A1 Mathematics A1 or A2 First-year Physical Education Second Year: Chemistry B2 Chemistry B6 English B6 German A1 or A2 Mathematics B2 Second-year Physical Education Third Year: Chemistry B4 Chemistry B7 Physics B1 German A2 or Approved Elective Fourth Year: Chemistry C1 Chemistry C2 Approved Elective BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN COMMERCE The candidate must complete a total of twenty courses, chosen in accordance with the following regulations: I.

Field of Concentration At the beginning of the second and all subsequent years of candidacy for this degree, and before registration, a student must have his program of study approved in writing by an official adviser for the School of Commerce. Ten courses are required in the Field of Concentration, seven of which are prescribed for all candidates for the degree. The remaining three courses must be approved by the official adviser for the School of Commerce. The seven prescribed courses are as follows: Economic Geography B1 Commercial Law B1 Economics B1 (The Principles of Economics) Economics B2 (The Growth of American Commerce and Industry) Economics B3 (Money and Banking) Economics B4 (Elementary Accounting) Economics B5 (Statistics) III. Electives The remaining courses needed to make up the required twenty may be elected from courses in the Academic Schools for which the candidate has adequate preparation. Final Comprehensive Examination A candidate for this degree must make a satisfactory standing in a final comprehensive examination on his Field of Concentration, set by the faculty of the School of Commerce. This examination shall be in lieu of separate final examinations in all courses in the Field of Concentration, taken in the session of graduation, which the School of Commerce may include in it. It may be wholly a written examination, or partly written and partly oral. Professional Course in Field of Concentration The first-year course in the Department of Law, of this University, may be substituted for four academic courses. This substitution cannot be made unless the candidate has spent three full sessions in the College of Arts and Sciences of this University and has obtained credit for sixteen courses, including: 1. The eight Required Courses (not less than six of which must be completed at least two years before graduation). 2. Eight courses in the Field of Concentration, six of which must be passed by all candidates for the degree. The remaining two courses will be prescribed by an official adviser for the School of Commerce: The six Required Courses are as follows: Economic Geography B1, Economics B1, Economics B2, Economics B3, Economics B4, Economics B5. 3.

      <field name="fulltext">DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES JOHN LLOYD NEWCOMB, B.A., C.E., Sc.D., LL.D. President of the University JOHN CALVIN METCALF, M.A., Litt.D., LL.D. Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE The Dean and Professors Manahan, Mitchell, Benton, Snavely, Balz, Jordan; for the Summer Quarter, The Dean and Professors Faulkner, Kepner, Snavely. HISTORICAL STATEMENT While the original organization of the Academic Schools of the University by Jefferson contemplated instruction of graduate grade in each School, the first "post-graduate department" in the modern sense was instituted in 1859-60 by Basil L. Gildersleeve, then Professor of Greek in the institution. The degree of Master of Arts continued to be conferred upon graduates in all six Schools of the University. Professor Gildersleeve conducted graduate courses in the School of Greek; shortly after the Civil War a "post-graduate department" was announced for the School of Latin. Graduate courses were offered in individual Schools, but there was no general department organization for graduate study until 1904. In that year the Department of Graduate Studies was established as a regular co-ordinate division of the University, with definitely prescribed regulations corresponding to the requirements of the Association of American Universities, in which the University of Virginia was the first Southern university to hold membership. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy had, however, been offered by the University as far back as 1880, and the first doctor's degree was awarded in 1885. From 1885 to 1935 the degree of Doctor of Philosophy has been conferred upon two hundred and forty-eight persons. The present requirements for graduate degrees, with certain modifications, have been in force since 1922. THE GRADUATE HOUSE The Graduate House, administrative headquarters of the Department of Graduate Studies, is on West Lawn. Besides the Dean's office, this building contains one large lecture-room for graduate classes and four seminar rooms specially equipped for small groups of students and professors engaged in advanced graduate work. At present the class-rooms are used for certain advanced courses in the Schools of English and History. The Bruce Collection of books for the use of graduate students in English is in this building. This departmental library, endowed by the late Professor J. Douglas Bruce of the University of Tennessee, an alumnus of the University, contains valuable source material. LIBRARY FACILITIES The University Libraries altogether contained on July 1, 1935, a total of 248,580 volumes. Departmental libraries afford specialized collections in science, classics, English, the social sciences, and education. The Medical Library, now in the new Medical Buildings, is spacious and well equipped for graduate study. Graduate students may, through the office of the General Library, get certain books needed in research from other university libraries on the inter-library loan system. Nearness to Washington makes the Library of Congress and the Folger Shakespeare Library easily available for graduate students. GRADUATE CLUBS There are regular weekly or bi-weekly departmental conferences of graduate students and professors for discussion of topics connected with graduate study. In the various physical sciences, in medical science, in the social sciences, and in humanistic studies, graduate clubs, composed of students and professors, are actively engaged in stimulating investigation and publication in their respective fields. The scientific society of Sigma Xi is an important organization for the advancement of technical knowledge, while the Institute for Research in the Social Sciences furnishes a fruitful field of activity. The University Committee on Research, while not specifically an organization of the Department of Graduate Studies, is a valuable auxiliary of the Department. This committee administers an annual appropriation for promoting research in the various Departments of the University, especially in the matter of the publication of the results of original investigation, and so aids the general cause of advanced scholarship. An annual volume, "Publications and Research," containing summaries of contributions by professors and students of the Graduate Department, is issued by the University. A list of doctoral dissertations, with abstracts, is published each September for distribution among other universities. SCIENTIFIC LABORATORIES Each Scientific School occupies a separate building with an extensive laboratory and a select departmental library. Statements in regard to laboratories and general scientific equipment in the Schools of Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Geology, Physics, and the Department of Medicine may be found under the announcements of those Schools. More detailed information is contained in the General Catalogue. ORGANIZATION The immediate direction of the Department of Graduate Studies is vested in the Dean and an Administrative Committee of eight professors, appointed by the President. The Faculty of the Graduate Department consists of those professors in the Academic Schools and the Medical School who offer graduate courses. Courses marked C are primarily for graduates and advanced under-graduates; those marked D are for graduates only, and usually for advanced graduate students, candidates for the Ph.D. degree. In the Department of Medicine the regular courses are evaluated as C courses; elective, special and research courses, and seminars as D courses. The prerequisites for each course are indicated, varying from 6 to 12 session-hours of college work. The various Schools, or departments, fall into four general divisions, or groups, as follows: Group IâLanguages, Literature, Fine Arts and Music. English, French, German, Greek, Latin, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Biblical Literature, Architecture, Music. Group IIâSocial and Philosophical Sciences. Commerce, Economics, Education, History, Philosophy, Psychology, Political Science, Sociology. Group IIIâMathematical and Natural Sciences. Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Geology, Mathematics, Physics. Group IVâMedical Sciences. Anatomy and Anthropology, Biochemistry, Dermatology and Syphilology, Histology and Embryology, Neurology, Clinical Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology, Pathology, Pharmacology, Physiology, and Surgery. REGISTRATION Every graduate student, new or old, is required to register at the office of the Dean of the Department, Graduate House, West Lawn, after consultation with the head of his School. All women students must first register at the office of the Dean of Women, 16 East Lawn. The first three days of the session are devoted to registration. Every applicant for admission to the Graduate Department as a candidate for a degree must file with the Dean an official transcript of his college record. Admission to the Department does not necessarily imply acceptance for candidacy for a degree. All applications will be passed upon by the Committee on Rules and Courses of the Department of Graduate Studies early in the first term, and each applicant will be formally notified by the Dean of the tentative approval of his candidacy. The final approval of his candidacy will depend upon his record during the first term, or quarter, of his residence. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Admission to the Department.âFor admission to the Department of Graduate Studies a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank is required, for men and women alike. For students in the Medical Science Group, the M. D. degree will be accepted in lieu of a baccalaureate degree. In order to become a candidate for a degree, the student must be advanced to candidacy by the Committee on Rules and Courses upon formal application, as set forth below. Advancement to Candidacy for a Degree.âAny graduate student who wishes to become a candidate for a degree must file with the Dean of the Department his application on a blank form to be secured from the Dean's Secretary. This application must include a proposed program of work arranged in accordance with the requirements for the several degrees as stated below, and must be accompanied, in case the applicant does not hold an academic degree from this University, by an official transcript of the applicant's academic record made out by the Registrar of the institution from which the baccalaureate degree was received, and by a catalogue of that institution, marked to show the courses of study pursued. The application will be submitted by the Dean to the Committee on Rules and Courses, who will consider it in conference with the professors concerned. The Committee will have the right to require that the applicant add to his program any courses, undergraduate or graduate, considered necessary to supply his deficiencies, or to enable him to pursue with profit the courses he has selected. When the program has been finally approved, the Dean will report to the applicant his advancement to candidacy for a degree. It should be distinctly understood that graduate degrees are not conferred merely upon the basis of the number of courses passed, or of the length of time spent in resident or non-resident work, but upon the basis of the quality and scope of the candidate's knowledge, and his power of investigation in his chosen field of study. Candidates whose training and attainments are inferior cannot expect to secure a degree in the normal length of time estimated below for the respective degrees. As a prerequisite to full candidacy for a Master's degree, at least 6 collegiate session-hours, or 12 semester-hours, of foreign language (ancient or modern) credit are required. A reading knowledge of foreign languages may be attested by an examination. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES Master of Arts.âThe degree of Master of Arts will be conferred upon the holder of a degree of Bachelor of Arts who has fulfilled the following requirements: (1) The successful completion, in not less than one full year of resident graduate work, of the program of studies approved for the candidate by the Committee on Rules and Courses, as embodied in his formal application for advancement to candidacy. This application must be submitted early in the session in which it is expected that the degree will be conferred. The program must form a consistent plan of work, to be pursued with some definite aim, and grouped around some one subject to be known as the candidate's Major Subject, the name of which will be incorporated in the body of each diploma conferring the degree. The program should be arranged in consultation with the professors concerned, and must be approved in writing by a professor of the candidate's Major Subject, who shall be designated by the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies, after consultation with the candidate. Ordinarily, courses aggregating 12 session-hours, or 24 semester-hours, are required of candidates for a Master's degree. These courses may all be in one subject but the candidate may elect one or two minor subjects. Ordinarily, 3 session-hours, or 6 semester-hours, will form a course in the minor subject. (2) The preparation and submission of a thesis, to be accepted as satisfactory by at least two professors in the candidate's Major Subject. Two copies of the thesis, typewritten on paper of good quality, 8Â½ by 11 inches, and bound in stiff board or cloth covers, must be deposited in the office of the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies not later than May 15 of the year in which it is expected that the degree will be conferred. The back of the cover must bear the title of the thesis and the writer's name, and the title page must carry the author's name, degree, and the subject of the thesis, followed by the words: A Thesis Presented to the Graduate Faculty of the University of Virginia in Candidacy for the Degree of Master of Arts. (3) A final comprehensive examination, oral or written, after the acceptance of the candidate's thesis, conducted by the candidate's major professor and two or more of his departmental colleagues. Master of Science.âThe degree of Master of Science will be conferred upon the holder of a degree of Bachelor of Science who fulfills requirements corresponding to those stated above for the degree of Master of Arts. The degree of Master of Science, like that of Master of Arts, is regarded as a cultural rather than a professional degree and the prerequisites for candidacy, including a reading knowledge of foreign languages, are estimated accordingly. No extension or correspondence courses will be credited toward a Master's degree. Doctor of Philosophy.âThe degree of Doctor of Philosophy will be conferred upon the holder of a baccalaureate degree who has fulfilled the following requirements: (1) A reading knowledge of French and German sufficient to enable the student to use these languages for purposes of research. This knowledge shall be attested by examinations in those languages set by the candidate's major professor, or by some one in his School designated by him. Examination papers shall be read and marked by professors in the Schools of French and German. The language examinations of candidates for the Ph.D. degree should be held by October 1 of the session preceding the final academic year of candidacy for the degree. Credit in this University for not less than 3 session-hours in B courses in either language may, on the approval of the School of the candidate's Major Subject, be accepted as satisfying the requirement in that language. Upon recommendation of the professor of the Major Subject, and at the discretion of the Graduate Committee, some other foreign language may be substituted for either French or German. (2) The successful completion, in not less than three full years of graduate work, of the program of studies approved for the candidate by the Graduate Committee as embodied in his formal application. The application for advancement to candidacy should be submitted to the Dean not later than October 15 of the session preceding the final year of candidacy for the degree, and must be submitted by October 15 of his final year. The program of studies must include a Major Subject, pursued for at least three years, and a Minor Subject, pursued for at least one year. The Minor Subject must be closely related to the Major Subject, and the program as a whole must contribute to the mastery of some definite field of knowledge as an object of study and research. The name of the Major Subject will be incorporated in the body of the diploma conferring the degree. At least one year of advanced graduate study, preferably the last, must be spent in residence. By special permission of the Graduate Committee the student may be allowed to complete his dissertation in absentia under the direction of his advisory professor. (3) A dissertation exhibiting independent research in the candidate's Major Subject, to be submitted in complete form to the Special Departmental Committee of which the candidate's advisory professor is chairman, not later than May 1 of the final year of candidacy. Three typewritten copies must be sent to the Dean's office, before the conferring of the degree. Two of these copies will be deposited in the General Library; one copy will, upon request, be turned over to the department or school in which the dissertation was prepared. The dissertation shall be typewritten upon paper of good quality, 8Â½ by 11 inches, and substantially bound in stiff covers; pasteboard covers are not acceptable. The cover shall bear the title of the dissertation with the author's full name and academic degree or degrees, and in addition the following words: A Dissertation Presented to the Graduate Faculty of the University of Virginia in Candidacy for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy. The candidate is expected to arrange, at the earliest possible date, for the publication of the dissertation, either as a whole or in part, as the department or school concerned shall direct, and to deposit fifty-two copies of the printed dissertation in the University Library. In case, however, the dissertation should be issued by an established publishing house and thus become generally available, only six copies need be deposited in the University Library. Each dissertation, when finally submitted, must be accompanied by an abstract of one thousand to two thousand words, to be approved by the department or school. This abstract, or summary, will be published in a bulletin for distribution among other universities. No dissertation will be accepted without this attached abstract. A fee of $25 toward the editing and publication of this annual bulletin of summaries must be paid by the candidate for the Ph.D. degree before the conferring of the degree. (4) A final examination, oral, written, or both, in addition to all examinations in course, upon such phases of the Major Subject and of allied subjects, as the Special Committee (described below) shall prescribe. Ordinarily no candidate may be admitted to the final examination until his dissertation has been accepted. Preliminary examinations may, in addition, be required by individual Schools, as stated under the announcements of these Schools. Upon approval of the dissertation, the Dean will appoint, upon nomination of the School concerned, a Special Committee of not less than three professors under the chairmanship of the professor of the candidate's Major Subject, and including a representative of the Graduate Committee. This Special Committee may, through its chairman, invite other members of the departmental faculty to take part in the examination of the candidate. It is recommended indeed that the doctoral examination be given before the entire professorial staff of the School concerned. The result of the examination should be promptly reported to the Registrar. Grade.âA graduate student's standing in a course is indicated by one of the following symbols: A, B+, B, C. A, B+, and B are passing grades: A is distinguished, B+ is very good, B is satisfactory, C is unsatisfactory. Failure to attain the grade of B on any one term will invalidate candidacy for the degree in the current session. Only graduate courses may be counted toward a graduate degree. Summer Session.âThe Master's degree may be won by properly qualified persons in three full Summer Quarters. In no case will this degree be conferred without resident graduate study during three quarters, the equivalent in time of the long session. Not more than two graduate courses each term of the Summer Quarter will be credited toward the degree except by special permission of the Dean and the Committee concerned. At least 12 session-hours, or 24 semester-hours, of graduate courses are required for the Master's degree. A candidate for the Master's degree in the Summer Quarter must register with the Dean of the Graduate Department and submit a program of studies in accordance with the regulations prescribed for admission to candidacy for that degree in the long session. In addition to the preparation of a thesis, a final examination, written or oral, upon the program of study and acceptable to the professor of the candidate's Major Subject in the long session of the University, will be required. Candidates for degrees at the Summer Quarter Convocation must hand in their theses by August 1 and take their final comprehensive examinations as soon as their theses have been approved. Graduate Students in the Summer Quarter must complete the courses of study for their Masters' degrees within five summers after admission to full candidacy. Graduate students are strongly advised to continue their residence during one or more terms of the long session. Candidates for degrees at the Summer Quarter Convocation must notify the Graduate office of their intentions at the beginning of the Summer Quarter. Each candidate must submit for departmental approval to the chairman of the department concerned the subject of his thesis. Fellowships.âA list of Fellowships available for graduate students will be found on page 170. A special Bulletin of the Department of Graduate Studies is issued each year. This contains detailed information as to courses and regulations of the Department, and should be consulted by persons interested. This Bulletin and further information will be supplied by the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies.</field>

It was endowed by gifts of $100,000 from John D. Rockefeller and $50,000 from the General Education Board, and was named in honor of Dr. J. L. M. Curry, the Southern educator. There were originally two professorships in the School, the Curry Memorial Professorship of Education and the Professorship of Secondary Education. In 1914 a chair of Educational Psychology and Principles of Teaching was added to the School, and two years later a Professorship of School Administration was established. In 1919 the School was organized into a Department of the University, with four professorships, and was placed upon a professional basis similar to that of the Departments of Law, Medicine and Engineering. The relation of the Department of Education to the various academic schools of the University remains close, however, since the academic training of students of Education is obtained in the academic schools, and courses in Education are credited toward the academic degrees. In the spring of 1928 plans were matured to provide more adequate facilities for observation, practice teaching, and experimental studies. The school authorities of the City of Charlottesville and the County of Albemarle joined with the University of Virginia in establishing a program of experimental education and teacher-training. After the preliminary program of organization had been approved, the General Education Board of New York City granted to the University a subsidy of $20,000 a year for a period of two years to forward the program and make possible its operation for the session of 1928-1929. The Rector and Visitors of the University made a supplementary appropriation of $5,000 annually for a period of two years, thereby giving the Department additional funds amounting to $50,000 for the biennium, 1928-1930. Since 1930 all funds for the Department have been carried in the regular University budget. PURPOSE The rapid development of educational science and practice has made it necessary that ample provision be made for the professional training of those who expect to teach or to administer school affairs. The Department of Education, therefore, aims to provide the following: 1. An opportunity for the study of Education as an important function of society. 2. To give the necessary technical training for teaching and administration to: a. University students, with or without experience, who intend to teach; b. Secondary school principals; c. Normal school teachers and administrators; d. College teachers of Education; e. School superintendents, supervisors, and other executives of schools of all grades in cities, counties, and states. 3. To develop scientific methods of testing school work and to furnish demonstrations of the way in which these methods may best be applied, thus developing a spirit of observation and experimentation tending to increase our knowledge of the science and art of education. 4. To become a center of educational influence to which teachers of all grades and kinds may come for information and educational guidance. 5. To furnish to the general public information on any phase of school organization, administration, and supervision, thus helping to create a clearer general understanding about Education and the State. PEABODY HALL Peabody Hall, the Education Building, was named in honor of George Peabody, who in 1867 made his great gift to the cause of education in the South. The building was made possible through a gift of $40,000 from the trustees of the Peabody Education Fund. This amount was supplemented by an appropriation of $12,000 from the Rector and Visitors of the University. The building was completed in 1912, and is the home of the Curry Memorial Department of Education. The plans were drawn by a modern school architect, and approved by some of the leading authorities on school architecture in this country. It is, therefore, a model of excellence in this regard. It is one of the best equipped buildings in the University, and has ample classroom and laboratory facilities, and an excellent auditorium equipped with a modern motion picture machine. Modern requirements in heating, lighting and ventilation are exemplified in its construction without sacrificing conformity to the general style of classic architecture prevailing in the University. Adequate provision is made for a Departmental library, seminar rooms, classrooms, psychological laboratory, and offices for the administrative officers and teaching staff of the Department. THE HECK MEMORIAL LIBRARY The Department of Education maintains its own library in Peabody Hall named in honor of the first professor of Education in the University, the late Professor William Harry Heck. The library was made possible through the gift of Mrs. Anna Tuttle Heck of Professor Heck's private library containing approximately 2,000 well-selected books on Education, and the transfer of all books on Education from the General Library of the University. Splendid equipment was procured through a gift of money from students in Education, the Education Club and friends of Professor Heck. A gift of $3,000 from Mr. Alfred W. Erickson of New York City has enabled the Department so to strengthen its professional library as to offer very superior facilities to its rapidly growing student body, by making possible the enrichment of every course now offered. At present the library consists of approximately ten thousand select books covering most fields of Education, a complete file of publications of the United States Bureau of Education, various national, state and foreign documents, state school laws, annual reports of state superintendents of public instruction, city superintendents' reports, etc. Files of the leading educational magazines are available for free use of the students. Exhibits of elementary and high school texts for comparative studies are made available through the generosity of various publishers. SCHOLARSHIPS The Virginia State Teachers' Scholarships in the Department of Education: thirty scholarships annually, twenty each with a value of $200, and ten each with a value of $100, were established in 1918 by action of the General Assembly of Virginia. The holder must be a Virginian in need of financial assistance in order to attend the University; and he must pledge himself to teach or engage in some other form of public school work in Virginia for at least two years, or, failing this, to repay to the University the full value of the scholarship. Blank forms of application may be had upon request to Dean John L. Manahan, Chairman of the Committee on State Teachers' Scholarships. Appointments prior to September 1 of each year are made upon the recommendation of division superintendents. Any scholarships unassigned on September 1 are open to applicants from the State at large.

Smithey, Professor of Secondary Education, a high school quarterly called Secondary Education in Virginia, devoted to the encouragement of research in Virginia secondary school problems for both public and private schools and to the reporting of research through its columns. This publication is the official organ of the Department of Education, and addressed primarily to the solution of problems of secondary education in Virginia and its columns are open to all workers in this field. It aims to encourage educational research in secondary education. EXPENSES The necessary expenses of a Virginia student in the Department of Education may be estimated at from $400 a year upward, according to the mode of living; for students from other states, $575 and upward. A fuller statement of expenses will be found on page 157. THE DEAN'S LIST Any student who passed, in the preceding term, on all courses taken, aggregating not less than five, with an average grade on all courses of at least 85 per cent, will be placed on the Dean's List. A student on the Dean's List is not subject to the regulations limiting absence from classes, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class standing, imposed for absence alone. But the performance of written work and laboratory work is not affected by these regulations. COÃPERATIVE PROGRAM BETWEEN THE SCHOOL BOARD OF THE CITY OF CHARLOTTESVILLE AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Facilities for observation and directed teaching and for practical educational research are made available through the coÃ¶peration with the University of the school systems of the City of Charlottesville and the County of Albemarle. The CoÃ¶perative Teacher-Training Program entered into between the School Board of the City of Charlottesville and the University of Virginia provides for the employment of critic teachers in the following subjects: English, Latin, Mathematics, Natural Science and Social Science. The agreement as adopted includes the following regulations: 1. The critic teachers shall be chosen by the University with the approval of the superintendent of schools, it being recognized that no person may be elected by the School Board without the recommendation of the superintendent of schools. 2. The duties of the critic teachers shall be as follows: A. To teach two regular classes in the high school such as shall be agreed upon by the critic teacher, the principal of the high school and the superintendent of schools. B. To serve as critic teacher for the direction of the teaching of such student teachers as are assigned to him. C. To perform such routine duties in connection with the classes taught as would fall to the lot of any high school teacher in a city school system in Virginia. D. To conduct such experimental studies as the wisdom of the critic teacher, the principal of the high school and the superintendent of schools may deem advisable for the improvement of the school. Proposals for all such experimental studies shall originate with the Department of Education in the University of Virginia. 3. The salaries of the critic teachers shall be paid as follows: A. The City School Board shall pay the pro rata amount for the two regular classes taught that would be paid to any high school teacher for doing the same work according to the fixed salary schedule in effect from time to time. B. The remainder of the salary shall be paid by the University. 4. The critic teacher may teach a special methods course in the subject-matter field of his assignment, this work to be done at the University. COÃPERATIVE PROGRAM BETWEEN THE ALBEMARLE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA The CoÃ¶perative Program entered into between the School Board of the County of Albemarle and the University of Virginia provides facilities for observation and practice in the high schools of the County for the training of high school teachers and principals under a director of high school supervision; and laboratory training for rural supervisors in the elementary schools of the County under two assistant professors of rural supervision. Provision is also made for the training of division superintendents of schools under the direction of Superintendent A. L. Bennett. CRITIC TEACHERS AND DEPARTMENTAL SUPERVISORS The duties of the critic teachers and departmental supervisors in the County high schools are as follows: 1. To act as general departmental supervisor in the subject-matter field of his assignment. 2. To teach two regular classes in the high school of which he is a member of the teaching staff, such as shall be assigned by the Director of Supervision acting in agreement with the principal of the high school and division superintendent of schools. 3. To serve as critic teacher for the direction of the teaching of such student teachers as are assigned to him by the Director of Supervision. 4. To teach a special methods course in the subject-matter field of his assignment. 5. To conduct such studies of instructional problems as are approved by the Director of Supervision as being in the interest of the improvement of instruction in his subject. 6. To coÃ¶perate in directing the studies of such graduate students as are assigned to him by the Director of Supervision, acting in agreement with the Professor of Secondary Education. 7. To recommend to the principal pupil-assignment to studies in his departmental field. DUTIES OF THE RURAL SUPERVISORS The coÃ¶perative program between the University and the County of Albemarle made possible the employment of two superior rural supervisors, bringing the supervisory staff for elementary schools to five. These two supervisors, in addition to supervising all elementary schools in the districts assigned to them, direct the training of rural supervisors. In order that there may be adequate opportunity for experimentation in one-room schools two schools within easy reach of the University have been chosen for special study and demonstration by the rural supervisors. It is hoped that the record of achievement in these two schools may serve as an example and stimulus, not only to the schools of the County, but of a much wider area. COURSES IN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION Students who have completed two years of work in a standard Teachers' College or equivalent, thus qualifying for the Normal Professional Certificate as issued by the Virginia State Board of Education, may meet the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Education, with a major in Elementary Education, so far as professional courses are concerned by taking such courses from those listed as the Dean of the Department of Education may specify. Ordinarily six session-hours of credit in professional courses in Elementary Education offered in this University will be required. Exceptions to this may be made in the case of students who have already accumulated credits representing well rounded preparation for elementary school work. Qualified students may take one graduate course in meeting the requirements. It should be clearly understood that students expecting to major in Elementary Education should have already obtained credit for Practice Teaching and for such courses in Public School Music, Fine and Industrial Arts and Physical Education, as are required of elementary teachers by the Virginia State Board of Education under present certificate requirements. Students who do not have credit for such courses may take any or all of them in the Summer Quarter of the University. TRAINING OF ELEMENTARY SUPERVISORS Students preparing for elementary school supervision must have (1) previous training equivalent to that required for the Virginia Normal Professional Certificate, and (2) at least two years of successful teaching experience in elementary schools attested by letters of recommendation from division superintendents of school under whom the teaching was done. It is a general requirement in connection with Education B4 that students shall be present for the opening of the schools in Albemarle County for the purpose of studying the problems of school organization. The schools usually open during the first week in September. COLLEGIATE PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE Recipients of the degree of Bachelor of Science in Education will receive the Collegiate Professional Certificate, the highest form of certificate for teachers issued by the Virginia State Board of Education. This certificate is valid for ten years, renewable for a similar period, and entitles the holder to teach in both high and elementary schools in Virginia. Holders of Collegiate Certificates, the certificates of second rank issued by the State Board of Education, may obtain the Collegiate Professional Certificate by attending the University one session and taking three full courses in Education. Curricula organized to meet the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Education fulfill both academic and professional requirements for the highest grade of professional high school certificates issued without examination by the various state departments of Education to holders of baccalaureate degrees. The graduate courses in Education are recognized in states requiring graduate study for professional certificates. THE SUMMER QUARTER The Summer Quarter is an integral part of the University year. Courses in the College of Arts and Sciences, as well as in the Department of Education, are the same in character and in credit value as in any other Quarter of the University. Degrees are conferred upon men and women upon exactly the same terms for work done in the Summer Quarter when the degree requirements are fully met. Those who contemplate completing their degree requirements in the Summer Quarter should keep clearly in mind, in estimating the time that will be required, that the normal amount of credit which may be taken in one Summer Quarter is 6 session-hours. (With special permission, an additional hour may be carried each term.) Candidates for a degree who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. This certificate must be acceptable both to the Dean of the Summer Quarter and to the Dean of the Department in which the degree will be obtained. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college and must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate and must give his grades. In every case the candidate must spend at least three full Summer Quarters or an equivalent time at the University in order to meet the residence requirements. The Master's degree may be obtained by properly qualified persons in three Summer Quarters. In no case is this degree to be conferred upon any person who has not attended and done graduate work three full Summer Quarters or the equivalent time in the regular session of the University and the Summer Quarter. All persons who are looking forward ultimately to taking a degree through summer work are urgently requested to file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter an official statement of their entrance requirements and work for which college credit is desired. Blanks for this purpose will be mailed upon application. First Term begins June 15 and ends July 25. Second Term begins July 27 and ends August 29. In order to provide for the increasing number of students who complete the requirements for their degrees during the Summer Quarter, a convocation exercise will be held Friday evening, August 28, at 8 o'clock, when the degrees will be conferred. Catalogue and further information may be obtained by addressing Secretary Summer Quarter, Box 1337, University, Virginia. BUREAU OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS Educational Tests.âThe Department of Education maintains a Bureau of Tests and Measurements as a feature of its extra-University service. Select standard tests in school subjects will be supplied to cities, counties and individual schools at cost. Members of the Faculty of Education will visit the schools to be tested, train teachers in the use of the tests and personally direct the giving and scoring of them, provided the necessary traveling expenses are borne by the schools served. Mental Tests.âIn connection with its work in educational psychology, the Department undertakes to assist school authorities in the diagnosis and training of backward and gifted children. Assistance will be rendered in the making of mental surveys and the establishment of special classes. A clinic will be maintained for the study of cases accessible to the University and the services of the professor in charge will be available to any community in Virginia at the cost of the necessary test materials and traveling expenses. Any school official desiring the services of the Bureau of Tests and Measurements should address the Dean of the Department of Education. BUREAU OF APPOINTMENTS The University of Virginia maintains a Bureau of Appointments in charge of a committee consisting of Professors Manahan, Smithey, Metcalf and Lewis. The services of the bureau are free to all teachers and prospective teachers seeking positions in secondary schools (both public and private), normal schools, and colleges. Correspondence with regard to appointment should be addressed to the Bureau of Appointments, A. M. Jarman, Secretary, Room D, Peabody Hall, University, Virginia.

Second term: Medieval and Renaissance Education. This course will begin where the first term ended, that is at the time when the barbarians in western Europe, under the auspices of the church and the institution of chivalry, were gradually mastering Latin grammar, rhetoric and the social virtues. The date, somewhat arbitrary, is 1000 A. D. From this period the course extends roughly to the year 1650 and will consider education during the late middle ages and the Renaissance period. During the middle ages, special emphasis will be placed on the scholastic movement, the rediscovery of Greek philosophy, the rise and influence of mendicant orders and rise and growth of universities. The Renaissance will be interpreted broadly to include three important educational developments: humanism, reformation and counter-reformation education and the scientific revolution. Third term: History of Modern Education. Completes the review of western education. While the study of European education will be continued, special attention will be directed to the history of education in the United States.

JOHN LEVI MANAHAN, M.A., Ph.D. Dean of the Department of Education FACULTY LOUISE OATES, B.S., M.A., Diploma, Union Memorial Hospital Training School for Nurses, Baltimore, Md., Sadie Heath Cabaniss Memorial Professor of Nursing Education. MYRTLE MARY HOLLO, Ph.B., M.A., Diploma, University of Minnesota School of Nursing, Minneapolis, Minn., Acting Assistant Professor of Nursing Education. HISTORY The movement to endow a Chair of Nursing at the University of Virginiaâthe first step in the foundation of the Schoolâwas launched in the spring of 1923 by the Graduate Nurses' Association of Virginia. Through the zealous and praiseworthy efforts of this group of women, the sum of $50,000.00 was raised and presented to the University. The chair of Nursing Education was named in honor of Sadie Heath Cabaniss, Virginia's outstanding pioneer nurse. In April, 1928, the first Cabaniss Memorial Professor of Nursing Education was appointed. The school was then placed under the Department of Education and organization begun. Beginning with the academic year of 1928-29, the Cabaniss Memorial School of Nursing Education has offered courses of university grade for graduate nurses. PURPOSE The purpose of the School is to give further preparation to well qualified nurses who desire to better fit themselves as supervisors, administrators or teachers in hospital schools for undergraduate students. There is a very urgent need for more and better-prepared women to fill the hospital positions, not only in Virginia but over the entire country. And the demand for nurses who have prepared themselves by special study for these executive and teaching positions is far in excess of the supply. In addition to affording opportunities for study and training to the individual student, the School of Nursing Education, as part of the State University, offers its services to nursing school authorities throughout Virginia, with a desire to coÃ¶perate in the solution of practical problems and in the furtherance of nursing education in the State. GENERAL STATEMENT Professional programs are arranged for three groups as follows: 1. Teachers in Schools of Nursing. 2. Supervisors and Head Nurses in Schools of Nursing. 3. Administrators in Schools of Nursing. The courses are planned on a three-year basis leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Nursing Education. Applicants meeting all entrance requirements may secure the maximum credit of a year's work for their course in an approved school of nursing. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS To be admitted to regular standing in the School of Nursing Education, applicants must be registered nurses, graduates of schools of nursing of approved standards and in addition must meet the regular entrance requirements of the University by certificate from an accredited high school or private secondary school, giving the equivalent of four years of satisfactory high school work, or by examination. Furthermore, at least one year of graduate experience in some educational or executive work in schools of nursing is highly desirable for all prospective students. For admission by certificate, the applicant should file with the School not later than September 1, a Certificate of Preparation made out on a blank form furnished upon request. And a special blank giving applicant's professional training and experience will be required of all students. All women students must first register at the office of the Dean of Women, 16 East Lawn. Special Students.âA limited number of graduate nurses of more mature age whose general education has not included a complete high school course may be admitted as special students. But they must present evidence of satisfactory professional and personal qualifications and ability to pursue the course in Nursing Education successfully. No special student may be a candidate for a degree; but such students are permitted and encouraged to make up deficiencies by private study or by taking courses in the Summer Quarter. They will then be admitted as regular students, and may be accepted as applicants for the degree, provided all entrance requirements are met at least one academic year before the date of graduation. College Credit.âA maximum of 5 courses (15 session-hours) may be granted for one year of college work and 11 courses for two years. In no case will credit be given on more than 11 courses of work done in another college, and any student who receives this maximum amount of credit must take the remaining 5 courses required for her degree in residence in a regular session of nine months in this University. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE IN THE SCHOOL OF NURSING EDUCATION The School of Nursing Education offers only one degree, the Bachelor of Science in Nursing Education. The specific degree requirements, together with a suggested curriculum, are herewith presented: I. Bachelor of Science in Nursing Education. A. Required Subjectsâ7 courses distributed as follows: 1. Natural Scienceâ2 courses (double-course) in one science. 2. Social Science: (a) Historyâ1 course. (b) Sociologyâ1 course. 3. English: (a) English A1â1 course. (b) English B1, or English B2â1 course. 4. General Psychology B1â1 course. B. Education. 2 courses which must be Education B1 and Education B2. C.

OBSERVATION AND DIRECTED TEACHING Laboratory facilities for observation and practice teaching are made available through the close proximity and coÃ¶peration of the University of Virginia Hospital School of Nursing. Students of the School of Nursing Education will do observation and directed teaching under the supervision of a member of the University faculty. It is likewise planned that a limited amount of field work in supervision will be made available for those wishing to specialize in this branch of nursing. By these arrangements between the University and the Hospital a very close coÃ¶peration is made possible which should result in mutual benefit to the School of Nursing Education and the Hospital School of Nursing. BOARD AND LODGING There are no University dormitories for women students, but satisfactory arrangements can be made in approved boarding houses near the campus. A list of these private boarding and lodging houses, with rates, may be had upon application to the Bursar. EXPENSES The figures in the following table may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of nine months. The necessary expenses included here are University, athletic and tuition fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. Three estimates are givenâa low, an average, and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundryâin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. The student who shares a room with another student, and practices the strictest economy, may possibly reduce expenses below the low estimate.

LOAN FUNDS AND STUDENT SELF-HELP The University is in possession of funds from which loans are made to deserving students in need of such assistance. An account of these loans is given in this Catalogue. Inquiries concerning them should be addressed to the Bursar. Opportunities for obtaining remunerative employment are afforded to students who are desirous by this means of partially paying their way through the University. SCHOLARSHIPS There are a number of scholarships in the University, some of which may be made available for students of Nursing Education. A detailed description of them is given in the General Catalogue of the University. The Isabel Hampton Robb Memorial Fund provides annually a number of scholarships to nurses taking advanced professional work. Application should be made to Miss Katherine DeWitt, 18 Worrall Avenue, Poughkeepsie, N. Y. Four Philip Francis duPont Scholarships are available to students of Nursing Education, with a tenure of two years. Students who have not attended the University must submit their applications not later than July 1. Students attending the University must apply not later than May 1. Applications must be made on a form supplied upon request.</field>

He must present a certificate of honorable withdrawal from the school last attended, or other valid proof of general good character. He must further satisfy the Dean of the Department of Engineering as to his adequate preparation for the work by passing the Entrance Examinations specified below or by the presentation of equivalent certificates of preparation signed by an official of a recognized institution of collegiate rank, or by the principal of an accredited public high school or of an accredited private secondary school. An applicant for admission from outside of Virginia may be required to supplement his application by an interview with a representative of the University. The topics required for entrance and their values in units are as follows, the unit being one year's work on the subject in an accredited high school: English A.âGrammar and Grammatical Analysis 1 English B.âComposition and Rhetoric 1 English C.âCritical study of Specimens of Literature 1 Mathematics A.âAlgebra through Quadratics, Progressions, Binomial Formula 2 Mathematics C.âPlane Geometry 1 Mathematics D.âSolid Geometry Â½ Mathematics E.âPlane Trigonometry Â½ History.âAncient; Medieval; English; American (any one) 1 Electives 7 Total 15 High school students who expect to study Engineering are advised to include among their electives at least one Foreign Language (Latin or French or German), one Science (Chemistry or Physics with adequate laboratory work) and an additional unit of History. Other electives which may be profitably offered are History of English and American Literature, Greek, Botany, ZoÃ¶logy, Physical Geography. Conditioned Students.âA candidate may be admitted as a Conditioned Student in spite of some deficiencies in required entrance subjects, provided these are not such as will impair the integrity of his work, but he must submit not less than 15 units. No such candidate will be conditioned except upon subjects actually taught in this University, nor will any candidate be conditioned on more than 2 units; and all conditions must be absorbed before the beginning of the next session after initial registration. Courses taken for the removal of entrance conditions may in no case be counted as part of the work credited for any degree. No conditions will be allowed in English A or B or C or in Mathematics A or C. As the table of Entrance Requirements shows, the full High School course in Mathematics is required for entrance to the Department of Engineering, but unfortunately the graduates of the High Schools are often deficient in Solid Geometry and Plane Trigonometry and can be admitted only upon conditions in those subjects. High School principals are advised to urge their graduates, with this status, to attend a Summer Session at the University before entering the Department of Engineering so that these deficiencies may be overcome. If the prospective student finds it impossible to attend a Summer School previous to his regular matriculation, a course has been planned which will allow him to make up his deficiencies by taking work in the Summer School following his first year in Engineering. Such a program will prepare the student for Second-year standing and will save him from the failure usually encountered by students who attempt to make up the deficient work in regular session in addition to the full course of required subjects. Special Students.âA candidate may be admitted as a Special Student, without formal examination, provided he is more than twenty years old if a Virginian and not less than twenty-three years old if a non-Virginian, and gives evidence of serious purpose and of fitness to pursue with profit the course for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for any degree. No conditioned student may register later as a special student. ADMISSION OF WOMEN Women are admitted as candidates for the Engineering Degrees but not as Special Students. A candidate must be at least twenty years old on the birthday preceding matriculation; must present certificates showing graduation from an accredited public high-school, or not less than four years' attendance in an accredited private school, with credit for not less than 15 college entrance units obtained at least two years before admission to the University; and must in addition show by proper certificate the completion in a standard college, subsequent to the credit obtained for 15 entrance-units, of at least 30 session-hours (60 semester-hours), of courses of college grade, in not less than eighteen calendar months. ADVANCED STANDING Under the elective system of the University of Virginia, a student who has completed courses of college or university grade in other institutions of learning on mathematical or scientific subjects may be excused from attendance upon these courses by the Dean, with the advice and consent of the professor in charge, and will then be registered for the more advanced work, provided the full entrance requirements have been satisfied. In order to secure College Credit upon such courses toward a degree in Engineering from the University, the applicant must showâ 1. That the courses offered are coextensive with the corresponding courses as given in the University of Virginia. 2. That his grades on them were not below the 75 per cent. pass-mark of this University. Such credits may be granted by the faculty upon the recommendation of the Dean and the professors in charge; but are automatically revoked by the failure of the student to pass in the more advanced courses in the related topics. Advanced standing in the technical engineering subjects of higher grade than those of the Second-year will not be given except to graduates of other institutions offering technical engineering instruction and then only upon special consideration of each application for such advanced standing. No degree in Engineering will be awarded for less than one full year's work in a regular session of this University and the work of a candidate's last year must be performed in residence here. The same rules apply to Credits on Summer School Courses; except that for courses in the Summer School of this University the examination questions must be prepared by the professor in charge of the regular course, and the answers must be read and graded by him. Students, suspended from other universities, are not granted college credits on courses previously passed, except upon explicit recommendation of the suspending university, and after such additional tests as this Engineering Faculty may impose. Credits on Practice-Courses, in Drawing, or Field-work may be granted to applicants who have gained in professional practice the training which these courses represent. Such applicants must file with the Dean proper certificates from the official under whom the work was done and must in every case pass an additional practical test on the subjects for which credit is desired. College credit is not granted for high-school work. PROGRAMS OF STUDY The candidate who has satisfied the requirements for entrance as above defined is matriculated as a student of Engineering and admitted to the First-year Class. The studies of this class comprise lecture courses in English, Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Chemistry with associated laboratory courses in Chemistry, Drawing, and Field-work. All First-year students have the same courses. For advancement to the Second-year Class the student must have completed at least two-thirds of his First-year work. Upon entering this class the students majoring in Chemical Engineering begin their specialized work, while all others pursue identical courses of study through the year, except for courses in the third term. On entering this third term each student elects his specialty. The courses thereafter diverge according to the major subject chosen by the student. At the beginning of the fourth year the students of Mechanical Engineering must choose either the machinery or the aeronautical option. Programs of study for each degree are given below. The courses are so ordered that the specified entrance requirements are adequate for the work of the First Year. Each succeeding year presupposes the completion of the work for all the foregoing years. Students are advised to adhere strictly to the regular programs. The arangements specified in them have been carefully planned and are the best. Departures from the curriculum will in almost every case produce conflicts in lecture hours or laboratory periods and may cost the student a year's time. Haphazard election is discouraged and in extreme cases will be prohibited. No student will be registered for a course unless, in the opinion both of the Dean and of the professor, his preliminary training has fitted him for the profitable pursuit of that course. Students are especially advised against the attempt to crowd too many studies into their scheme of work, and are warned that admission to advanced courses will be granted only to those who have adequate mathematical and scientific training to profit by them. Men overloaded with work, too great in volume or in difficulty for their powers, suffer inevitable discouragement and incur almost certain failure. Changes of classes with transfer of fees may be made, subject to the approval of the Dean, within two weeks after the beginning of any term. Thereafter such changes may be made only by special order of the faculty, and then without transfer of fees. Upon the completion of the four years' course as defined in any one of the Programs of Study, the faculty will award to any student in regular and honorable standing the degree of Bachelor of Science in Engineering. Upon the completion of the additional Graduate Course in a satisfactory manner the faculty will award the appropriate degree of Chemical Engineer, Civil Engineer, Electrical Engineer, or Mechanical Engineer. The five-year curriculum has been adopted at the University of Virginia in view of the impressive and growing demand from practicing engineers and industrial leaders that Schools of Engineering should enlarge the field of study to embrace more of the humanities and better opportunities for student research, to the end that the graduates may be better fitted to undertake their duties as engineers and citizens. EXPENSES OF REGULAR STUDENTS The average annual expense of a student who pursues the regular course in Engineering will be: NonVirginians First-year Virginians Other Virginians University Fee $ 60.00 $ 50.00 $ 50.00 Tuition Fee 200.00 65.00 130.00 Athletic Fee 15.00 15.00 15.00 Topics Fee 1.50 1.50 1.50 Laboratory Fees (average) 35.00 45.00 35.00 Living Expenses (for 9 months) 375.00 375.00 375.00 Books and Drawing Materials 30.00 30.00 30.00 Incidental Expenses (for 9 months) 60.00 60.00 60.00 Total annual for average conditions $776.50 $641.50 $696.50 The charges for Tuition are uniform to all students, except that Virginians are relieved of tuition on certain courses, this exception saving regular Freshmen from Virginia $135 and all other Virginia students $70 each year in comparison with non-Virginians. The laboratory charges are $15 per class for the year's course in Physics, and $20 per class for a year's course in Chemistry. A deposit for breakage of $5 is required for each laboratory course in Chemistry. A fee of $5 for the year's course in Engineering Geology is charged. The fee for each practice course in the Engineering Department, Drawing, and Engineering Laboratories is $5 per term for each course. The fees for Field-work and Bridge Drafting are each $10 per term per course. These fees include all charges for laboratory materials; but the student is held further responsible for breakage. The Living Expenses include board, lodging, fuel and lights, servant and laundry; the average is $10.00 per week, the minimum $7.50, and a reasonable maximum $12.50. Books and Drawing Materials will cost about $120 for the four-year course. Incidental Expenses ought to be kept within modest bounds; the above estimate is sufficient; large allowances of pocket money promote idleness and attract companions of the baser sort. No allowances are included for clothing and travel, the expenses for which vary too much to be introduced into any general estimate. The charges payable on entrance are the University Fee, the Athletic Fee, the Topics Fee, and the Tuition and Laboratory Fees. SCHOLARSHIPS The Accredited School Scholarships from accredited public or private secondary schools may be assigned to the Department of Engineering. Tenure, one year. Emolument, for Virginians, the remission of $60 in fees; for nonVirginians, the remission of $150 in fees. The holder must be a graduate of his school, he must rank in the highest quarter of his class, and he must enter the University the session immediately following his graduation. The Alumni Scholarships may be assigned to the Department of Engineering. Tenure, one year, but an incumbent may be eligible for reappointment upon recommendation of the Dean. Emolument, for Virginians, the remission of $60 in fees; for non-Virginians, the remission of $150 in fees. The holder must need financial aid in order to attend the University, and must file a written statement to this effect, together with a similar statement from his parent or guardian. He must have ranked in the highest quarter of the graduating class of his school, and must enter the University the session immediately following his graduation. The Philip Francis duPont Scholarships: Founded in 1928 upon the generous bequest of Philip Francis duPont, '00: In the Department of Engineering a number of these scholarships are awarded annually to both new and old students of the department. The emolument will vary from $100 to $150, depending upon the income available, with apportionment at the discretion of the Faculty of Engineering. The tenure of each scholarship is one year, but any incumbent may be reappointed upon recommendation of the Dean. Applicants for these scholarships who have not previously attended the University must have complied with the entrance requirements before their applications can be considered; they must give evidence of financial need; and they must have ranked in the highest quarter of their class. Preference is given to applicants who ranked in the highest tenth of their class. Applications must be made on a blank form supplied by the Dean.

The Isabella Merrick Sampson Scholarship in the Department of Engineering, with an income of $100: Founded in 1910 upon the gift of Mr. W. Gordon Merrick, of Glendower, Albemarle County, Virginia. Appointments are made upon the recommendation of the trustees of the Isabella Merrick Sampson Endowment. Preference is given to an applicant from Albemarle County. A limited number of additional scholarships may be granted in the Department of Engineering from those general scholarships open to any department of the University. STUDENT BRANCHES OF NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES There have been established at the University of Virginia Student Branches of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (1912), the American Society of Civil Engineers (1921), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (1922), and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (1934). These societies hold regular meetings for the discussion of periodical literature and the exposition by resident and visiting engineers of the present-day problems in Engineering. A valuable feature of the meetings is the opportunity presented for practice in public speaking and debate. At stated meetings the Branches hold joint sessions for the discussion of mutually interesting questions. ENGINEERING COUNCIL In 1934 was established the students' Engineering Council with representatives of the Student Branches and a Faculty advisor chosen by the Council. This Council coÃ¶rdinates the activities of the student societies and plans in general to advance the welfare of students in Engineering by every means within the reasonable reach of the Department. TAU BETA PI In May, 1921, a chapter of the National Honorary Engineering Fraternity Tau Beta Pi was granted and the Alpha of Virginia Chapter of Tau Beta Pi will henceforth serve to further inspire high scholarship and integrity. This fraternity is recognized as the leading honorary engineering fraternity of this country and its chapters are found in a limited number of engineering schools of the highest standing. The members are elected with care and the standards maintained are rigid both in respect to scholarship and character. THETA TAU In June, 1923, a chapter of the National Engineering Fraternity of Theta Tau was granted at the University of Virginia. This fraternity has chapters in a score or more of the leading engineering schools of the country and membership is eagerly sought and greatly appreciated by the members of the student body. Elections are made each year based on scholarship and general record of ability and promise of future service to the profession of engineering. TRIGON SOCIETY The Trigon Engineering Society was founded at the University of Virginia early in the spring of 1923. It is a local organization which has for its object the broadening of the education of the engineering student by fraternal and social contact and by encouraging lectures and study on subjects aside from those dealing primarily with engineering. The society is active in the student affairs of the department and is always ready to help in any undertaking for the betterment of the Engineering School. Members are selected for their personality, sociability, and promise of high engineering attainment. ALPHA CHI SIGMA On May 27, 1922, a charter was granted at the University of Virginia, creating the Alpha Kappa chapter of the National Chemical Fraternity of Alpha Chi Sigma. This fraternity recognizes high scholarship, character, and seriousness of purpose in students specializing in chemistry and chemical engineering. As the leading national fraternity in this field, it has 47 active college chapters, 10 professional chapters, and six professional groups, serving to advance chemistry and chemical engineering both scientifically and professionally. Among the regular activities of the local chapter are the sponsoring of the annual Alpha Chi Sigma lecture, the award of a membership in the American Chemical Society to the outstanding student in chemistry and chemical engineering, and general assistance to the faculty in the conduct of official functions. JONES AND BARKSDALE MEMORIAL FUNDS A gift to the Department of Engineering from Messrs. Arthur P. Jones, William Barham Jones (B.A. 1907) and Major Kenneth S. Jones (B.A., LL.B., C.E. 1915, Major U. S. A., Engineer Corps) in memory of their father, the late Walter H. Jones, of Norfolk, Va., and of his deep interest in the University of Virginia, in the form of an endowment fund has made it possible to provide a considerable number of professional periodicals representing the various engineering activities. A gift to the Department of Engineering from Mrs. Hamilton Barksdale in memory of her husband, an alumnus of the Engineering Department, specifically donated for the purpose of building up the department library, has made possible much needed changes and additions to the library. EXAMINATIONS AND REPORTS Oral Examinations may be held at the beginning of each lecture hour on the topics of the preceding lecture. Written test papers are set monthly, or at such interval as the professor may appoint. Absences from lecture except by reason of sickness are not excused without a written leave from the Dean. Class standing is determined on the basis of the oral examinations and the written tests. Absence from the latter or failure to answer incurs a 0 grade. Absences from laboratory periods, however caused, must be made up by special private arrangement with the instructor. Written Examinations are held at the end of each term on the entire work of that term. The result of examination combined with the student's class-standing gives his term-grade. The pass-mark is 75 per cent. Absence from the written term examination incurs a 0 term-grade, which may not be removed except by the passage of a special written examination on the work of that term. Such special examinations are granted only upon presentation of a written certificate from a reputable physician that the student by reason of sickness on the day of the regular examination was unable to attend. Regular Reports are sent out at the end of every term to the student's parent or guardian. These state for each course followed the term-grade. Further comment may be added by the Dean or the professor, if it appears probable that such comment would be helpful to the student. Parents are urged to examine these reports carefully and to exert such parental influence as may seem needed to establish and confirm the student in habits of industry and order. Special Reports are sent to parents at the end of each month for students delinquent in attendance or studiousness and for delinquents only. When a student is making steady progress and showing due diligence in his work, only the regular reports are sent. The receipt of a special report is evidence that, in the judgment of the faculty, prompt and pointed parental admonition is urgently needed. If in any class in the Department of Engineering a student fails to make satisfactory progress, he is first admonished by the professor in charge. In default of prompt and permanent improvement, he is next formally warned by the Dean. If due amendment is then not immediately effected, the student's name is dropped from the rolls of the Department, on the ground that he is not accomplishing the purposes for which he should have entered upon a University course of study. DEPARTMENT REGULATIONS The following regulations, adopted to define the policy of the faculty, are published for the information and guidance of the students: 1. Practice-courses as well as lecture-courses must be conducted under the Honor System. The student who submits any work to be graded is considered to submit it under pledge. 2. When the lecture-course and the associated practice-course are given in the same term of the same year, no student will be admitted to examination on the lecture-course until he has completed at least three-fourths of the practice-course. 3. No student will be admitted to any practice-course unless he is at the same time pursuing the associated lecture-course, or has already received credit for the same. 4. No student will be admitted to the graduating examination on a lecture-course unless he has been present at more than half the lectures in that course. 5. No averaging of term grades shall be used in courses taken for credit for a degree in Engineering. Failure to make 75 on any term course will necessitate taking the course again. 6. The pass-mark in every course is 75. Class standing and written examination are combined for the term-grade in such proportions as the several professors may determine. 7. No student who fails to make 75 on term-grade shall be granted another examination on the course until he has again attended lectures on that course. 8. A student who fails a second time on any course will be allowed to attempt the course for a third time only by special permission of the faculty; a third failure in a course will prevent such student from acceptance as a degree candidate here in engineering. 9. Special examinations are not given except by reason of sickness on the day of examination, attested by the written certificate of a reputable physician, or for other like providential causes. In every case they must be validated by special vote of the faculty. 10. Any engineering student who fails to attain a passing grade of 75 on at least 9 term-hours will be placed on probation for the following term, probation to continue until at least 9 term-hours are passed in one term. No engineering student shall remain on probation for more than three terms, whether consecutive or not, in his entire engineering course. If probation is imposed a fourth time the student shall be suspended. 11. Any engineering student who passes less than 6 term-hours and whose average grade on all courses taken is less than 65 will be suspended. Suspension during a session continues for the remainder of the regular session. Suspension imposed at the end of a session holds for the whole of a subsequent session, except that such suspension may be absolved by the successful completion of prescribed work in the Summer Quarter. No engineering student suspended for a second time shall re-enter the department. 12. The Dean's List.âA student, who, in any successive three terms, passes on all courses taken, aggregating not less than 18 session-hours, with an average grade on all courses of not less than 82 per cent, will be placed on the Dean's list. A student, who, in any successive three terms, passes on all courses taken aggregating not less than 18 session-hours, but who does not average 82 per cent, and who, in any subsequent term, passes on all courses taken, aggregating not less than 17 term-hours, with an average grade on all 17 term-hours of not less than 82 per cent will be placed on the Dean's List. A student will be automatically dropped from the Dean's List, if, in any term, he does not pass on all courses taken, aggregating not less than 17 term-hours, with an average grade on all courses of not less than 82 per cent. A student dropped from the Dean's List will be again placed on it if he meets the above mentioned standard for a term. A student on the Dean's List is not subject to the regulations limiting the issuance of leaves of absence from the University, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class standing, imposed for absence alone. Students on the Dean's List must attend all laboratory classes and must perform all written problem work and take all written quizzes under the same conditions as all other students. PHYSICAL PLANT FOR ENGINEERING INSTRUCTION DRAFTING ROOMS At present there are available three drafting rooms, one containing 78 individual tables, for the use of first-year students, and two containing 15 individual tables each, for upper classmen. The tables are of special design, with individual drawers for each student, and can adequately hold all of the student's equipment. All tables are provided with padlock hasps, and students are required to furnish their own padlocks, which must be of a type approved by the Department. The tables for upper classmen are provided with parallel rules, for which the student must supply a cord at a nominal fee. Careful attention is given to the training of students in freehand lettering, in the use of standard instruments and special equipment, in engineering drawing expression and convention, and in the use of such media as pencil and ink on drawing paper, and tracing paper and cloth. A photostat machine, and a vertical blue-printing machine comprise a portion of the auxiliary equipment of the Department, and some time is devoted to reproduction of drawings. Technical ability and dexterity is required to the extent of preparing men for positions in industry, but the graphical method is taught and used primarily as an indispensable instrument of communication and research, the mastery of which is essential for the instructed Engineer.

The laboratory is equipped with facilities for building and testing aerodynamic models of all types. Two wind tunnels are available for student use. One of these is a portable model with 10 inch by 12 inch throat, having moderate throat velocity. This is more of a demonstration than a laboratory type tunnel. The large wind tunnel, used for routine and research aerodynamic testing is capable of testing a model of 36 inch wing span at 150 miles per hour. This tunnel is of the rectangular type having a 30 inch by 50 inch test section which may be used with either an open or closed throat. The design is of the high-efficiency return circuit type and the propeller is powered by a direct drive streamlined electric motor developing over 40 horsepower and having external control equipment capable of varying the speed over a wide range. Precision type wood working machinery, bench mounted, and consisting of equipment such as the jointer, sander, jig saw, etc., is installed for the purpose of model making of all descriptions. This equipment is mobile and is available to all divisions of the Engineering Department for wood repair or modeling work. Several aircraft engines including the Whirlwind, Wasp, and Gypsy in the air-cooled field and representative water-cooled engines are available for engine work in the Aeronautics Laboratory. A Consolidated Trainer and a Curtiss Dive Bomber have been loaned to the Department of Engineering and are employed for instruction in airplane structures and rigging. There is considerable detached equipment such as instruments, carburetors, magnetos, supercharger, etc., available for study.

They are also required to make up their field-books in standard forms; to reduce their surveys and execute all the necessary profiles, plans and maps; and to determine lengths, areas, and volumes both from the maps and from the original notes. Polar planimeters are provided for facilitating such estimates, and a pantograph for making reduced copies of finished drawings. MODEL TESTING APPARATUS The Department has apparatus for the determination of stresses in structural and machine parts by the use of models. The Beggs' Deformeter is a specialized set of equipment for the determination of moments and shears in elastic structures by utilizing Maxwell's principle of reciprocal deflections. The work is done on small scale models accurately cut from celluloid or other suitable material. This year the Department is securing modern Photoelastic equipment for the analysis of stresses in elastic members. The equipment consists of an elaborate optical set in which a model of bakelite is inserted. The method is based on certain optical effects imposed on a ray of light by the stressed model. CHEMICAL ENGINEERING LABORATORY A new unit process laboratory for Chemical Engineering is being planned and portions of it will be installed for service during the coming year. This laboratory will occupy space in one end of the second floor of Building C. It will be provided with essential services of air, water and gas as well as electrical outlets and a floor drainage system. Additional facilities exist at the University Power House, where semi-plant scale absorption equipment has been installed for the experimental treatment of flue gas. ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING LABORATORY The Scott Laboratory of Electrical Engineering.âThis laboratory was initially equipped and endowed by Mrs. Frances Branch Scott, of Richmond, Va., as a memorial to her late son, an alumnus of this University. During the year 1910 the equipment was substantially increased through the generosity of the Hon. Charles R. Crane, of Chicago, Ill., a friend of the University. In recent years a large number of new machines, measuring instruments and pieces of auxiliary apparatus have been purchased. Improvements are constantly being made and items of equipment added. As a result the laboratory is now well supplied with the best modern equipment. Power is supplied to the laboratory direct from the 4,000-volt distribution system of the local power company through a modern substation located in the building. This substation forms a part of the main electrical laboratory and all equipment is available for inspection and study. In one end of the laboratory is located the main light and power switchboard for the entire building, consisting of seventeen steel panels containing a complete array of instruments, relays and low tension circuit breakers together with the control switches for the eight electrically operated high voltage circuit breakers which are located in the adjacent fireproof vault. The vault also contains six single-phase induction regulators, a 300-Kv.-a. bank of transformers for the power supply, a 225-Kv.-a. bank of transformers for lighting and a 75-Kv-a. autotransformer. Adjacent to the vault is the battery room containing a 120-volt and a 24-volt storage battery, the former furnishing control current for the substation. Near the main switchboard are located two motor generator sets for supplying direct current to the laboratory. These sets consist of synchronous motors driving three-wire direct current generators of 100 and 50 kilowatts capacity respectively. There is also an alternator of 50-Kv-a. capacity which is provided with a Tirrill regulator. Automatic control for the synchronous motors is provided on the switchboard. From the main switchboard power is conducted through the permanent wiring system to four distribution panels in the electrical machinery laboratory and four panels in the adjacent communications, photometry, and measurements laboratories. These panels make available six different sources of power at convenient locations. The panels and all of the experimental equipment are fitted with universal plug receptacles to facilitate the making of necessary connections. For the machine testing there are available several direct-current motor generator sets with automatic control; numerous series, shunt and compound motors and generators; synchronous and induction motor driven generator sets; high voltage direct-current generator; steam turbine driven three-phase alternator with exciter and control switchboard; two experimental test sets for alternating current single or polyphase generator operation; single-phase induction motor; single-phase repulsion-induction motor; two-phase induction motor; three-phase squirrel cage induction motors of the general purpose, high reactance and double cage types; wound rotor induction motors; induction generator; wound rotor induction motor set for concatenation; Fynn-Weichsel synchronous induction motor; frequency changer set; synchronous motors; rotary converter; arc welding generator set; constant potential transformers; constant current transformer; polyphase transformer; induction regulator; mercury arc and thermionic rectifiers; a number of different types of A. C. and D. C. fractional horsepower motors; prony brakes for all motors; adjustable resistances, inductances and capacitances. The instrument room is unusually well equipped with all of the types of high grade portable instruments required for the laboratory tests, including frequency and power factor meters, watthour meters, synchroscopes, tachometers, instrument transformers, recording voltmeters, ammeters and wattmeters. For testing and calibrating the portable instruments and for more precise work in electrical measurements there are available a set of laboratory standard instruments with standard shunts and resistances; standard cells; standard condensers, inductances and resistances; galvanometers of the best modern type and numerous other pieces of apparatus of the highest precision such as the Wolff potentiometer, Siemens and Halske-Thomson double bridge, Carey-Foster bridge, Koepsel permeameter, Fahy simplex permeameter and others. For experiments in illumination and photometry there are a Station photometer with Lummer-Brodhun screen, a Macbeth illuminometer, General Electric and Weston portable foot-candle meters. The lighting system for the building has been designed so that it will serve as a complete up-to-date laboratory of commercial and industrial lighting, illustrating the best lighting equipment available at the present time. Equipment for the study of communication and power transmission includes a complete artificial transmission line; an adjustable frequency test oscillator; impedance bridge; vacuum tube voltmeter-ammeter; representative pieces of modern telephone equipment including two central office ringer sets; equipment for the study of vacuum tube performance; model network distribution system; relays of different types; radio transmitting and receiving sets; microphones, amplifiers and other sound equipment; phototubes and amplifier tubes of various types; all with the necessary auxiliary apparatus. In addition the automatic dial telephone system installed in the building is available for examination and study. The laboratory is equipped with three oscillographs which are available for the study of wave forms and transient phenomena. Two of the oscillographs are of the latest portable typeâone a six element and the other a one element. All are complete with the necessary accessories for both visual observation and photographic recording. BUILDINGS The buildings at present wholly or partially devoted to the work of the Department of Engineering are the following: Thornton Hall.âThe new center for instruction in engineering at the University of Virginia, open for use at the beginning of the 1935-1936 session, is named Thornton Hall, in honor of the first Dean of Engineering at Virginia, William Mynn Thornton, whose active service spanned 55 years, from 1875 to 1930. The building plans were perfected by the Architectural Commission of the University upon a skeleton plan for service needs prepared by the teaching staff of the Department of Engineering. The Commission was particularly fortunate in its finished plan in securing two important essentials: harmony with the well-known Jeffersonian architecture of the rest of the University; and at the same time fitness for service as a working home for the activities in class and laboratory of a department concerned with engineering instruction of a professional character. The Setting of the Building The site selected, at the southern end of the main campus, on McCormick Road, affords a pleasing outlook on all sides and secures an unencumbered abundance of light and air for the working areas. The building is designed to accommodate comfortably a student body of 300, normally distributed in the several years of the course, and it is expected that the matriculation in engineering will be restricted to that approximate number, in the belief that it affords an ideal group for the University to train in its engineering school. The building is in a sense three interconnected structures arranged in U-fashion, with a central grass court 150 feet square, closed at the top of the U by an arcaded walk which furnishes ready access between the two wings. The main unit of the group consists of basement and two upper floors; the western wing is of one-story, and the eastern wing of two-story, construction, each unit being approximately 300 feet long. The entire building is erected upon reinforced concrete foundations with the walls of over-size brick of a color to match other campus structures, and is of a simple, dignified design most pleasing from every aspect. Cast stone bands, with the same material as a part of door and window trim, serve to relieve the severity of extensive uninterrupted areas of brick. The arcade motif is used throughout the construction rather than the colonnade, which is a feature of many of the earlier buildings on the campus. Reinforced concrete floors are the rule; partitions of brick, tile or gypsum block predominate, and the slate roof is supported on structural steel trusses. Floors vary from those of concrete in most of the laboratories, through terrazzo in corridors, to mastic-covered concrete in offices, classrooms and library. The classrooms and offices have plastered walls and sound-absorbing ceiling surfaces, while the walls of most of the laboratories and drawing rooms are of painted brick. Basement corridors and lavatories are finished in general with glazed tile walls to a height of about 6 feet. Throughout the building generous window allotment has been secured to insure ample natural light and ventilation. Heating and Illumination The entire building is heated from the central heating plant of the University, which provides a circulating hot-water system, with radiators wall-supported to aid in maintaining cleanliness. The building's water supply is obtained from the main service of the University. All laboratories are piped for the necessary water supply, electric water heaters provide essential service to lavatories, and electric coolers in strategic locations make available a ready supply of cool drinking water. All laboratories which have use for gas are piped for that service from the city mains. The problem of adequate artificial illumination for all purposes was given careful attention, and as a result the planned illumination will be in accord with the best modern practice. An ample arrangement of panel boards with heavy mains together with a finely divided individual control of circuits provides a flexible and entirely adequate system suited to the several uses made necessary in such an all-inclusive structure. Semi-indirect and totally indirect lighting is utilized in most locations, with such a variety of lighting units as will serve both to provide essential illumination and at the same time be an exemplification of several means of obtaining approved illumination of required intensity but free from glare. Incandescent units ranging in size from 100 to 1,500 watts are in the main utilized. A single installation of modern mercury-arc units is applied, however, in the repair shop. In connection with the electrical system, care has been taken to supply, wherever requisite, an ample number of convenience outlets, so that electric fans, projection apparatus, etc., may readily be connected when needed. Interior communication will be afforded between various parts of the building by an intercommunicating telephone system of some 40 stations. A number of electric clocks are installed, and class periods will be announced on an electric program service reaching every portion of the building. Interior Arrangement of Central UnitâBuilding A The central unit of the group is entered from the main walk through an arcaded entrance leading to the lobby in which the main bulletin boards are placed. From this open lobby the main corridor extends in both directions, giving access at each end by stairways to the upper floor level and also by stairways downward to the basement and connecting passageways to the other two units of the building. Arranged along the main corridor are eleven offices for ten professors and the secretary to the Dean, which overlook the central grass court, and in each of which modern steel office equipment is installed. From the main corridor, across from the offices, are three classrooms and a Faculty conference room. Side corridors lead to six other classrooms, to which access is also possible through two side doors from the front plaza. The Faculty conference room is equipped with a conference table and the necessary chairs. Four of the classrooms will seat 30 students each, three seat 27 each, and one larger room is arranged to seat 56. These eight rooms are equipped with individual swivel chairs arranged with table tops on pedestals in front of each row of chairs. The remaining large classroom is equipped with 77 tablet-arm chairs arranged radially. All classrooms are furnished with ample blackboards covering all available wall space, besides bulletin board and special lecture desk. This floor is completed by two small lavatories, one at each end of the office suite, reserved for use of the Faculty and for ladies respectively. The upper floor of this unit is devoted to the library and drawing rooms for the Department. The library is directly above the offices and will constitute a combined library and reading room. This handsome room is pleasingly furnished in oak panels and trim, and is equipped with oak reading tables and substantial chairs. Steel stacks house the present engineering library of some 6,000 volumes, and adequate space is available for growth of the collection. A librarian's office adjoins the library proper, and an additional office for drawing instructors completes one end of the floor. At the opposite end of the reading room are an office and a small room which contains the blueprinting equipment for the Department, with a dark-room attached. The remainder of this floor is assigned to drafting rooms, space being available for something over 150 individual drawing tables and the accessory files. For the present, 108 drawing tables are in place, 78 in one main group for first-year students principally, with two smaller groups of 15 each in partitioned rooms for more advanced classes. The drawing tables are specially built and provide adjustable tilt tops 3 by 4 feet in area; each table is equipped with two drawers, each drawer being supplied with individual combination, master-keyed padlocks. Steel stools, with wooden seats, are supplied for each table. The planned artificial illumination for the drawing room is 30 foot-candles on the working surface. For the present the unoccupied space, later to be equipped with additional drawing tables, will be used as a temporary auditorium, using folding steel chairs, where the entire student group may assemble for lectures and general meetings. The Basement of the Central Unit The basement floor of this unit is occupied in the front by one large and four smaller storage rooms, the photostat and mimeograph room, and the main locker-room and lavatory. More than 200 individual steel lockers, supplied with combination, master-keyed padlocks, are installed here. The sanitary arrangements of the lavatories are of the best modern type. The inner section of this basement will be used by three experimental laboratories. The largest is that for hydraulic testing. This laboratory has adequate headroom and is provided with a built-in trench extending its entire length. Here are assembled the various pumping units, high- and low-pressure, electrically driven and controlled; apparatus for flow experiments; weirs, tanks, scales, meters, etc., with the essential auxiliary apparatus necessary for successful hydraulic testing of motors, pumps and systems. A second laboratory on this floor is that for testing fuels and oils. This is supplied with gas, water and electricity and in its equipment are calorimeters for solid, liquid and gaseous fuels; electric-muffle furnace, electric drying oven, sample grinder and crusher, pyknometers, balances, crucibles, etc. Here also are found flash and chill testers, hydrometers, viscosimeters, etc., used in determining the properties of oils. The third of these laboratories is for concrete testing. It is completely equipped for making tests of cement, cement aggregates, and concrete. It has tensile testers, compressometers of several types, tools for shearing test, steaming oven for accelerated tests, drying ovens with automatic temperature regulation, moist-air closets, sieves, moulds, and the necessary small apparatus required in these tests. The One-Story WingâBuilding B This wing is devoted mainly to three additional laboratories of experimental engineering. One of these is to be used for road materials testing. It is equipped with abrasive machine, ball mill, molding press for briquetting, impact cementation tester, toughness tester, rock crusher and brick rattler, compression tester, diamond core drill, diamond rock saw, grinding lap, Westphal balance, specific gravity apparatus and sets of sieves. For bituminous road materials there are a penetrometer, ductility machine, viscosimeters, extractor, oil tester, pyknometers, flow plates, gas and electric hot plates, and accessory apparatus for testing bituminous road binders. The second laboratory in this wing is the power laboratory. Here are found the units for steam and gas power testing; steam boiler, steam engines, turbines, gas engines, condensers, air compressor, and auxiliary equipment such as indicators, thermometers, gages, planimeters, standards for their calibration and correction, Orsat apparatus, calorimeters, etc. In addition to the above, the complete boiler equipment of the University boiler plant is available for student tests. Also in this group is the structural materials laboratory. Here are placed standard machines for tensile, compressive and transverse tests of both metals and wood; torsion machine, impact testing machine, fatigue test machine, scleroscope, wire testing machines; extensometers, compressometers and tools for shearing tests of metals and timber. On a mezzanine are an office and an apparatus room. An office for the instructing staff in surveying is located in this wing, and directly connecting with it is the instrument room for surveying classes. This equipment includes compasses, transits and levels of various makes, hand levels and clinometers, plane tables, sextant, leveling rods, telemeter rods, signal poles, chains, tapes, pins and so on. For hydraulic surveys there are hook gage and current meter. The facilities of this wing also include a locker room and lavatory easily accessible. The Two-Story WingâBuilding C The ground floor of the two-story wing is devoted entirely to the electrical engineering laboratories. The main room will be used for dynamo-machine testing and has the building power plant at one end. The electrical supply is at present secured from the Public Service Company, and the needs of laboratories and building are taken through transformers and motor-generator sets. The dynamo laboratory is well supplied with test units of moderate size, of various makes, and of the general types usual in service, both direct and alternating current. All tests units are direct-driven, and all connections are made by universal plug and receptacle connections with flexible cords. Individual control panels are placed at convenient points throughout the laboratory, and their supply is by conduit embedded in the floor structure. Brakes are furnished for each motor unit, and a complete supply of instruments is at hand for all tests. Transformers of various types, induction regulators, control resistances, inductances and capacitances are included in this equipment. Mercury arc rectifiers, arc welding sets and numerous other units supply additional test service. Oscillographs, single and multiple, make possible a wide variety of tests of transient phenomena. An office for the laboratory instructor, and a large instrument room, adjoin the machine laboratory. As a part of the electrical supply system, there is the transformer room, which houses also the main circuit breakers and voltage regulators. A storage battery room is closely adjacent, and a dark-room for photographic developing is included. Moreover, there are three additional laboratories in the electrical division. One of these is the standardizing laboratory, which is supplied with the usual electrical standards necessary for testing and calibrating portable test instruments. Here are included also several instruments of high-precision type, such as potentiometers, double bridges, galvanometers, permeameters, etc. A second small laboratory is for illumination tests of various kinds. This is equipped with photometers, illuminometers and several types of foot-candle meters. A third unit in this suite will be used for communication and power transmission testing, with electronic testing being developed. Its equipment includes an artificial transmission line, test oscillator, bridge, vacuum tube ammeter-voltmeter, various electronic units and auxiliary apparatus needed in this particular field of electrical testing. This floor is completed by a medium-sized locker room and lavatory adjacent to the main electrical laboratory, and a janitors' room. The upper story of this wing is for chemical and mechanical engineering. A large laboratory is being developed for aeronautical testing. Here are found aeroplanes, aeroplane engines and auxiliary apparatus, and a wind tunnel of moderate proportions. An office and a storeroom adjoin this laboratory, and a locker and lavatory are placed for use on this level. A repair shop will provide facilities for repairing apparatus and for building experimental equipment. This shop communicates with the lower level by freight elevator, which will be installed later, the complete shaft only having been built. A separate tool-room adjoins the repair shop. A wood shop is equipped with the usual motor-driven wood-working machinery. A second shop provides a variety of machine tools. Instead of actual shop practice, however, it will be the policy here to use this machinery to familiarize the student with principles of machine design as well as to introduce him to both possibilities and limitations of such equipment in production. One unit in this division will allow the student to become acquainted with various phases of metallography. The equipment here includes an electric heat-treating furnace, polishers, microscopes, hardness tester, and varied samples of metal and alloys. The remainder of this section will be devoted to a unit-process laboratory for the work in Chemical Engineering. This laboratory is now being planned and will be partially installed during the coming year. Representative units required for an approved laboratory course in this subject will be rapidly put into operation. It may be noted that the major technical instruction in chemical, civil, electrical and mechanical engineering is cared for in this new building group. In addition to the technical instruction, all mathematics and English for the engineering students will be given in Thornton Hall. Physics, chemistry, modern language and certain other humanities will continue to be given in the College of Arts and Sciences. With the facilities made available in Thornton Hall, many restrictions of space under which instruction has been carried on hitherto will be removed. The rigid disciplines of the theoretical courses which have ever been a part of the instruction here will hereafter be supplemented by the advantages of adequate space and equipment for both students and faculty. The Power House is a single story building 130 by 60 feet, in which is housed the University heating plant. The equipment includes two 310 horsepower Heine water tube boilers, equipped with single retort stokers of the underfeed type, supplied by the Combustion Engineering Corporation, two Babcock and Wilcox boilers (Stirling type) fitted with underfeed twin-retort Detroit stokers, two steam and two electrically driven circulating pumps, low pressure heaters, etc. Provision has been made for the future installation of two steam turbine generator sets for the supply of electric current to the University buildings. The entire plant is available for instructional purposes. Plants available for inspection both locally and elsewhere throughout the State include the Bremo Bluff and other generating stations of the Virginia Public Service Company, numerous chemical plants, the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, Hampton, the Newport News Shipyard, the Norfolk Navy Yard, the Rothwell Cold Storage and Ice Company's plants in Charlottesville and Waynesboro, the Norfolk and Western Railway shops and the works of the Virginia Bridge and Iron Company at Roanoke, the Charlottesville Woolen Mills, etc. Visits of several days' duration are organized to distant points and are made to coincide, if possible, with some event of more than usual interest, such as the launching of a cruiser at the Newport News Shipyard, the visit of an airplane carrier to Hampton Roads or the sea trials of a passenger liner. The Geological Museum is 120 by 50 feet. It is a three-story building. The main floor is devoted to the very extensive geological collection of specimens, charts, relief maps, and so on. The gallery above contains an equally good collection of minerals and numerous models of typical crystallographic forms. The upper floor contains the lecture-rooms and the laboratories of Economic Geology. In the basement are stored subsidiary collections and new material accumulated in more recent geological surveys. The Rouss Physical Laboratory faces the old Mechanical Laboratory on the opposite side of the Lawn, and has almost the same proportions, namely 180 by 70 feet. The main floor contains the lecture-room, the professors' offices, and a laboratory for experimental research, and the storeroom for the very large collection of apparatus used in the lectures. On the ground floor is the storage battery room, a well-equipped shop for the repair and manufacture of apparatus, and smaller rooms for the work of graduate students. The laboratory for experimental physics is in the basement of the old Mechanical Laboratory. The Cobb Chemical Laboratory was opened for use in September, 1917 In this fire-proof structure all the work in Chemistry is assembled. The floor area provided is about 45,000 square feet. The lecture-rooms seat classes of 300, 75 and 25 students. The laboratories assigned to General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Qualitative Analysis, Quantitative Analysis and Physical Chemistry contain 110, 60, 40, 30, and 20 desks. Altogether by dividing classes into sections, 600 students may be accommodated. Smaller private laboratories are provided for research workers. Large stock rooms communicating by elevators with the several floors contain ample stores of chemical supplies. The 5,000 volumes of books and bound sets of journals constituting the Departmental Library of Chemistry are so housed as to be accessible to both teachers and students.

A considerable amount of collateral reading in descriptive industrial chemistry is assigned, and written reports involving use of the literature are required. Better appreciation of the quantitative relationships existing in the applications of chemistry is gained through problem work paralleling the lecture material. A number of plant inspection trips are arranged during the year. Lectures and recitations, 3 hours a week. (Fall, Winter, Spring.) Textbooks: Badger and Baker: Inorganic Chemical Technology; Lewis and Radasch: Industrial Stoichiometry; Riegel: Industrial Chemistry. Associate Professor Hitchcock. 374-375-376: Chemical Engineering Laboratory: The student demonstrates to himself essential features of the unit operations of chemical engineering, by constructing and testing with his own hands suitable apparatus for the illustration of principles in the parallel classroom work. Under minimum supervision, he plans, builds, and tests such equipment as orifices and other measuring apparatus, fluid flow devices verifying Fanning's equation, apparatus for determination of heat transfer coefficients in the more common cases, model vacuum pan sufficient to demonstrate the ordinary relationships of evaporation, and packed columns for the absorption of gases in liquids. The primary object of this course is to teach the student how to obtain the data necessary for the interpretation of the unit operations in chemical engineering. It is inevitable that at the same time, he gains a clearer understanding of these operations, as well as facility in shopwork and the use of his hands, the preparation of working drawings, and the reduction of his results to writing in the form of an acceptable report. Whether the apparatus is particularly efficient, or even practicable from a production standpoint, is not regarded as important at this stage. The students work in small groups in order to make better use of the time, and the results obtained by each group are made available to all through dependent problem work in the classroom. 6 hours a week. (Fall, Winter, Spring.) Associate Professor Hitchcock. 383-384-385: Undergraduate Chemical Engineering Research: Opportunity is afforded undergraduate students to obtain an introduction to research methods in problems pertaining to chemical engineering. As a rule the course is open to those who are taking the major portion of their work in senior subjects, and who have had or are taking Chemical Engineering 324-325-326. A minimum of nine hours per week for one term is required in the laboratory, and it is expected that normally the student will continue the work through the entire session. (An elective course for those having the time to apply to it.) Associate Professor Hitchcock. 386-387-388: Chemical Engineering Research: This course is designed for candidates for the Ch. E. degree and affords an introduction to research methods. Fundamental problems are selected, whenever possible, from the field of greatest interest to the student. The method of attack is in general to reduce the selected problem to laboratory scale leading to the collection of basic data susceptible of definite interpretation, rather than to attempt investigations on commercial equipment which usually yield empirical results. The use of the chemical literature as an aid in conducting investigations prefaces and accompanies the laboratory work, as well as practice in the mathematical and graphical treatment of the data obtained. The preparation and submission of a satisfactory thesis marks the completion of this course, and is a partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Ch. E. degree. Two copies of the thesis, typewritten on paper of prescribed quality and size, and substantially bound, must be deposited in the office of the Dean of the Department of Engineering not later than May 15 of the year in which it is expected that the degree will be conferred. The back of the cover must bear the title of the thesis and the writer's name, and the title page must bear the words: A thesis presented to the Engineering Faculty of the University of Virginia in candidacy for the degree of Chemical Engineer. (Fall, Winter, Spring.) Associate Professor Hitchcock. Advanced Courses: A number of advanced courses in Chemistry, not listed above, are described in the catalogue of the College. When time permits, students in Chemical Engineering, who are properly prepared, may take such of these courses as are approved by the Faculty of Engineering. The Chemical Journal Club will meet once a week (hour to be arranged) for the critical review and discussion of various topics of interest in current chemical literature and of such chemical researches as are in progress in the University. All members of the teaching staff and advanced students in chemistry are expected to participate in these meetings and to take part in the discussions.

SUMMER SCHOOL In the Summer School at the University of Virginia it has been possible for some time to procure many of the non-technical courses required in the engineering curricula, such as Chemistry, Physics and German. In the Summer School of 1936 there will be given the following courses as they are given in the regular session: Mathematics 100-106-107 and 108-109-110 with 158-159-160. In addition at least two courses in Mechanics will again be offered from the three 526, 527 and 528. If there be a sufficient demand Engineering Drawing, 522-572, and Descriptive Geometry, 523-573, will be given.

Historical.âAmong the original Schools contemplated in Mr. Jefferson's plan for the organization of the University of Virginia was "Law: Municipal and Foreign, Embracing the General Principles, Theory and Practice of Jurisprudence, together with the Theory and Principles of Constitutional Government." Accordingly the School of Law was established in 1826, and has been an integral part of the University from its foundation. The aim of the Department of Law has been, from earliest days, to maintain a high standard as a requirement for graduationâthe degree being conferred only upon such students as have satisfactorily completed the prescribed course of study according to traditionally rigid standards. This policy has been uniformly enforced, and its wisdom has been vindicated by the high position which the graduates of the Law School are accustomed to attain at the bar and in public life. The course of instruction has been extended from time to time to conform to economic conditions and to meet the increasing demands of the profession. The Law School is a member of the Association of American Law Schools; is registered by the Regents of the University of the State of New York as meeting the requirements for admission to the bar in that State; and is on the approved list of the American Bar Association. Standards of the American Bar Association.âAs an approved law school on the list of the American Bar Association, this law school complies with the official request of that Association that approved law schools include in their Annual Bulletins a copy of the following standards: "Standards of the American Bar Association." (1) "The American Bar Association is of the opinion that every candidate for admission to the Bar should give evidence of graduation from a school complying with the following standards: (a) "It shall require as a condition of admission at least two years of study in a college. (b) "It shall require its students to pursue a course of three years duration if they devote substantially all of their working time to their studies, and a longer time, equivalent in the number of working hours, if they devote only part of their working time to their studies. (c) "It shall provide an adequate library available for the use of the students. (d) "It shall have among its teachers a sufficient number giving their entire time to the school to ensure actual personal acquaintance and influence with the whole student body. (e) "It shall not be operated as a commercial enterprise and the compensation of any officer or member of its teaching staff shall not depend on the number of students or on the fees received. (2) "The American Bar Association is of the opinion that graduation from a law school should not confer the right of admission to the Bar, and that every candidate should be subjected to an examination by public authority to determine his fitness. (3) "The Council on Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar is directed to publish from time to time the names of those law schools which comply with the above standards and of those which do not and to make such publications available so far as possible to intending law students. "In compliance with the policy announced by the American Bar Association in 1921, we recommend the establishment in each state, where none now exist, of opportunities for a collegiate training, free or at moderate cost, so that all deserving young men and young women seeking admission to the Bar may obtain an adequate preliminary education; and, that the several states be urged, through the Council on Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar, to provide, at stated times and places, for pre-legal examinations to be held by the university of the state or by the board of law examiners thereof, for those applicants for admission to the Bar obliged to make up their preliminary qualifications outside of accredited institutions of learning." For further information, address Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar, American Bar Association, 1140 North Dearborn St., Chicago, Ill. A pamphlet is available upon request, containing the various Rulings of the Council upon the foregoing Resolutions of the Association, and a revised list of Approved Law Schools. Law School Building.âThe Law School occupied from 1911 to 1932 its own building, designated as Minor Hall, in honor of the late John B. Minor, whose distinguished service of fifty years as a professor in the Law School, the University thus commemorates. But due to increased numbers, both in the teaching force and in student enrollment, the Law School in recent years found these quarters too limited for its purposes. This situation was relieved at the opening of the session of 1932-33, when the Law School occupied its new and commodious quarters, Clark Memorial Hall, which was formally presented and dedicated on October 5, 1932. It occupies the elevated site in rear of the dormitories known as D and E on Dawson's Row, now demolished. The Law School was indebted for the new building to the generosity of the late William Andrews Clark, Jr., of Los Angeles, California, a graduate of the Law School of 1899. The gift is a memorial to his late wife, Mabel Foster Clark, for whom the building is named. It is a modern fireproof structure, with liberal and handsome provision for all the needs and conveniences of a modern law school. Law Library.âThe Library contains about twenty-nine thousand volumes. Its financial resources, from appropriations by the Visitors, and from special endowments, make possible substantial additions annually. The Library contains the English Reports, practically complete, from and including the Year Books to date; the Canadian and Australian Reports; the United States Supreme Court Reports; reports of all the American States in official or unofficial form; the National Reporter System, complete; selected and annotated reports, together with modern searchbooks in the form of general Digests, and the leading Encyclopedias, besides a large collection of textbooks, and bound volumes of law journals. Practically all the current American legal periodicals are received, and bound volumes of these are on the shelves. Virginia Law Review.âUnder the title of the Virginia Law Review, the undergraduate students of the Law School conduct a law journal devoted to the discussion of general questions of American jurisprudence. Eight numbers are issued annually, from November to June, inclusive. The Review is now in its twenty-second volume. From its inception it has maintained a high standard of excellence, and a worthy rank among the leading law journals of the country. Adequate quarters are provided for the accommodation of the editorial board and the business staff. GENERAL INFORMATION The Session begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September, and continues for thirty-nine weeks, ending about June 15. The first three days of the session are given to registration, and all students, both old and new, are required during that time to place their names upon the books of the University and the rolls of their respective classes. Lecture courses begin on the Monday following, and absences will be recorded against any student not present, from the opening lecture of each course. Students entering after the first three days, without satisfactory excuse, will be charged a fee for registration. The session is divided into Three Terms. The first term ends December 19; the second, March 20; and the third, with the close of the session. Late Entrance.âStudents are advised that late entrance upon the work of any term is a serious hindrance to progress. The student who enters late must begin his work at the point to which the several courses have advanced at the time of his entrance; and credit for three years' attendance cannot be secured unless the student is in actual residence at least thirty weeks per session. No student may register, as a candidate for the degree, for the work of the first term after October 15, nor for that of the second term after January 10ânor is registration in absentia permissible. When Students May Enter.âIt is highly desirable that students of any year, and particularly those of the first year, should enter upon the study of law at the beginning of the session. Where this was impossible, it was formerly the practice of the Law School to permit students to register at the beginning of the second term, in January, but not later, save in exceptional cases. This practice was then feasible, since new courses were begun at that time. With the session of 1931-1932, however, a number of indivisible courses, some in each year, were extended over two or more terms. It is, therefore no longer possible for candidates for the degree to enter at the beginning of the later term. In exceptional cases, qualified students who seek special courses, and who are not candidates for the degree, may be permitted to enter after the end of the first term. Fees and Expenses.âThe necessary expenses of a student in the Law School may be estimated at $700 per session of nine months. This minimum estimate includes all University and tuition fees, board, lodging, laundry and books. An average estimate would be $900 to $1,000 per session, reckoning living expenses at a somewhat higher figure. The University fee applicable to all law students (including those from Virginia) is $60; and the tuition fee for residents of Virginia is $175, for non-residents, $195; an athletic fee of $15 applies to all students. The total fees, therefore, for Virginia students are $250, and for non-Virginians $270, plus a fee of $1.50 for the student newspaper. Payments of Fees.âFees are payable one-third upon registration; one-third at the opening of the second term; and the remainder at the opening of the third term. Failure to make satisfactory arrangements therefor with the Bursar will lead to suspension of all University privileges. (See Regulation 2, post, page 374.) Registration as Virginia Student.âIn order to be considered a Virginia student, it is necessary that the applicant's parents be domiciled in the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; or if he has attained his majority, that he himself be domiciled in the State; and that either his parents or the applicant for admission shall have been bona fide taxpayers in the State of Virginia for at least two years prior to said application. Three Years' Course.âThe course of study embraces three years of thirty-seven weeks each, exclusive of holidays. Residence for three years, with attendance of at least thirty weeks a year, exclusive of holidays, is essential to graduation. Plan of Instruction.âEach professor has full liberty to adopt his own method of teaching. In a great majority of the courses instruction is by the case method, oral discussion in the class-room of cases contained in standard case-books. The daily oral quiz has long been a marked and, as experience has proved, a valuable feature of the system of instruction. This oral quiz is supplemented by frequent written tests, the results of which are carefully recorded, and, in the professor's discretion, are considered in estimating the final grade of the student. Practical Work.âIn the procedural courses and in Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, special stress is laid upon practical work. In the course on Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, an intimate acquaintance with law books and skill in their use are secured by lectures and demonstrations during the first term of the first year, accompanied by the assignment of practical work in the library, on which numerous oral and written tests are held; and in the third year briefs on assigned topics and according to rigorous standards are required. Much practical work is done in the headnoting of cases on scientific principles. The Law Clubs.âThere are usually six or more Law Clubs functioning actively in the life of the Law School. Membership in the Law Clubs is optional but students are strongly advised to participate in this work as it affords training in the use of the library, in the preparation of briefs, and in the presentation of oral argument. Required for Graduation.âThe degree of Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) is conferred upon such students as have satisfied the entrance requirements; have attended three full sessions of the Law School; have successfully passed the required examinations, with satisfactory performance of assigned practical work, and have maintained a satisfactory record for ethical conceptions and honorable conduct such as should characterize a prospective member of the legal profession. More specifically, the candidate for graduation must have completed all the obligatory courses (see Outline of Courses, infra), and elective courses, aggregating at least 21 term-hours. A term-hour represents one lecture period per week throughout one of the three terms into which the session is divided. Degree with Final Honors.âA student who is without substantial deficiency in the work of the first two years may, when registering for his third year, seek to quality for the award of the degree with Final Honors upon the conditions set forth on page 377 infra. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Suggestions as to Preliminary Education.âProspective law students, and their parents or guardians, are admonished that the law is peculiarly an intellectual profession, and for its successful prosecution, whether in a law school or in the broader fields of professional life, demands a well-trained mind. If it be true that untrained recruits, in rare instances, under diligent and persistent effort, develop into successful practitioners after entrance upon the practice, such exceptional cases but serve to illustrate the rule that out of a given number of candidates entering upon the study of law, those with sound preliminary training will have incomparably the advantage, while those without such training are likely never to rise above mediocrity in their profession. The experience of all law teachers is that the standing and progress of law students may, in general, be measured by their academic preparation. Moreover, sound academic training tends to develop and to refine the ethical sense so necessary to an honorable career at the bar. It is this consideration that has been, in large measure, the motive of the Association of American Law Schools, and of the national and State bar associations of America, to stress, as these have been doing for some years, the need of a higher educational standard for students proposing to enter upon the study of the law. Students are therefore urged not to begin their legal studies before completion of an academic course approximating that required for a baccalaureate degree. So high a standard, however, is not as yet exacted as a condition of entrance into the Law School. These conditions are shown in the following sections. 1. Regular Students.âCandidates for the degree of Bachelor of Laws must have attained the age of nineteen years (counting to the nearest birthday) before entering the department, must produce a certificate of good character from the school or college last attended, or from other satisfactory source, and must conform to the general requirements following: Entrance Credits.âIn addition to the completion of an approved high school course of four years, or its equivalent, the candidate must present evidence that for two years at least he has pursued, as a resident, in a standard college, courses acceptable toward a baccalaureate degree, of which he must have successfully completed at least 30 session-hours, or 60 semester-hours. A session-hour is one hour a week of recitation, or two hours a week of laboratory work, throughout the college year. Credit will be given for completed courses only. A completed course is one for which the student is entitled to final credit toward a baccalaureate degree from the institution in which the work was done, without further pursuit of that course. Applications for Admission.âApplications for admission must be submitted upon forms which will be supplied by the Dean of the Law School. Such applications, with satisfactory evidence of the required entrance credits, should be filed in the Dean's office not later than September 1. An applicant for admission from outside Virginia may be required to supplement his application by an interview with representatives of the University. Any applicant whose pre-law college record is not considered satisfactory by the Committee on Admissions, from the standpoint of scholarship, may be denied admission, or admitted only on Probation, even though such applicant has completed the entrance credits required. Courses Not Acceptable for Admission.âA candidate shall present at least 30 session-hours (or 60 semester-hours, or their equivalent) of college work, taken in a school approved by standard regional accrediting agencies, and exclusive of credit earned in non-theory courses in Military Science, Hygiene, Domestic Arts, Physical Education, Vocal or Instrumental Music, or other courses without intellectual content of substantial value. This requirement conforms to the rules of the Association of American Law Schools. Recommended Pre-Law Courses.âThe following subjects are recommended as desirable pre-law courses: English, Latin, a Modern Foreign Language, History, a Natural Science, Mathematics, Political Science, Accounting, Economics, Psychology, Philosophy, and Public Speaking. Evidence of the Required High School and College Work.âEvidence of the required entrance credits must be in the form of a certificate, properly authenticated by the Registrar or other authorized official of the institution at which the college work was done. Such certificate must indicate, in addition to the high school units offered for admission, the college courses completed, the grades received, the time devoted to each course, and the credit, in session- or semester-hours, at which each such course is valued toward a baccalaureate degree. No Conditioned Students.âCandidates for admission who have not completed the required 30 session-hours will not be admitted with the privilege of making up the deficiency. Advanced Standing.âFrom 1904 to 1934 no advanced standing or other credit was given for attendance at another law school, nor for time spent in private reading. During that time the practical results were so satisfactory that the rule must still be regarded as the prevailing policy of the law school, as a general rule.* * After considerable experimentation with the prevailing custom of giving credit for work done in other law schools, this rule was adopted in 1904. From the beginning the practical results were so satisfactory that it has become a firmly established policy of the Law School. The rule does not rest on an assumed superiority of curriculum or methods, but on the practical impossibility of dovetailing the parts of two differently arranged curricula. It also avoids certain evils usually accompanying the advanced standing privilege. For an account of the origin of the privilege of advanced standing, and the undesirable results, reference is made to Bulletin Number Fifteen (1921, p. 168) of The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. During recent years, however, it has become apparent that iron-clad adherence to this rule occasionally prevented the Law School from receiving an applicant of the highest calibre. To make the admission of such an applicant possible, in exceptional cases, the Law Faculty adopted a resolution, effective with the session of 1934-35, providing as follows: "Credit toward the degree of Bachelor of Laws in this Law School, in no event to exceed the work of one full session, may, in the discretion of the Dean or Assistant Dean of this Law School, or upon vote of the Law Faculty, be given for courses satisfactorily passed in a law school in the United States that is either approved by the American Bar Association or is a member of the Association of American Law Schools. Similar credit may in like manner be given for work done in law schools outside the United States. No credit shall be given to a student who is ineligible for re-admission to the law school in which the work, for which credit is sought, was done; and no credit shall be given for work in any single session during which the student failed in two or more courses. Credit once given may be withdrawn for unsatisfactory work in this Law School. The Dean and the Assistant Dean of this Law School are given power to make such rulings and adjustments as shall be necessary for the fair and equitable administration of this general provision." Admission of Women.âWith the beginning of the session of 1920-1921, women were admitted to the Law School for the first time. The conditions of their admissions are the same as in the case of male applicants. 2. Special Students.âA limited number of applicants who are at least 23 years old and who present proper evidence of good character and of needful maturity and training, though unable to fulfil the foregoing entrance requirements, may, by special action of the Law Faculty, and only in exceptional cases, be admitted as special students, and not as candidates for the degree.â  â  The limitation of the number of special students admitted conforms to the recom- mendation of the American Bar Association. The applicant for admission as a special student is required to make written application to the Dean of the Law School, on a blank furnished for the purpose, with detailed information as to his age, general habits, his educational and business experience, and his general fitness to undertake the study of law, with a statement of reasons why he was unable to qualify as a regular student. Such application, together with such testimonials as may be required, should be filed with the Dean not later than September 1 of the year in which the applicant desires to enter. Every such applicant for admission as a special student must (if required) pass a satisfactory examination, to be held at the University during the registration days of the session. The examination, which will be conducted by a committee of the Law Faculty, may include the subjects of English, American and English History, and Civil Government.

Under the terms of the donation the award is made at the close of each session to the law student who is a candidate for graduation the following year, and whose scholarship, character, personality, activities in the affairs of the Law School, and promise of efficiency, have, in the opinion of the Law Faculty, entitled him to special recognition above his fellows. The William Samuel Goodwyn Fellowship, with an income of $280: Founded in 1935 upon the bequest of Mrs. Dora H. Goodwyn, of Emporia, Va. THE WILLIAM H. WHITE LECTURE FOUNDATION This Foundation was established in 1922 by Mrs. Emma Gray White, widow, Mrs. Emma Gray Trigg, daughter, and W. H. Landon White and William H. White, Jr., sons of the late William H. White, a distinguished alumnus and for many years a Visitor of the University. The conditions require that the income be used in securing each session the delivery before the Law School of a series of lectures, preferably not less than three in number, by a jurist or publicist, especially distinguished in some branch of jurisprudence, domestic, international, or foreign; and that the lecturer present some fresh or unfamiliar aspect of his subject. Each series of lectures shall possess such unity that they may be published in book form; and the copyright thereof shall vest in the Foundation. OUTLINE OF COURSES The table of courses and lecture schedule, as outlined on the following pages, contemplate an average of about fifteen lecture periods (of one hour each) per week. In view of possible changes, no attempt is here made to outline the courses for 1936-1937. The courses and schedules are those offered in 1935-1936. Written examinations are held at the close of each term.

Registration Generally.âStudents are required to register in advance at the office of (1) The Dean of the Law School; (2) The Bursar; and (3) The University Registrar, for every course taken. Registration is not complete until fees have been paid or proper arrangement for payment made with the Bursar. 2. Suspension for Non-payment of Fees.âA student who is in default in the payment of fees and has so remained for fifteen days will be suspended, and deprived of all privileges of the Law School, until his financial relations with the University have been arranged satisfactorily with the Bursar. 3. Delayed Registration.âStudents are not permitted to delay registration through carelessness or for inadequate reasons. Any student, new or old, who fails without good cause, to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session, and between the hours of nine A. M. and one-thirty P. M. on the first week-day after the Christmas Recess, will be charged a special registration fee of five dollars. 4. Minimum for Which Students May Register.âNo student, without special permission, and for good cause, may register for less than a full year's work as scheduled. 5. Exchange or Omission of Courses.âAfter registration no course may be exchanged or omitted except on the approval of the professor in charge and of the Dean. 6. Late Entrance into Classes.âNo credit is given for the completion of any course upon which the student has entered after 50 per cent. of the lectures thereon in any term have been delivered. See requirements for Graduation, ante, p. 367. 7. Courses Extending Through More Than One Term of the Session.â a. Real Property I and Real Property II are so far regarded as separate courses that one may be passed, and credited, and the other failed. They are so far regarded as a single course that both may be absolved by attaining, in the same session, grades which average the passing grade. b. All other courses extending through more than one term will be credited only in their entirety, each as a single course. Regular examinations will be held, however, at the end of each term during which such a course is given, and will be reported to the Dean's Office, for disciplinary purposes, but the final grade for the entire course will be based upon the several term examinations, with the usual adjustments for attendance, written exercises and recitations. The last examination in such a course may cover the entire subject. 8. First-Year Students.âFailure on the part of any first-year student, without just cause, to attain, for the first term, an average examination grade of 80 per cent. will place such student on probation (see Regulation 11) for the remainder of the session, and the student and his parent or guardian will be so notified. Unless marked improvement in the character of his work is indicated at the end of the second term, his resignation may be required. 9. Carrying Over Uncompleted Work from the First Year.âSubject to regulations below, students who have been found deficient in two or more courses prescribed for the first year may be re-admitted on probation (see Regulation 11). Where the Law Faculty deems the deficiency serious enough the student must repeat the lectures in the courses in which he is deficient. No optional attendance is permissible in the latter case, and only such a limited amount of new work may be taken as will not conflict with the previously incomplete work. 10. Carrying Over Uncompleted Work from the Second Year.âA candidate for the degree who has proved deficient in one or more subjects required in the second year may be required to repeat such courses without privileges in optional attendance, or otherwise, and may be on probation in any term during which he is repeating a second-year course. 11. Probation.âStudents on probation are not entitled to leaves of absence except for imperative cause, nor are they permitted to become members or officials of athletic, musical, debating or other student organizations which publicly represent the University. Any student on probation may be required to resign unless his work indicates a marked improvement. 12. Conditions of Readmission.âA student who, without satisfactory cause, has not attained for the session, on his examinations, credit for courses comprising in the aggregate at least 325 lecture periods, will be excluded from the Law School the following session, but may be permitted to return, on conditions, the next session thereafter. In this connection, attention is called to Regulation 9 foregoing. 13. Invalids.âStudents whose condition of health is too precarious to permit regular attendance upon lectures, but not serious enough to admit them as patients of the hospital, will be required to withdraw from the University until able to resume their regular work. 14. Optional Attendance.âA student who has attended the required lectures on any subject, required in the first year, but has failed on the examinations, may, with the approval of the Dean, secure optional attendance on such subject the following session, to the extent necessitated by actual conflict in schedule with the regular courses of the second year, but subject to Regulation 9. 15. Advanced Work.âStudents are not permitted to anticipate the courses of a subsequent year, without urgent reasons satisfactory to the Dean. 16. General Requirements.âStudents of the Law School are required to attend all regular exercises of the classes of which they are members, and to perform all the work assigned, including quizzes and examinations, unless excused for good cause. 17. Absence from Lectures.âA careful record is kept of the absence from lectures and omission of prescribed work. Such absences, unexcused, render the student liable to be disciplined and detract from his class or examination grade. A student who has been absent for any cause from more than one-third of the scheduled number of lectures in any course shall, prima facie, automatically be denied the privilege of standing the examination in such course. Under special circumstances, and upon special petition, the Law Faculty may permit such a student to stand the examination in such course. 18. "Dean's List."âAn average examination grade of 90 per cent. for the first two years will entitle the student to a place on the "Dean's List," which carries with it special privileges with respect to absences from lectures. The privilege will not exempt students from required practical work, nor from review quizzes. The Dean may revoke the privilege if abused. 19. Extra-Curricular ActivitiesâReports to the Dean.âStudents of the Law School who propose to become members or officials of athletic, musical, debating or other student organizations which publicly represent the University, or who propose to devote a material portion of their time to work outside the Law School, are required to report their names and proposed activities at the Dean's office for official approval. In no case will such approval be given to a student on probation. 20. Law Students Taking College Courses.âA Law Student, under special circumstances, with the permission of the Dean, may register in the College of Arts and Sciences for a course not exceeding three hours a week. 21. Special Examinations. (Subject to Regulation 24 below.)âNo special examinations are granted, save in case of sickness on the day of examination (attested by physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause approved by the Law Faculty. In no case will such examination be granted unless prompt application be made therefor. 22. Re-Examinations.âNo re-examinations are granted, except under conditions stated in Regulations 14 and 23. 23. Third-Year StudentsâIncomplete Work.âA candidate for the degree who at the end of his third year is found deficient in one or more subjects, may return the following session and, without further attendance upon lectures, stand the regular examinations on such of his uncompleted subjects as the Dean and the professor or professors in charge may approve. But this privilege may be exercised but onceâthat is to say, after a second failure the candidate must take the lectures over again, on the subject or subjects on which he has for a second time proved deficient. In exceptional cases and for good cause this privilege may be extended to the student of any year. See Regulation 14. 24. The Same.âStudents in the category mentioned in the foregoing regulation who return for a regular examination as mentioned, and who reside 250 miles from the University, may be granted the privilege of standing one or more special examinations in incompleted courses scheduled for a later term. The purpose of this provision is to avoid the expense of several return trips. 25. Examinations in absentia.âStudents entitled to one or more examinations under Regulation 23, and who reside more than 300 miles from the University, may, in the discretion of the Dean and of the professor or prefessors in charge, be allowed the privilege of standing such examination or examinations in absentia under approved supervision. 26. Examination Fees.âThe fee for standing such examinations as are mentioned in the last three preceding regulations is $5 for each examination taken. Students, who, under such circumstances, return for further lectures, and who have paid full matriculation and tuition fees for three years, are required to pay a matriculation fee in proportion to the amount of work taken plus $5 for each course. There is no charge for special examinations granted for imperative cause, under Regulation 21. 27. Elective Courses Required for Degree.âIn addition to the satisfactory completion of all required work a candidate for the degree must offer credits of not less than 21 term-hours to be chosen by the student from the elective courses offered in the third year. Choice of Elective Courses.âEach applicant for a degree must upon his matriculation sheet specifically designate those elective courses which the candidate proposes to take in order to absolve the requirements under Regulation 27 (twenty-one term hours of elective courses) and under Regulation 29, if applicable (thirty-one term hours). Such designation when definitely made shall be final, and the candidate must pass the courses so elected in order to obtain the degree. Grades in elective courses, as in obligatory courses in the third year, will not be announced until after the publication of the degree list in June. No addition nor substitution of elective courses after choice is definitely made will be permitted except upon the approval of the Dean's Office, for good cause shown. 28. Application for Degree.âCandidates for graduation are required to file a written application with the Dean, not later than November 15 of their third year, indicating the courses completed, together with a schedule of the courses to be pursued during their final year. Blanks for this purpose will be supplied at the Dean's office. 29. Graduation with Final Honors.âA candidate who is without substantial deficiency in the work of the first two years may apply (See Regulation 28) for the award of the degree with Final Honors, by offering credits for elective courses totaling at least 10 term-hours, in addition to the 21 term-hours of elective courses mentioned in Regulation 27. The degree of Bachelor of Laws with Final Honors may be conferred upon any applicant who has completed all the prerequisite work, with an average grade of at least 90 per cent. on the courses offered in his third year, but subject to such special oral or written examinations as the Law Faculty may prescribe in respect to each such application. Caveat.âAt the date of the preparation of this catalogue the whole question of whether the Law School shall continue the degree of Bachelor of Laws with Final Honors, and, if so, under what conditions, is being studied by a committee of the Law Faculty. For this reason the catalogue announcement is being left as it has appeared heretofore, but should be regarded as subject to change for the session of 1936-1937. 30. Required Withdrawal.âThe right is reserved to require the withdrawal of any student who, in the opinion of the faculty, is not profiting nor likely to profit by the instruction offered or whose neglect or irregular performance of required duties, after admonition, indicates indifference or contumacy or whose character or habits are a menace to the good order of the Law School. 31. Honor System.âAll written tests and examinations are conducted under the Honor System.</field>

For other information address the Dean of the Department of Medicine. The session of 1936-37 opens on September 17. The registration days are September 17-19. A fee is required for delayed registration. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS The requirement for admission to the first year of the Department of Medicine is a four-year high-school education or its full equivalent, and two years of work in a college of arts and sciences approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association, as follows: I. High School Requirements The following are the minimum high school requirements of the American Medical Association and the Association of American Medical Colleges and must be satisfied for admission to all Class A medical schools. Students entering the College of the University of Virginia for their premedical college work must also satisfy the regular entrance requirements for admission to the college. These differ from the requirements stated beyond only in that 2Â½ units of Mathematics (1Â½ in Algebra and 1 in Plane Geometry) are required. (a) For admission to the two-year premedical college course, students shall have completed a four-year course of at least 15 units in a standard accredited high school or other institution of standard secondary school grade, or have the equivalent as demonstrated by examinations conducted by the College Entrance Examination Board or by the authorized examiner of a standard college or university which has been approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association. (b) Credit for admission to the premedical college course may be granted for the subjects shown in the following list and for any other subject counted by a standard accredited high school as part of the requirements for its diploma, provided that at least 11 units must be offered in groups I-V: Group I. English. (3 units required) Literature and composition. Group II. Foreign Languages. (2 units required, both of which must be in the same language) Latin, Greek, French, German, Spanish, Italian, or other modern foreign language. Group III. Mathematics. (2 units required) Elementary Algebra, Advanced Algebra, Plane Geometry, Solid Geometry, Trigonometry. Group IV. History. (1 unit required) Ancient History, Medieval and Modern History, English History, American History, Civil Government. Group V. Science. Botany, ZoÃ¶logy, Chemistry, Physics, Physiography, Physiology, Astronomy, Geology. Group VI. Miscellaneous. Agriculture, Bookkeeping, Business Law, Commercial Geography, Domestic Science, Drawing, Freehand and Mechanical, Economics and Economic History, Manual Training, MusicâAppreciation or Harmony. A unit is the credit value of at least thirty-six weeks work of four or five recitation periods per week, each recitation period to be not less than forty minutes. II. Premedical College Course The requirements given below are strictly minimum requirements. Premedical students are advised to take more than 30 session-hours of college work, either by spending an additional year in college or by taking 33 or 36 session-hours during their two years as college students. Entrance conditions of any kind whatsoever are absolutely prohibited and no substitution can be allowed for any required subject. In addition to the high-school work specified above, a candidate for admission to the Department of Medicine must present evidence of the completion in a manner satisfactory to this medical school of at least 30 session-hours of collegiate work in a college approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association. A session-hour is the credit value of one hour a week of lecture or recitation or two hours a week of laboratory work throughout a session of at least thirty-two weeks, exclusive of holidays. The subjects included in the 30 session-hours of college work should be in accordance with the following schedule: Required Subjects: Session-hours General Inorganic Chemistry (a) 4 Organic Chemistry (b) 3 Physics (c) 4 Biology (d) 4 English Composition and Literature (e) 3 Other non-science subjects (f) 6 Subjects Strongly Urged: French or German, Advanced Botany or Advanced ZoÃ¶logy, Psychology, Advanced Algebra, Solid Geometry, and Trigonometry, additional courses in Chemistry. Other Suggested Electives: English (additional), Economics, History, Sociology, Political Science, Ethics, Logic, Mathematics, Latin, Greek, Italian, Spanish, Drawing. Credit Not Given for an Incomplete Course: Credit can be accepted only when the student has a clear record on the entire course; for example, if the course in General Chemistry is a 6 session-hour course consisting of 3 hours lecture and 6 hours laboratory weekly for three trimesters and the student passes on two trimesters but fails on the third no credit for admission to medicine can be given for the portion of the subject passed, even though the credit value of this work is 4 session-hours. In all cases the student must have completed the entire subject for which he is registered. Deficiencies of this kind may, however, be made up by obtaining a clear record in the portion of the subject in which the failure has occurred, without repeating the entire course. Aptitude Tests: Applicants are strongly advised to take the Aptitude Tests of the Association of American Medical Colleges. Requirements in Individual Collegiate Subjects (a) General Inorganic Chemistry. 4 session-hours are required, including 2 session-hours of laboratory work. In the interpretation of this rule work in Qualitative Analysis may be counted as General Inorganic Chemistry. It is desirable that more time than this be given to General Chemistry and especially that either the elements of Physical Chemistry be included in a 6 session-hour course in this subject or a supplementary course in Elementary Physical Chemistry be taken. Students are also advised when their premedical work extends over more than two sessions to take at least 4 session-hours of Qualitative Analysis and 2 session-hours of Quantitative Analysis. (b) Organic Chemistry. 3 session-hours are required of which at least 1 must be laboratory work. 4 session-hours including 2 session-hours of laboratory work are recommended as giving better preparation in Organic Chemistry. (c) Physics. 4 session-hours required, of which at least 1 must be laboratory work. It is urged that this course be preceded by a course in Trigonometry and Solid Geometry. (d) Biology. 4 session-hours required, of which 2 must consist of laboratory work. The requirement may be satisfied by a course of 4 session-hours in General Biology or ZoÃ¶logy, or by courses of 2 session-hours each in ZoÃ¶logy and Botany, but not by Botany alone. Courses in Physiology and Hygiene, Sanitation, Bacteriology, Histology, and other similar work covered in the medical curriculum cannot be accepted as part of the premedical college requirements in Biology. (e) English Composition and Literature. The usual introductory college course of 3 session-hours, or its equivalent, is required. (f) Non-Science Subjects. Of the 30 session-hours required as the measurement of two years of college work, at least 9, including 3 session-hours of English, should be in subjects other than the physical, chemical, or biological sciences. Although not required for admission to the medical school, premedical students are strongly urged to acquire the basic knowledge of French or Germanâand preferably of both French and Germanâwhich will enable them with a little practice to read with ease the medical literature published in these languages. Apart from the cultural value of the study of a foreign language and the use which may be found for French and German in the study of medicine, a reading knowledge of one or both of these languages is required for certain desirable postgraduate scholarships and fellowships. When the student presents for admission to the premedical college course 2 units of high school work in either language, the usual 3 session-hour "second year" college course will amply give this basic knowledge. When he begins the study of the language in college, he should take at least 4, and preferably 5, session-hours in the language. College courses in Physical Education and in Military Training or Military Science will not be counted towards the 30 session-hours required for admission to medicine; nor will required courses in Bible and Biblical Literature be counted, unless the course has a credit value of at least 3 session-hours for one session. No entrance conditions whatever can be allowed nor can any substitutions be made for the required subjects. Premedical students in other colleges and universities who are considering the possibility of entering upon their medical studies in this University are urged to have the authorities of the University of Virginia pass officially upon their academic credit early in their last premedical college year and in no case later than June 1, of that year. Deficiencies may be discovered in this way in time to remove them before the following September. Such students will incur no obligation to enter this medical school. The prohibition of entrance conditions in all recognized medical colleges makes it especially important for the student to be absolutely sure six months or more beforehand that the course he is taking will admit him to the study of medicine. Many deficiencies can be made up by work in summer schools. In planning two years of premedical college work students are advised to take English, Mathematics (Solid Geometry, Plane Trigonometry, and Advanced Algebra), Biology, and General Inorganic Chemistry the first year; and Organic Chemistry, Physics, Foreign Language, and one or more electives the second year. This arrangement of studies is advised because Mathematics should precede Physics and General Inorganic Chemistry must precede Organic Chemistry. Those who have to take 4 or more session-hours of college work in Foreign Language may find it advisable to take Foreign Language both years and take the Mathematics in a summer school following the first premedical college session. Admission with Advanced Standing.âStudents are admitted to advanced standing in the second and third year under the following conditions: 1. Satisfaction of the requirements for entrance into this department at the time of entrance of the class to which the applicant seeks admission. 2. The presentation of a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended. 3. The presentation of the complete record of the student in the school previously attended, on blanks to be obtained from the Dean of the Department of Medicine. This record will be submitted to the action of the Faculty Committee on Advanced Standing, and the admission of the student, together with the terms of admission, will be determined by this committee. The Committee on Advanced Standing will not in general consider favorably applications which are not accompanied by a distinctly good record in the school previously attended. Whenever a student is admitted to advanced standing he must take and pass the full work of the class to which he is admitted unless by permission of the Dean he substitutes for one or more of the regular courses of his class other courses of approximately the same credit value. Students are not received with advanced standing to the fourth-year class. Limitation of Numbers and Reservation of Places.âThe number of students in the first year class is limited to sixty-five. Any applicant whose record has been endorsed by the Dean of the Department of Medicine as entitling him to admission to the class to which he seeks admittance, may at a specified time after June 25 of which he will be given due notice and before the registration period in September have a place reserved for him until 12:00 noon of the first day of registration by depositing with the Bursar the sum of $50.00 in part payment of the tuition fee. A reservation so made can be cancelled only in exceptional cases. In case a student who has obtained a reservation fails to register, the deposit of $50.00 will be forfeited to the University unless, in case of illness or equivalent cause, the Dean of the Department of Medicine directs that it be returned. Unreserved places are filled from a "waiting list" of approved candidates. By the deposit, under similar conditions, of the entire fees for the year a student may have a place reserved for him until 5 p. m. of the last day of registration. Women over twenty years of age are admitted to the medical department by satisfying the entrance requirements specified above. All women students must first register at the office of the Dean of Women, 16 East Lawn. FACILITIES FOR AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION The new Medical Building completed in 1929 contains modern well-equipped laboratories for the accommodation of the medical sciences. This building is connected by corridors and bridges with the hospital, thus bringing all departments of the Medical School into close physical association. The new arrangement necessitated extensive changes in certain portions of the hospital, involving especially the surgical suite, the X-ray suite and the out-patient quarters. It required also the erection of an enlarged laundry, a new power plant, and dining halls for hospital staff and nurses. The Medical School Building consists of two wings connected by an inside pavilion, all five floors in height. The south wing houses on four successive floors the departments of biochemistry, pharmacology and materia medica, physiology, and histology and embryology. On the top floor are the experimental laboratories, quarters for experimental animals and a fire-proof storage room for X-ray plates. The north wing gives accommodations on the ground floor for autopsy rooms, an embalming room, a media room, refrigeration, incineration and storage. The first floor houses half of the Out-patient Department and the receiving room. On the second floor are the offices of administration, the museum and the library. On the third floor are the department of pathology and bacteriology, and two classrooms. The fourth floor contains a laboratory for neuro-anatomy. The connecting pavilion, or west wing, contains on the ground floor four student locker rooms, the electrical power room, a record storage room, and an amphitheatre. The latter is two floors in height and extends eastward into the open court between the north and south wings. On the first floor are a lecture room, a staff room, a record room, a drug room, and examining and sterilizing rooms. On the second floor are housed the department of clinical pathology and a cardiac laboratory. The third floor has three laboratories for gross anatomy, a study room, a number of offices, and quarters for surgical pathology. On the top floor are accommodations for the department of public health and hygiene. These laboratories are all presided over by trained teachers, to whom teaching and investigation are primary considerations. The number of hours assigned to laboratory subjects is quite large and affords ample time for thorough study by the best methods. The student is brought into close contact with teachers who are both willing and able to guide him; he gains a very large part of his knowledge at first hand and by his own exertions, and thus acquires the habit of working out things for himself; he becomes self-reliant, a quality essential to the practice of his difficult profession. Trained in this manner, he acquires an understanding of the medical sciences and the ability to apply the facts of these sciences to the subsequent study of disease. For these reasons the great fundamental sciences receive the utmost consideration, constituting a large part of the work of the first two years. The methods of clinical instruction are based upon the belief that no clinical teaching is efficient which is not governed by essentially the same principles as those which govern the best laboratory teaching. This instruction is accordingly designed to enforce with the individual student a careful, thorough, face-to-face study of disease and its management. The facilities afforded by the University Hospital and Out-Patient Department are described on a subsequent page. In the Out-Patient Department and in the Hospital the student learns the methods of examining patients, of diagnosing their diseases, and of instituting rational treatment; and he learns these things in much the same way as he studied in the laboratory, that is to say, by doing them himself under the direction and criticism of the instructors. This practical training is accompanied by a systematic study of the various subjects by means of lectures, textbooks, and recitations. The student conducts a complete examination, records his observations in a scientific manner, makes a diagnosis, states his view as to the treatment indicated, and keeps a complete record of the case, all under the advice and criticism of the physician or surgeon in charge. He is expected to keep himself informed of the progress of the case throughout its course. If it is one requiring surgical treatment, he assists at the operation, and thus is able to follow all the procedures of the operator at close range. In addition, students make frequent visits to the wards with the attending physicians and surgeons, during which visits the nature, treatment, and progress of various cases are gone over in detail. The patients of the Blue Ridge Sanatorium afford additional material for clinical instruction. Since the number of students in each class is relatively small, it is clear that the department offers capable young men clinical advantages which are distinctly exceptional. At the meetings of the Medical Society of the University of Virginia reviews of important articles, clinical cases and results of original research are presented by the instructors and by invited guests. Graduate Instruction in the Department of Medicine is administered under the Department of Graduate Studies of the University. The courses of the regular medical curriculum are credited as C courses; elective, special research and seminar courses are evaluated as D courses. Recent revision of the medical curriculum, involving chiefly reductions in the number of session-hours of required work and the establishment of elective and research courses in each of the major departments, makes possible an enlarged scope of graduate instruction. Registrar's Records of Student's Work.âThe results of the work of each student are recorded in the Registrar's office in such manner as to show (1) the grade received on each course, (2) whether the student has or has not absolved the course and, if not, what is necessary to obtain a clear record and admit to dependent subjects, and (3) a valuation in "honor points" of the results of the work for each session. 1. The grade received on each course. These grades with their percentage equivalents are as follows: 1 + = 95-100 per cent 1 = 90- 94 per cent 2 = 85- 89 per cent 3 = 80- 84 per cent 4 = 70- 79 per cent 5 = below 70 per cent The passing grade is 3. A grade of 4 entitles the student to a condition, as explained below. A grade of 5 means a failure for the course. No passing grades are reported to the Registrar's office on didactic work unless the laboratory or clinical part of the course is completed in a satisfactory manner; nor are any grades reported when the student is deficient until the deficiency has been made up. 2. Whether the student has or has not absolved the course, and, if not, what is required to obtain a clear record and admit to dependent subjects. This is indicated in the following terms: Passed (P) indicates the satisfactory completion of the course and admits to all dependent subjects. Conditioned (C) means that to obtain a clear record on the course the student must pass a special examination. Failure to take or to pass this examination is equivalent to a record of "failed." The record "conditioned" is not given in fourth-year subjects, except in case of illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty. A student may be conditioned on any examination because of failure to maintain a reasonable standard of English composition. Deficient (D) indicates that part of the required laboratory or clinical work of the course has not been completed. Upon the satisfactory completion of this work within the time and in the manner prescribed by the professor in charge, the student receives the record "passed"; otherwise the record is "failed" on the entire course. Failed (F) indicates that the course must be repeated; except that when the laboratory or other practical work has been satisfactorily performed, the professor in charge may, at his discretion, excuse the student from repeating the same; and, by special vote of the faculty, the student may be granted optional attendance upon the course, in whole or in part. In general, a student who is repeating a course will be required to attend all the exercises of the course, and will not be excused from any exercise thereof because of schedule conflicts with more advanced work. Absence from a regular examination, when excused because of illness or equivalent cause gives a record of conditioned; if not excused, a record of failed. 3. A valuation of the general results of the work on each course and of the student's work for the entire session. Honor points and Deficiency points. The term point is employed as an index of the extent of departure from the passing grade of 3. No points are given for a mere passing grade; but for grades above 3 they are designated as honor points (or +) and for those below 3 as deficiency points (or -) An honor point may be defined as the value of one-half session-hour of a course on which a grade of 2 has been received; this value is increased to 2 when a grade of 1 has been received; and to 2Â½ when a grade of 1+ has been received. A deficiency point is the value of 1/3 session-hour of a course on which a grade of 4 has been received; this becomes 1 1/3 when a grade of 5 has been received. Deficiency points, once incurred, cannot be expunged. The 1 deficiency point of a grade requiring a conditioned examination becomes 1 1/3 deficiency points if a passing grade is not made on the re-examination, since the record becomes a failure. Each course is valued in the usual manner in terms of session-hours. Then the student's honor and deficiency points are determined by multiplying the number of session-hours involved by the point value of the grade earned. The following table gives the values in points for one session-hour of work for the various grades: Grade Point value per session-hour 1+ (95-100%) 5 honor points (+5) 1 (90-94.9%) 4 honor points (+4) 2 (85-89.9%) 2 honor points (+2) 3 (80-84.9%) 0 honor points (None) 4 (70-79.9%) 3 deficiency points (-3) 5 (Under 70%) 4 deficiency points (-4) The value in points of a session's work is the difference between the honor points received and the deficiency points. If there is an excess of the former, this is indicated by placing a plus (+) sign before the numeral; if vice versa, a minus (-); if they balance one another, no sign or numeral is employed, which is also the case where the grade is 3 on all subjects. Honor points will not be given for grades received on conditioned examinations or on courses in which repetition was required on account of poor scholarship. On the other hand, deficiency points will be given in accordance with the above table. Furthermore, deficiency points shall be cumulative. A student, having incurred deficiency points in June, shall have these added to such as he may incur on repeating a course on re-examination and the sum shall be used in determining his relative rank in his class. Students, whose excess of honor points over deficiency points amounts to 50 on the entire curriculum of medical study of any one year, or its equivalent, are designated as "honor" or "distinguished" students and have the privilege of optional attendance on the didactic work of the next session. Special Rules Governing Advancement and Registration. I. At the close of the University in June the records of the past session will be reviewed and the students will be classified as follows: (a) Promoted; (b) Required to Withdraw; (c) Provisionally Promoted; and (d) Required to Repeat. (a) Promoted. This group shall be composed of all students who have satisfactorily completed the entire work of the year. (b) Required to Withdraw. This group shall include such students as are not deemed competent to continue their training in this school. The record requiring withdrawal, reckoned in deficiency points and in session-hours, is as follows: For first-year classâ36 deficiency points regardless of honor points, or the equivalent in session-hours: (1) Failures in 9 session-hours; (2) failures in 6 hours plus conditions in 4 hours; (3) conditions in 12 hours. For second-year classâ36 deficiency points regardless of honor points, or the equivalent in session-hours: (1) Failures in 9 hours; (2) failures in 6 hours plus conditions in 4 hours; (3) conditions in 12 hours. For third-year classâ26 deficiency points regardless of honor points, or the equivalent in session-hours: (1) Failures in 6.5 hours; (2) failures in 4 hours plus conditions in 3.3 hours; (3) conditions in 8.6 hours. (c) Provisionally Promoted. This group shall include the students who have incurred only such deficiencies as can with reasonable expectation be removed by the opening of the next session. The record entitling provisional promotion, reckoned in deficiency points and in session-hours, must not be worse than the following: For first-year classâ28 deficiency points regardless of honor points, or the equivalent in session-hours: (1) Failures in 7 hours; (2) failures in 4 hours plus conditions in 4 hours; (3) conditions in 9.3 hours. For second-year classâ18 deficiency points regardless of honor points, or the equivalent in session-hours: (1) Failures in 7 hours; (2) failures in 4 hours plus conditions in 4 hours; (3) conditions in 9.3 hours. For third-year classâ18 deficiency points regardless of honor points, or the equivalent in session-hours: (1) Failures in 4.5 hours; (2) failures in 3 hours plus conditions in 2 hours; (3) conditions in 6 hours. (d) Required to Repeat. This group shall include all students not placed in groups a, b, and c; that is, those who have incurred (1) in the first or second year between 28.1 and 35.9 deficiency points, and (2) in the third between 18.1 and 25.9. A student who is repeating a session's work must attend all the exercises of the year, or courses, and pass all the examinations, regardless of the grades previously made. II. Students, classified in June as "Required to Withdraw" or "Required to Repeat," shall not change their status by passing summer courses and (or) special examinations. III. At the opening of the session in September, the status of the students, who were classified in June as Provisionally Promoted, will be revised and they will be re-classified as follows: (a) Promoted; (b) Required to Withdraw; (c) Required to Repeat. (a) Promoted. This group shall be composed of such students as were provisionally promoted in June and have now, by summer's work and reexamination, satisfactorily completed the entire work of the year; i. e., have not added to their deficiency points. (b) Required to Withdraw. This group shall be composed of such students as have failed to make up their deficiencies to such an extent as to incur (1) in the first and second years more than 24 additional deficiency points, or the equivalent in failures of more than 6 session-hours of work, and (2) in the third year more than 16 additional deficiency points, or its equivalent in failures of more than 4 session-hours of work. (c) Required to Repeat. This group shall be composed of such students as were not placed in a and b, above; i. e., in the first and second years they have not more than 24 additional deficiency points; and in the third, not more than 16 additional. IV. A student who has been permitted to repeat a year, or prescribed courses, shall not be granted the privilege for a second time, i. e., he shall not spend more than five years in completing the requirements for graduation. V. A student may not take any course, either in whole or in part (as explained under the above definition of failed) more than twice. A second record of failed on the same course involves withdrawal from the Department of Medicine. VI. A clear record at the opening of the session in September on all subjects of the preceding year is required for advancement to the third and fourth years. VII. Summer courses taken for the removal of deficiencies must be approved by the professor in whose subjects the deficiencies were incurred; but it shall be the duty of the student concerned to provide the information on which to base the decision as to acceptability of courses; he must absolve the summer work and have an official record mailed directly from the institution to the professor at the University in charge of the subjects; and in addition he must report for the special examination at this University and make a passing grade therein. VIII. Any student, who makes a grade below passing on any term's work or is in any way derelict in his duties, shall be warned, warned and placed on probation, or dismissed, according to the merits of the case. The value in session-hours of the courses of the first three years:â First Year Second Year Third Year Anatomy 1 6 Physiology 5 Clinical Diagnosis 2.5 Anatomy 2 2 Pathology 6 Medicine 4.0 Histology 4 Pharmacology 2 Surgery 4.0 Embryology 2 Materia Medica 3 Obstetrics 2.5 Biochemistry 4 Physical Diagnosis 1 Orthopedics 1.5 Bacteriology 3 Medicine 2 Pediatrics 2.0 Surgery 1 Urology 1.0 Ophthalmology 1.0 Otolaryngology 1.0 Totals 21 Totals 20 Totals 19.5 Similar rules are enforced at practically all medical schools. It is exceedingly difficult for a student who has been dropped or not advanced at one school to secure admission to another. Compulsory withdrawal may therefore terminate a medical career. Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine, who have less than one full year's work to complete, may be required to take such additional work and to pass such additional examinations as the Medical Faculty may prescribe. This additional work may be selected from any of the courses given in the Department of Medicine, even when such prescribed courses have previously been taken and passed by the candidate in question. Certificates of Attendance.âStudents who attend the whole regular course of one or more of the four years are entitled to an official statement under the seal of the University, showing all courses for which the student was registered each year as a medical student and the record (see above under "Regulations") with the grade received on each course for which he was registered. These statements will also contain any special faculty votes affecting the student's registration in this school. In no case will the University give an official certificate of the completion of a part of a course. The professor in charge may, at his discretion, make a personal statement by letter to the head of the same department in another medical school of the work done by the student in his course; but he must at the same time clearly state that this letter does not imply credit in this medical school. Requirements for Graduation.âThe degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred by the University of Virginia upon candidates who have complied with the entrance requirements of this department; attended a regular medical course of four years of at least eight months each, the last two of which years must have been at this institution; and have satisfactorily completed a thesis and all of the subjects included in the medical course. Examinations.âThese are in writing, accompanied in many subjects by individual practical examinations. Examinations may be held only during the regular examination periods at the end of each term or during the vacation periods. No examinations may be given while regular class work is in progress; provided this rule is not to be interpreted to prohibit unannounced written tests or regular daily or weekly tests which count on the class standing of students. The regular examinations are held at stated periods during the session. In addition, examinations are held each year during the week immediately preceding the beginning of lectures. To the latter are admitted: 1. Students of the previous session, who, from illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty, were unable to present themselves for examination in any particular subject at the regular time. 2. Students who at the regular examination in any first-, second-, or third-year subject of the preceding session have attained a grade less than 80 per cent., but as much as 70 per cent., on one or more subjects, as explained in a preceding paragraph. This does not apply to students who have been required to withdraw, or required to repeat, under the Special Rules Governing Advancement (pp. 389-391). 3. Certain applicants for advanced standing who are required to take examinations by the Committee on Advanced Standing. The usual period for special or conditioned examinations is in September during the week of registration; but such examinations may be scheduled, at the option of the professor in charge, for any other time, provided regular class work is not in progress and also provided all students entitled to take examinations agree to the change of date. For a special or conditioned examination held at any other time than that assigned for all students entitled thereto a fee of five dollars is charged. This fee must be paid to the Bursar before the examination is held. In all courses in which there is practical work, either in the laboratory or in the outpatient department or wards of the hospital, two records are returned to the Registrar's office for each student; one of these records is for the practical laboratory or clinical work in which the record is P(assed), D(eficient), or F(ailed), the other record is for the didactic work, including the final examinationsâin which case the record is P(assed), C(onditioned), D(eficient), or F(ailed), with the approximate percentage grade. To obtain a clear record on the course a student must have a record of P(assed) both on practical and on didactic work; at the discretion of the professor in charge these grades may be averaged to determine the final standing of the student. No record whatever is given on didactic work unless there is a record of P(assed) on practical work nor will any record be given on practical work until a clear record is obtained on didactic work; failure on practical work gives a record of F(ailed) on the entire course. The Fall Examinations for 1936-37 begin September 14 and close September 19. Students entitled to admission to these examinations will be informed of the date of examination by the Dean. Expenses.âThe fees for instruction are 1, the tuition fee; 2, the University fee which entitles the student to the use of the Library, Gymnasium, to medical attention, etc.; 3, the athletic fee; 4, the Topics fee; 5, special laboratory fees, as specified in following table. First Year Second Year Third Year Fourth Year Tuition (Virginians) $250 00 $250 00 $250 00 $250 00 (Non-Virginians) 300 00 300 00 300 00 300 00 University fee 60 00 60 00 60 00 60 00 Athletic fee 15 00 15 00 15 00 15 00 College Topics fee 1 50 1 50 1 50 1 50 Laboratory Fees: Biochemistry 10 00 Deposit in Biochemistry 10 00 Anatomy 1 and 2 17 50 Histology and Embryology 7 50 Physiology 10 00 Bacteriology 7 50 Pathology 5 00 Pharmacology 5 00 Clinical Diagnosis 5 00 5 00 Materia Medica 5 00 Total (Virginians) $379 00 $356 50 $331 50 $326 50 (Non-Virginians) 429 00 406 50 381 50 376 50 The minimum for necessary living expenses, including room, heat, light, furniture, service, board, books, and laundry, is estimated at $400. In the course in Biochemistry, a deposit of $10 is required to cover cost of breakage. A fee of $3.00 is required of all women students for the upkeep of the "Women Students' Association Room." Each student in the Department of Medicine is required to provide himself with a satisfactory microscope. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University and the Dean of the Department in which the student is registered. When a permit is granted upon the University Physician's certificate that withdrawal is necessary on account of ill health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct, the fees are returned pro rata. Under no other circumstances will there be a return of fees. Combined Degrees in Arts (or Science) and Medicine.âStudents who have credit for the 48 session-hours of the group electives required in this University for the cultural beccalaureate degrees in arts and science may substitute for 12 session-hours of Electives-at-Large the first-year course in the Department of Medicine and receive the degree of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science at the end of the year. The University offers also the degree of Bachelor of Science in Medicine. This degree has been placed in charge of the Medical Faculty. It is awarded on the recommendation of the Medical Faculty after the completion of the second year of the medical curriculum to students who (1) present 33 session hours of acceptable work in premedical college subjects (whether taken in the University or elsewhere) as specified below; (2) complete the first two years of the medical course in this University with grades in general higher than the lowest passing grade; and (3) demonstrate by examination a reading knowledge of medical French and German. (1) Premedical College Subjects.âThese must include: Session-hours One year of English 3 Algebra, Solid Geometry, Plane Trigonometry 3 Physics, Chemistry, and Biology 24 With minimum requirements in each subject as follows: (a) General Chemistry (including in this term Analytical or Physical Chemistry) 6 (b) Organic Chemistry 3 (c) General Physics 4 (d) Biological Science 6 Elective in subjects other than Physics, Chemistry and Biology 3 (2) First two years of the Medical Curriculum, completed with a record of 30 honor points on first-year subjects and 40 honor points on second-year subjects. (3) Reading knowledge of Medical French and German.âThis will be tested by examination consisting of the translation of passages from textbooks of Anatomy and Histology, Biochemistry, Physiology, and Pathology. No specific college work is required although the equivalent of 3 session-hour college courses in each of these languages is desirable. The vocabulary of medical French and German may best be acquired by using foreign textbooks, etc., in the above medical sciences as parallel reading, or as summer reading after the completion of the above subjects in the regular medical course. SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS Certain special scholarships are open only to medical students. A considerable number of other scholarships are open to medical students in common with students from other departments of the University. The William A. Herndon Scholarships are founded upon the bequest of Dr. Cumberland George Herndon, a graduate in medicine of this University.

COURSES OF INSTRUCTION In the following description of courses, the number of hours represents the amount of time each student devotes to the course. In addition to the hours scheduled in the third and fourth years of the course, each student devotes a considerable amount of time to practical work which does not appear in the schedule, but the satisfactory performance of which is essential to graduation. Thus the taking of histories, the visits to his cases in the hospital, assisting at operations, attendance upon cases of labor, the employment of microscopical and chemical methods of diagnosis in the hospital, require much time which it has not seemed possible to record in a rigid schedule. The session, exclusive of the time devoted to examination, is divided into a first term of twelve weeks, a second term of ten weeks, and a third term of ten weeks. First Year Anatomy 1: 19 hours weekly during the first term and 12 hours weekly during the second term. This course begins with a systematic study of the bones, on the completion of which a part is assigned to each student for dissection and study. On the completion of this course each student has dissected a lateral half of the body. The student obtains his knowledge at first hand and by his own personal efforts. Dr. Bean, Dr. Speidel and Assistants. Anatomy 2: 6 hours weekly during the second term. This course consists of a laboratory study of the anatomy of the central nervous system carried out in considerable detail. The gross anatomy of the spinal cord and brain is first considered, on the completion of which sections of the more important regions are studied with the aid of the microscope. Fresh brains and series of sections of the cord and brain are thoroughly used. A reconstruction of the central nervous system showing the more important pathways is prepared by each student. Dr. Speidel. Histology: 4 lectures or recitations and 10 hours of laboratory work weekly during the first term. This course aims to acquaint the student with the microscopic structure of tissues and organs. Cytogenesis and histogenesis are briefly considered in the case of many tissues studied. The relation of histology to physiology and pathology is constantly kept in view. The student is also given opportunity to acquaint himself with the principles and practice of histological technique. Dr. Jordan and Dr. Kindred. Embryology: 7 hours weekly during the second term. The laboratory work (5 hours weekly) with sections and dissections of mammalian embryos, is supplemented by lectures, recitations, and the study of models. The course aims to give the student a knowledge of developmental processes, in the light of which he may the better understand the more abstruse normal conditions of adult anatomy, as well as many anomalies and variations. Dr. Jordan and Dr. Kindred. Bacteriology: Lectures, conferences and laboratory work 15 hours weekly during the third term. The object of this course is to acquaint the student with the microÃ¶rganisms which are of importance to man and his environment, the methods used in their study and identification. The fundamentals of infection and immunity are taught. So far as practicable the material studied is obtained from the environment, from the body surfaces and excretions of normal individuals, and from the body surfaces, excretions, secretions and exudates of the persons with various common pathological conditions. The student is thus introduced to the etiology of infectious disease and some of the factors involved in resistance. Through a consideration of selected bacteriologic and immunologic studies the basis is laid for the later study of epidemiology and preventive medicine. Dr. Maxcy, Dr. Scott and Assistants. Biochemistry: Lectures and laboratory, 7 hours weekly during the second term and 14 hours weekly during the third term. Course comprises the chemistry of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates; digestion, intestinal putrefaction, feces, blood, milk, and bile; particular attention is devoted to the chemical physiology of digestion, secretion, excretion, internal secretion, intermediary metabolism, and nutrition. Laboratory work includes the study of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, purine compounds, etc.; gastric contents, blood, milk, and urine; the digestive enzymes and the digestion of foods; and extensive qualitative and quantitative work on urine. Dr. Chautin and Dr. Ludewig. Second Year Physiology: Lectures, conferences, and demonstrations, 5 hours weekly during the first term, and 4 hours during the second term; laboratory work, 7 hours weekly during the first term, 3 hours weekly during the second term. In the lecture course attention is drawn to the fundamental branches of the subject, and the more difficult aspects are thoroughly discussed. Recent important physiological contributions are evaluated, and the student is directed further to consult various monographs and original papers. The laboratory work consists of preliminary elemental experiments on the neuromuscular system, followed by intensive courses in mammalian and in human physiology. The latter are designed particularly to train students to observe and record, and to interpret and make deductions from their results. Suggestive outlines only are provided for the experimental studies. The course in physiology is particularly devised to stimulate and correlate the student's consideration of the activities of the organism as a whole. Emphasis is given to those branches of physiology which should prove valuable in later work in medicine. Dr. Britton, Dr. Corey, Dr. Silvette and Assistants. Pathology: 4 hours weekly during the first term; 12 hours weekly during the second term, and 12 hours weekly during the third term. By a systematic series of lectures, combined with demonstrations of both gross and microscopic preparations, the various morbid conditions of the body are presented. In the laboratory, under supervision, the student personally examines all of the gross material and devotes considerable time to the study of the loan-collection of slides with which he is provided. In addition to this systematic portion of the course an attempt is made to acquaint the students with fresh tissues and disease as seen at the autopsy table. With this end in view the class is divided into small groups of students each of which assists at a limited number of autopsies. Fresh tissues are demonstrated during class hours and, whenever possible, autopsies are performed before the entire class. Dr. Cash, Dr. Casey, Dr. Scott and Dr. Foote. Materia Medica: Lectures and recitations 4Â½ hours weekly and laboratory work 6 hours weekly, during the first three-fourths of the first term. A thorough study is made of the sources, preparation, composition, properties and interactions of medicinal substances to the end that they may be intelligently prescribed. Special attention is paid to their standardization for purity and potency. Prescription writing and incompatibility are dealt with in frequent practical exercises. While the consideration of the more important preparations of the Pharmacopeia and the New and Non-Official Remedies consumes the greater portion of the allotted time, the course is concluded with a critical study of many of the so-called patent medicines. Dr. J. A. Waddell, Dr. Moir and Assistants. Toxicology: Lectures and recitations 4Â½ hours weekly and laboratory work 6 hours weekly, during the last quarter of the first term. A systematic review is made of the pharmacological action of such chemic agents as are particularly liable to cause injury to health or loss of life, special attention being given to their quantitative effects. Practical instruction is given in the methods of isolating and identifying. The treatment of poisoning is dealt with in detail. Dr. J. A. Waddell and Dr. Moir. Pharmacology: Lectures, recitations and demonstrations 4 hours weekly and laboratory work 6 hours weekly, during the second term.

Pharmacist Maud Lambert Assistant Pharmacist The hospital is the property of the University and is under the exclusive control of its Medical Faculty. It was designed and is administered as a teaching hospital, being so arranged that free use can be made of its clinical material without in any way disturbing or violating the privacy of other patients. The location of the University Hospital is a most favorable one, being situated at the intersection of two great railway trunk lines near the geographical center of the State. A large population outside of the city of Charlottesville is available as a source of clinical material, both in the wards and the Out-Patient Department. The hospital is thus enabled to serve a large area of the State and the transportation facilities are such that this service includes a progressively increasing number of emergency cases and cases of acute illness. The buildings are arranged upon the pavilion system, consisting of a central structure, four stories in height, to which have been added up to the present time five additional units, including a service building. The central building is largely devoted to administrative purposes and general service departments. The four pavilions are connected with the main building by corridors on each floor. In these are located the wards and suites of rooms for private patients. As at present constituted, the hospital has a capacity of about 300 beds; of these, approximately 225 are available and used for clinical teaching. During the past year there were 7,092 admissions to the hospital. Attention is particularly called to the fact that the hospital, with its associated Out-Patient Department, constitutes a most valuable part of the teaching facilities of the Department of Medicine. The size of the clinic permits the presentation of a wide variety of cases, and the organization of the hospital as an integral part of the Medical Department affords exceptional facilities for thorough study of patients. THE OUT-PATIENT DEPARTMENT Commodious and well-equipped quarters for the treatment of ambulant cases are provided in the north pavilion of the hospital, and medical school building, and the service is conducted under the direct personal supervision of members of the teaching staff of the Medical Department. The character of the equipment of this department and its location in the hospital makes possible the use of thorough methods in the diagnosis and treatment of cases, and the systematic examination of each patient is thus emphasized at the very outset of the student's clinical experience. 37,681 visits were made by patients to this department during the past year. THE BLUE RIDGE SANATORIUM The Blue Ridge Sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis, which is owned by the State and controlled by the Virginia State Board of Health, is situated near the Medical School. Under a plan of coÃ¶peration agreed upon by the State Board of Health and the University, the Medical Director and other members of the staff of the Sanatorium give instruction in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis to students in the Medical School. The Sanatorium has accommodations for 270 patients. Work at the Sanatorium is part of the required course. This affiliation of the Sanatorium and the Medical School offers an opportunity almost ideal for the medical student to become thoroughly familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of this most important disease. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HOSPITAL TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES A training school for nurses is conducted in connection with the hospital. Full information regarding requirements for admission, and the course of instruction may be obtained by addressing the Superintendent of Nurses.</field>

SUMMARY OF ATTENDANCEâ1935 From Virginia 1,325 From other states and countries 517 Total 1,842 Less duplicates 384 Net enrollment 1,458 ANNOUNCEMENTS The Summer Quarter of the University is an integral part of the University Year, the courses in the College of Arts and Sciences and in the Department of Graduate Studies being the same in character, method and in credit value as in the other quarters. In the Department of Education many professional courses for elementary and high school teachers which are not offered in the regular session are given to meet certificate requirements. The Summer Quarter is divided into two terms for the accommodation of those who can give only five or six weeks to the work but who desire University credit. The First Term will begin June 15 and will close July 25, with lectures 5 times a week. The Second Term will begin July 27 and close August 29, with 6 lectures a week. Students may enter for either term or both. A separate registration card must be filled out for each term. The Summer Quarter is conducted for white men and women students as follows: Elementary school teachers seeking certificate or degree credit, high school teachers desiring certificates or degree credit, students just entering college desiring advanced standing, undergraduate students, pre-medical students and pre-law students desiring to meet entrance requirements, medical students, engineering students, graduate students working for the master's degree or wishing to engage in research, school officials, supervisors and superintendents, and serious minded men and women who wish a wider knowledge of some special subject or seek broader general culture. FEES University Fees.âRegistration and tuition fees vary for Virginia teachers, students who are residents of Virginia but do not teach, and students and teachers from other states. There are special fees for graduate courses, laboratory courses, music, art, commercial, medical, etc., courses, for extra courses, which are charged all students alike. Fees for Virginia Teachers.âA registration fee of $10.00 is charged all teachers from Virginia. Tuition is entirely free to Virginia teachers in all the regular courses leading to certification. The term "Virginia Teacher" means one whose last teaching was in Virginia. It does not include one who lives in Virginia but teaches outside the State, or who plans to teach but has not yet taught. Women students from Virginia who are planning to teach but have not yet taught, may secure a State scholarship which entitles them to free tuition in return for their pledge to teach two years in the public schools of Virginia. A student applying for such a scholarship should have her applicaion endorsed by the superintendent of the division in which she lives. Fees for Virginia Students.âA registration fee of $5.00 and a tuition fee of $15.00 are charged residents of Virginia who do not teach or residents of Virginia who teach out of the state. Fees for Out-of-State Students.âA registration fee of $5.00 and a tuition fee of $25.00 are charged residents from states other than Virginia. Fees for All Students.âA medical fee of $0.75 is charged all students save those local people who have their own physicians. Three session-hours is the normal amount of work which a student may carry. If special permission is given to carry more than three session-hours, a fee of $5.00 is charged for the fourth hour. There is a fee of $5.00 for each graduate hour. This fee is stated in the description of the course. There are laboratory and special fees for certain classes. In every case, the amount of the fee is included in the description of the class. EXPENSES Board and Rooms.âBoard and rooms may be had at prices ranging from $7.50 a week, where several stay in the same room, upward, according to accommodation and proximity to the University, the average being $7.50 to $10.00 a week. Most of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the University grounds. The University Commons conducts a first-class dining-room at which meals may be obtained at $6.00 per single week, or $32.75 for six weeks. Full details concerning Board and Rooms may be obtained from the Catalogue of the Summer Quarter which is published annually.

In addition to those so listed there are offered also: 2 courses in Art, 8 courses in Commercial Education, 1 course in English, 3 courses in Industrial and Fine Arts, 11 courses in Music, 13 courses in Physical Education, and 3 courses in High-School Mathematics. Full descriptions of all these courses may be found in the Catalogue of the Summer Quarter. CREDITS AND DEGREES Degrees are conferred upon men and women upon exactly the same terms for work done in the Summer Quarter when the degree requirements are fully met. 60 session-hours of undergraduate courses, exclusive of Physical Education, taken in conformity with the requirements published herewith, are required for the Bachelor's degree. Those who contemplate completing their degree requirements in the Summer Quarter should keep clearly in mind, in estimating the time that will be required, that the normal amount of credit which may be taken in one Summer Quarter is 6 session-hours. To obtain a degree in the College of Arts and Sciences an applicant must have been in residence as a college student for at least one session of nine months or for at least three full Summer Quarters. The last regular session or the last three Summer Quarters of candidacy must be spent in residence in the College of this University. Any course for which credit on a baccalaureate degree is allowed in this University must be a complete course, that is, not a fraction of a course. For example, one or two terms only of a three-term course cannot be counted toward a degree. Similarly, when work is done elsewhere, one semester alone of a two-semester course cannot be counted toward a degree. However, combinations of fractions of courses may be allowed to count as complete courses with the approval of the Schools and Departments concerned. Candidates for a degree who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. The certificate must be acceptable both to the Dean of the Summer Quarter and to the Dean of the Department in which the degree will be obtained. The certificate must bear the signature of an official of the candidate's college and must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate and must give his grade. In every case the candidate must spend at least three full Summer Quarters at the University in order to meet the rsidence requirements. The Master's degree may be obtained by properly qualifiel persons in three Summer Quarters. In no case is this degree to be conferred upon any person who has not attended and done graduate work three full Summer Quarters or the equivalent time in the regular session of the University. All persons who are looking forward ultimately to taking a degree through summer work are urgently requested to file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter an official statement of their entrance credits and work for which college credit is desired. In order to provide for the increasing number of students who complete the requirements for their degrees during the Summer Quarter, a convocation exercise will be held Friday evening, August 28, at 8 o'clock, when the degrees will be conferred. Catalogue and further information may be obtained by addressing Secretary Summer Quarter, Box 1337, University, Virginia. PRE-MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS Courses covering all the required subjects for entrance to the first year of the Medical School, as described on page 382 of this catalogue, are offered in the Summer Quarter so that it is possible for the student to meet the pre-medical requirements in two summer quarters and one regular session of the University. PRE-LEGAL REQUIREMENTS Courses are offered in the Summer Quarter covering all the required college work for admission to the Department of Law, see page 368 of this catalogue.

History and Purpose The first reference to University Extension at the University of Virginia appears in an early issue of College Topics, at present a student publication but originally a publication of the General Athletic Association. Volume II, number 26, of College Topics, issued April 18, 1891, carried an account of a meeting of University of Virginia alumni at Columbia University Hall in Washington, D. C., on April 13 preceding "at which the system of education known as university extension was discussed by leading professors and learned men." A visiting speaker on this occasion "thought it eminently fitting and proper that the meeting in the interest of university extension should be called under the auspices of the Alumni Association of the University of Virginia, that institution which was founded by Thomas Jefferson who taught the true democracy of education." Notwithstanding this early reference to and interest in extension, the work was not formally introduced in the University until September 1912 when a system of extension lectures was inaugurated. There followed almost immediately extension publications dealing with subjects of special importance in the life of the State. These publications were soon organized into a regular series, The University of Virginia Record Extension Series, the first number of which appeared in September 1915. In the same year the University "desirous of extending its services beyond its academic walls to as many people of the State as possible who cannot have advantage of the resident courses in the institution," established an "Extension Bureau" as an administrative unit. By 1920-1921 the activities of this bureau had been increased to include, according to the University catalogue for that year, (1) Extension Teaching (Extension credit courses), (2) Extension Lectures, (3) Debate and Public Discussion, (4) Citizenship Education, (5) Package Libraries, (6) Publications, (7) Visual Education, (8) Home Reading Courses (in coÃ¶peration with the United States Bureau of Education), and (9) Short Courses. In 1922-1923 the title of the administrative agency was changed from Bureau of Extension to Division of Extension to conform to general practice in nomenclature among American universities. There were few precedents to follow when Extension work was first organized at the University of Virginia. Unquestionably the inspiration for the Extension movement in America came from English universities where a system of extension lectures had been instituted as early as 1865. But conditions in the mother country are very different from those in America. The University of Virginia, like other State universities in America, had to deal with conditions peculiar to itself and to the State which created it for its service. Accordingly, first the Extension Bureau and later the Division of Extension had to experiment and explore. The result has been constant changes in methods due to efforts to profit by experience and to conform more closely with the University's developing ideas of its responsibilities in the fields of adult education and university extension. Much of the Extension Division's attention today is directed to the purpose of interpreting adult education and of keeping the ideal of continuing education before the people of the State, and of encouraging local communities and appropriate organizations to establish adult education institutions, especially for those unprepared to undertake education on a college or university level. Probably the most clearly recognized function of the Division is that of bringing education on the university level to college graduates and other mature adults throughout the State who are qualified to pursue such courses with pleasure and profit. Especial effort is also made by the Division to coÃ¶perate both with individuals and professional groups in this State. Many features of its program prophetic of the most far-reaching results are coÃ¶perative undertakings. Through lectures, publications, press reports, conferences and direct correspondence the Division discusses and defines the adult education movement and encourages a general consideration of the problems involved. The more specific contributions of the Division are organized under three principal bureaus as follows: Extension Teaching, Educational Aids, and CoÃ¶perative Activities. I. Extension Teaching Credit Course.âTwo types of Extension courses carrying degree credit are offered, namely, Extension Classes and Home Study Courses. Extension Classes.âExtension classes are conducted in communities requesting them that are available to the Extension instructors. In general only the equivalent of courses offered in residence are given. The exceptions are courses in education offered by teacher-training institutions of the State in fields not dealt with in the Department of Education at the University of Virginia. Prerequisites and general requirements are the same for extension credit courses as for courses in residence. Students and Fees.âFifteen or more qualified students are required for a credit class, although under certain circumstances a class may be organized for a smaller number, as, for example, when an advanced course is desired. The fee is $10.00 per session-hour course. Subjects Offered in Extension Credit Courses.âCultural courses are emphasized by the Division but student participation in the choice of subject is encouraged. Courses requiring laboratory work, with a single exception, are not offered. CoÃ¶peration With Other Virginia Colleges.âThe University with its resident faculty cannot alone meet all of the requests for Extension credit courses. Rather than employ a special Extension faculty, it has asked the coÃ¶peration of other higher educational institutions in Virginia in taking this form of instruction to the people of the State. The University is responsible for administrative procedure and general supervision while the several colleges and universities assist in providing instruction. A more satisfactory geographical distribution of Extension instructors results. The universities and colleges now coÃ¶perating with the Extension Division, in the order in which coÃ¶perative agreements were made, are as follows: Roanoke College, Washington and Lee University, Farmville State Teachers College, Harrisonburg State Teachers College, Fredericksburg State Teachers College, Randolph-Macon College, Sweet Briar College, Randolph-Macon Woman's College, Hampden-Sydney College, Emory and Henry College, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute. Extension Teaching Centers.âThe Extension Division maintains, in addition to offices at the University, local offices in centers in the state from which the work in the cities or sections represented can best be carried forward. These centers with addresses are as follows: Richmond Center, Franklin and Shafer Streets, Richmond. Roanoke Center, Boxley Building, Roanoke. Lynchburg Center, E. C. Glass High School, Lynchburg. Petersburg Center, Chamber of Commerce Building, Petersburg. Danville Center, Averett College, Danville. Home Study Courses.âFifteen full courses (including forty-five term courses) carrying degree credit are offered by home study. The courses are prepared and conducted only by regular members of the University of Virginia faculty. The courses are the equivalent of similar courses given in residence. Prerequisites and general requirements are the same for the home study courses as for the corresponding courses offered in the University. The final examination in a full three-term course must be taken at the University. Fees.âThe fee for a term course is $10. For a full three-term course, the fee is $28. Books are rented at nominal rates through the Extension Library. Informal (non-credit) Instruction.âInformal instruction is carried forward by means of forums, lectures, conferences and reading courses. Neither method leads to credit toward University degrees. Forums, Lecture Courses and Conferences bring together teachers and mature men and women who are interested in discussing and studying together, usually informally, some subject or problem. The Division's chief interest is in social and cultural subjects although opportunity for student choice of subject is furnished. These methods are valuable in reaching on a high level many adults who are not interested in a form of instruction developed especially for college students and designed to lead to academic credit. Forums or lectures in such cases are usually in series of from six to fifteen in number and at weekly intervals. Often conferences meet daily for shorter periods. Organization requirements as to enrollment, numbers of lectures, fees, etc., are adjusted in accordance with the peculiar demands or conditions under which each course is conducted. Directed Reading Courses are less formal in character than home study courses. The outlines are prepared by recognized authorities in the several fields and are simply guides to systematic reading. Courses are offered to extend educational opportunities to men and women in all walks of life denied the advantages of or uninterested in formal instruction. Courses are in a variety of subjects in cultural, scientific, professional and vocational fields. Courses are $4.00 each for those who desire to submit papers for criticisms. They are $0.25 each for those who desire the outlines only as guides to independent study. II. Educational Aids Extension Library.âThe Division lends by mail under prescribed regulations, and with certain limitations, books from the University, Extension and departmental libraries for nominal costs of postage and packing. Emphasis is on the loan of the best current books, although provision is made for a wide range of interest. Lists of books available for loan are sent free upon request. Assistance is also furnished in assembling information and reference material on subjects of current interest for use by individuals or organizations requesting such data. Radio and Newspaper Book Reviews.âClosely associated with the library extension work is that of the weekly reviews of current books, selected on the basis of merit, by members of the University and associated faculties over the WRVA broadcasting station in Richmond, Virginia. The Division conducts the reviews in coÃ¶peration with the Virginia Quarterly Review. The reviews are fifteen minutes in length and are broadcast every Tuesday at 6:45 P. M. Only seven omissions have occurred since the weekly talks were begun on November 13, 1928; both in duration and continuity the reviews are unique in radio broadcasting. The purpose of the reviews is to give a critical opinion of a selected number of the best current books. Special reviews in two forms, a long article dealing with one book and a brief discussion of several books, are furnished to the newspapers of the state which request them for publication in their book or feature sections. All books reviewed are loaned upon request by the Extension Library. Publications.âFor the purpose of carrying the results of research, study and investigation of members of the University faculty to as many people as possible, the Extension Division publishes each year a number of bulletins on a variety of subjects. Many are for free distribution, while for others a small fee is charged to cover the cost of printing. Aside from a portion of those studies that are distributed without cost, bulletins are sent only on request. These publications are accumulative in character, and the results of approximately one hundred studies or reports are now available. Bureau of School and Community Drama.âThe Bureau of School and Community Drama has as its immediate purpose assistance in the selection of suitable plays for schools and community organizations. It also offers help in the actual production or staging of plays. Visual Aids.âAs a result of donations largely, the Extension Division has available for loan to schools, churches and other educational organizations in the state, educational films, slides and prints. The films and slides are principally on historical subjects and were prepared to supplement classroom instruction in History. The prints are chiefly reproductions of famous paintings or works of art and were designed to bring to the smaller and more isolated communities good color prints that would convey some idea of the beauty inherent in the great masterpieces of some of the world's leading artists. The Division is at present coÃ¶perating with Southern Art Projects, an organization sponsoring art in the South, in circulating exhibitions of original paintings, including oils, water colors, etchings, in communities throughout the state. Lectures on art by leading artists are offered also. III. CoÃ¶perative Activities School Relations.âThe work of this bureau is concerned primarily in assisting the high school officials of the state in the conduct for educational purposes of inter-scholastic literary and athletic contests. Certain contests culminate annually in a final state meet at the University held usually in May. Theoretically at least those exhibiting the highest literary and athletic talents come together to match wits and skills. Medical Extension.âThe Extension Division coÃ¶perates with the Medical Society of Virginia in administering under its Department of Clinical and Medical Education an extension program in the field of medical education. For over two years interest was centered on instruction in the subject of prenatal and postnatal care. For this purpose a full-time instructor was retained who gave lectures and conducted clinics in numerous centers throughout the state. For the current year the subject of pediatrics is being emphasized. Special clinicians for brief periods are being engaged. The purpose is to enlarge the fields of interest and to give similar instruction in other subjects. The Division also coÃ¶perates with the Department of Medicine of the University of Virginia in announcing postgraduate clinics for practicing physicians conducted at the University of Virginia. Aids to Teachers of Adults.âWith the increased interest and attention to adult education there has come a demand from teachers of adults for advice and assistance with regard to methods and materials to be used. Advice is offered on these subjects and, when available, materials are loaned. More complete announcements concerning each of the above services will be sent free upon request.</field>

The grant extended over a five-year period, $27,500 becoming available each of the years from July 1, 1926, through June 30, 1931. At the close of the first five-year period the grant was renewed by the Rockefeller Foundation for another five years, contingent upon an increasing support pledged by the University from its budget. This was met in a sufficiently adequate manner, in spite of the unusual stress caused by the economic depression, so that in the fall of 1934 the Rockefeller Foundation made a third grant for a five-year period (1935-1940) which has enabled the Institute to become definitely assured of its permanence as a part of the life of the University. The work under the provisions of the grant has been organized as an Institute for Research in the Social Sciences. The President of the University, the members of the University faculty of professional rank in the schools of History, Economics, Government, Jurisprudence, Philosophy, Psychology, Rural Social Economics, and Sociology, and the employed personnel constitute the membership of the Institute. As outlined in the resolutions which were adopted by the Institute, "the duty of this Institute shall be to promote research effort, both individual and group, in the Social Sciences at the University of Virginiaâat the outset primarily in the field of Virginia problems. It shall further be the function of the Institute to consider any matter that concerns the development of the Social Sciences in the University of Virginia, making recommendations thereon to the President of the University." Social Science Building.âThe Institute is housed in one of the original Jefferson buildings of the University formerly known as the Old Medical Building. The interior of the structure has been repaired and put in condition for the activities of the Institute. Provision is made for office space and equipment for the research workers, and also a general office has been set up where supplies and secretarial assistance are provided. Scope of Research Effort.âThe grant to the University of Virginia has been utilized primarily for research into a number of vital economic and social problems in the life of the State. It has chosen this field for two reasons. First, because Virginia is in a changing period in its history, and needs full light on its problems to direct as wisely as possible the current of transition. And secondly, the University of Virginia realizes that it is a State University and desires to relate itself more and more intimately with the people and the life of the State in general, feeling that such a relationship will be mutually beneficial. However, the work of the Institute has not been limited to the field of Virginia problems but provision has been made in a number of cases for scholarly research in the broader phases of social science research without respect to geographical boundaries. The research in the Institute is carried on as the professor's own research project assisted by well-trained research workers. The plan has been to limit the number of problems to be studied, and to do these thoroughly, and in a way that will make the investigations of an immediate or ultimate usefulness in the life of the State, as well as constituting contributions to the broader field of social science research. A definite portion of the grant is allotted for the publication of the studies when completed.

Abernethy, Associate Professor of History The value and extent of the public lands rendered this one of the most important questions dealt with by the legislatures of the Revolutionary and Early Republican periods. The statutes passed in this connection throw unimpeachable light upon the struggle between democracy and privilege which went on in the new States. Speculations, sponsored by individuals or chartered land companies, often give an insight into important political situations and the motives of public officials. It is with the hope of discovering some of the secret springs of Virginian politics during this important period that the study of the land question is undertaken. 2. Experimental Study of Human Instincts By Wayne Dennis, Assistant Professor of Psychology. In spite of an enormous literature concerning human instincts, practically the only experimental investigations of instinctive human responses are those of Watson. These studies were limited to infants so young that many instinctive responses may have been as yet undeveloped. The present project will utilize older subjects. The difficulty of making certain that the responses to be observed, such as responses to strangers, to animals, to the sea, etc., have not been influenced by training will be met by a careful selection of subjects from among hospitalized children, institutionalized children, and children from isolated communities. When techniques are developed and a general knowledge of instinctive responses acquired, the problem can be widened to include a comparison of racial and social groups. 3. Scientific Interests in the Old South By T. Cary Johnson, Jr., Associate Professor of History. In working up this project an attempt will be made to answer, among others, such questions as the following: What was the effect of the agricultural philosophies of Jefferson's day, with their all-embracing interests, in stimulating a genuine enthusiasm for science? Did the achievements in some special field by Southerners, as for instance in geology by LeConte, or in hydrography by Maury, or in ornithology by Audubon, or in anesthetics by Long, develop from this earlier scientific curiosity by any discernible process of differentiation? How widespread was this curiosity in regard to natural phenomena? What effect did it have on schools and colleges? And what effect on ante-bellum religious beliefs? What were its contributions to material well-being in the form of useful inventions? What part did Southerners play in preparing for the Industrial Era and in bringing about the Machine Age? These are some of the questions to be answered in a volume of moderate size. 4. The Executive Power in Virginia By G. W. Spicer, Associate Professor of Political Science. In this study the development of the office of Governor of Virginia will be traced through its various stages, and a critical estimate given of the desirability of the changes which it has undergone. Finally, special emphasis will be given to the present status of this office in its relation to the legislative function, the judicial function, the administrative function, political leadership, etc. In short, the object of this study will be to tell in a critical manner, the story of the government of Virginia as it revolves about the office of the Governor. 5. Guide to Manuscript Sources and Collections in Virginia By Lester J. Cappon, Archivist and Research Associate in History. The need of a guide to manuscripts in Virginia, to bring to light for the research student materials hitherto unknown in libraries, government offices, and in private hands, led to the inception of this project to make a State-wide inventory of all original records available or which can be made accessible. This survey includes detailed lists of records in the State, county, and city archives, in college and university libraries, and in historical societies; also the original record books and papers of business houses, churches and lodges, schools, banks, public utilities, and other organizations. The survey also includes a list of Virginia newspaper files throughout the State. A card index by county is kept so that the information can be re-organized later for publication. In addition to the survey, the archivist is collecting manuscripts for the Library of the University where they are cataloged and filed for research work. 6. The Institutionalization in Roanoke, Virginia By Floyd N. House, Professor of Sociology, Frank W. Hoffer, Associate Professor of Sociology, and Dorothy Hayens Wheeler, Research Assistant in Sociology. This study is a unit of a comprehensive and thorough social study of the community of Roanoke and environs, which the authors are planning to make, and which will present a concrete and realistic picture of the social and cultural life of the people of Roanoke, and of the various social classes and smaller groups of which the community as a whole is composed. It is planned to focus the comprehensive study around three major topics: (1) the ecology of the communityâ the spatial distribution of population and institutions, and trends of change in that distributionâsuburban expansion, development of outlying sub-centers, and the like; (2) the history and functioning of institutionsâschools, churches, welfare agencies, governmental institutions, business institutions, and the many other institutionalized forms of social life which develop in a community the size of Roanoke; (3) the nature and trend of cultural life. 7. Economic Theory in the Crucible By Abraham Berglund, Professor of Commerce and Business Administration and William H. Wandel, Research Associate in Economic Theory. The study of Economic Theory in the Crucible is proceeding along the line of making a close analytical and comparative inquiry into the doctrines of leading economists, both academic and lay, of the last quarter century. The analysis includes a consideration of the scope of the scientific field adopted or assumed by these economists, their approaches and methods, their assumptions and postulates with some notes as to the validity of these, and their conceptions of value and distribution. The comparisons are drawn to discover whatever unity may exist either in doctrines, in emphasis, or in divergence from the more conventional theory, conventional theory being taken to signify not the use of a standard but merely the recognition of the existence of certain fairly well defined schools: the Classical and the Austrian. 8. History of Taxation in Virginia Since 1776 By Tipton R. Snavely, Professor of Economics, and Emory Q. Hawk, Research Associate in Economics. The purpose of this study is to give a factual account and interpretation of the development of taxation in Virginia from the end of the Colonial Period. Some forty years ago, Professor William Z. Ripley, of Harvard University, published a financial history of Virginia from the beginning of the Colony to the year 1776. A similar study has not been published for the subsequent period, although it has long been evident that there is urgent need to bring the history of taxation down to date. Dr. William H. Stauffer, economist for the Virginia State Tax Department, recently published a volume bearing upon current aspects of taxation in the State, but no treatise exists covering the period from 1776 to the appearance of Dr. Stauffer's monograph. 9. The Supervision and Control of Virginia State Banks By Allan G. de Gruchy, Research Associate in Commerce. One of Virginia's important economic problems is the proper control of her banking system, and it is the purpose of this investigation to indicate where it is possible to improve the present system of State bank supervision. The investigation falls into three divisions: 1. historical background; 2. analysis of the legal status of State bank supervision; 3. present system of State bank supervision in Virginia. The conclusion is reached that State banking in Virginia is still largely uncontrolled banking. In the hope of instituting a more satisfactory control of the State banking system, the writer will offer a number of suggestions which would materially strengthen Virginia's system of supervising and controlling the State banks. 10. Roanoke: A Study in Population By Frank W. Hoffer, Associate Professor of Sociology, and Floyd N. House, Professor of Sociology. During the next few years there will be prepared a number of semi-separate studies of social conditions in Roanoke, Virginia. Among these contemplated studies are the following: (1) a detailed study of the population of Roanoke by census tracts and other areas, and of the history of the natural areas of the city; (2) the nature and trend of cultural life in Roanoke; (3) the care of the aged in Roanoke; (4) divorce and family disorganization in Roanoke; (5) a statistical study, supplemented by some analysis of individual cases, of the post-school careers of Roanoke high school students of the years 1920-24; and (6) a study of crime and delinquency in Roanoke. 11. A History of the Classical World By Stringfellow Barr, Professor of History. It is proposed to write this study on the hypothesis that the classical culture which sprang from the worship of the Olympian deities, developed in Greece after the Dorian invasions, reached its cultural height in Periclean Athens, was taken over by the Roman Republic and spread by that Republic and by the Roman Empire throughout western Europe, coming to an end in the west with the barbarian invasions, should be treated as a unit. This, no historian has attempted to do to the present time. 12. History of the Southern Iron Industry, Especially Since 1865 By Lester J. Cappon, Acting Assistant Professor of History. An interpretation of the iron industry from the point of view of the significant part it has played in the development of the so-called "New South." 13. Parliamentary Government in France, Its History, Theory and Practice By R. K. Gooch, Professor of Political Science. It is at present a commonplace that democratic government is seriously on trial and that its defenses which remain among the great powers are to be found in France, in Great Britain, and in the United States. Where democratic government has been overthrown or most bitterly attacked, it had existed in the parliamentary form. Moreover, such governments, as is in general true in Europe, took the form of the French variant of the parliamentary system rather than the classic or English form. Almost the only serious study of parliamentary government in general, that of an Alsatian scholar, denominates the French variant parliamentary government "in its inauthentic form" and the English parliamentary government "in its true form." During the crisis of last year, M. Doumergue made serious proposals for the constitutional changes calculated to make the French system as nearly like the English as possible. Contrary to expectations, the reforms failed of acceptance. The political forces which caused existing French institutions to persist are almost certainly forces which are interconnected with the nature of these institutions and their vast influence in the world. These institutions and forces undoubtedly deserve searching study. Moreover, they clearly can be understood only in proper historical perspective. 14. Influence of the Newspaper Press on Anglo-German Relations, 18901914 By Oron J. Hale, Assistant Professor of History. The object of this study is to estimate the significance of the newspaper press in transforming the friendly relations existing between these two Powers in 1890, into a state of chronic hostility, which characterized their public relations after the turn of the century. The questions of naval rivalry, economic rivalry, and political opposition have been intensively investigated, but no adequate or even cursory examination of the rÃ´le played by the press has been undertaken until now. 15. The Influence of the Depression upon National Economic Policy in the United States. By D. C. Hyde, Associate Professor of Economics. There is a general feeling that the present depression will leave a permanent mark upon the evolution of national economic policy in the United States. The attitude of individuals on this question seems to be inevitably coloured by their economic faith and background. At a time when emergency measures seem to be giving place to more permanent policies it is considered well to undertake an impartial investigation into the nature of the changes in policy during the last five years. 16. The Effects of the Separation of Tax Sources in Virginia By Tipton R. Snavely, Professor of Economics, and J. J. Corson, III, Research Associate in Economics. The purpose of this study is to make an investigation of the results, both to the State and the localities, of the Byrd Plan of Tax Revision in Virginia. It is desired to make a statistical inquiry concerning the amounts of revenue lost and gained to the State government, as well as to the local subdivisions, under the law which segregates real estate and tangible personal property to the localities. It is believed that sufficient time has elapsed since the segregation plan in Virginia was established to permit objective inquiry into its general effects. 17. The Rationalization of Electricity Supply in Great Britain By Melvin G. de Chazeau, Associate Professor of Commerce and Business Administration. This study will attempt to evaluate the effects of the British scheme on production costs, prices to consumers, and the use of electricity by industry, farms and domestic consumers. Also it will ascertain whether the planâprivate ownership of generating stations, with public control of their operation and extension, and private ownership and operation of distributing organizationsâhas been able to overcome the problems inherent in that relationship. 18. Cocke of Bremo: A Plantation Puritan By Armistead C. Gordon, Jr., Associate Professor of English. This biographical study of John Hartwell Cocke, who was associated with Thomas Jefferson in the founding of the University of Virginia will reconstruct a portrait of the versatile planter against the background of a Piedmont Virginia plantation throughout the first two-thirds of the 19th centuryâthe period of his mature career. 19. Pre-Cultural Elements in Human Behavior By Wayne Dennis, Assistant Professor of Psychology. An account of human responses and tendencies as they exist prior to attempts to make them conform to a particular culture. Evidence will come in the main from deaf-blind cases, from children reared in partial isolation such as Caspar Hauser, the Savage of Aveyron and other "wild children," from diary accounts of child development which have been kept by individual observers, and from recent experimental studies including those conducted by the author with the aid of the Institute.</field>

These were located as follows: General Library 137,648 volumes Department Libraries: Education 12,329 volumes Engineering 5,356 volumes Graduate 2,045 volumes Law 28,349 volumes Medicine 14,580 volumes School Libraries and Other Collections 48,273 volumes 248,580 volumes These figures do not include unbound material. The various libraries were receiving on July 1, 1935, a total of 1,680 current serials (exclusive of the Law Library); and the number of periodicals represented by back files, often incomplete, was over 3,000. HOURS OF OPENING, GENERAL LIBRARY During the regular session the General Library is open on week days from 9:00 A. M. to 10:30 P. M. and on Sundays from 2:30 to 10:30 P. M. Through the examination periods the closing time is midnight. During the Summer Quarter the week day hours are 8:30 A. M. to 9:30 P. M. and the Sunday hours are 2:00 to 4:00 P. M. During vacations the open hours on week days are from 9:00 A. M. to 1:00 P. M. The General Library is closed on New Year's Day, Founder's Day, the Fourth of July, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas, and on Sundays in vacation periods. LOAN OF BOOKS, GENERAL LIBRARY All books may be used within the reading rooms. Books may be borrowed for use outside of the General Library by (1) members of the University; (2) former officers and professors who are residing at the University; and (3) card holders. Cards are issued to residents of Charlottesville and vicinity and to visitors to the University who are introduced in writing by a member of the faculty who is of professorial rank and who is not a member of the library staff. Loans outside of Charlottesville or vicinity may also be made by inter-library loan through a local library or by arrangement with the Extension Division of the University. Reference books, rare books (including genealogical works), and current numbers of magazines are not loaned out of the general library. Certain rare editions which are desired for reading in connection with university courses may be loaned on receipt of written request from the Professor in charge of the course. Books reserved for collateral reading may be borrowed for over night use one-half hour before the closing the the library. Reserved books are not to be removed from the reading room at other times unless written permission has been granted by the Professor for whom the books have been reserved. The rules for checking of reserved books are as follows: 1. Each reserved book must be checked out in the name of the person who has it. 2. A reserved book must be checked in at the desk when, for whatever reason, the person who has it leaves the library. 3. Reserved books which are to be taken out for overnight use must be checked out at the desk at ten o'clock or shortly thereafter, the due date to be written both on the card and in the back of the book. During vacations between terms students may borrow books up to the number of five by leaving a money deposit with the circulation librarians. Books borrowed by members of the faculty of professorial rank or by instructors who are not taking graduate courses are subject to return on request by the librarians; all such loans should be returned before the first of June of each year, and records previous to that date should be cleared before further borrowing of books. Books borrowed by registered graduate students, candidates for final honors, hospital internes, and qualified non-student employees of the University are loaned for the current term, on the understanding that they may be recalled when needed by other readers. The records of each term should be cleared before borrowing is resumed on the following term. All other loans are for periods of two weeks or less, the date of return being indicated on the slip within the back cover of the book. The borrower should examine this date in each case, since at the end of each term the period of loan is shortened and during the summer quarter the regular period is one week. All except professorial loans are subject to fines of ten cents a day for late return, and also to the replacement cost of the book for loss or defacement. On reserved books there is a fine of ten cents an hour but not to exceed twenty-five cents for the first day, and fines of twenty-five cents a day for each succeeding day or part of day. A fine of twenty-five cents is imposed for each violation of the rule for checking out of reserved books. The maximum fines are three dollars for an ordinary loan and five dollars for the loan of a reserved book. Further accumulation of fines ceases as soon as the loss of a book is reported. If any fines remain unpaid for fifteen days after the date on which they are due, the Librarian shall, by resolution of the Rector and Visitors, notify the Dean of the Department in which the student is entered, and such student shall by him be required to cease his privileges as a student until the library account has been satisfactorily settled. Credits are withheld, further registration is not permitted, and no degrees are conferred until such accounts have been cleared.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">STUDENT ACTIVITIES JEFFERSON SOCIETY Connected with the University is the Jefferson Society founded in 1825 to provide for common improvement in debate, to promote general culture among its members and the student body, and to drill its members in all those exercises which strengthen for the free duties of citizenship. All students in regular attendance upon one or more of the schools of the University of Virginia who are not members of any similar organization in this institution shall be eligible to regular membership. Such candidates shall make written applications on forms provided by the Membership Committee. These forms may be obtained at any of the literary meetings of the Society, all of which are open to the public. They are announced in College Topics. PUBLICATIONS College Topics is a tri-weekly newspaper published by the students and devoted to the interests of the University at large. Corks and Curls is the University Annual, its aim being to present some record of the scholastic, religious, athletic and social activities of the college year. Its publication is in the hands of a chartered corporation formed by the fraternities and literary societies of the University. The Virginia Law Review is a journal devoted to the discussion of general questions of American jurisprudence published monthly from October to May, inclusive, by the students of the Law Department. The University of Virginia Magazine is a literary journal published seven times a year by students and is sponsored by the Jefferson Society. STUDENT UNION The Student Union was organized in 1932. The University has taken over Madison Hall for use as a center of student activities under the supervision of the Union of which all students are considered members. The affairs of the Union are conducted by the Student Senate. Facilities are offered for meetings of student organizations and groups and a social program is carried forward throughout the session. In the reading room are newspapers from many of the cities in the South and East. Recreation rooms are also provided. Offices of College Topics, the Magazine, Corks and Curls, the Dulaney Memorial Library and the Student Self Help Bureau are located in the building. WOMAN'S SELF-GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION The Association includes all women students of the University of Virginia, and exists to bring about a greater unity and mutual helpfulness among the women of the University, and to promote and maintain the highest standards of University life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RELIGIOUS WORK YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION, INCORPORATED William Norris Leonard President Paschal Dupuy Fowlkes Vice-President Page Bowie Clagett Recording Secretary Elmer Irving Carruthers Treasurer William Kyle Smith General Secretary William Royall Smithey Chairman, Board of Directors History.âThe Young Men's Christian Association of the University of Virginia which has its headquarters on the second floor of Madison Hall was founded October 12, 1858, during the period of the University's expansion and reformation. Bruce, in his "History of the University of Virginia," states: "The spirit of reformation was expressed in (1) the abolition of the uniform law, and also the law that required the students to leave their beds at dawn; (2) the adoption of the Honor System; (3) and the organization of the Young Men's Christian Association." It was the first college to adopt the constitution of the Y. M. C. A., and thus has the honor of being the oldest college association in the world. Object.âThe object of this Association, as set forth generally in the Charter, is more specifically stated as follows:â to foster and promote Christian fellowship among the students of the University of Virginia by encouraging their participation in religious activities; by provoking their serious thought on great moral and religious issues; by inculcating in them the spirit of service; and by providing for them, and increasing their appreciation of, social entertainment of a wholesome and beneficial nature. Work.âThe Association affords opportunity for voluntary study of the Bible and also of problems of national and international interest, particularly with reference to the possibility of solution by the fundamental principles of Christianity. Discussion groups are addressed by prominent men and faculty members conduct regularly increasing numbers of special groups as interests are developed. Members of the Association work with the Boy Scout troops and cooperate with community agencies in other forms of welfare work. Under the Deputation Committee, student leaders and groups of students visit various preparatory and high schools in the State to conduct religious meetings, and they also carry on evangelistic campaigns in various communities throughout the State. Handbooks and student directories to the number of more than 2,000 are distributed each fall. Various conferences are attended by delegated representatives from the Association both in the State and outside when possible. Equipment.âThrough the munificence of Mrs. William E. Dodge and family, of New York City, the Association possesses a very handsome building, which was erected in 1905, at a cost, including furnishings, of about $80,000, and which is maintained in part by an endowment of over $16,000, subscribed by students, alumni, and friends of the University. This building, called "Madison Hall" in honor of President Madison, who was intimately connected with the early history of the University, faces the north front of the Rotunda. The budget for the support of the Association work is supplied by the income from a small endowment, the Chapel fund and rents. THE UNIVERSITY CHAPEL The handsome Gothic chapel was erected upon the University grounds by the voluntary gifts of students, alumni, members of the faculty and other friends.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ATHLETICS Norton Goodier Pritchett Director James Glenn Driver Graduate Manager Thomas Moore Carruthers Treasurer It is the objective of the University to offer every student an opportunity to engage in sports according to individual interest and ability. Many intramural activities are supported enthusiastically by students who find therein stimulating contacts, exercise, and associations that might otherwise be denied them. The University is represented in intercollegiate athletics by both varsity and first-year teams in football, baseball, basketball, track, boxing, tennis, golf and swimming. Its athletic plant is one of the finest in the South. Memorial Gymnasium contains three basketball courts, a swimming pool, a running track, boxing and wrestling rooms, and adequate locker facilities, in addition to equipment necessary to gymnastic training. Scott Stadium, which seats 22,000 spectators, is considered one of the most beautiful in the country. Lambeth Field has excellent facilities for baseball and track. Twenty-two tennis courts and four intramural fields are located near Memorial Gymnasium. All intercollegiate athletics, physical education activities, and intramural sports are under the supervision of the Director of Athletics and Physical Education, who is responsible under the President for the administration of the entire sports program of the University. An Athletic Council (the 3-3-3) composed of three faculty representatives, three representatives of the Alumni Association, and three student representatives, serves in an official advisory capacity in the administration of athletics. At least four meetings of this Council are held each year. The University of Virginia is a member of the Southern Conference. (Extracts from the By-Laws of the Southern Conference) Article VII.
