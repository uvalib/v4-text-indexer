(1930) Critic Teacher in Mathematics MARGARET PAGE, Normal Diploma, Farmville State Teachers College, Teacher in Simeon Experimental Rural School MOLLIE B. WHITLOCK, Normal Diploma, University of Virginia Summer Quarter Teacher in Liberty Experimental Rural School HISTORY The Curry Memorial School of Education was founded in 1905 as one of the academic schools of the University. It was endowed by gifts of $100,000 from John D. Rockefeller and $50,000 from the General Education Board, and was named in honor of Dr. J. L. M. Curry, the Southern educator. There were originally two professionships in the School, the Curry Memorial Professorship of Education and the Professorship of Secondary Education. In 1914 a chair of Educational Psychology and Principles of Teaching was added to the School, and two years later a Professorship of School Administration was established. In 1919 the School was organized into a Department of the University, with four professorships, and was placed upon a professional basis similar to that of the Departments of Law, Medicine and Engineering. The relation of the Department of Education to the various academic schools of the University remains close, however, since the academic training of students of Education is obtained in the academic schools, and courses in Education are credited toward the academic degrees. In the spring of 1928 plans were matured to provide more adequate facilities for observation, practice teaching, and experimental studies. The school authorities of the City of Charlottesville and the County of Albemarle joined with the University of Virginia in establishing a program of experimental education and teacher-training. After the preliminary program of organization had been approved, the General Education Board of New York City granted to the University a subsidy of $20,000 a year for a period of two years to forward the program and make possible its operation for the session of 1928-29. The Rector and Visitors of the University made a supplementary appropriation of $5,000 annually for a period of two years, thereby giving the Department additional funds amounting to $50,000 for the biennium, 1928-1930. PURPOSE The rapid development of educational science and practice has made it necessary that ample provision be made for the professional training of those who expect to teach or to administer school affairs. The Department of Education, therefore, aims to provide the following: 1. An opportunity for the study of Education as an important function of society. 2. To give the necessary technical training for teaching and administration to: a. University students, with or without experience, who intend to teach; b. Secondary school principals; c. Normal school teachers and administrators; d. College teachers of Education; e. School superintendents, supervisors, and other executives of schools of all grades in cities, counties, and states. 3. To develop scientific methods of testing school work and to furnish demonstrations of the way in which these methods may best be applied, thus developing a spirit of observation and experimentation tending to increase our knowledge of the science and art of education. 4. To become a center of educational influence to which teachers of all grades and kinds may come for information and educational guidance. 5. To furnish to the general public information on any phase of school organization, administration, and supervision, thus helping to create a clearer general understanding about Education and the State. PEABODY HALL Peabody Hall, the Education Building, was named in honor of George Peabody, who in 1867 made his great gift to the cause of education in the South. The building was made possible through a gift of $40,000 from the trustees of the Peabody Education Fund. This amount was supplemented by an appropriation of $12,000 from the Rector and Visitors of the University. The building was completed in 1912, and is the home of the Curry Memorial Department of Education. The plans were drawn by a modern school architect, and approved by some of the leading authorities on school architecture in this country. It is, therefore, a model of excellence in this regard. It is one of the best equipped buildings in the University, and has ample classroom and laboratory facilities, and an excellent auditorium equipped with a modern motion picture machine. Modern requirements in heating, lighting and ventilation are exemplified in its construction without sacrificing conformity to the general style of classic architecture prevailing in the University. Adequate provision is made for a Departmental library, seminar rooms, classrooms, psychological laboratory, and offices for the administrative officers and teaching staff of the Department. THE HECK MEMORIAL LIBRARY The Department of Education maintains its own library in Peabody Hall, named in honor of the first professor of Education in the University, the late Professor William Harry Heck. The library was made possible through the gift by Mrs. Anna Tuttle Heck of Professor Heck's private library containing approximately 2,000 well-selected books on Education, and the transfer of all books on Education from the General Library of the University. Splendid equipment was procured through a gift of money from students in Education, the Education Club and friends of Professor Heck. A gift of $3,000 from Mr. Alfred W. Erickson of New York City has enabled the Department so to strengthen its professional library as to offer very superior facilities to its rapidly growing student body, by making possible the enrichment of every course now offered. At present the library consists of several thousand select books covering most fields of Education, a complete file of publications of the United States Bureau of Education, various national, state and foreign documents, state school laws, annual reports of state superintendents of public instruction, city superintendents' reports, etc. Files of the leading educational magazines are available for free use of the students. Exhibits of elementary and high school texts for comparative studies are made available through the generosity of various publishers. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Requirements for the Admission of Men.âTo be admitted to regular standing in the Department of Education, men must have satisfied the entrance requirements of the College. Students who have decided to enter the teaching profession at the time of entering the University should register with the Dean of the Department of Education in order to be advised in planning their curricula. Holders of State Teachers' Scholarships are required to register in the Department of Education. Requirements for the Admission of Women.âTo be admitted to regular standing in the Department of Education, women must be twenty years of age, must meet the entrance requirements of the University and must have completed two years of college work aggregating 30 session-hours in academic subjects. Candidates not able to meet these requirements may make up their deficiencies during the Summer Quarter. All women students must first register at the office of the Dean of Women, 20 East Lawn. Women planning to enter the Department of Education after completing the two years of work required for admission should choose, during the two years, courses corresponding to the University courses recommended for students at the University during the same period. The Dean will welcome conferences with such students before they begin training elsewhere. Special Students.â(a) Graduates of colleges and universities other than the University of Virginia, desiring to secure the necessary professional training to qualify for the Collegiate Professional Certificate, may register in the Department of Education and upon completion of the required professional courses receive a certificate which will entitle them to the Collegiate Professional Certificate issued by the State Department of Education. (b) Men may be admitted as special students without fulfilling the entrance requirements above specified, provided that, if they are Virginians, they are more than twenty years old or, if they are not Virginians, they are more than twenty-three years old, on the day of registration, and give adequate evidence of serious purpose and of the training needed to pursue with profit the courses for which they are registered. No special student may be a candidate for a degree; but such students are permitted and encouraged to make up deficiencies by private study or by taking courses in the Summer Quarter. They will then be admitted as regular students, and may be accepted as applicants for degrees, provided all entrance requirements are met at least one academic year before the date of graduation. An applicant who has regularly attended a secondary school until he is twenty years of age without, because of failure, obtaining credit for 15 acceptable entrance units, will not be accepted as a special student. (c) Women, twenty-five years of age, giving satisfactory evidence that they are qualified to pursue courses in Education successfully, may be admitted as special students, even though they fail to show credit for the 30 session-hours of academic work required of women for admission to regular standing. Advanced Standing is given to any candidate who, in addition to meeting the minimum requirements for entrance above stated, can show by passing an examination given sometime during the first month of his first session that he has done work equivalent to that covered by any of the following courses offered in the college: Latin A1, Greek A1, Greek A2, English A1 or A2, Mathematics A1, German A1, French A1, Spanish A1, Italian A1. Candidates who apply for examination for advanced standing must present a special certificate showing that the full content of the course, on which advanced standing is sought, has been covered in a systematic manner in the preparatory school, and in addition must present the specific recommendation of the principal of the school that the candidate be admitted to the advanced standing examination in question. College Credit.âCandidates who desire credit for work done at other colleges, must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students, and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the department a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college, must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate, and must give his grades. The final validation of such certificates is effected by the successful completion of not less than 12 session-hours of work during his first session. In no case will credit be given on more than 45 session-hours of work done elsewhere, and any candidate who receives this maximum amount of credit can count among the remaining 15 session-hours required for his degree only the credit value of the courses he has passed as a resident student in the College of Arts and Sciences, exclusive of any credit for work done in the Summer Quarter or in any of the professional departments. In every case the candidate must spend the last session of his candidacy, which must be a regular session of nine months, exclusively in college work in this University; and the courses offered as Major Electives must all have been completed in residence in this University. A maximum of 15 session-hours may be granted for one year of college work, and 33 hours for two years. In general, credit will not be granted for work completed elsewhere with the lowest passing grade, if the grades are given as letters, or with a grade below 75 per cent., if the grades are given as percentages. Conditioned Students.âA candidate for entrance must offer 15 units as defined by the Southern Commission on Accredited Schools. At least 13 of the units offered must be included in the list of units accepted for admission on page 10. A student who, while able to offer 15 units, cannot offer 15 units as defined in this list, may be conditioned on any 2 units not including English A, B, or C, or Mathematics A1. All conditions should be absolved before the beginning of the session following initial registration. This may be done by passing entrance examinations or by passing equivalent courses in the Summer Quarter. But no course taken to remove a condition may be counted as part of the work credited toward a degree. No conditioned student may be awarded a degree until his entrance conditions are absolved, nor may he be later registered as a special student. GRADUATE WORK IN EDUCATION Graduate work in Education leading to the degrees of Master of Arts, Master of Science or Doctor of Philosophy may be pursued in the Department of Graduate Studies. Graduate students who choose Education as their major for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy must meet the entrance requirements of the Department of Graduate Studies, and, in addition, must pass, at least two terms prior to receiving the degree, preliminary written examinations in each of the following fields: History of Education, Educational Psychology, Educational Administration, Secondary Education, and Educational Sociology. The candidate must also pass a final oral examination upon his dissertation and the general fields of his major and minor subjects. The Department of Education offers the following graduate courses: Education C1, Advanced Educational Psychology; Education C2, Problems in School Administration; Education C3, Problems in Elementary School Supervision; Education C4, Problems in High School Administration; Education C5, Problems in High School Supervision; Education C6, Mental Measurement; Education D1, Seminar in Educational Psychology; Education D2, Seminar in School Administration; and Education D3, Seminar in Secondary Education.

This certificate must come from an accredited public high school or from an accredited private secondary school. For admission from an institution of collegiate rank, an official transcript of the applicant's record, made out on the form used by the institution in question, must be submitted. In addition, each applicant, whether from a secondary school or a college, must submit a formal application for admission, on a blank form supplied by the University. The candidate for admission from a public high school must be a full graduate of an accredited four-year high school. The candidate for admission from a private secondary school must be a full graduate of the school, or must present a certificate showing that he has completed at least the equivalent of four years of satisfactory secondary school work of standard grade, covering at least 15 entrance units. An applicant for admission from a secondary school which requires a special grade for recommendation to college must have made the grade required by his school or must have ranked in the upper three-quarters of his class. In every case an applicant must have the general recommendation of the principal of his school. The University accredits all four-year public high schools and all private secondary schools which are fully accredited by the State Board of Education of Virginia. Schools outside of Virginia which are fully accredited by their own state universities or institutions of equal rank, by their own state departments of education or by recognized regional associations of secondary schools, are also accredited by the University. Certificate credit for any entrance unit is invalidated by subsequent failure in a college entrance examination on the unit in question. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must in all cases pass the entrance examinations. ADMISSION BY EXAMINATION For admission by examination, the candidate must present himself at the University in June or in September, according to the dates given in the Program of Entrance Examinations. The examinations are held under the Honor System, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge, and they are held only on the dates given in the Program of Entrance Examinations. A fee of one dollar is charged for each examination taken. This fee is payable in advance and is in no case returned. The entrance examinations of the University are similar, in many respects, to those of the College Entrance Examination Board. The University does not furnish sample copies of its entrance examinations. Official records of the examinations of the College Entrance Examination Board or of the University of the State of New York may be submitted in lieu of taking entrance examinations here.

A session-hour is one hour a week throughout the session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week throughout the session of laboratory work. (2) Maximum and Minimum Number of Session-Hours.âEach student is required to undertake each session courses aggregating at least 15 session-hours (with the exception noted under Probation below). This number may be increased in the following cases: (I) Any first-year student may take 18 session-hours, provided he is credited with 6 session-hours of advanced standing. (II) A student not in his first year in the Department of Education may take 18 session-hours, provided he (a) has passed in the preceding session or in the third term thereof courses aggregating 15 session-hours, or (b) is in his graduating year and needs 18 session-hours for his degree. (III) A student not in his first year may take 21 session-hours provided he passed in the preceding session or in the third term thereof courses aggregating 18 session-hours. (IV) Any student whose term grade (or class grade, if the term grade is not available) for the first or second term is at least 75 per cent. in each of his courses, may take 3 additional session-hours for the ensuing term. Exceptions to the above regulations will be allowed only by special permission of the Faculty. Physical Education is not counted in the maximum and minimum requirements detailed above. (3) Grade.âThe grade of a student in any course either for a term or for the session, is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Class standing in any course is determined by the regularity of the student's attendance upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercises) of the course, and by the quality of his work, as indicated by his recitation grades, written tests, laboratory work, etc. For passing in any course in the Department of Education a grade of 75 per cent. is required. (4) Exclusion from Courses, Probation and Suspension. (I) Exclusion from Courses: 1. A student who is evidently making no real progress in a course, may, at any time during the session, be excluded from the course by the Dean upon recommendation of the instructor concerned. 2. A student whose term grade in a course is less than 50 per cent., or who discontinues the course without permission of the Dean, or who is absent without excuse from the term examination, will be excluded from the course. (II) Probation and Suspension: 1. Probation is a state of warning, involving withdrawal from the student of certain privileges enumerated below. Suspension means forced withdrawal from the Department. 2. A student will be placed on probation if, in any term, he does not pass on 6 hours of work; and, if he shall be excluded from a course or courses, he must, in order to avoid probation, pass on a number of hours 6 in excess of the number from which he is excluded. A student will be suspended if, in any term, he does not pass on 3 hours of work; and, if he shall be excluded from a course or courses, he must, in order to escape suspension, pass on a number of hours 3 in excess of the number from which he is excluded. 3. A student on probation must carry at least 12 hours of work or be suspended. A student not on probation must carry at least 15 hours of work or be placed on probation. Exception: A first-year student excluded from one course during the first term is not to be placed on probation during the rest of the term. But at the end of the term he is to be considered as having made a grade of less than 50 per cent. on the course from which he was excluded. 4. No student may remain on probation for more than two terms in his entire college course. If his record is such as to invoke probation a third time, he will be suspended. No student suspended a second time may reenter the Department. 5. No student on probation may be a member of any student organization which publicly represents the University, such as an athletic team, a musical club or a student publication. 6. Suspension, if imposed during the session, applies to the remainder of the regular session; if imposed at the end of the session, it applies to the whole of the subsequent session. 7. Probation or suspension may be absolved by the completion of 3 session-hours of work in one term of the Summer Quarter. 8. A student who is permitted to withdraw from the University during the session will be re-admitted only on probation if, at the time of his withdrawal, he was on probation. A student previously suspended will be readmitted only on probation. 9. The application of these regulations is automatic. A student may, however, appeal in writing to the Committee on Rules and Courses for relief from their application. The Committee is empowered to grant relief for just cause. (5) Absence from Examinations will not be excused except for sickness on the day of examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. A student excused from more than one-half of his term examinations on account of illness may not be a member of any student organization which publicly represents the University, such as an athletic team, a musical club, or a student publication, until he has taken his examinations. No student may remain in the Department if he misses all the examinations of two consecutive terms on account of illness. (6) Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, in accordance with (5) above, is entitled to a special examination on a date during the regular session to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge of the examination. (7) Re-Examinations.âA candidate for an academic degree who fails on only one of his courses during his final session of candidacy is entitled to a special re-examination on the work of that course before the final day, provided that he average at least 65 per cent. on the work of the three terms, and provided the professor in charge recommends that the candidate be granted a re-examination. The professor in charge is to decide whether the candidate is to stand a re-examination upon the whole course, or upon some portion or portions of the course. No fee is charged for such re-examination. It should be carefully noted that no student is entitled to more than one re-examination on a given course without repeating the course. (8) Reports.âReports are sent at the end of each term to the parent or guardian of each student. These reports indicate the number of times the student has been absent from lectures, and give his term grade on each course. The Dean will be glad at any time to furnish to the proper person a special report on any student's standing. In addition to the above, a report on the standing of each first-year student in the Department is sent to the student's parent or guardian early in November. (9) Conduct.âThe laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or anywhere else. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University for the residue of the current session every student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. The President will dismiss from the University every student convicted of public drunkenness, or of other conduct reflecting serious discredit upon the University. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The keeping of dogs by students within the University grounds is forbidden. Motor driven vehicles either owned or operated by students are prohibited from parking in the roadways and alleys of the University grounds between the hours of 8:30 a. m. and 4:30 p. m. However, students suffering from serious physical disability, or who live more than two miles outside the city limits, may be granted permits to park. (10) Voluntary Withdrawal.âVoluntary withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University as well as the consent of the student's parent or guardian, if he is a minor. Any student who withdraws without permission will be recorded as having been suspended for the residue of the current session. No student on probation may withdraw except for imperative reasons and any student on probation who withdraws without permission will be suspended, not only for the residue of the current session, but also for the whole of the subsequent session. (11) Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also Suspension, above. (12) Change of Studies.âNo change can be made in a student's program of studies except with the written consent of the Dean, together with official notification by the Registrar. No permit for change of courses will be issued after the end of the first week of each term. Any student who drops a course without permission will receive a grade of zero in that course; and no credit may be received for any portion of a course attended before formal permission has been granted as outlined above. (13) Absence from Lectures may be excused by the Dean, but only for sickness or other imperative cause. Any explanation of an absence which a student has to offer must be made in writing to the Dean within one week after the absence. But no excuse for an absence may be submitted after the beginning of an examination period. Each unexcused absence from a class exercise will cause one point to be deducted from the student's term grade. Exception: A second-year student who has credit for at least 12 but less than 27 session-hours of work is allowed one absence without penalty per term in each course. A third-year student who has credit for at least 27 but less than 42 session-hours of work is allowed two absences without penalty per term in each course. A fourth-year student who has credit for at least 42 session-hours of work is allowed three absences without penalty per term in each course. A total of more than 15 unexcused absences (in excess of absences without penalty) in any term will cause a student to be placed on probation. Probation imposed for absences is called "attendance probation," and it carries the penalties of probation imposed for failure in courses. If, in any term, a student incurs both attendance probation and probation for failure in courses, he will be suspended. No student who was, for any reason, absent from more than 50 per cent. of the lectures of a course in any term can receive a grade on the course in that term. This regulation does not apply to students on the Dean's List. The laws relating to absence from the University of members of athletic teams are found in the General Catalogue. The same regulations apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. The Dean's List.âA student who passes on not less than 15 session-hours during a session with an average of at least 85 per cent., and with no session grade less than 75 per cent., will be placed on the Dean's List, and will remain on the List as long as he receives an average of at least 85 per cent., on at least 15 session-hours per term and receives no term grade less than 75 per cent. in any course. Any student on the Dean's List failing to maintain this standard of excellence will be automatically dropped from the List. A student once dropped from the List can again make the Dean's List by meeting the above standard for entire session. A student on the Dean's List is not subject to the regulations limiting the issuance of leaves of absence from the University, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class standing, imposed for absence alone.

During the fourth, or senior year, a student's program will consist primarily of courses in the major academic group and Education B11 (b) (Directed Teaching). Students may meet the requirements of the West Law by taking Education B12 (School Hygiene and Sanitation) during any session, but it is recommended that the work be taken during the third or fourth year. TRAINING OF ELEMENTARY SUPERVISORS Students preparing for elementary school supervision must have (1) previous training equivalent to that required for the Virginia Normal Professional Certificate, and (2) at least two years of successful teaching experience in elementary schools attested by letters of recommendation from division superintendents of schools under whom the teaching was done. It is a general requirement in connection with Education B4 that students shall be present for the opening of the schools in Albemarle County for the purpose of studying the problems of school organization. The schools usually open during the first week in September. COLLEGIATE PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE Recipients of the Bachelor of Science in Education will receive the Collegiate Professional Certificate, the highest form of certificate for high school teachers issued by the State Board of Education. This certificate is valid for ten years, renewable for a similar period, and entitles the holder to teach in both high and elementary schools in Virginia. Holders of Collegiate Certificates, the certificates of second rank issued by the State Board of Education, may obtain the Collegiate Professional Certificate by attending the University one session and taking four 3 session-hour courses in Education. Curricula organized to meet the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Education fulfill both academic and professional requirements for the highest grade of professional high school certificates issued without examination by the various state departments of Education to holders of baccalaureate degrees. The graduate courses in Education are recognized in states requiring graduate study for professional certificates. TEACHERS' CERTIFICATES A resolution of the State Board of Education provides that on and after September 1, 1929, the minimum qualifications for those persons beginning to teach in an accredited high school shall be a baccalaureate degree from a standard four-year college. In accordance with the above regulations it will not be necessary after September 1, 1929, to issue to incoming teachers the Special or Junior College Certificate. The new requirement for high school teachers will not be retroactive. SUGGESTED TEACHING COMBINATIONS FOR SECONDARY TEACHERS The State Board of Education has revised the program of studies for the high schools of the State and has prepared a suggested plan for the assignment of subjects to teachers. The subject combinations recommended for which training is offered at the University of Virginia are as follows: 1. English and Foreign Language. (Latin or French.) 2. Mathematics and Science. 3. History and one of the following: English, Language, Mathematics, and Science. 4. Physical Education. It is generally recognized that the success of the revised high school program, especially that phase of it which has to do with the assignment of subjects to teachers, is dependent to a large extent upon an adequate supply of instructors trained to teach the combinations of subjects as provided for above. Students are directed in the choice of courses during their period of training to insure their meeting the requirements for at least one of the teaching combinations. COURSES FOR TEACHERS IN SERVICE Saturday courses in any subject offered in the Department of Education will be arranged at the University for teachers in service, if requested by at least five teachers. Degree credit will be allowed on the same basis as in the regular courses, provided that not more than 1Â½ session-hours' credit shall be given for the work in any course for one year. Superintendents and Teachers of Public Schools Exempt from Fees.â White male teachers and superintendents of the public schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Academic Schools of the University without payment of fees (except those charged in laboratory courses), upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the public schools of the State during the year. Applicants for admission as teachers are required to send their names to the President of the University not later than March 5. COOPERATIVE PROGRAM BETWEEN THE SCHOOL BOARD OF THE CITY OF CHARLOTTESVILLE AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Facilities for observation and directed teaching and for practical educational research are made available through the coÃ¶peration with the University of the school systems of the City of Charlottesville and the County of Albemarle. The CoÃ¶perative Teacher-Training Program entered into between the School Board of the City of Charlottesville and the University of Virginia provides for the employment of critic teachers in the following subjects: English, Latin, Mathematics, Natural Science and Social Science. The agreement as adopted includes the following regulations: 1. The critic teachers shall be chosen by the University with the approval of the superintendent of schools, it being recognized that no person may be elected by the School Board without the recommendation of the superintendent of schools. 2. The duties of the critic teachers shall be as follows: A. To teach two regular classes in the high school such as shall be agreed upon by the critic teacher, the principal of the high school and the superintendent of schools. B. To serve as critic teacher for the direction of the teaching of such student teachers as are assigned to him. C. To perform such routine duties in connection with the classes taught as would fall to the lot of any high school teacher in a city school system in Virginia. D. To conduct such experimental studies as the wisdom of the critic teacher, the principal of the high school and the superintendent of schools may deem advisable for the improvement of the school. Proposals for all such experimental studies shall originate with the Department of Education in the University of Virginia. 3. The salaries of the critic teachers shall be paid as follows: A. The City School Board shall pay the pro rata amount for the two regular classes taught that would be paid to any high school teacher for doing the same work according to the fixed salary schedule in effect from time to time. B. The remainder of the salary shall be paid by the University. 4. The critic teacher may teach a special methods course in the subject-matter field of his assignment, this work to be done at the University. COOPERATIVE PROGRAM BETWEEN THE ALBEMARLE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA The CoÃ¶perative Program entered into between the School Board of the County of Albemarle and the University of Virginia provides facilities for observation and practice in the high schools of the County for the training of high school teachers and principals under a director of high school supervision; and laboratory training for rural supervisors in the elementary schools of the County under two assistant professors of rural supervision. Provision is also made for the training of division superintendents of schools under the direction of Superintendent A. L. Bennett. CRITIC TEACHERS AND DEPARTMENTAL SUPERVISORS The duties of the critic teachers and departmental supervisors in the County high schools are as follows: 1. To act as general departmental supervisor in the subject-matter field of his assignment. 2. To teach two regular classes in the high school of which he is a member of the teaching staff, such as shall be assigned by the Director of Supervision acting in agreement with the principal of the high school and division superintendent of schools. 3. To serve as critic teacher for the direction of the teaching of such student teachers as are assigned to him by the Director of Supervision. 4. To teach a special methods course in the subject-matter field of his assignment. 5. To conduct such studies of instructional problems as are approved by the Director of Supervision as being in the interest of the improvement of instruction in his subject. 6. To coÃ¶perate in directing the studies of such graduate students as are assigned to him by the Director of Supervision, acting in agreement with the Professor of Secondary Education. 7. To recommend to the principal pupil-assignment to studies in his departmental field. DUTIES OF THE RURAL SUPERVISORS The coÃ¶perative program between the University and the County of Albemarle made possible the employment of two superior rural supervisors, bringing the supervisory staff for elementary schools to five. These two supervisors, in addition to supervising all elementary schools in the districts assigned to them, direct the training of rural supervisors. In order that there may be adequate opportunity for experimentation in one-room schools two schools within easy reach of the University have been chosen for special study and demonstration by the rural supervisors. It is hoped that the record of achievement in these two schools may serve as an example and stimulus, not only to the schools of the county, but of a much wider area. SECONDARY EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA The Department of Education publishes under the editorship of Dr. W. R. Smithey, Professor of Secondary Education, a high school quarterly called Secondary Education in Virginia, devoted to the encouragement of research in Virginia secondary school problems for both public and private schools and to the reporting of research through its columns. This publication is the official organ of the Department of Education, and addressed primarily to the solution of problems of secondary education in Virginia and its columns are open to all workers in this field. It aims to encourage educational research in secondary education. THE SUMMER QUARTER The Summer Quarter is an integral part of the University year. Courses in the College of Arts and Sciences, as well as in the Department of Education, are the same in character and in credit value as in any other Quarter of the University. Degrees are conferred upon men and women upon exactly the same terms for work done in the Summer Quarter when the degree requirements are fully met. Those who contemplate completing their degree requirements in the Summer Quarter should keep clearly in mind, in estimating the time that will be required, that the normal amount of credit which may be taken in one Summer Quarter is 6 session-hours. Candidates for a degree who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. This certificate must be acceptable both to the Dean of the Summer Quarter and to the Dean of the department in which the degree will be obtained. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college and must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate and must give his grades. In every case the candidate must spend at least three full Summer Quarters or an equivalent time at the University in order to meet the residence requirements. The Master's degree may be obtained by properly qualified persons in three Summer Quarters. In no case is this degree to be conferred upon any person who has not attended and done graduate work three full Summer Quarters or the equivalent time in the regular session of the University and the Summer Quarter. On account of the increasing demand for graduate work in the Summer Quarter, the number of graduate courses will be enlarged in 1930. All persons who are looking forward ultimately to taking a degree through summer work are urgently requested to file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter an official statement of their entrance requirements and work for which college credit is desired. Blanks for this purpose will be mailed upon application. First Term begins June 16th and ends July 26th. Second Term begins July 28th and ends August 29th. In order to provide for the increasing number of students who complete the requirements for their degrees during the Summer Quarter, a convocation exercise will be held Friday evening, August 29th, at 8 o'clock, when the degrees will be conferred. Catalogue and further information may be obtained by addressing Secretary Summer Quarter, Box 149, University, Virginia. BUREAU OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS Educational Tests.âThe Department of Education maintains a Bureau of Tests and Measurements as a feature of its extra-University service. Select standard tests in school subjects will be supplied to cities, counties and individual schools at cost. Members of the Faculty of Education will visit the schools to be tested, train teachers in the use of the tests and personally direct the giving and scoring of them, provided the necessary traveling expenses are borne by the schools served. Mental Tests.âIn connection with its work in educational psychology, the Department undertakes to assist school authorities in the diagnosis and training of backward and gifted children. Assistance will be rendered in the making of mental surveys and the establishment of special classes. A clinic will be maintained for the study of cases accessible to the University and the services of the professor in charge will be available to any community in Virginia at the cost of the necessary test materials and traveling expenses. Any school official desiring the services of the Bureau of Tests and Measurements should address the Dean of the Department of Education. BUREAU OF APPOINTMENTS The University of Virginia maintains a Bureau of Appointments in charge of a committee consisting of Professors Manahan, Windes, Smithey, Metcalf and Lewis. The services of the bureau are free to all teachers and prospective teachers seeking positions in secondary schools (both public and private), normal schools, and colleges. Correspondence with regard to appointment should be addressed to the Bureau of Appointments, A. M. Jarman, Secretary, Room D, Peabody Hall, University, Virginia. PHI DELTA KAPPA FRATERNITY A chapter of the national honorary educational fraternity of Phi Delta Kappa has been organized in connection with the Department of Education. Under the constitution of the fraternity, only those students are eligible to membership who expect to make teaching or administration of schools a permanent vocation, and who give evidence of superior qualities of character, scholarship and initiative. The standards of scholarship governing election to membership in the fraternity are similar to those prescribed for election to Phi Beta Kappa. The purpose of the fraternity as stated in its constitution is "to develop among the students of Education at the University of Virginia the spirit of `Research, Service and Leadership,' " and to endeavor by every worthy means at its command to create and foster fellowship and true fraternalism among the members of the society. EDUCATION CLUB An Education Club is conducted for the purpose of fostering a scientific study of educational problems. Membership is open to all students taking courses in Education, teachers, principals and superintendents now in service, and members of the faculty of the University who are willing to lend their influence and efforts toward placing the teaching profession in Virginia and the South on a professional basis. SCHOLARSHIPS The Virginia State Teachers' Scholarships in the Department of Education: thirty scholarships annually, twenty each with a value of $200, and ten each with a value of $100. Founded in 1918 by action of the General Assembly of Virginia. The holder must be a Virginian in need of financial assistance in order to attend the University; and he must pledge himself to teach or engage in some other form of public school work in Virginia for at least two years, or, failing this, to repay to the University the full value of the scholarship. Blank forms of application may be had upon request to Dean John L. Manahan, Chairman of the Committee on State Teachers' Scholarships. Appointments prior to September 1 of each year are made upon the recommendation of division superintendents. Any scholarships unassigned on September 1 are open to applicants from the State at large. In addition to the Virginia State Teachers' Scholarships, there are a number of other scholarships in the University available for students of Education. A detailed description of them is given in the General Catalogue of the University. LOAN FUNDS AND STUDENT SELF-HELP The University is in possession of funds from which loans are made to deserving students in need of such assistance. An account of these loans is given in the General Catalogue. Inquiries concerning them should be addressed to the Bursar. Opportunities for obtaining remunerative employment are afforded to students who are desirous by this means of partially paying their way through the University. It is difficult to give definite assurance of employment to a student before he reaches the University, but it may be stated that any student with sufficient resources to carry him through the first half of the session can be reasonably sure of obtaining work which will help defray his expenses for the rest of the academic year. Information as to employment may be obtained from the Secretary of the Committee on Student Help, Madison Hall, University, Virginia. EXPENSES The figures in the following table may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of nine months. The necessary expenses included here are University and tuition fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. Three estimates are givenâa low, an average, and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundryâin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. The student who shares a room with another student, and practices the strictest economy, may possibly reduce expenses below the low estimate. VIRGINIANS NON-VIRGINIANS Low Average Liberal Low Average Liberal University Fee $ 50 $ 50 $ 50 $ 60 $ 60 $ 60 Tuition Fee 10 10 10 175 175 175 Laboratory Fees (average) 10 10 10 10 10 10 Room, Heat, Light, Furniture and Service 65 115 225 65 115 225 Board 225 270 315 225 270 315 Books 25 30 35 25 30 35 Laundry 25 35 50 25 35 50 Total for Session of Nine Months $ 410 $ 520 $ 695 $ 585 $ 695 $ 870 A fee of $3.00 is required of all women students for the upkeep of the "Woman Students' Association Rooms."
