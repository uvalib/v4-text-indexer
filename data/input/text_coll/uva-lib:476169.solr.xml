      <field name="fulltext">PROEM "SO LET THEM PASS, THESE SONGS OF MINE" So let them pass, these songs of mine, Into oblivion, nor repine; Abandoned ruins of large schemes, Dimmed lights adrift from nobler dreams, Weak wings I sped on quests divine, So let them pass, these songs of mine. They soar, or sink ephemeralâ I care not greatly which befall! For if no song I e'er had wrought, Still have I loved and laughed and fought; So let them pass, these songs of mine; I sting too hot with life to whine! Still shall I struggle, fail, aspire, Lose God, and find Gods in the mire, And drink dream-deep life's heady wineâ So let them pass, these songs of mine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DAYLIGHT HUMORS THIS IS ANOTHER DAY I AM mine own priest, and I shrive myselfOf all my wasted yesterdays. Though sinAnd sloth and foolishness, and all ill weedsOf error, evil, and neglect grow rankAnd ugly there, I dare forgive myselfThat error, sin, and sloth and foolishness.God knows that yesterday I played the fool;God knows that yesterday I played the knave;But shall I therefore cloud this new dawn o'erWith fog of futile sighs and vain regrets?This is another day! And flushed Hope walksAdown the sunward slopes with golden shoon.This is another day; and its young strengthIs laid upon the quivering hills until,Like Egypt's Memnon, they grow quick with song.This is another day, and the bold worldLeaps up and grasps its light, and laughs, as leaptPrometheus up and wrenched the fire from Zeus.This is another dayâare its eyes blurredWith maudlin grief for any wasted past?A thousand thousand failures shall not daunt!Let dust clasp dust; death, deathâI am alive!And out of all the dust and death of mineOld selves I dare to lift a singing heartAnd living faith; my spirit dares drink deepOf the red mirth mantling in the cup of morn. APRIL SONG FLEET across the grassesFlash the feet of Spring,Piping, as he passesFleet across the grasses,"Follow, lads and lasses!Sing, world, sing!"Fleet across the grassesFlash the feet of Spring!Idle winds deliverRumors through the town,Tales of reeds that quiver,Idle winds deliver,Where the rapid riverDrags the willows downâIdle winds deliverRumors through the town.In the country placesBy the silver brooksApril airs her graces;In the country placesWayward April paces,Laughter in her looks;In the country placesBy the silver brooks.Hints of alien glamorEven reach the town;Urban muses stammerHints of alien glamor,But the city's clamorBeats the voices down;Hints of alien glamorEven reach the town. THIS EARTH, IT IS ALSO A STAR WHERE the singers of Saturn find tongue,Where the Galaxy's lovers embrace,Our world and its beauty are sung!They lean from their casements to traceIf our planet still spins in its place;Faith fables the thing that we are,And Fantasy laughs and gives chase:This earth, it is also a star!Round the sun, that is fixed, and hungFor a lamp in the darkness of spaceWe are whirled, we are swirled, we are flung;Singing and shining we raceAnd our light on the uplifted faceOf dreamer or prophet afarMay fall as a symbol of grace:This earth, it is also a star!Looking out where our planet is swungDoubt loses his writhen grimace,Dry hearts drink the gleams and are young;âWhere agony's boughs interlaceHis Garden some Jesus may pace,Lifting, the wan avatar,His soul to this light as a vase!This earth, it is also a star!Great spirits in sorrowful caseYearn to us through the vapors that bar:Canst think of that, soul, and be base?âThis earth, it is also a star! THE NAME IT shifts and shifts from form to form,It drifts and darkles, gleams and glows;It is the passion of the storm,The poignance of the rose;Through changing shapes, through devious ways,By noon or night, through cloud or flame,My heart has followed all my daysSomething I cannot name.In sunlight on some woman's hair,Or starlight in some woman's eyne,Or in low laughter smothered whereHer red lips wedded mine,My heart hath known, and thrilled to know,This unnamed presence that it sought;And when my heart hath found it so,"Love is the name," I thought.Sometimes when sudden afterglowsIn futile glory storm the skiesWithin their transient gold and roseThe secret stirs and dies;Or when the trampling morn walks o'erThe troubled seas, with feet of flame,My awed heart whispers, "Ask no more,For Beauty is the name!"Or dreaming in old chapels whereThe dim aisles pulse with murmuringsThat part are music, part are prayerâ(Or rush of hidden wings)Sometimes I lift a startled headTo some saint's carven countenance,Half fancying that the lips have said,All names mean God, perchance!" THE BIRTH THERE is a legend that the love of GodSo quickened under Mary's heart it wroughtHer very maidenhood to holier stuff. . . .However that may be, the birth befellUpon a night when all the Syrian starsSwayed tremulous before one lordlier orbThat rose in gradual splendor,Paused,Flooding the firmament with mystic light,And dropped upon the breathing hillsA sudden musicLike a distillation from its gleams;A rain of spirit and a dew of song! A MOOD OF PAVLOWA THE soul of the Spring through its body of earthBursts in a bloom of fire,And the crocuses come in a rainbow riot of mirth....They flutter, they burn, they take wing, they aspire. . . .Wings, motion and music and flame,Flower, woman and laughter, and all these the same!She is light and first love and the youth of the world,She is sandaled with joy . . . she is lifted and whirled,She is flung, she is swirled, she is driven alongBy the carnival winds that have torn her awayFrom the coronal bloom on the brow of the May. . . .She is youth, she is foam, she is flame, she is visible Song! THE POOL REACH over, my Undine, and clutch me a reedâNymph of mine idleness, notch me a pipeâFor I am fulfilled of the silence, and longFor to utter the sense of the silence in song.Down-stream all the rapids are troubled with pebblesThat fetter and fret what the water would utter,And it rushes and splashes in tremulous trebles;It makes haste through the shallows, its soul is aflutter;But here all the sound is serene and outspreadIn the murmurous moods of a slow-swirling pool;Here all the sounds are unhurried and cool;Every silence is kith to a sound; they are wed,They are mated, are mingled, are tangled, are bound;Every hush is in love with a sound, every soundBy the law of its life to some silence is bound.Then here will we hide; idle here and abide,In the covert here, close by the watersideâHere, where the slim flattered reeds are aquiverWith the exquisite hints of the reticent river,Here, where the lips of this pool are the lipsOf all pools, let us listen and question and wait;Let us hark to the whispers of love and of death,Let us hark to the lispings of life and of fateâIn this place where pale silences flower into soundLet us strive for some secret of all the profoundDeep and calm Silence that meshes men 'round!There's as much of God hinted in one ripple's plashesâThere's as much of Truth glints in yon dragon- fly's flightâThere's as much Purpose gleams where yonder trout flashesAs inâany book else!âcould we read things aright.Then nymph of mine indolence, here let us hide,Learn, listen, and question; idle here and abideWhere the rushes and lilies lean low to the tide. "THEY HAD NO POET . . ." "Vain was the chief's, the sage's pride!They had no poet and they died." âPOPE. By Tigris, or the streams of Ind,Ere Colchis rose, or Babylon,Forgotten empires dreamed and sinned,Setting tall towns against the dawn,Which, when the proud Sun smote upon,Flashed fire for fire and pride for pride;Their names were . . . Ask oblivion! . . ."They had no poet, and they died."Queens, dusk of hair and tawny-skinned,That loll where fellow leopards fawn . . .Their hearts are dust before the wind,Their loves, that shook the world, are wan!Passion is mighty . . . but, anon,Strong Death has Romance for his bride;Their legends . . . Ask oblivion! . . ."They had no poet, and they died."Heroes, the braggart trumps that dinnedTheir futile triumphs, monarch, pawn,Wild tribesmen, kingdoms disciplined,Passed like a whirlwind and were gone;They built with bronze and gold and brawn,The inner Vision still denied;Their conquests . . .

NEW YORK SHE is hot to the sea that crouches beside,Human and hot to the cool stars peering down,My passionate city, my quivering town,And her dark blood, tide upon purple tide,With throbs as of thunder beats,With leaping rhythms and vast, is swirledThrough the shaken lengths of her veined streets...She pulses, the heart of a world!I have thrilled with her ecstasy, agony, woeâHath she a mood that I do not know?The winds of her music tumultuous have seized me and swayed me,Have lifted, have swung me aroundIn their whorls as of cyclonic sound;Her passions have torn me and tossed me and brayed me;Drunken and tranced and dazzled with visions and gleams,I have spun with her dervish priests;I have searched to the souls of her hunted beastsAnd found love sleeping there;I have soared on the wings of her flashing dreams;I have sunk with her dull despair;I have sweat with her travails and cursed with her pains;I have swelled with her foolish pride;I have raged through a thick red mist at one with her branded Cains,With her broken Christs have died.O beautiful half-god city of visions and love!O hideous half-brute city of hate!O wholly human and baffled and passionate town!The throes of thy burgeoning, stress of thy fight,Thy bitter, blind struggle to gain for thy body a soul,I have known, I have felt, and been shaken thereby!Wakened and shaken and broken,For I hear in thy thunders terrific that throb through thy rapid veinsThe beat of the heart of a world. A HYMN (1914) CLOTHED on with thunder and with steelAnd black against the dawnThe whirling armies clash and reel. . . .A wind, and they are goneLike mists withdrawn,Like mists withdrawn!Like clouds withdrawn, like driven sands,Earth's body vanisheth:One solid thing unconquered stands,The ghost that humbles death.All else is breath,All else is breath!Man rose from out the stinging slime,Half brute, and sought a soul,And up the starrier ways of time,Half god, unto his goal,He still must climb,He still must climb!What though worlds stagger, and the sunsSeem shaken in their place,Trust thou the leaping love that runsCreative over space:Take heart of grace,Take heart of grace!What though great kingdoms fall on deathBefore the stabbing blade,Their brazen might was only breath,Their substance but a shadeâBe not dismayed,Be not dismayed!Man's dream which conquered brute and clodShall fail not, but endure,Shall rise, though beaten to the sod,Shall hold its vantage sureâAs sure as God,As sure as God! THE SINGER A LITTLE while, with love and youth,He wandered, singing:âHe felt life's pulses hot and strongBeat all his rapid veins along;He wrought life's rhythms into song:He laughed, he sang the Dawn!So close, so close to life he dweltThat at rare times and rapt he feltThe fleshly barriers yield and melt;He trembled, looking onCreation at her miracles;His soul-sight pierced the earthly shellsAnd saw the spirit weave its spells,The veil of clay withdrawn;âA little while, with love and youth,He wandered, singing!A little while, with age and death,He wanders, dreaming;âNo more the thunder and the urgeOf earth's full tides that storm the vergeOf heaven with their sweep and surgeShall lift, shall bear him on;Where is the golden hope that ledHim comrade with the mighty dead?The love that aureoled his head?âThe glory is withdrawn!How shall one soar with broken wings?The leagued might of futile thingsWars with the heart that dares and sings;âIt is not always Dawn!A little while, with age and death,He wanders, dreaming. WORDS ARE NOT GUNS Put by the sword (a dreamer saith),The years of peace draw nigh!Already the millennial dawnMakes red the eastern sky!Be not deceived. It comes not yet!The ancient passions keepAlive beneath their changing masks.They are not dead. They sleep.Surely peace comes. As sure as ManRose from primeval slime.That was not yesterday. There's stillA weary height to climb!And we can dwell too long with dreamsAnd play too much with words,Forgetting our inheritanceWas bought and held with swords.But Truth (you say) makes tyrants quailâBeats down embattled Wrong?If truth be armed! Be not deceived.The strife is to the strong.Words are not guns. Words are not ships.And ships and guns prevail.Our liberties, that blood has gained,Are guarded, or they fail.Truth does not triumph without blows,Error not tamely yields.But falsehood closes with quick faith,Fierce, on a thousand fields.And surely, somewhat of that faithOur fathers fought for clings!Which called this freedom's hemisphere,Despite Earth's leagued kings.Great creeds grow thews, or else they die.Thought clothed in deed is lord.What are thy gods? Thy gods brought love?They also brought a sword.Unchallenged, shall we always stand,Secure, apart, aloof?Be not deceived. That hour shall comeWhich puts us to the proof.Then, that we hold the trust we haveSafeguarded for our sons,Let us cease dreaming! Let us haveMore ships, more troops, more guns! WITH THE SUBMARINES ABOVE, the baffled twilight fails; beneath, the blind snakes creep;Beside us glides the charnel shark, our pilot through the deep;And, lurking where low headlands shield from cruising scout and spy,We bide the signal through the gloom that bids us slay or die.All watchful, mute, the crouching guns that guard the strait sea lanesâWatchful and hawklike, plumed with hate, the desperate aeroplanesâAnd still as death and swift as fate, above the darkling coasts,The spying Wireless sows the night with troops of stealthy ghosts,While hushed through all her huddled streets the tide-walled city waitsThe drumming thunders that announce brute battle at her gates.Southward a hundred windy leagues, through storms that blind and bar,Our cheated cruisers search the waves, our cap- tains seek the war;But here the port of peril is; the foeman's dread- noughts rideSullen and black against the moon, upon a sullen tide.And only we to launch ourselves against their stark advanceâTo guide uncertain lightnings through these treach- erous seas of chance!. . . . . . . . .And now a wheeling searchlight paints a signal on the night;And now the bellowing guns are loud with the wild lust of fight.. . . . . .And now, her flanks of steel apulse with all the power of hell,Forth from the darkness leaps in pride a hateful miracle,The flagship of their Admiralâand now God help and save!âWe challenge Death at Death's own game; we sink beneath the wave!. . . . . .Ah, steady nowâand one good blowâone straight stab through the gloomâAh, good!âthe thrust went home!âshe foundersâ flounders to her doom!âFull speed ahead!âthose damned quick-firing guns âbut let them barkâWhat's thatâthe dynamos?âthey've got us, men! âChrist! in the dark! NICHOLAS OF MONTENEGRO (1912) HE speaks as straight as his rifles shot,As straight as a thrusting blade,Waiting the deed that shall trouble the truceHis savage guns have made."You have dared the wrath of a dozen states,"Was the challenge that he heard;"We can die but once!" said the grim old KingAs he gripped his mountain sword."For I paid in blood for the town I took,The blood of my brave men slain,âAnd if you covet the town I tookYou must buy it with blood again!"Stern old King of the stark, black hills,Where the lean, fierce eagles breed,Your speech rings true as your good sword ringsâAnd you are a king indeed! DICKENS "The only book that the party had was a volume of Dickens. During the six months that they lay in the cave which they had hacked in the ice, waiting for spring to come, they read this volume through again and again."âFrom a newspaper report of an antarctic expedition. HUDDLED within their savage lairThey hearkened to the prowling wind;They heard the loud wings of despair . . .And madness beat against the mind. . . .A sunless world stretched stark outsideAs if it had cursed God and died;Dumb plains lay prone beneath the weightOf cold unutterably great;Iron ice bound all the bitter seas,The brutal hills were bleak as hate. . . .Here none but Death might walk at ease!Then Dickens spoke, and, lo! the vastUnpeopled void stirred into life;The dead world quickened, the mad blastHushed for an hour its idiot strifeWith nothingness. . . .And from the gloom,Parting the flaps of frozen skin,Old friends and dear came trooping in,And light and laughter filled the room. . . .Voices and faces, shapes beloved,Babbling lips and kindly eyes,Not ghosts, but friends that lived and moved . . .They brought the sun from other skies,They wrought the magic that dispelsThe bitterer part of loneliness . . .And when they vanished each man dreamedHis dream there in the wilderness. . . .One heard the chime of Christmas bells,And, staring down a country lane,Saw bright against the window-paneThe firelight beckon warm and red. . . .And one turned from the watersideWhere Thames rolls down his slothful tideTo breast the human sea that beatsThrough roaring London's battered streetsAnd revel in the moods of men. . . .And one saw all the April hillsMade glad with golden daffodils,And found and kissed his love again. . . .. . . . . .By all the troubled hearts he cheersIn homely ways or by lost trails,By all light shed through all dark yearsWhen hope grows sick and courage quails,We hail him first among his peers;Whether we sorrow, sing, or feast,He, too, hath known and understoodâMaster of many moods, high priestOf mirth and lord of cleansing tears! A POLITICIAN LEADER no more, be judged of us!Hailed Chief, and loved, of yoreâYouth, and the faith of youth, cry out:Leader and Chief no more!We dreamed a Prophet, flushed with faith,Content to toil in painIf that his sacrifice might be,Somehow, his people's gain.We saw a vision, and our bloodBeat red and hot and strong:"Lead us (we cried) to war againstSome foul, embattled wrong!"We dreamed a Warrior whose swordWas edged for sham and shame;We dreamed a Statesman far aboveThe vulgar lust for fame.We were not cynics, and we dreamedA Man who made no truceWith lies nor ancient privilegeNor old, entrenched abuse.We dreamed . . . we dreamed . . . Youth dreamed a dream!And even you forgotYourself, one moment, and dreamed, tooâStruck, while your mood was hot!Struck three or four good blows . . . and thenTurned back to easier things:The cheap applause, the blatant mob,The praise of underlings!Praise . . . praise . . . was ever man so filled,So avid still, of praise?So hungry for the crowd's acclaim,The sycophantic phrase?O you whom Greatness beckoned to . . .O swollen LittlenessWho turned from ImmortalityTo fawn upon Success!O blind with love of self, who ledYouth's vision to defeat,Bawling and brawling for rewards,Loud, in the common street!O you who were so quick to judgeâLeader, and loved, of yoreâHear now the judgment of our youth:Leader and Chief no more! THE BAYONET (1914) THE great guns slay from a league away, the death- bolts fly unseen,And bellowing hill replies to hill, machine to brute machine,But still in the end when the long lines bend and the battle hangs in doubtThey take to the steel in the same old way that their fathers fought it outâIt is man to man and breast to breast and eye to bloodshot eyeAnd the reach and twist of the thrusting wrist, as it was in the days gone by!Along the shaken hills the guns their drumming thunder rollâBut the keen blades thrill with the lust to kill that leaps from the slayer's soul!For hand and heart and living steel, one pulse of hate they feel.Is your clan afraid of the naked blade? Does it flinch from the bitter steel?Perish your dreams of conquest then, your swollen hopes and bold,For empire dwells with the stabbing blade, as it did in the days of old! THE BUTCHERS AT PRAYER (1914) EACH nation as it draws the swordAnd flings its standard to the airPetitions piously the LordâVexing the void abyss with prayer.O irony too deep for mirth!O posturing apes that rant, and dareThis antic attitude! O Earth,With your wild jest of wicked prayer!I dare not laugh . . . a rising swellOf laughter breaks in shrieks somewhereâNo doubt they relish it in Hell,This cosmic jest of Earth at prayer!</field>

A NIGHTMARE LEAGUES before me, leagues behind,Clamor warring wastes of flood,All the streams of all the worldsFlung together, mad of mood;Through the canon beats a sound,Regular of interval,Distant, drumming, muffled, dull,Thunderously rhythmical;Crafts slip by my startled soulâSoul that cowers, a thing apartâThey are corpuscles of blood!That's the throbbing of a heart!God of terrors!âam I mad?âThrough my body, mine own soul,Shrunken to an atom's size,Voyages toward an unguessed goal! THE MOTHER THE mother by the gallows-tree,The gallows-tree, the gallows-tree,(While the twitching body mocked the sun)Lifted to Heaven her broken heartAnd called for sympathy.Then Mother Mary bent to her,Bent from her place by God's left side,And whispered: "Peaceâdo I not know?âMy son was crucified!""O Mother Mary," answered she,"You cannot, cannot enter inTo my soul's woeâyou cannot knowâFor your son wrought no sin!"(And men whose work compelled them there,Their hearts were stricken dead;They heard the rope creak on the beam;I thought I heard the frightened ghostWhimpering overhead.)The mother by the gallows-tree,The gallows-tree, the gallows-tree,Lifted to Christ her broken heartAnd called in agony.Then Lord Christ bent to her and said:"Be comforted, be comforted;I know your grief; the whole world's woeI bore upon my head.""But O Lord Christ, you cannot know,No one can know," she said, "no one"â(While the quivering corpse swayed in the wind)â"Lord Christ, no one can understandWho never had a son!" IN THE BAYOU LAZY and slow, through the snags and treesMove the sluggish currents, half asleep;Around and between the cypress knees,Like black, slow snakes the dark tides creepâHow deep is the bayou beneath the trees?"Knee-deep,Knee-deep,Knee-deep,Knee-deep!"Croaks the big bullfrog of Reelfoot LakeFrom his hiding-place in the draggled brake.What is the secret the slim reeds knowThat makes them to shake and to shiver so,And the scared flags quiver from plume to foot?âThe frogs pipe solemnly, deep and slow:"Look underthe root!Look underthe root!"The hoarse frog croaks and the stark owl hootsOf a mystery moored in the cypress roots.Was it love turned hate? Was it friend turned foe?Only the frogs and the gray owl know,For the white moon shrouded her face in a mistAt the spurt of a pistol, red and brightâAt the sound of a shriek that stabbed the nightâAnd the little reeds were frightened and whist;But always the eddies whimper and choke,And the frogs would tell if they could, for they croak:"Deep, deep!Death-deep!Deep, deep!Death-deep!"And the dark tide slides and glisters and glidesSnakelike over the secret it hides. THE SAILOR'S WIFE SPEAKS YE are dead, they say, but ye swore, ye swore,Ye would come to me back from the sea!From out of the sea and the night, ye cried,Nor the crawling weed nor the dragging tideCould hold ye fast from me:âCome, ah, come to me!Three spells I have laid on the rising sunAnd three on the waning moonâAre ye held in the bonds of the night or the dayYe must loosen your bonds and away, away!Ye must come where I wait ye, soonâAh, soon! soon! soon!Three times I have cast my words to the wind,And thrice to the climbing sea;If ye drift or dream with the clouds or foamYe must drift again home, ye must drift again homeâWraith, ye are free, ye are free;Ghost, ye are free, ye are free!Are the coasts of death so fair, so fair?But I wait ye here on the shore!It is I that ye hear in the calling windâI have stared through the dark till my soul is blind!O lover of mine, ye swore,Lover of mine, ye swore! HUNTED Oh, why do they hunt so hard, so hard, who have no need of food?Do they hunt for sport, do they hunt for hate, do they hunt for the lust of blood?. . . . . .If I were a god I would get me a spear, I would get me horse and dog,And merrily, merrily I would ride through covert and brake and bog,With hound and horn and laughter loud, over the hills and awayâFor there is no sport like that of a god with a man that stands at bay!Ho! but the morning is fresh and fair, and oh! but the sun is bright,And yonder the quarry breaks from the brush and heads for the hills in flight;A minute's law for the harried thingâthen follow him, follow him fast,With the bellow of dogs and the beat of hoofs and the mellow bugle's blast.. . . . . .Hillo! Halloo! they have marked a man! there is sport in the world to-dayâAnd a clamor swells from the heart of the wood that tells of a soul at bay! A DREAM CHILD WHERE tides of tossed wistaria bloomFoam up in purple turbulence,Where twining boughs have built a roomAnd wing'd winds pause to garner scentsAnd scattered sunlight flecks the gloom,She broods in pensive indolence.What is the thought that holds her thrall,That dims her sight with unshed tears?What songs of sorrow droop and fallIn broken music for her ears?What voices thrill her and recallThe poignant joy of happier years?She dreams 'tis not the winds which passThat whisper through the shaken vine;Whose footstep stirs the rustling grassNone else that listened might divine;She sees her child that never wasLook up with longing in his eyne.Unkissed, his lifted forehead gainsA grace not earthly, but more rareâFor since her heart but only feigns,Wherefore should love not feign him fair?Put blood of roses in his veins,Weave yellow sunshines for his hair?All ghosts of little children deadThat wander wistful, uncaressed,Their seeking lips by love unfed,She fain would cradle on her breastFor his sweet sake whose lonely headHas never known that tender rest.And thus she sits, and thus she broods,Where drifted blossoms freak the grass;The winds that move across her moodsPulse with low whispers as they pass,And in their eerier interludesShe hears a voice that never was. ACROSS THE NIGHT MUCH listening through the silences,Much staring through the night,And lo! the dumb blind distancesAre bridged with speech and sight!Magician Thought, informed of Love,Hath fixed her on the airâOh, Love and I laughed down the fatesAnd clasped her, here as there!Across the eerie silencesShe came in headlong flight,She stormed the serried distances,She trampled space and night!Oh, foolish scientists might giveThis miracle a nameâBut Love and I care but to knowThat when we called she came.And since I find the distancesSubservient to my thought,And of the sentient silencesMore vital speech have wrought,Then she and I will mock Death's self,For all his vaunted mightâThere are no gulfs we dare not leap,As she leapt through the night! SEA CHANGES MORNING WE stood among the boats and nets;We saw the swift clouds fall,We watched the schooners scamper inBefore the sudden squall;âThe jolly squall strove lustilyTo whelm the sheltered streetâThe merry squall that piled the seasAbout the patient headland's kneesAnd chased the fishing fleet.She laughed; as if with wings her mirthArose and left the wingless earthAnd all tame things behind;Rose like a bird, wild with delightWhose briny pinions flash in flightThrough storm and sun and wind.Her laughter sought those skies becauseTheir mood and hers were one,For she and I were drunk with loveAnd life and storm and sun!And while she laughed, the Sun himselfLeapt laughing through the rainAnd struck his harper hand alongThe ringing coast; and that wind-songWhose joy is mixed with painForgot the undertone of griefAnd joined the jocund strain,And over every hidden reefWhereon the waves broke merrilyRose jets and sprays of melodyAnd leapt and laughed again. MOONLIGHT We stood among the boats and nets . . .We marked the risen moonWalk swaying o'er the trembling seasAs one sways in a swoon;The little stars, the lonely stars,Stole through the hollow sky,And every sucking eddy whereThe waves lapped wharf or rotten stairMoaned like some stricken thing hid thereAnd strangled with its own despairAs the shuddering tide crept by.I loved her, and I hated herâOr did I hate myself because,Bound by obscure, strong, silken laws,I felt myself the worshiperOf beauty never wholly mine?With lures most apt to snare, entwine,With bonds too subtle to define,Her lighter nature mastered mine;Herself half given, half withheld,Her lesser spirit still compelledIts tribute from my franker soul:Soârebel, slave, and worshiper!âI loved her and I hated her.I gazed upon her, I, her thrall,And musing, murmured, What if deathWere just the answer to it all?âSuppose some dainty dagger quaffedHer life in one deep eager draught?âSuppose some amorous knife caressedThe lovely hollow of her breast?"âShe turned a mocking look to mine:She read the thought within my eyne,She held me with her lookâand laughed!Now who may tell what stirs, controls,And shapes mad fancies into facts?What trivial things may quicken soulsTo irrevocable, swift acts?Now who has known, who understood,Wherefore some idle thingMay stab with deadlier stingThan well-considered insult could?âMay spur the languor of a moodAnd rouse a tiger in the blood?âAh, Christ!âhad she not laughed just whenThat fancy came! . . . for then . . . and then . . .A sudden mist dropped from the sky,A mist swept in across the sea . . .A mist that hid her face from me . . .A weeping mist all tinged with red,A dripping mist that smelt like blood . . .It choked my throat, it burnt my brain . . .And through it peered one sallow star,And through it rang one shriek of pain . . .And when it passed my hands were red,My soul was dabbled with her blood;And when it passed my love was deadAnd tossed upon the troubled flood.

SUNSET I stood among the boatsThe sinking sun, the angry sun,Across the sullen waveLaid the sudden strength of his red wrathLike to a shaken glaive:âOr did the sun pause in the westTo lift a sword at me,Or was it she, or was it she,Rose for an instant on some crestAnd plucked the red blade from her breastAnd brandished it at me?

The world hath just one tale to tell, and it is very old,A little taleâa simple taleâa tale that's easy told:"There was a youth in Babylon who greatly loved a maid!"The world hath just one song to sing, but sings it unafraid,A little songâa foolish songâthe only song it hath:"There was a youth in Ascalon who loved a girl in Gath!"Homer clanged it, Omar twanged it, Greece and Persia knew!âNimrod's reivers, Hiram's weavers, Hindu, Kurd, and JewâCrowning Tyre, Troy afire, they have dreamed the dream;Tiber-side and Nilus-tide brightened with the gleamâOh, the suing, sighing, wooing, sad and merry hours,Blisses tasted, kisses wasted, building Babel's towers!Hearts were aching, hearts were breaking, lashes wet with dew,When the ships touched the lips of islands Sappho knew;Yearning breasts and burning breasts, cold at last, are hidAmid the glooms of carven tombs in Khufu's pyramidâThough the sages, down the ages, smile their cynic doubt,Man and maid, unafraid, put the schools to rout;Seek to chain love and retain love in the bonds of breath,Vow to hold love, bind and fold love even unto death!The dust of forty centuries has buried Babylon,And out of all her lovers dead rises only one;Rises with a song to sing and laughter in his eyes,The old songâthe only songâfor all the rest are lies!For, oh, the world has just one dream, and it is very oldâ'Tis youth's dreamâa silly dreamâbut it is flushed with gold! A RHYME OF THE ROADS PEARL-SLASHED and purple and crimson and fringed with gray mist of the hills,The pennons of morning advance to the music of rock-fretted rills,The dumb forest quickens to song, and the little gusts shout as they flingA floor-cloth of orchard bloom down for the flash- ing, quick feet of the Spring.To the road, gipsy-heart, thou and I! 'Tis the mad piper, Spring, who is leading;'Tis the pulse of his piping that throbs through the brain, irresistibly pleading;Full-blossomed, deep-bosomed, fain woman, light- footed, lute-throated and fleet,We have drunk of the wine of this Wanderer's song; let us follow his feet!Like raveled red girdles flung down by some hoidenish goddess in mirthThe tangled roads reach from rim unto utter- most rim of the earthâWe will weave of these strands a strong net, we will snare the bright wings of delight,âWe will make of these strings a sweet lute that will shame the low wind-harps of night.The clamor of tongues and the clangor of trades in the peevish packed street,The arrogant, jangling Nothings, with iterant, dis- sonant beat,The clattering, senseless endeavor with dross of mere gold for its goal,These have sickened the senses and wearied the brain and straitened the soul."Come forth and be cleansed of the folly of strife for things worthless of strife,Come forth and gain life and grasp God by fore- going gains worthless of life"âIt was thus spake the wizard wildwood, low- voiced to the hearkening heart,It was thus sang the jovial hills, and the harper sun bore part.O woman, whose blood as my blood with the fire of the Spring is aflame,We did well, when the red roads called, that we heeded the call and cameâCame forth to the sweet wise silence where soul may speak sooth unto soul,Vine-wreathed and vagabond Love, with the goal of Nowhere for our goal!What planet-crowned Dusk that wanders the steeps of our firmament thereHath gems that may match with the dew-opals meshed in thine opulent hair?What wind-witch that skims the curled billows with feet they are fain to caressHath sandals so wing'd as thine art with a god- like carelessness?And dare we not dream this is heaven?âto wan- der thus on, ever on.Through the hush-heavy valleys of space, up the flushing red slopes of the dawn?âFor none that seeks rest shall find rest till he ceaseth his striving for rest,And the gain of the quest is the joy of the road that allures to the quest. THE LAND OF YESTERDAY AND I would seek the country townAmid green meadows nestled downIf I could only find the wayBack to the Land of Yesterday!How I would thrust the miles aside,Rush up the quiet lane, and then,Just where her roses laughed in pride,Find her among the flowers again.I'd slip in silently and waitUntil she saw me by the gate,And then . . . read through a blur of tearsQuick pardon for the selfish years.This time, this time, I would not waitFor that brief wire that said, Too late!âIf I could only find the wayInto the Land of Yesterday.I wonder if her roses yetLift up their heads and laugh with pride,And if her phlox and mignonetteHave heart to blossom by their side;I wonder if the dear old laneStill chirps with robins after rain,And if the birds and banded beesStill rob her early cherry-trees. . . .I wonder, if I went there now,How everything would seem, and howâBut no! not now; there is no wayBack to the Land of Yesterday. OCTOBER CEASE to call him sad and sober,Merriest of months, October!Patron of the bursting bins,Reveler in wayside inns,I can nowhere find a traceOf the pensive in his face;There is mingled wit and folly,But the madcap lacks the graceOf a thoughtful melancholy.Spendthrift of the seasons' gold,How he flings and scatters outTreasure filched from summer-time!âNever ruffling squire of oldBetter loved a tavern boutWhen Prince Hal was in his prime.Doublet slashed with gold and green;Cloak of crimson; changeful sheen,Of the dews that gem his breast;Frosty lace about his throat;Scarlet plumes that flaunt and floatBackward in a gay unrestâWhere's another gallant drestWith such tricksy gaiety,Such unlessoned vanity?With his amber afternoonsAnd his pendant poets' moonsâWith his twilights dashed with roseFrom the red-lipped afterglowsâWith his vocal airs at dawnBreathing hints of HeliconâBacchanalian bees that sipWhere his cider-presses dripâWith the winding of the hornWhere his huntsmen meet the mornâWith his every piping breezeShaking from familiar treesApples of HesperidesâWith the chuckle, chirp, and trillOf his jolly brooks that spillMirth in tangled madrigalsDown pebble-dappled waterfallsâ(Brooks that laugh and make escapeThrough wild arbors where the grapePurples with a promise ofRacy vintage rare as love)âWith his merry, wanton air,Mirth and vanity and follyWhy should he be made to bearBurden of some melancholySong that swoons and sinks with care?Cease to call him sad or sober,âHe's a jolly dog, October! CHANT OF THE CHANGING HOURS THE Hours passed by, a fleet, confused crowd;With wafture of blown garments bright as fire,Light, light of foot and laughing, morning-browed,And where they trod the jonquil and the briarThrilled into jocund life, the dreaming dellsWaked to a morrice chime of jostled bells;âThey danced! they danced! to piping such as flingsThe garnered music of a million SpringsInto one single, keener ecstasy;âOne paused and shouted to my questionings:"Lo, I am Youth; I bid thee follow me!"The Hours passed by; they paced, great lords and proud,Crowned on with sunlight, robed in rich attire;Before their conquering word the brute deed bowed,And Ariel fancies served their large desire;They spake, and roused the mused soul that dwellsIn dust, or, smiling, shaped new heavens and hells,Dethroned old gods and made blind beggars kings:"And what art thou," I cried to one, "that bringsHis mistress, for a brooch, the Galaxy?"â"I am the plumed Thought that soars and sings:Lo, I am Song; I bid thee follow me!"The Hours passed by, with veiled eyes endowedOf dream, and parted lips that scarce suspire,To breathing dusk and arrowy moonlight vowed,South wind and shadowy grove and murmuring lyre;âSwaying they moved, as drows'd of wizard spellsOr tranc'd with sight of recent miracles,And yet they trembled, down their folded wingsQuivered the hint of sweet withholden things,Ah, bitter-sweet in their intensity!One paused and said unto my wonderings:"Lo, I am Love; I bid thee follow me!"The Hours passed by, through huddled cities loudWith witless hate and stale with stinking mire:So cowled monks might march with bier and shroudDown streets plague-spotted toward some cleansing pyre;âYet, lo! strange lilies bloomed in lightless cells,And passionate spirits burst their clayey shellsAnd sang the stricken hope that bleeds and clings:Earth's bruised heart beat in the throbbing strings,And joy still struggled through the threnody!One stern Hour said unto my marvelings:"Lo, I am Life; I bid thee follow me!"The Hours passed by, the stumbling hours and cowed,Uncertain, prone to tears and childish ire,âThe wavering hours that drift like any cloudAt whim of winds or fortunate or dire,âThe feeble shapes that any chance expells;Their wisdom useless, lacking the blood that swellsThe tensed vein: the hot, swift tide that stingsWith life. Ah, wise! but naked to the slingsOf fate, and plagued of youthful memory!A cracked voice broke upon my pityings:"Lo, I am Age; I bid thee follow me!"Ah, Youth! we dallied by the babbling wellsWhere April all her lyric secret tells;âAh, Song! we sped our bold imaginingsAs far as yon red planet's triple rings;âO Life! O Love! I followed, followed thee!There waits one word to end my journeyings:"Lo, I am Death; I bid thee follow me!"</field>

THE WAGES EARTH loves to gibber o'er her dross,Her golden souls, to waste;The cup she fills for her god-menIs a bitter cup to taste.Who sees the gyves that bind mankindAnd strives to strike them offShall gain the hissing hate of fools,Thorns, and the ingrate's scoff.Who storms the moss-grown walls of eldAnd beats some falsehood downShall pass the pallid gates of deathSans laurel, love or crown;For him who fain would teach the worldThe world holds hate in feeâFor Socrates, the hemlock cup;For Christ, Gethsemane. IN MARS, WHAT AVATAR? "In Vishnu-land, what avatar?" âBROWNING. PERCHANCE the dying gods of EarthAre destined to another birth,And worn-out creeds regain their worthIn the kindly air of other starsâWhat lords of life and light hold swayIn the myriad worlds of the Milky Way?What avatars in Mars?What Aphrodites from the seasThat lap the plunging PleiadesArise to spread afarThe dream that was the soul of Greece?In Mars, what avatar?Which hundred moons are wan with loveFor dull Endymions?Which hundred moons hang tranced aboveAudacious Ajalons?What Holy Grail lures errants paleThrough the wastes of yonder star?What fables sway the Milky Way?In Mars, what avatar?When morning skims with crimson wingsAcross the meres of Mercury,What dreaming Memnon wakes and singsOf miracles on Mercury?What Christs, what avatars,Claim Mars? THE GOD-MAKER, MAN NEVERMOREShall the shepherds of Arcady followPan's moods as he lolls by the shoreOf the mere, or lies hid in the hollow;NevermoreShall they start at the sound of his reed-fashioned flute;Fallen muteAre the strings of Apollo,His lyre and his lute;And the lips of the Memnons are muteEvermore;And the gods of the North,âare they dead or forgetful,Our Odin and Baldur and Thor?Are they drunk, or grown weary of worship and fretful,Our Odin and Baldur and Thor?And into what night have the Orient dieties strayed?Swart gods of the Nile, in dusk splendors arrayed,Brooding Isis and somber Osiris,You were gone ere the fragile papyrus,(That bragged you eternal!) decayed.The avatarsBut illumine their limited evensAnd vanish like plunging stars;They are fixed in the whirling heavensNo firmer than falling stars;Brief lords of the changing soul, they passLike a breath from the face of a glass,Or a blossom of summer blown shallop-like overThe cloverAnd tossed tides of grass.Sink to silence the psalms and the paeansThe shibboleths shift, and the faiths,And the temples that challenged the aeonsAre tenanted only by wraiths;Swoon to silence the cymbals and psalters,The worships grow senseless and strange,And the mockers ask, "Where be thy altars?"Crying, "Nothing is changelessâbut Change!"Yes, nothing seems changeless, but Change.And yet, through the creed-wrecking years,One story for ever appears;The tale of a City SupernalâThe whisper of Something eternalâA passion, a hope, and a visionThat peoples the silence with Powers;A fable of meadows ElysianWhere Time enters not with his Hours;âManifold are the tale's variations,Race and clime ever tinting the dreams,Yet its essence, through endless mutations,Immutable gleams.Deathless, though godheads be dying,Surviving the creeds that expire,Illogical, reason-defying,Lives that passionate, primal desire;Insistent, persistent, foreverMan cries to the silences, NeverShall Death reign the lord of the soul,Shall the dust be the ultimate goalâI will storm the black bastions of Night!I will tread where my vision has trod,I will set in the darkness a light,In the vastness, a god!"As the forehead of Man grows broader, so do his creeds;And his gods they are shaped in his image, and mirror his needs;And he clothes them with thunders and beauty, he clothes them with music and fire;Seeing not, as he bows by their altars, that he worships his own desire;And mixed with his trust there is terror, and mixed with his madness is ruth,And every man grovels in error, yet every man glimpses a truth.For all of the creeds are false, and all of the creeds are true;And low at the shrines where my brothers bow, there will I bow, too;For no form of a god, and no fashionMan has made in his desperate passionBut is worthy some worship of mine;âNot too hot with a gross belief,Nor yet too cold with pride,I will bow me down where my brothers bow,Humbleâbut open-eyed! UNREST A FIERCE unrest seethes at the coreOf all existing things:It was the eager wish to soarThat gave the gods their wings.From what flat wastes of cosmic slime,And stung by what quick fire,Sunward the restless races climb!âMen risen out of mire!There throbs through all the worlds that areThis heart-beat hot and strong,And shaken systems, star by star,Awake and glow in song.But for the urge of this unrestThese joyous spheres were mute;But for the rebel in his breastHad man remained a brute.When baffled lips demanded speech,Speech trembled into birthâ(One day the lyric word shall reachFrom earth to laughing earth)âWhen man's dim eyes demanded lightThe light he sought was bornâHis wish, a Titan, scaled the heightAnd flung him back the morn!From deed to dream, from dream to deed,From daring hope to hope,The restless wish, the instant need,Still lashed him up the slope!. . . . . .I sing no governed firmament,Cold, ordered, regularâI sing the stinging discontentThat leaps from star to star! THE PILTDOWN SKULL WHAT was his life, back yonderIn the dusk where time began,This beast uncouth with the jaw of an apeAnd the eye and brain of a man?âWork, and the wooing of woman,Fight, and the lust of fight,Play, and the blind beginningsOf an Art that groped for light?âIn the wonder of redder mornings,By the beauty of brighter seas,Did he stand, the world's first thinker,Scorning his clan's decrees?âSeeking, with baffled eyes,In the dumb, inscrutable skies,A name for the greater gloryThat only the dreamer sees?One day, when the afterglows,Like quick and sentient things,With a rush of their vast, wild wings,Rose out of the shaken oceanAs great birds rise from the sod,Did the shock of their sudden splendorStir him and startle and thrill him,Grip him and shake him and fill himWith a sense as of heights untrod?âDid he tremble with hope and vision,And grasp at a hint of God?London stands where the mammothCaked shag flanks with slimeâAnd what are our lives that inheritThe treasures of all time?Work, and the wooing of woman,Fight, and the lust of fight,A little play (and too much toil!)With an Art that gropes for light;And now and then a dreamer,Rapt, from his lonely sodLooks up and is thrilled and startledWith a fleeting sense of God! THE SEEKER THE creeds he wrought of dream and thoughtFall from him at the touch of life,His old gods fail him in the strifeâWithdrawn, the heavens he sought!Vanished, the miracles that led,The cloud at noon, the flame at night;The vision that he wing'd and spedFalls backward, baffled, from the height;Yet in the wreck of these he standsUpheld by something grim and strong;Some stubborn instinct lifts a songAnd nerves him, heart and hands:He does not dare to call it hope;âIt is not aught that seeks rewardâNor faith, that up some sunward slopeRuns aureoled to meet its lord;It touches something elder farThan faith or creed or thought in man,It was ere yet these lived and ranLike light from star to star;It touches that stark, primal needThat from unpeopled voids and vastFashioned the first crude, childish creed,âAnd still shall fashion, till the last!For one word is the tale of men:They fling their icons to the sod,And having trampled down a godThey seek a god again!Stripped of his creeds inherited,Bereft of all his sires held true,Amid the wreck of visions deadHe thrills at touch of visions new. . . .He wings another Dream for flight. . . .He seeks beyond the outmost dawnA god he set there . . . and, anon,Drags that god from the height!. . . . . .But aye from ruined faiths and oldThat droop and die, fall bruised seeds;And when new flowers and faiths unfoldThey're lovelier flowers, they're kindlier creeds. THE AWAKENING THE steam, the reek, the fume, of prayerBlown outward for a million years,Becomes a mist between the spheres,And waking Sentience struggles there.Prayer still creates the boon we pray;And gods we've hoped for, from those hopesWill gain sufficient form one dayAnd in full godhood storm the slopesWhere ancient Chaos, stark and gray,Already trembles for his sway.When that the restless worlds would flyTheir wish created rapid wings,But not till aeons had passed byWith dower of many idler things;And when dumb flesh demanded speechSpeech struggled to the lips at last;âNow the unpeopled Void, and vast,Clean to that uttermost blank beachWhereto the boldest thought may reachThat voyages from the vaguest pastâ(Dim realm and ultimate of space)âIs vexed and troubled, stirs and shakes,In prescience of a god that wakes,Born of man's wish to see God's face!The endless, groping, dumb desires,âThe climbing incense thick and sweet,The lovely purpose that aspires,The wraiths of vapor wing'd and fleetThat rise and run with eager feetForth from a myriad altar fires:All these become a mist that fillsThe vales and chasms nebular;A shaping Soul that moves and thrillsThe wastes between red star and star! A SONG OF MEN OUT of the soil and the slime,Reeking, they climb,Out of the muck and the mire,Rank, they aspire;Filthy with murder and mud,Black with shed blood,Lust and passion and clayâDying, they slay;Stirred by vague hints of a goal,Seeking a soul!Groping through terror and nightUp to the light:Life in the dust and the clodSensing a God;Flushed of the glamor and gleamCaught from a dream;Stained of the struggle and toil,Stained of the soil,Ally of God in the endâHelper and friendâHero and prophet and priestOut of the beast! THE NOBLER LESSON CHRIST was of virgin birth, and, being slain,The creedists say, He rose from death again.Oh, futile age-long talk of death and birth!âHis life, that is the one thing wonder-worth;Not how He came, but how He lived on earth.For if gods stoop, and with quaint juggleryMock nature's laws, how shall that profit thee?âThe nobler lesson is that mortals canGrow godlike through this baffled front of man! AT LAST EACH race has died and lived and fought for the "true" gods of that poor race,Unconsciously, divinest thought of each race gild- ing its god's face.And every race that lives and dies shall make itself some other gods,Shall build, with mingled truth and lies, new icons from the world-old clods.Through all the tangled creeds and dreams and shifting shibboleths men holdThe false-and-true, inwoven, gleams: a matted mass of dross and gold.Prove, then, thy gods in thine own soul; all others' gods, for thee, are vain;Nor swerved be, struggling for the goal, by bribe of joy nor threat of pain.As skulls grow broader, so do faiths; as old tongues die, old gods die, too,And only ghosts of gods and wraiths may meet the backward-gazer's view.Where, where the faiths of yesterday? Ah, whither vanished, whither gone?Say, what Apollos drive to-day adown the flaming slopes of dawn?Oh, does the blank past hide from view forgotten Christs, to be reborn,The future tremble where some new Messiah- Memnon sings the morn?Of all the worlds, say any earth, like dust wind- harried to and fro,Shall give the next Prometheus birth; but sayâ at lastâyou do not know.How should I know what dawn may gleam beyond the gates of darkness there?âWhich god of all the gods men dream? Why should I whip myself to care?Whichever over all hath place hath shaped and made me what I am;Hath made me strong to front his face, to dare to question though he damn.Perhaps to cringe and cower and bring a shrine a forced and faithless faithIs far more futile than to fling your laughter in the face of Death.For writhe or whirl in dervish rout, they are not flattered there on high,Or sham belief to hide a doubtâno gods are mine that love a lie!Nor gods that beg belief on earth with portents that some seer foretellsâIs life itself not wonder-worth that we must cry for miracles?Is it not strange enough we breathe? Does every- thing not God reveal?Or must we ever weave and wreathe some creed that shall his face conceal?Some creed of which its prophets cry it holds the secret's all-in-all:Some creed which ever bye and bye doth crumble, totter, to its fall!Say any dream of all the dreams that drift and darkle, glint and glow,Holds most of truth within its gleams; but say âat lastâyou do not know.Oh, say the soul, from star to star, with victory wing'd, leap on through spaceAnd scale the bastioned nights that bar the secret's inner dwelling-place;Or say it ever roam dim glades where pallid wraiths of long-dead moonsFlit like blown feathers through the shades, borne on the breath of sobbing tunes:Say any tide of any time, of all the tides that ebb and flow,Shall buoy us on toward any clime; but sayâat lastâyou do not know!</field>

"MY LANDS, NOT THINE" MY lands, not thine, we look upon,Friend Croesus, hill and vale and lawn.Mine every woodland madrigal,And mine thy singing waterfallThat vaguely hints of Helicon.Mark how thine upland slopes have drawnA golden glory from the dawn!âFool's gold?âthy dullness proves them all My landsânot thine!For when all title-deeds are gone,Still, still will satyr, nymph, and faunThrough brake and covert pipe and callIn dances bold and bacchanalâFor them, for me, you hold in pawn, My landsânot thine! TO A DANCING DOLL FORMAL, quaint, precise, and trim,You begin your steps demurelyâThere's a spirit almost primIn the feet that move so surely,So discreetly, to the chimeOf the music that so sweetlyMarks the time.But the chords begin to tinkleQuicker,And your feet they flash and flickerâTwinkle!âFlash and flutter to a tricksyFickle meter;And you foot it like a pixieâOnly fleeter!Now our current, dowdyThingsâ"Turkey-trots" and rowdyFlingsâFor they made you overseasIn politer times than these,In an age when grace could please,Ere St. VitusClutched and shook us, spine and knees;âLoosed a plague of jerks to smite us!Well, our day is far more briskAnd our manner rather slacker),And you are nothing more than bisqueAnd lacquerâBut you shame us with the gracesOf courtlier times and placesWhen the cheapAnd vulgar wasn't "art"âWhen the faunal prance and leapWeren't "smart."Have we lost the trick of weddingGrace to pleasure?Must we clown it at the biddingOf some tawdry, common measure?Can't you school us in the gracesOf your pose and dainty paces?âNow the chords begin to tinkleQuickerâAnd your feet they flash and flickerâTwinkle!âAnd you mock us as you featlySwing and flutter to the chimeOf the music-box that sweetlyMarks the time! LOWER NEW YORKâA STORM WHITE wing'd below the darkling cloudsThe driven sea-gulls wheel;The roused sea flings a storm againstThe towers of stone and steel.The very voice of ocean ringsAlong the shaken streetâDusk, storm, and beauty whelm the worldWhere sea and city meetâBut what care they for flashing wings,Quick beauty, loud refrain,These huddled thousands, deaf and blindTo all but greed and gain? AT SUNSET THE sun-god stooped from out the skyTo kiss the flushing sea,While all the winds of all the worldMade jovial melody;The night came hurrying up to hideThe lovers with her tent;The governed thunders, rank on rank,Stood mute with wonderment;The pale worn moon, a jealous shade,Peered from the firmament;The early stars, the curious stars,Came peering forth to seeWhat mighty nuptials shook the worldWith such an ecstasyWhenas the sun-god left the skyTo mingle with the sea. A CHRISTMAS GIFT ALACK-A-DAY for poverty!What jewels my mind doth give to thee!Carved agate stone porphyrogene,Green emerald and beryl green,Deep sapphine and pale amethyst,Sly opal, cloaking with a mistThe levin of its love elate,Shy brides' pearls, flushed and delicate,Sea-colored lapis lazuli,Sardonyx and chalcedony,Enkindling diamond, candid gold,Red rubies and red garnets bold:And all their humors should be blentIn one intolerable blaze,Barbaric, fierce, and opulent,To dazzle him that dared to gaze!Alack-a-day for poverty:My rhymes are all you get of me!Yet, if your heart receive, behold!The worthless words are set in gold. SILVIA I STILL remember how she movedAmong the rathe, wild blooms she loved,(When Spring came tip-toe down the slopes,Atremble 'twixt her doubts and hopes,Half fearful and all virginal)âHow Silvia sought this dell to callHer flowers into full festival,And chid them with this madrigal:"The busy spider hangs the brushWith filmy gossamers,The frogs are croaking in the creek,The sluggish blacksnake stirs,But still the ground is bare of bloomBeneath the fragrant firs."Arise, arise, O briar rose,And sleepy violet!Awake, awake, anemone,Your wintry dreams forgetâFor shame, you tardy marigold,Are you not budded yet?"The Swallow's back, and claims the eavesThat last year were his home;The Robin follows where the plowBreaks up the crusted loam;And Red-wings spies the Thrush and pipes:'Look! Speckle-breast is come!'"Up, blooms! and storm the wooded slopes,The lowlands and the plainâBlow, jonquil, blow your golden hornAcross the ranks of rain!To arms! to arms! and put to flightThe Winter's broken train!"She paused beside this selfsame rill,And as she ceased, a daffodilHeld up reproachfully his headAnd fluttered into speech, and said:"Chide not the flowers! You little knowOf all their travail 'neath the snow,Their struggling hoursOf choking sorrow underground.Chide not the flowers!You little guess of that profoundAnd blind, dumb agony of ours! Yet, victor here beside the rill,I greet the light that I have found, A Daffodil!"And when the Daffodil was doneA boastful Marigold spake on:"Oh, chide the white frost, if you choose,The heavy clod, so hard to loose,The preying powersOf worm and insect underground.Chide not the flowers!For spite of scathe and cruel wound,Unconquered by the sunless hours, I rise in regal pride, a boldAnd golden-hearted, golden-crowned Marsh Marigold!"And when she came no more, her creekWould not believe, but bade us seekHither, yon, and to and froâEverywhere that children goWhen the SpringIs on the wingAnd the winds of April blowâ"I will never think her dead;"She will come again!" it said;And then the birds that use the vale,Broken-hearted, turned the taleInto syllables of songAnd chirped it half a summer long:"Silvia, Silvia,Be our Song once more,Our vale revisit, Silvia,And be our Song once more:For joy lies sleeping in the lute;The merry pipe, the woodland flute,And all the pleading reeds are muteThat breathed to thee of yore."Silvia, Silvia,Be our Moon again,Shine on our valley, Silvia,And be our Moon again:The fluffy owl and nightingaleFlit silent through the darkling vale,Or utter only words of wailFrom throats all harsh with pain."Silvia, Silvia,Be Springtime, as of old;Come clad in laughter, Silvia,Our Springtime, as of old:The waiting lowlands and the hillsAre tremulous with daffodilsUnblown, until thy footstep thrillsTheir promise into gold."And, musing on her here, I tooMust wonder if it can be trueShe died, as other mortals do.The thought would fit her more, to feignThat, full of life and unawareThat earth holds aught of grief or stain,The fairies stole and hold her whereDeath enters not, nor strife nor pain;âThat, drowsing on some bed of pansies,By Titania's necromanciesHer senses were to slumber lulled,Deeply sunken, steeped and dulled,And by wafture of swift pinionsShe was borne out through earth's portalsTo the fairy queen's dominions,To some land of the immortals. THE EXPLORERS AND some still cry: "What is the use?The service rendered? What the gain?Heroic, yes!âbut in what cause?Have they made less one earth-borne pain?Broadened the bounded spirit's scope?Or died to make the dull world hope?"Must man still be the slave of Use?âBut these men, careless and elate,Join battle with a burly worldOr come to wrestling grips with fate,And not for any good nor gainNor any fame that may befallâBut, thrilling in the clutch of life,Heed the loud challenge and the call;âAnd grown to symbols at the last,Stand in heroic silhouetteAgainst horizons ultimate,As towers that front lost seas are set;âThe reckless gesture, the strong pose,Sharp battle-cry flung back to Earth,And buoyant humor, as a godMight say: "Lo, here my feet have trod!"âThere lies the meaning and the worth!They bring no golden treasure home,They win no acres for their clan,Nor dream nor deed of theirs shall mendThe ills of man's bedeviled spanâNor are they skilled in sleights of speech, (Nor overeager) to make plainThe use they serve, transcending use,âThe gain beyond apparent gain! EARLY AUTUMN WITH half-hearted levies of frost that make foray, retire, and refrainâAmbiguous bugles that blow and that falter to silence againâWith banners of mist that still waver above them, advance and retreat,The hosts of the Autumn still hide in the hills, for a doubt stays their feet;âBut anon, with a barbaric splendor to dazzle the eyes that behold,And regal in raiment of purple and umber and amber and gold,And girt with the glamor of conquest and scarved with red symbols of pride,From the hills in their might and their mirth on the steeds of the wind will they ride,To make sport and make spoil of the Summer, who dwells in a dream on the plain,Still tented in opulent ease in the camps of her indolent train. "TIME STEALS FROM LOVE" TIME steals from Love all but Love's wings;And how should aught but evil things,Or any good but death, befallHim that is thrall unto Time's thrall,Slave to the lesser of these Kings?O heart of youth that wakes and sings!O golden vows and golden rings!Life mocks you with the tale of allTime steals from Love!O riven lute and writhen strings,Dead bough whereto no blossom clings,The glory was ephemeral!Nor may our Autumn grief recallThe passion of the perished SpringsTime steals from Love! THE RONDEAU YOUR rondeau's tale must still be lightâNo bugle-call to life's stern fight!Rather a smiling interludeMemorial to some transient moodOf idle love and gala-night.Its manner is the merest sleightO' hand; yet therein dwells its might,For if the heavier touch intrudeYour rondeau's stale.Fragrant and fragile, fleet and bright,And wing'd with whim, it gleams in flightLike April blossoms wind-pursuedDown aisles of tangled underwood;âNor be too serious when you writeYour rondeau's tail! VISITORS THEY haunt me, they tease me with hintedWithheld revelations,The songs that I may not utter;They lead me, they flatter, they woo me.I follow, I follow, I snatchAt the veils of their secrets in vainâFor lo! they have left me and vanished,The songs that I cannot sing.There are visions elusive that comeWith a quiver and shimmer of wings;âShapes shadows and shapes, and the murmurOf voices;âShapes, that out of the twilightLeap, and with gesture appealingSeem to deliver a message,And are gone 'twixt a breath and a breath;âShapes that race in with the wavesMoving silverly under the moon,And are gone ere they break into foam on the rocksAnd recede;âBreathings of love from invisibleFlutes,Blown somewhere out in the tenderDusk,That die on the bosom of Silence;âFormless,And fleeter than thought,Vaguer than thought or emotion,What are these visitors?Out of the vast and unchartedRealms that encircle the visible world,With a glimmer of light on their pinions,They rush . . .They waver, they vanish,Leaving me stirred with a dream of the ultimate beauty,A sense of the ultimate music,I never shall capture;âThey are Beauty,Formless and tremulous Beauty,Beauty unborn;Beauty as yet unappareledIn thought;Beauty that hesitates,Falters,Withdraws from the verge of birth,Flutters,Retreats from the portals of life;âO Beauty for ever uncaptured!O songs that I never shall sing! THE PARTING WE have come "the primrose way,"Folly, thou and I!Such a glamor and a graceEver glimmered on thy face,Ever such a witcheryLit the laughing eyes of thee,Could a fool like me withstandFolly's feast and beckoning hand?Drinking, how thy lips' caressSpiced the cup of waywardness!So we came "the primrose way,"Folly, thou and I!But now, Folly, we must part,Folly, thou and I!Shall one look with mirth or tearsBack on all his wasted years,Purposes dissolved in wine,Pearls flung to the heedless swine?âIdle days and nights of mirth,Were they pleasures nothing worth?Well, there's no gainsaying weSquandered youth right merrily!But now, Folly, we must part,Folly, thou and I! AN OPEN FIRE THESE logs with drama and with dream are rife,For all their golden Summers and green SpringsThrough leaf and root they sucked the forest's life,Drank in its secret, deep, essential things,Its midwood moods, its mystic runes,Its breathing hushes stirred of faery wings,Its August nights and April noons;The garnered fervors of forgotten JunesFlare forth again and waste away;And in the sap that leaps and singsWe hear again the chant the cricket flingsAcross the hawthorn-scented dusks of May.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REALITIES REALITIES WE are deceived by the shadow, we see not the substance of things.For the hills are less solid than thought; and deeds are but vapors; and fleshIs a mist thrown off and resumed by the soul, as a world by a god.Back of the transient appearance dwells in inef- fable calmThe utter reality, ultimate truth; this seems and that is. THE STRUGGLE I HAVE been down in a dark valley;I have been groping through a deep gorge;Far above, the lips of it were rimmed with moon- light,And here and there the light lay on the dripping rocksSo that it seemed they dripped with moonlight, not with water;So deep it was, that narrow gash among the hills,That those great pines which fringed its edgeSeemed to me no larger than upthrust fingersSilhouetted against the sky;And at its top the vale was strait,And the rays were slantAnd reached but part way down the sides;I could not see the moon itself;I walked through darkness, and the valley's edgeSeemed almost level with the stars,The stars that were like fireflies in the little trees.It was the midnight of defeat;I felt that I had failed;I was mocked of the gods;There was no way out of that gorge;The paths led no whitherAnd I could not remember their beginnings;I was doomed to wander evermore,Thirsty, with the sound of mocking waters in mine ears,Groping, with gleams of useless lightSplashed in ironic beauty on the rocks above.And so I whined.And then despair flashed into rage;I leapt erect, and cried:"Could I but grasp my life as sculptors grasp the clayAnd knead and thrust it into shape again!âIf all the scorn of Heaven were but thrownInto the focus of some creature I could clutch!âIf something tangible were but vouchsafed meBy the cold, far gods!âIf they but sent a Reason for the failure of my lifeI'd answer it;If they but sent a Fiend, I'd conquer it!âBut I reach out, and grasp the air,I rage, and the brute rock echoes my words in mockeryâHow can one fight the sliding moonlight on the cliffs?You gods, coward gods,Come down, I challenge you!âYou who set snares with roses and with passion,You who make flesh beautiful and damn men through the flesh,You who plump the purple grape and then put poison in the cup,You who put serpents in your Edens,You who gave me delight of my senses and broke me for it,You who have mingled death with beauty,You who have put into my blood the impulses for which you cursed me,You who permitted my brain the doubts wherefore you damn me,Behold, I doubt you, gods, no longer, but defy!âI perish here?Then I will be slain of a god!You who have wrapped me in the scorn of your silence,The divinity in this same dust you floutFlames through the dust,And dares,And flings you back your scorn,âCome, face to face, and slay me if you will,But not until you've felt the weightOf all betricked humanity's contemptIn one bold blow!âSpeak forth a Reason, and I will answer it,Yes, to your faces I will answer it;Come garmented in flesh and I will fight with you,Yes, in your faces will I smite you, gods;Coward gods and tricksters that set trapsIn paradise!âFar gods that hedge yourselves about with silenceAnd with distance;That mock men from the unscalable escarpments of your Heavens."Thus I raved, being mad.I had no sooner finished speaking than I feltThe darkness fluttered by approaching feet,And the silence was burned through by trembling flames of sound,And I was 'ware that Something stood by me.And with a shout I leapt and grasped that Being,And the Thing grasped me.We came to wrestling grips,And back and forth we swayed,Hand seeking throat, and crook'd knee seekingTo encrook unwary leg,And spread toes grasping the uneven ground;The strained breast muscles cracked and creaked,The sweat ran in my eyes,The plagued breath sobbed and whistled through my throat,I tasted blood, and strangled, but still struggled onâThe stars above me danced in swarms like yellow bees,The shaken moonlight writhed upon the rocks;âBut at the last I felt his breathing weaker grow,The tense limbs grow less tense,And with a bursting cry I bent his head right back,Back, back, untilI heard his neck bones snap;His spine crunched in my grip;I flung him to the earth and knelt upon his breastAnd listened till the fluttering pulse was stilled.Man, god, or devil, I had wrenched the life from him!And lo!âeven as he diedThe moonlight failed above the vale,âAnd somehow, sure, I know now how!âBetween the rifted rocks the great Sun struckA finger down the cliff, and that red beamLay sharp across the face of him that I had slain;And in that light I read the answer of the silent godsUnto my cursed-out prayer,For he that lay upon the ground wasâI!I understood the lesson then;It was myself that lay there dead;Yes, I had slain my Self. THE REBEL No doubt the ordered worlds speed onWith purpose in their wings;No doubt the ordered songs are sweetEach worthy angel sings;And doubtless it is wise to heedThe ordered words of Kings;But how the heart leaps up to greetThe headlong, rebel flight,Whenas some reckless meteorBlazes across the night!Some cometâByronâLuciferâHas dared to Be, and fight!No doubt but it is safe to dwellWhere ordered duties are;No doubt the cherubs earn their wageWho wind each ticking star;No doubt the system is quite right!âSane, ordered, regular;But how the rebel fires the soulWho dares the strong gods' ire!Each Byron!âShelley!âLucifer!âAnd all the outcast choirThat chant when some PrometheusLeaps up to steal Jove's fire! THE CHILD AND THE MILL BETTER a pauper, penniless, asleep on the kindly sodâBetter a gipsy, houseless, but near to the heart of God,That beats for ears not dulled by the clanking wheels of careâBetter starvation and freedom, hope and the good fresh airThan death to the Something in him that was born to laugh and dream,That was kin to the idle lilies and the ripples of the stream.For out of the dreams of childhood, that careless come and go,The boy gains strength, unknowing, that the Man will prove and know.But these fools with their lies and their dollars, their mills and their bloody hands,Who make a god of a wheel, who worship their whirring bands,They are flinging the life of a people, raw, to the brute machines.Dull-eyed, weary, and oldâold in his early teensâStunted and stupid and twisted, marred in the mills of grief,Can your factories fashion a Man of this thingâ a Man and a Chief?Dumb is the heart of him now, at the time when his heart should singâWasters of body and brain, what race will the future bring?What of the nation's nerve whenas swift crises come?What of the brawn that should heave the guns on the beck of the drum?Thieves of body and soul, who can neither think nor feel,Swine-eyed priests of little false gods of gold and steel,Bow to your obscene altars, worship your loud mills then!Feed to Moloch and Baal the brawn and brains of menâBut silent and watchful and hidden forever over allThe masters brood of those Mills that "grind exceeding small."And it needs no occult art nor magic to foreshowThat a people who sow defeat they will reap the thing they sow. "SIC TRANSIT GLORIA MUNDI" CONQUERORS leonine, lordly,Princes and vaunting kings,Ye are drunk with the sound of your braggart trumpsâBut lo! ye are little things!Earth . . . it is charnel with monarchs!And the puffs of dust that startWhere your war steeds stamp with their ringing hoofsWere each some warrior's heart.Peoples imperial, mighty,Masterful, challenging fate,The tread of your cohorts shakes the hillsâBut lo! ye are not great!Nations that swarm and murmur,Ye are moths that flutter and climbâYe are whirling gnats, ye are swirling bees,Tossed in the winds of time!Earth that is flushed with glory,A marvelous world ye are!But lo! in the midst of a million starsYe are only one pale star!A breath stirs the dark abysses. . . .The deeps below the deepAre troubled and vexed . . . and a thousand worldsFall on eternal sleep! THE COMRADE HATH not man at his noblestAn air of something more than man?âA hint of grace immortal,Born of his greatly daring to assist the godsIn conquering these shaggy wastes,These desert worlds,And planting life and order in these stars?âSo Woman at her best:Her eyes are bright with visions and with dreamsThat triumph over time;Her plumed thought, wing for wing, is mate with his.The world rolls on from dream to dream,And 'neath the vast impersonal revenges of its going,Crushed fools that cried defeatLie dead amid the dust they prophesiedâYe doubters of man's larger destiny,Ye that despair,Look backward down the vistaed years,And all is battleâand all victory!Man fought, to be a man!Through painful centuries the slow beast fought,Blinded and baffled, fought to gain his soul;âWild, hairy, shag, and feared of shadows,Yet the cloudsMade him strange signals that he puzzled o'er;âBeast, child, and ape,And yet the winds harped to him, and the seaRolled in upon his consciousnessIts tides of wonder and romance;âUncouth and caked with mire,And yet the stars said something to him, and the sunDeclared itself a god;âThe lagging cycles turned at lastThe pictures into thought,Thought flowered in soul;âBut, oh, the myriad weary yearsEre Caliban was Shakespeare's selfAnd Darwin's ape had Darwin's brain!âThe battling, battling, and the steep ascent,The fight to hold the little gained,The loss, the doubt, the shaken heart,The stubborn, groping slow recovery!âBut looking backward toward the dim beginnings,You that despair,Hath he not climbed and conquered?Look backward and all's Victory!What coward looks forward and foresees defeat? Who climbed beside him, and who foughtAnd suffered and was glad?Is she a lesser thing than he,Who stained the slopes with bloody feet, or stoodBeside him on some hard-won eminence of hopeExulting as the bold dawn sweptA harper hand along the ringing hills?Flesh of his flesh, and of his soul the soul,Hath she not fought, hath she not climbed?And how is she a lesser thing?âNay, if she ever was'Twas we that made her so, who called her queenBut kept her slave. Had she not courage for the fight?Hath she not courage for the years to come?Hath she not courage who descends aloneâ(How pitifully alone, except for Love!)Where man's thought even falters that would follow,Into the shadowy abyss(Through vast and murmurous caverns dark with crowding dreadAnd terrible with hovering wings),To battle there with Death?âto battleThere with Death, and wrest from him,O Conqueror and Mother,Life! Hath she too long dwelt dream-bound in the world of love,Unconscious of the sterner throes,The more austere, impersonal, wide faith,The urge that drives Christs to the crossNot for the love of one beloved,But for the love of all?If so, she wakes!Wakes and demands a share in all man's bolder destinies,The high, audacious ventures of the soulThat thinks to scale the bastioned slopesAnd strike stark Chaos from his throne.We still stand in the dawn of time.Not meanly let us stand nor shaken with low doubts!For there beyond the verge and margin of gray cloudThe future thrills with promiseAnd the skies are tremulous with golden light;âShe too would share those victories,Comrade, and more than comrade;âNew times, new needs confront us now;We must evolve new powersTo battle with;âWe must go forward now together,Or perchance we fail! ENVOIA LITTLE WHILE A little while the tears and laughter,The willow and the roseâA little while, and what comes afterNo man knows.An hour to sing, to love and linger . . .Then lutanist and luteWill fall on silence, song and singerBoth be mute.Our gods from our desires we fashion. . . .Exalt our baffled lives,And dream their vital bloom and passionStill survives;But when we're done with mirth and weeping,With myrtle, rue, and rose,Shall Death take Life into his keeping? . . .No man knows.What heart hath not, through twilight places,Sought for its dead againTo gild with love their pallid faces? . . .Sought in vain! . . .till mounts the Dream on shining pinion . . .Still broods the dull distrust . . .Which shall have ultimate dominion,Dream, or dust?A little while with grief and laughter,And then the day will close;The shadows gather . . . what comes afterNo man knows!</field>
