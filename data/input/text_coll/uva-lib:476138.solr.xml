      <field name="fulltext">THE PRIDE OF HIS HOUSE A Story of Honolulu's Chinatown By Dr. Yamei Kin. IN one corner of the picturesque city of Honolulu may be found a home like so many other Chinese homes of men who have gone abroad to seek a livelihood. Over the general merchandise and drygoods store of Li Sing Hing is a suite of apartments reached by a flight of steep stairs, scarcely more than a ladder. The first room at the head of the stairs is quite large, and used for a reception room or parlor, and furnished according to the taste and means of the master. One side was occupied with an old-fashioned set of three straight chairs and a capacious sofa, all upholstered in green reps. A grandfather's clock stood in the corner, slowly ticking the time away. Various chromos such as Wide Awake, Fast Asleep, Christ Before Pilate and other specimens of European art adorned the walls, for Ah Sing had a fair knowledge of the English language, and was considered one of the most enterprising merchants. Several bright colored carpet rugs were spread over the cool, light matting. But on the other side of the room Ah Sing had let his soul down from the mazes of Western civilization which he was earnestly trying to master by hanging up a couple of scroll pictures in the usual style of Chinese water-color painting. The landscape scenes reminded him of the hills around the village from which he had come, and where he hoped some day his bones might repose beside those of his ancestors. Under these scrolls stood a pair of beautifully carved teak wood Chinese chairs, with a small square tea table to match between. The most highly prized article was a long panel, on which was written a sentence from the ancient classics. The firm yet graceful lines of the characters made almost a picture in themselves, and showed a master's scholarly hand. Every time Ah Sing read the sentiment, "The superior man preserves harmony," he recalled the face of his old teacher as he amplified the terse statements of the ancients, and with much note and comment revealed the full extent of wisdom inclosed; how he had emphasized the duties a man owed to his ancestors and the obligation to leave a posterity, which should perform the same duties, so that the spirits of the departed should not wander homeless and hungry without a son to offer sacrifices to them. This was to be remembered in the midst of striving for the calm and dignity that belonged to the superior man. But it was so easy to for-[illustration omitted] get in the new life he was surrounded with, just as the old green rep sofa was the most natural thing to drop into on entering the room, rather than the stately carved Chinese chairs. Sundry pieces of bric-a-brac stood on brackets and what-nots around the room. Pink and blue Dresden shepherdesses jostled mandarins in full official costume. A group of the Eight Immortals smiled benignly at terra cotta figures of dancing girls and a Dutch flute player. But the special article of pride was a great glass chandelier hung in the middle of the room, full of many sparkling pendants. These failed to relieve altogether the cold whiteness which reminded one too forcibly of a funeral; hence, several little red baskets filled with gay artificial flowers and with red and green tassels attached, and in addition three or four [illustration omitted] rows of pink flowered globes off a job lot of hand-lamps that he had bought at an auction, so that when the chandelier was lighted up the bits of color made it truly Oriental in effect. Under the chandelier stood a round, inlaid table also handsomely carved, for the master had prospered in his business and could afford much more display than he ordinarily made. The windows overlooked a small back yard filled with rows of pot plants and a few shrubs, but mostly boxes and things out of the store occupied the available space. To the left a door ajar showed a kitchen with an array of brass and copper sauce-pans and an earthen range with its big hole for the rice pot, and smaller holes for the other things. Wood chopped fine was piled up ready to stick into the spaces under the holes to furnish heat to cook with. This was an improved range and had a hood connected with the chimney in the back, so that no smoke could escape to blacken the room, as with many of the common ranges. The pictures of the kitchen god and goddess were pasted up as usual over a small shelf, bearing an offering of rice and wine and lighted tapers floated in a cup of nut oil. The breeze drawing through the windows blew open the door on the opposite side of the parlor, and disclosed what seemed to be a bed-room, but the bed-stead was an importation from China, with a beautiful carved canopy and side pieces, but without springs, and not any more comfortable to sleep on than the Chinese chairs were to sit upon, though costly and of fine workmanship. On the edge of the bed sat a woman about thirty-two or three years of age, rather tall for a Chinese woman, but with too large a mouth and nose to be called pretty; however her delicately arched eyebrows and oval outline of face, with its pale ivory tinted skin of exquisite texture, and air of refinement showed her to be of rather better blood than most of the women one sees in the mercantile communities which have grown up from the coolie laborer abroad. Moreover, her feet had been partially bound in youth, so that she wore a shoe six inches long, which, though not up to the fashionable measurement of two and a half inches, yet redeemed her from the stigma of being a common slave or a boat woman. Her dress was of the simplest—a pair of black trousers reaching to the ankles and a blue cotton tunic or wide-sleeved jacket called a "saam." She sat in deep meditation, and finally clasping her hands together, jingling the heavy bracelets, said aloud: "Ai ya, why have all my pray- ers and sacrifices failed? Kwan Yin has indeed been deaf. I wonder what I could have done to be so unfortunate." Just then the outer door of the parlor opened. A young man of medium height, smooth-shaven except the queue, came slowly across, near to where the woman was sitting, and stood hesitating. Ah Sing's round, boyish face, usually so bright and cheerful, was troubled to-day, and it was some time before he asked: "Well, what did the new doctor say?" "Oh, I don't think this one amounts to any more than the others. She will not even give me one dose of medicine. I have been twice, and she says there is no hope." His face fell, for he had hoped more than he had been willing to acknowledge to himself even. Drawing towards him a pipe standing on a table near by, he sat down on the little bamboo stool, and for a few moments the gurgling of the water as the smoke passed through the pipe was the only sound. Then making a distinct effort, he remarked: "I am the last one of our branch of the clan." "Yes," she assented. "How long have we been married, Yut Ho?" "Sixteen years," she replied. Then he sat silent again, and smoked a few puffs more. "We have had no children at all," he said gently. She nodded her head, as he went on with a sigh. "I wish we did not have to do this thing. You have been a good wife to me in every way, but it can't be helped." "I know it," she said, and rose, passing through the parlor to the kitchen, where she busied herself with preparations for the evening meal. Once in a while her tear-dimmed eyes glanced up at the teacher's panel and she wondered vaguely why it should be so hard to fulfill her part in preserving harmony. But the last thought as she went to sleep that night was an echo of her husband's words. It can't be helped—it must be done. A few days after this, Yut Ho might have been seen one afternoon dressed to go out calling, with fresh, new satin shoes, black, shining trousers, and a handsome light blue saam or jacket; covered, however, while going through the streets by a saam of black similar to the trousers, so that she should present the quiet aspect of a respectable woman; but on entering the house where she was to spend the afternoon, she would lay the upper garment off and appear in the style that befitted her position. The house where she called was that of a poor woman, so far as this world's goods go, but blessed with a large family, among whom were several young girls. The mother rose and greeted respectfully the wife of Li Sing Hing, and hurried her daughters, who moved easily about, not having bound feet, to bring tea and refreshments, inwardly wondering to what she owed the honor of a call. Gradually, as the afternoon wore on, she surmised that the rumors she had heard were true. Yut Ho had given up all hope of having a son of her own, and was looking for a hand-maiden to serve her to bear an heir for the family. At first she resented the thought of any of her daughters going in a secondary capacity, though they were of the large-footed class, for girls of any kind were much sought after by young men growing up, since it was different from China, where a wife could easily be found. But she reflected, Li Sing Hing was rich and generous, and could afford to keep her daughter in much more comfort than she would have as the only wife of a laborer. Moreover, if she should be the mother of a son, her position would be assured, or even honorable, and the more she looked at the kindly, strong face of Yut Ho, and was impressed with her refinement and good breeding, and the more she felt that her daughter would perhaps be more kindly treated than if left to the caprice of a mother-in-law, who, in her querulous old age, might be hard to please. Of course, none of this was expressed in the chat of the two women, though Yut Ho stayed till late in the afternoon, but they each understood the attitude of the other. That evening, when Ah Sing returned, his wife asked if he had made any arrangements or had any one in mind, and he had told her no. Then she quietly said: "I was down at Hop Winn's place to-day. How do you think his second daughter would do?" "Well, if you are satisfied," said Ah Sing, "that she is strong and will be obedient, I am willing." "Who do you think would be a good middle man?" she asked. He reflected a moment and then said: "I think cousin Ah Ching would do it. How much dowry will they want?" "I do not know," said Yut Ho. "Perhaps $400 would do. The oldest daughter is soon to be married." Ah Sing began to calculate. "There will be a dowry of $400, a present of jewelry, bracelets and ear-rings when the papers of contract are signed. I can send some wine and other goods from the store that will be enough for a pledge of good faith. Then the astrologer's fee if the Fates are propitious; a fee for fixing the marriage day; a present to Ah Ching for his services as go-between, and lastly the feast, which will be no small item, for my clan and friends are numerous. It will cost not less than $800. I had [illustration omitted] better say $1,000 in round numbers." He sighed and looked over at Yut Ho, and he thought what a bother it was all for the sake of keeping up the family name, and he had been so comfortable all these years with Yut Ho. He wondered whether this would not be the beginning of discord, but then he thought of a childless old age for her as well as for him, finally laid away by strangers, and then, no matter what happened, nothing would take away Yut Ho's position, for this girl was simply her servant, to wait upon her and obey her commands. While he was thus meditating, Yut Ho's housewifely instincts were already making preparations, changing the order and adding to their apartments, and in her mind's eye she saw the Chinese chairs covered with the red satin embroideries only used on special festive occasions, everything brushed up and in order, ready for the coming of this girl, upon whom so many of their hopes depended. We must pass over now a period of nearly two years, and this is the note we find in the doctor's diary: "Must call again this afternoon to see Li Sing Hing's baby; has some colic, slight case of indigestion, nothing much, but parents are anxious." There in a small back bedroom lay the young mother, who was most carefully waited on that she should not harm herself in any way, but have every kind of food and medicine needful. Yut Ho with her crippled feet was walking to and fro trying to hush a lusty boy who was in the throes of infantile colic. Ah Sing looked in anxiously, and then said: "I have to go down to the store, but stop on your way out, Doctor tell me what to get. I will send for it at once." Yut Ho paused a moment to show the Doctor some new flannel bands and dresses made after the pattern of some things belonging to the wife of Ah Sing's English teacher, who had a little one about the same age. She anxiously inquired if the shape of the new band was right, and pointed with much pride to the little saam made in the same shape as Ah Sing's, but buttoned down the middle of the front, with big American white porcelain buttons, as such an improvement on the Chinese little knotted button. Then she showed me the gorgeous silk clothes and cap with fringe and long streamers ready for his shaving feast, which would occur next week when the baby was 30 days old. His head would be shaved for the first time, and he would be formally named and entered in the family register. To this feast all were welcome. "I am going to invite the English teacher and his wife," she said. "For though we did not ask them to the feast when Chin Yo came, because they would not understand it, surely they would come to baby's feast." She looked down with such maternal pride and tenderness at the little one, who had at last gone to sleep in her arms! Her child—truly the child of love and sacrifice, who should care for and honor her old age, who redeemed her husband, Ah Sing, from being the mock and reproach of his family—Ah Sing, who had been so good and kind to her all these years, and of whom she was so fond and proud.
