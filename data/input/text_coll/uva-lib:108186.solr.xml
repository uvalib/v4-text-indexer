GENERAL STATEMENT. The University of Virginia Summer School is conducted primarily for teachers and students in high schools, academies and colleges. It takes as its peculiar province, not the ordinary summer institute, nor the more popular and inspirational summer school, but the solid and substantial training of high school teachers, college teachers, college students, and teachers who either have professional and life certificates or wish to procure them. Because the courses of instruction in high schools are not clearly defined but merge into the grammar grades below and into the lower college classes above, the high school offers itself as a strategic center around which to build up instruction, the emphasis of which is upon subject matter. The justification of such a summer school for high school teachers is the unusual activity in the South just now in behalf of secondary education. The large number of high school and college teachers attending the Summer School last year is an additional proof of the need of such a school. There were 1,350 regularly registered students in the session of 1910 besides a large number of visitors. LOCATION.âCharlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The sanitary arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about six hundred and fifty feet above sea level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete. One mile from the University is an excellent iron spring connected with the Jefferson Park Hotel, a much frequented resort. LABORATORIES AND MUSEUMS.âThe equipment possessed by the University for the work of instruction, alike in academic and in the professional departments, has been much augmented in recent years, and is now excellent in quality, as well as extensive. In scientific studies large facilities are offered by the Rouss Physical Laboratory, the Chemical Laboratory and the Museum of Industrial Chemistry, the Lewis Brooks Museum, the Biological Laboratory. THE GENERAL LIBRARY.âThe General Library is open to the corps of instructors and the students of the Summer School from 9 A. M. to 1:30 P. M., 3 to 5, and from 7:30 to 10 P. M. The collection contains about seventy thousand volumes, including the standard books of history, literature, and science, and is particularly rich in materials for the study of education and other social subjects. The reference section is well supplied with encyclopÃ¦dias and other sources of information. All books withdrawn from the library must be charged at the desk. Usually books are lent for one week but there are exceptions, and the loan expires on the date stamped in the book. Prompt return not later than the date on which the loan expires is expected and borrowers will be fined ten cents for each day delinquent. Students are expected to give prompt attention to all communications from the librarian. Volumes in the reference collection are not available to borrowers but may be freely consulted in the library, and works in current general use in connection with any course of instruction will be temporarily placed on reference and made subject to this rule. All bound magazines are classed as reference books. REST AND STUDY ROOMS.âMadison Hall, the beautiful new building of the Young Men's Christian Association, which was recently erected at the cost of seventy-five thousand dollars, will be open to students of the Summer School from nine o'clock in the morning until ten at night. Students will have access to the current periodicals in the reading room during the day and until ten at night. The other rooms will be used for rest, for study, for recreation, and for social gatherings. North of the building there are nineteen tennis courts which will be equipped for the use of the students. DAILY GENERAL ASSEMBLY.âDaily from 11:30 to 12:15 there will be a period, in which the students may have the privilege of attending a gathering of the entire body. At this time there will be short addresses on some interesting topic, and a brief prayer and song service, under the leadership of some clergyman or member of the faculty. Generally the singing will be choral, under the direction of the instructor of music, but occasionally, as opportunity offers, prominent soloists will be procured. SUNDAY VESPER SERVICES.âExperience has shown that no Sunday Chapel service held here during the summer has been more attractive or more appreciated than what has sometimes been called the Sunset Service. Further advantage of holding this service at this hour is that it enables all the faculty and the students of the summer school to unite in one common service without at all interfering with their attending the churches of their choice in the city. This service, which will always be kept within one hour, will begin at seven o'clock. It will consist of congregational singing and a brief address by some prominent minister or layman. The pipe organ used in this service is the work of one of the best organ makers in the country, and is admirably adapted, both in size and tone, for church purposes. RECREATION.âProvision has been made to keep the Fayerweather Gymnasium open for regularly registered students during the summer, under the control of a competent gymnasium director, who will give daily systematic instruction in physical culture. No fee will be charged for these courses nor for the use of the gymnasium, and it is hoped that every student will come prepared to take advantage of the physical training courses. A portion of each day set apart to systematic physical development will be profitably spent. The swimming pool and baths will be at the service of the students. The tennis courts belonging to Madison Hall will also be kept in readiness, duly marked and with nets in place. The splendid athletic field, one of the finest in the South, with base-ball ground and quarter mile running track, will be at the disposal of those who wish to engage in the manly sports. Within three minutes' walk from the Academic Building, the woods may be reached. These woods and the neighboring mountains furnish ample opportunity for pleasant strolls or for longer tramps on the part of those more vigorous. One of these walks leads to Fry's Spring, a most efficacious chalybeate spring, which may also be reached by street car. EXCURSIONS.âUnder the directorship of a competent guide, there will be excursions to neighboring points of interest such as Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson; the Natural Bridge; Luray Cavern; the battle fields in Virginia; and any other points to which a sufficiently large number may care to go. The proximity to Washington and Richmond (three hours ride to each) should make a visit to either exceptionally interesting. Saturdays will be reserved for these excursions. On all clear nights parties will leave Cabell Hall at 8 o'clock to visit the McCormick Astronomical Observatory, where they will be shown the stars through the large telescope in the Observatory. ORGAN RECITALS, ENTERTAINMENTS, AND LECTURES.âThe pipe organ in Cabell Hall is one of the best products of one of the largest organ manufacturers in America. It is an antiphonal organ with fifteen hundred pipes, and exhibits all the possibilities of organ manufacture. To bring out these possibilities requires a master organist, and it is the purpose of the management of the Summer School to procure distinguished organists for the recitals. Three outdoor performances of Shakespearean plays will be given July 21st and 22d by the Coburn Shakespeare Players, who have given their delightful performances before most of the large Universities, Country Clubs, and Summer Schools in this country. Other entertainments will be announced during the session of the Summer School. RURAL LIFE WEEK.âThe time between July 17th and July 21st will be devoted to the study of problems of rural life in general, and rural school problems in particular. The discussions will center around the large topics of better educational facilities for rural communities; better means of communication; improved methods of cooperation; the improvement of sanitary conditions; good roads; etc. Especial emphasis is to be placed on woman's work in the country, and the country preacher. One day will be given to a conference for preachers in country communities. Distinguished speakers from all sections of the United States will participate in these conferences. There has been no more helpful, interesting, and vital enterprise connected with the Summer School than this conference. It is of interest not only to the students attending the Summer School, but to county superintendents, progressive farmers, and citizens' improvement leagues. The proceedings of the Conference for last year were published and distributed and proved so popular that the supply was exhausted long before the demand for copies ceased. TEACHERS' POSITIONS.âThe University Appointment Committee receives demands for teachers each year. This Committee would be glad to have well qualified teachers who are in attendance upon the Summer School leave their applications with the Director, who is a member of the Committee. REDUCED RAILWAY RATES.âAll students coming to the Summer School from points within the territory covered by the Southeastern Passenger Association, i. e., the territory lying south of the Potomac and east of the Mississippi, should apply several weeks in advance to their local agents for reduced rates. In case the agent has received no instructions for selling reduced rate tickets to Charlottesville, Virginia, the applicant should write promptly to the Director of the Summer School. Reduced rate tickets can be bought only on one of the following datesâJune 17, 19, 20, 23, 24, 26, and July 3, and 10. It is expected that all railways within this territory will co-operate in the sale of these reduced rate tickets. Those coming from beyond this territory should write to the Director of the Summer School for instructions. BOARD AND ROOMS.âBoard and room may be had at prices ranging from $3.50 per week, where several stay in the same room, upwards, according to accommodations and proximity to the University, the average being $4.50 per week. Many of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the University grounds. One hundred and seventy-five single rooms and fifty double rooms in the University dormitories will be reserved in the order of application upon the following terms: The price will be $4.50 for the full term of six weeks for a single room, and $7.00 for a room which will accommodate two. No reduction will be made for parts of a term. Applications for rooms must be accompanied with the full amount of the fee in order to have them reserved. No rooms will be rented to any person who does not register and pay the fee in the Summer School. Rooms that are reserved will not be held later than July 1st. No room will be open for occupancy before June 17th. Each room is lighted by electricity and will contain one bed, one mattress, one pillow, one chiffonier, one table, one rocking chair, one straight chair. Wash stands and toilet sets will be provided where necessary. Roomers must provide themselves with necessary bed-clothes, towels, etc. The Randall Building, East and West Lawns and East and West Ranges will be reserved exclusively for ladies and will be under the charge of an experienced matron and chaperone. Some member of the faculty will be located in each set of dormitories. The rooms on Dawson's Row will be reserved for men. The location of these dormitories in the University grounds and the social advantages resulting from bringing so many teachers close together make this arrangement a very desirable one and the rooms are eagerly sought. The University Commons, the handsome new dining-hall, is now fully completed and equipped and is being operated successfully this session. It will be open for summer students and will provide table board for three hundred and fifty persons at the very low price of $3.50 a week. Application for dormitory rooms should be sent promptly, with retaining fee, to Mr. P. M. Chichester, University, Virginia. For list of boarding houses, rates, see page 56. TIME AND PLACE OF RECITATIONS AND LECTURES.â Recitations will begin in all courses Tuesday, June 20th, at 8:30 A. M. Students should present themselves at the first meeting of their classes with the required text-books and be prepared with tablets to take notes on introductory lectures. There will be no classes on Saturday unless arranged for by individual instructors, except on Saturday, June 24th, and Saturday, July 1st, when classes will meet at the usual hour. The length of recitation will be one hour, ten minutes of which may be allowed for transfer from one room to another. Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, July 27th, 28th, and 29th, will be used for examinations; the determination being to provide for six full weeks of recitation over and above registration and examination days. Following the outline of each course in this announcement will be found the time and place of meeting for each class. The courses outlined will be given as scheduled. Students should therefore follow the schedule in selecting courses that will not conflict. It is well for the student to select such courses from this catalogue before the opening of the Summer School, so that little delay may be experienced in registration. The Summer School lecture rooms are for the most part restricted to four buildingsâCabell Hall, Rouss Physical Laboratory, Mechanical Laboratory and the Rotunda. REGISTRATION.âMonday, June 19th, will be devoted to the registration of students. All students who can possibly do so should register on this day. Those who fail to register before June 20th will be permitted to attend classes and register as promptly as possible at other hours until June 22nd. The Registrar's office, located in the southeast rooms of the Rotunda, will be open continuously June 19th, 20th, and 21st, from 8:30 a. m. until 9 p. m. Students should consult freely with members of the Faculty in case of difficulty in choosing courses. No certificate will be granted to students who fail to register before Monday, June 26th, except a certificate of attendance. Students preparing to stand the examination for teachers' certificates held at this place by the State Board of Examiners, June 26th, 27th, and 28th, may enter at any time during the session. The form of registration will be as follows: Each student upon application will receive a card with space for name and address, and for courses to be taken. This card should be presented to the Registrar for purposes of filing. In exchange for it the student will receive two cards filled out and signed by the Registrar. These cards should then be presented to the Bursar, together with the fee for each course. The Bursar will sign and return one card to the student, who should present it to the instructors in charge of the courses prescribed on the card. The student, after presenting the card to the various instructors for enrollment in the classes, will retain the same as a receipt from the Bursar, and for future use. No student will be admitted to any course without a registration card naming the course in question and properly signed by the Registrar and the Bursar. In registering, students must state upon the registration card what credit, if any, is desired, as arrangements for credit must be made before taking the courses. No course may be counted toward a certificate without the consent of the Director or Registrar, and instructors will not admit students to any course not mentioned on their registration card, which must be signed by the Registrar and the Bursar to be valid. CREDIT.âThe instructor giving each course will keep the class grades, and attendance, hold the examination, and average the class grade with the examination grade, returning to the Director the general average grade of each student in each course. Absences or delayed entrance will be counted against the student. A certificate for each course completed with an average grade of 75 per cent will be signed by the instructor and the Director of the Summer School, and mailed to the student. When all of the certificates issued by the Director, which are required for any State certificate applied for, have been received, the President of the State Board of Examiners should be notified, and he will issue the appropriate certificate in exchange for the individual certificates noted above. Notice of the completion of courses counted towards University credit should be made to the Registrar of the University of Virginia. Credit Allowed by Other States than Virginia.âApplication has been made to other Southern States for credit equal to that accorded by the Virginia Board of Examiners. Credits are now allowed toward the extension of the certificates by certain other States. Some States authorize the University Summer School instructors to hold State examinations. In other States arrangements may be made upon application of the teachers from those States. All persons wishing to arrange for credits with their respective school authorities should correspond with the Director of the Summer School. University of Virginia Credit.âBelow are stated the conditions upon which credit in the University of Virginia may be granted for work done in the Summer School. (a) The student must satisfy the entrance examination requirements of the University of Virginia and matriculate before he can receive credit in the College for any work done in the University of Virginia Summer School. (b) The Dean of the College will accept the completion of the courses in the Summer School in lieu of the entrance examinations in the same subject, provided that in his judgment the courses are equivalent to those required for entrance to the University of Virginia, and provided, that the certificates of courses completed be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned. (c) The Dean of the College and the professor in charge of the school in which credit is desired will accept certificates of completion of summer courses in lieu of "A" courses in the University of Virginia, provided that such summer courses be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned as the full equivalent in character and scope of the corresponding "A" courses in the University. (d) Certificates of completion of certain summer courses approved by the Academic Faculty will be accepted in lieu of portions of "B" courses, provided that in each case the Dean of the College, the Faculty Committee on Degrees, and the professor in charge of the courses for which credit is desired certify in writing that the summer courses completed are equivalent in character and scope to that portion of the regular sessional work for which credit is desired. (e) The character of the examinations and the numerical standard (75 per cent) required for their successful completion shall be the same as those of the sessional examinations. Those wishing University credit should not take as a rule more than two courses and in every case permission must be granted by the Director to take more than three courses. The Summer School Professional Certificate.âThe following regulations with reference to the Summer School Professional Certificate have been passed by the State Board of Examiners: "That the work for the Summer School Professional Certificate shall not be given at any of the summer schools except at the University of Virginia Summer School. Entrance to the work leading to the Summer School Professional Certificate shall be restricted to those holding First Grade Certificates or to those holding High School Certificates who have had at least six months teaching experience. To procure such certificate the applicant shall study at the University of Virginia Summer School or one of similar rank for at least two sessions of six weeks each and shall make an average of 75 per cent on class work and examination in six courses other than elementary school subjects. Such certificates shall continue in force for seven years, subject to renewal from time to time. The six courses required shall include at least four subjects. One of the six courses required for the Summer School Professional Certificate shall be taken in the subject of English, another shall be taken in Education. The other four courses shall be chosen from any of the following groups, provided that not more than two of the six courses shall be chosen from any one group; Subjects in Industrial Education; Science; Mathematics; History; Education and Philosophy; Language." Note.âIndustrial Education includes Agriculture, Manual Training, Drawing, and Domestic Economy. Special Certificate.âAny teacher who complies with the entrance requirements for the Summer School Professional Certificate as given above, and who attends the University Summer School for two sessions of six weeks each and completes satisfactorily at least one course in Educational Psychology, and in addition three courses in any one subject, to be selected from courses prescribed for this certificate in the University Department, will be given a Special Certificate to teach the subject in which she has specialized. This certificate will be good for five years and renewable from time to time. Professional Elementary Certificates.âTwo Professional Elementary Certificates will be issued by the Virginia State Board of Examiners: The Professional Elementary CertificateâPrimary Grades; and the Professional Elementary CertificatesâGrammar Grades. These certificates will be issued for a term of seven years and will be renewable for a similar period from time to time. The requirements for entrance to the work leading to the Professional Elementary Certificates are the same as those for the Summer School Professional Certificate as outlined above. In addition to the completion of the courses below leading to the Professional Elementary Certificates, a teacher must have had at least nine months successful experience in Primary or Grammar Grade school teaching, as certified to by her superintendent and principal, before the certificate can be issued. The work leading to the two Professional Elementary certificates may be taken in the summer of 1911 only at the University of Virginia Summer School, or the Summer School held at the State Normal School, Farmville, Virginia, or at the Summer School held at the State Normal School, Harrisonburg, Virginia. The courses for the Professional Elementary CertificateâPrimary Gradesâmay be selected from the following: Principles of Teaching with special emphasis on "How to Study" (30 periods); Hygiene (30 periods); Music and Games (60 periods); Drawing (30 periods); Primary Industrial Work (30 periods); Observation Work or Practice Teaching (30 periods); Primary Methods in Reading (30 periods), in Language (30 periods), in Arithmetic (30 periods), in Physical Nature Study and Home Geography (60 periods).

Certificate Credit.âSummer School Professional CertificateâAstronomy 1, 2, 3, and 4. BIOLOGY. The summer work in biology at present offered makes provision for the study of each of the great divisions of the organic world: separate courses being offered in botany and in zoology. The object in either case is, first of all, to familiarize the student with the methods involved in the systematic study of the organization of plants or of animals; and to give such opportunity for individual work by such methods on the part of each student, under the guidance of the teacher, as will enable him or her to carry on similar work elsewhere independently with confidence and accuracy. A second object of equal importance is to give the student a clear conception of the vegetable or the animal kingdom (as the case may be) as a whole, in such manner as to impart a clear idea of the relations and significance of any particular group that may be at any time the subject of special interest. These ends are sought in each case by the presentation in the laboratory of a series of representative forms, each of which is in turn made the subject of careful study as to its organization, activities, and life-history: and by accompanying lectures, in which the results of the work in the laboratory are explained and supplemented, and the relations of the organism in question to the other forms studied and discussed. Two courses will be offered in both zoology and botany, a lecture course and a laboratory course, which may be taken separately but which in each case will be more profitably taken together. The examinations at the close of the session in either botany or zoology will cover both the lectures and the laboratory work. The Biological Laboratory is admirably equipped with simple and compound microscopes, microtomes, and other appliances for cutting, staining, and mounting sections for microscopic study, etc.; and while the prime object of the courses given will be to teach students to observe accurately, to record their observations with precision, and to make correct inferences therefrom, care will be taken to make them familiar in large measure with the principles of microscopal and other biological technic. 1. Systematic Botany.âThis course is intended to afford to teachers and others an opportunity to become familiar with the forms of plant life least generally understood, or most likely to offer discouraging difficulties to the beginner who undertakes them independently and unaided. It will consist of synoptical lectures upon the vegetable kingdom and will be devoted chiefly to the study of seedless (or "flowerless") plants, supplemented by a brief study of the organization and life-history of representatives of the seed (or "flowering") plants. It should be taken in connection with the laboratory course in botany. Daily, from 8:30 to 9:30. Professor Tuttle. Cabell Hall, Room 12. 2. Structural Botany.âThis course will be a laboratory course parallel with the lecture course above outlined. The following topics will be studied: use of the microscope and simple microscopic technic; fern-like plantsâa fern, an equisetum, a clubmoss; moss-like plantsâ a liverwort, a true moss; plant-cellsâstructure, growth, modification, the methods of cell-division; algÃ¦âa representative brown alga, a red alga, green algÃ¦, especially the more abundant water forms; fungiâ a mushroom, a cupfungus, the more abundant parasitic fungi, moulds and mildews, yeast; lichens; fission plantsâthe fission algÃ¦, the bacteria. Daily, from 9:30 to 12:30. Professor Tuttle. Cabell Hall, Room 12. 3. Systematic Zoology.âThe object of this course is first, to indicate the relationships that exist between the various types that compose the animal kingdom; and second, to furnish teachers and others such a knowledge of the chief types of invertebrates and of certain types of vertebrates as is necessary to form a basis for nature study and the teaching of elementary physiology. The laboratory course in zoology should be taken in connection with this lecture course. Daily, from 2:30 to 3:30. Professor Kepner. Cabell Hall, Room 12. 4. Structural Zoology.âThis course is a laboratory course parallel with the course above outlined. The following topics will be studied: use of the microscope and simple microscopical technic; protozoaâ amÅba, paramecium; coelenteratesâhydra and others; flatworms; threadworms, animal parasitism; annelidsâearthworm, nereis; mollusksâmussel or clam; echinodermsâstarfish, sea urchin; crustaceaâ "water fleas," shrimps, crayfish, crabs; insectsâgrasshopper, beetle, bee; chordatesâamphioxus, dogfish, frog; fundamental tissues of animalsâthe animal cell, cell-division, maturation of the ovum, segmentation and development. Daily, from 3:30 to 6:30. Professor Kepner. Cabell Hall, Room 12. Note.âIn addition to the regular fee a laboratory fee of two dollars each will be charged in Courses 2 and 4. University Credit.âA student who passes the examination on the two courses in botany and the two courses in zoology (either in the same or in consecutive sessions of the Summer Session) on complying with the requirements for admission to the University of Virginia, will be entitled to credit for Course 1 B in general biology, or for the requirements in that subject for admission to the Department of Medicine. A student who passes the examination on the two courses in botany under similar conditions, will be entitled to credit for an equivalent portion of Course 1 B in botany. Subject to the same conditions, a student who passes the examination on the two courses in zoology only will be entitled to credit for a corresponding portion of Course 1 B in zoology. Certificate Credit.âSummer School Professional CertificateâBiology, 1, 2, 3, and 4; Special Certificateâ1, 2, 3, and 4. FIELD BOTANY. The outline projected is intended to give to the student a systematized course of study, making it an easy and agreeable task for him to identify the various plant families in his locality and acquire methods of study by which children may identify and become familiar with the individual plants of their neighborhood. At the beginning of the course attention will be given to plant morphology and physiology, but the course will be of a practical character and performed in the fields and forests near the University where the plant life is diversified and rich in both indigenous and imported varieties, furnishing exceptional opportunities for the purpose. During the term each student will, under direction, collect, identify, mount, and preserve, characteristic types, so that he will have commenced the accumulation of an herbarium for use in his teaching, and to which he can continually add specimens from his own locality or that in which he is teaching. The results of the work contemplated should be of great value to the State, not only for its educational influence, but also for its economic importance as well. It would be fair to assume that with the teachers followed by their pupils working out the plants of all parts of the Commonwealth, it would only be a brief period until, from the collaboration of these collections, a complete and systematic symposium of Virginia's flora would be available, and the information now limited to a few, and possessing only scientific importance, would become common knowledge and acquire economic value, influencing agriculture, horticulture, and many important manufacturing industries. The hours for daily excursions will be arranged as far as possible so that they will not conflict with other courses taught in the Summer School. Daily, from 5:30 to 6:30. Professor Lambeth.

Laboratory Course for High School Teachers.âThe sole object of this course is to train each member of the class to give laboratory instruction in secondary schools; the situation that is likely to confront each one will be considered individually. The following topics will be discussed: the particular branches of the subject which should be taught high school students; the apparatus and chemicals necessary and their cost; how to equip a laboratory and how to make the best use of facilities likely to be found in a high school. It is planned to have the teacher perform, under the eye of the instructor, all experiments that the pupils should perform and such demonstration experiments as seem desirable. Special attention will be given to the fitting up of apparatus at a nominal cost, and the apparatus thus assembled may be taken away for future use. The essential pedagogic points of the experiments will be discussed fully and an effort made to show the teacher how to instill life into the laboratory work of the pupil, by pointing out its practical bearing. The chief emphasis will be laid upon the essential phenomena and laws of matter changes, especially those of daily occurrence. Daily, 2 hours before 2 P. M. Mr. Merz. West Range Laboratory. 3.

DRAWING. The courses in drawing are planned to give the teachers of primary, grammar, and high school grades, and supervisors a practical knowledge of drawing and art, as now given in the modern progressive schools. The purpose will not only be to give facility in representing form, but also the study of design, composition, pictorial and imaginative drawing, both still life and landscape, and to suggest definite ways and means for teaching drawing in the class room. Attention is particularly called to the fact that the courses have been made to cover two years thus giving an opportunity for more advanced and thorough work. An attempt will be made to adapt the courses to the needs of all applicants, and especially to the need of those teachers who fancy that they cannot draw. 1.

ENGLISH. The courses in English are designed to meet the needs of the following groups of students: present or prospective high school teachers; professional or technical students who have entered upon their professional courses and found that their training in English is so defective as to interfere with their prospects in their chosen professions; students preparing for college entrance examinations; students conditioned on their entrance examinations or in their college courses at other institutions; college professors and instructors who may be especially interested in methods of teaching English; teachers in elementary schools who are interested in language study for small children. It is desirable that all students of English take advantage of the work in composition, upon which special emphasis will be laid. Private conferences for criticism and personal supervision of theme writing will be arranged for by the instructor. 1. English Grammar and Composition.âThis course is designed especially for high school teachers. No subjects in the high school curriculum are more unsettled than those of grammar and composition, both being in a transitive stage. The multiplication of high schools in the South has called attention afresh to the importance of English but there is still little uniformity in methods of teaching it. An attempt will be made to suggest standards of instruction in grammar and composition. Text-Books.âMeiklejohn's English Grammar (D. C. Heath &amp; Co.); Joyne's Notes on the Parts of Speech (R. L.

British Essayists.âThis course is intended for those who have graduated at some standard college or pursued courses in English literature equivalent to the B. A. course in the University of Virginia. This course will be a careful study of six essayists with reference both to content and style. The essayists selected are Carlyle, Newman, Arnold, Ruskin and Stevenson. Parallel reading in other contemporary essayists may be required. The work will be conducted by conferences, lectures, and written reports. Daily, from 12:15 to 1:15. Professor Kent and Professor Metcalf. Cabell Hall, Room 4. 8. Elementary Language.âThis course is planned to give teachers of the elementary schools a brief, concentrated study of the essentials of matter and method for the language work of all grades above the primary.

Elementary Grammar.âThis course aims primarily at giving teachers a deeper, surer knowledge of the subject matter of grammar, and those completing the work satisfactorily should find themselves thoroughly prepared for the State examination in this subject. The instruction will cover the work of the seventh and eighth grades. Language will be considered mainly from the functional side, and presented so as to provide training in the actual process of thinking. There will be a condensed study of the essential features of descriptive grammar, with especial emphasis upon the more difficult points âthe abstract noun, the comparison of adjectives, the function of case, the personal pronoun, all phases of analysis, and, above all, the verb and the verbals. Frequent touches of comparative and historical grammar will be employed for the sake of the new light and interest to be gained therefrom. There will be, in addition, some consideration of the historical development of grammar teaching, the function and purpose of grammar, the place of grammar in the elementary schools, the relation of grammar to language work, and grammar as a record of usage rather than a law of usage. Text-Books.âHyde's Two-Book Course in English, Book II; Emerson and Bender's Modern English, Book II. Section I, daily, from 10:30 to 11:30; Section II, daily from 12:15 to 1:15. Miss Andrews.
