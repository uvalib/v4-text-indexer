      <field name="fulltext">REGULATIONS, &amp;c. MATRICULATION. To be admitted into the University, the Student must be sixteen years of age; but the Faculty are authorised to dispense with this requisition in the case of application for admission by two brothers, one of whom is under the age of sixteen. If the applicant for admission has been a Student at any other incorporated seminary, he cannot be received, but on producing a certificate from such seminary, or other satisfactory evidence to the Faculty, with respect to his general good conduct. Every Student is free to attend the Schools of his choice, and no other than he chooses; provided, that if under the age of twenty-one, he shall attend at least three professors, unless he has the written authority of his parent or guardian, or the Faculty shall for good cause shewn allow him, to attend less than three. The qualifications of the Student to enter the Schools of Antient Languages, Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, are tested by previous examinations. Before a student matriculates, he is furnished with a copy of the laws, which he is required to read. On matriculating, he signs a written declaration, that he will conform to those laws, and, if he be a resident Student, that he has deposited with the Patron all the funds in his possession. COURSE OF INSTRUCTION. In each School, there are three regular lectures a week; besides which, there are in most of them extra lectures suited to the several classes into which the school is divided. The mode of instruction is by text-books and lectures, accompanied by rigid examinations. The course pursued in each school, is as follows. I.âANTIENT LANGUAGES. Professor Harrison.âIn this school are taught the Latin and Greek Languages, the Greek and Roman History, Geography, and Liturature, and the Hebrew Language. The instruction, given by prelections and examinations, comprises the following subjects. 1. The doctrine of primary and secondary significations of words, and the method to be pursued in ascertaining them:âthe Etymology, comprising the laws which regulate the formation and composition of words:â the doctrine of the inflection or grammatical forms of words, illustrated by reference to the principles of the etymology:âthe Syntax or doctrine of the relations which the words in a sentence sustain to each other, and the connection between different sentences and members of a sentence, as expressed by connecting particles:âthe principles of grammatical criticism, and the idiomatic peculiarities of the languageâthe doctrine of the quantity of syllables, and the metres. 2. The Greek and Roman History, Geography, and Literature, are taught by prelections, and by commenting on portions of the text-books appointed to be read. These form part of the studies of the senior classes. 3. The Hebrew Language. The text-books are: In the Junior Latin Class:âHorace, Cicero's Epistles ad Diversos, Terence and CÃ¦sar's Commentaries; the last chiefly with a view to the written exercises. Zumpt's Latin Grammar is referred to. The student should have Lempriere's Classical Dictionary, new edition by Anthon, in two vols; Adams' Roman Antiquities: and the ancient, with the corresponding modern maps, of the series published by the "Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge," or the "Ãton Comparative Atlas. In the Senior Latin Class:âJuvenal, Livy and Tacitus. Of both Livy and Tacitus the student should have the whole remaining works. In the Junior Greek Class:âXenophon's Anabasis, a play of Euripides, or Ãschylus, and Herodotus. Buttmann's Greek Grammar, is referred to;âthe "Larger" Grammar of Buttmann, by Robinson, is to be preferred. Donnegan's Greek and English Lexicon, and Thiersch's Greek Tables by Patton, are recommended. In the Senior Greek Class:âEuripides, Sophocles, Thucydides, and Homer. In the prelections to this class, it is attempted to introduce the student into the higher departments of grammatical criticism; references are made to the large Grammar of MatthiÃ¦, and to the annotations of Porson, ShÃ¦fer, Hermann, Erfurdt, Elmsley, &amp;c. The History of Rome in the Library of Useful Knowledge, or Niebuhr's Roman History, translated by Hare and Thirlwell, and Ferguson's Roman Republic. Besides the ancient authorities, the students are advised to use Heeren's Manuel, and Montesquieu's "Grandeur et Decadence des Romains." For the Roman Geography the Professor's printed notes from the text-book. In Grecian History, &amp;c.:âThe History of Greece published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge is the text-book. Reference is made to Mitford, Gillies, &amp;c. The Professor's printed notes form the text for the prelections on the Grecian Geography. In both Grecian and Roman History, pains are taken to point out the ancient authorities. In Hebrew;âBiblia Hebraica, edit: Van Der Hooght, by D'Allemand, London; or the revised edition by Aug: Hahn, Leipsic, which is cheaper. Stuart's Hebrew Grammar, 3d edition, and Gesenius's Hebrew Lexicon, by Gibbs: (not the abridgement.) It is expected of the students of Latin and Greek, that they shall read in their rooms such authors and parts of authors, prescribed by the Professor, as cannot be read in the lecture room: e. g.: Cicero's Epistles to Atticus, his Orations (selected,) and Treatise "de Republica;" Sallust, Virgil, Terence, Plautus: Ãschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Demosthenes, Ãschines, Thucydides, &amp;c. As an essential part of the plan of instruction, the students of each class are required to furnish written exercises; which consist in the conversion of Latin or Greek into English, and of English into Latin or Greek. The exercises are examined by the Professor, and the errors marked: they are then returned to the students, and the corrections stated and explained in the presence of the class. For these exercises the classic authors are used as the text. II.âMODERN LANGUAGES. Professor BlÃ¦ttermann.âThe languages taught in this school, are the French, Spanish, Italian, German and Anglo Saxon; and if desired, will also be taught, the Danish, Swedish, Hollandish and Portuguese languages. In each of them, there are two classes, the senior and the junior, together with a third class for those who wish to qualify themselves for de-degrees in this school, as it is required that two degrees be obtained in modern languages before that of A M. will be conferred. Besides the oral translations in the lecture room, the students are required to write, as regular exercises out of the lecture rooms, translations from the foreign language into English, and vice versa. Lectures on the Literature of each of the nations whose languages are taught, are delivered twice a week, by the Professor; and also lectures on Modern History, and the political relations of the different civilized nations of the present day. The text-books used are the principal classics in each language. III.âMATHEMATICS. Professor Bonnycastle.âIn this school there are commonly five classes. Of these, the first junior begins with Arithmetic; but as the student is required to have some knowledge of this subject when he enters the University, the lectures of the Professor are limited to the theory, shewing the method of naming numbers, the different scales of notation, and the derivation of the several rules of Arithmetic from the primary notion of addition; the addition namely, of sensible objects one by one. The ideas thus acquired are appealed to at every subsequent step, and much pains are taken to exhibit the gradual development from the elementary truths, of the extensive science of mathematical analysis. Lacroix's Arithmetic is the text-book. In Algebra, the first problems are analized with, and without the use of letters, to make the student sensible of the advantages of these signs. In teaching the rules for adding, subtracting, &amp;c., they are compared with the correspondent rules in Arithmetic, and the agreement or diversity is noticed and explained. The text-book is Lacroix's Algebra. In Geometry, the first elements are taught, and illustrated by the use of models. The second junior class continue to read Lacroix's Algebra, and Bonnycastle's Inductive Geometry. In the latter, they successively acquireâ the theorems of Synthetic Geometryâthe theory and practice of Plane and Spherical Trigonometry, with the application of the latter to Nautical Astronomyâthe theory of Projectionâand the theory of curved lines and Surfaces. Their subsequent studies usually embrace a portion of the Differential Calculus. The senior classes continue the Differential Calculus in lessons taken from Young and from Bonnycastle's Geometry, concluding the course of Pure Mathematics with the Integral Calculus, the theory of which is taken from Young, and the examples, from Peacock. There is, moreover, a class of Mixed Mathematics, for such of the more advanced students as choose to pursue it: which consists of parts of Venturoli's Mechanics, the first book of Laplace's Mecanique Celeste, and of the applications of the principles there give to various problems. IV.âNATURAL PHILOSOPHY. Professor Rogers.âThere are two classes is this school, viz:âThe general or Junior, and the Senior class. In the former, the illustrations are experimental and graphical, with occasional references to the elementary truths of Geometry and Algebra. In the latter mathematical demonstration is almost exclusively employed, sometimes involving the use of the calculus. The various subjects embraced in this school are treated of in the following order, viz: Mechanics, including Statics, Dynamics, Laws of Impulse and Pressure, and Corpuscular Forces, Strength of Materials, Friction and Machinery; Hydronamics, including Hydrostatics, Hydraulics, Capillary Attraction. &amp;c.âPneumatics; Acoustics; Heat, including Meteorology and the Steam Engine; Electricity and Galvanism; Magnetism; Electro-Magnetism; Optics. Astronomy. The text-books referred to in the Junior Class, are Lardner's Mechanics. Hydrostatics and Pneumatics; Brewster's Optics, by BacheâHerschell's AstronomyâLardner on the Steam Engine, and the Treatises in the Library of Useful Knowledge on Mechanics, Hydrostatics and Hydraulics, Pneumatics, Heat, Electricity, Galvanism, Magnetism and Electro-Magnetism. The text-books in the senior class are the Cambridge Mechanics, Young's Analytical Mechanics, Gummere's Astronomy, Bache's Appendix to Brewster's Optics. In the senior class the students are examined upon the subjects of lecture in the general class, as well as the Mathematical Demonstrations referred to in their text-books. The Apparatus provided for the school of Natural Philosophy is very extensive and complete, and thus enables the Professor to illustrate every part of his course by experiments in the prvsence of his class. An Observatory, with its appropriate astronomical instruments, is also attached to this school. V.âCIVIL ENGINEERING. This school comprises the following branches of instruction, viz: I.âGraphical Mathematics, embracing Descriptive Geometry, Perspective Mensuration, &amp;c. II.âTheory of Levelling and Surveying, both ordinary and topographcal. III.âTheory of Roads, Railroads, Canals, Bridges, &amp;c. IV.âTheoretical Mechanics, Hydrostatics and Hydrodynamics, as connected with Engineering. V.âLaws of Heat and SteamâTheory and construction of the Steam Engine. VI.âGeology and Mideralogy. VII.âLevelling, Surveying, &amp;c., taught practically in the field. VIII.âPlan drawing, Plotting, Topographical drawing and sketching. The subjects named under the six first heads are divided between the Professors of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. Those included under 7th and 8th heads, are taught by the Teacher of Drawing, under the superintendance of the Professors above mentioned. VI.âCHEMISTRY AND MATERIA MEDICA. Professor Emmet.âThere are two classes in this school; one of Chemistry, to which there are lectures given twice a weeek; and the other of Materia Medica and Pharmacy, to which is given a lecture oncea week throughout the session. In the Chemical lectures, all the important applications of the science to the mechanic arts, agriculture and domestic economy are noticed, and when practicable, illustrated by experiment. In the lectures on earths and metals, the appropriate minerals are exhibited and noticed with reference to the sciences of Mineralogy and Geology. At the close of the history of inorganic matter, the atomatic theory, and the laws of definite proportions are fully explained and exemplified. The latter part of the course is occupied with the chemistry of organic substances; and it comprises the history, analysis and properties of each substance; to which are added general views of the connexion between Chemistry and the physiology of animals and vegetables. In the lectures on Materia Medica and Pharmacy, the subjects are treated in the following order:âThe operations of Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical preparations, the effect which the combining of different substances has on their medicinal properties, the different classifications of the Materia Medica, and lastly its several articles treated alphabetically. There is attached to this school, a very extensive apparatus and laboratory. VII.âMEDICINE. Professor Magill.âThe subjects taught in this school are the theory and practice of Medicine, Obstetrics and Medical Jurisprudence. The last forms a distinct class, and comprehends other students in addition to those of medicine. A full course of lectures is delivered on each of the above branches. In the theory and practice of Medicine, Eberle's work on that subject is recommended as a text-book; in Obstetrics, Burns, Dewees, or Gooch; and in Medical Jurisprudence, Beck or Ryan. VIII.âANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY AND SURGERY. Professor Warner.âIn Anatomy, the lectures are delivered from Subjects, with which the school is regularly supplied. The text-book is Horner's Special Anatomy. In Surgery, the text-book is Cooper's First Lines. In Physiology the text-book is Dunglison's Human Physiology. This and the two preceding schools constitute the Medical Department of the University; and the candidates for the degree of "Doctor of Medicine," must pass examination in them all. An extensive Museum is attached to this department. It possesses one advantage, at least, over the other Medical Schools in the United States, in having a session of more than ten months, instead of one of about four. A full course of lectures in the Medical Department of this University, is considered as equivalent to a full course in both the Philadelphia and Baltimore Schools: so that a student with a certificate from this University of having attended a full course of lectures here, is entitled to stand for graduation at either of the above named schools, after having attended all the lectures there delivered for one session only. IX.âMORAL PHILOSOPHY. Professor Tucker.âThere are two classes in this school. The Junior class studies Rhetoric, Belles-Lettres and Logic, the first half of the session, and Belles-Lettres and Ethics, the last half. The Senior, studies Mental Philosophy, the first part of the session, and Political Economy the last. The examinations are on the Professor's lectures, Brown's Philosophy, Say's Political Economy, and Adam Smith. In the Junior Class, the examinations are on the Professor's lectures, Blair's Lectures, Campbell's Rhetoric, Paley's Philosophy. There are also in this school, lectures on Logic and general Grammar. X.âLAW. Professor Davis.âThis school is arranged into two classes. The subjects studied by the Junior class are the Law of Nature and Nations, the Science of Government, Constitutional Law, and the elementary principles of Jurisprudence. The text-books used by this class, are Wheaton's International Law, the Federalist, the Virginia Report of '99, and Blackstone's Commentaries; in addition to which, lectures are delivered on Government, and on various topics of National and Constitutional Law not discussed in the text-books. The subjects studied by the Senior class are the Common and Statute Law, Equity and Maritime and Commercial Law. And the text-books used by this class, are Coke upon Littleton, (Thomas's edition,) Stephen on Pleading, Starkie on Evidence, (the first vol.) Toller on Executors, Chitty on Contracts, Bayley on Bills, Story's Equity, and Mitford's Pleadings; in addition to which lectures are delivered on Maritime and Commercial Law, and on several important topics included in the other branches of the course. The design of this arrangement is to embrace in the junior course, those studies which not only form an essential part of a liberal professional education, but which, from their universal interest and importance, constitute a highly useful branch of general education; whilst the senior course is exclusively occupied with the study of the theory and practice of the Law, as a profession. Students can attend either or both the classes; and those not wishing to study Municipal Law at all, can enter for that portion of the junior course which includes National Law, Government and Constitutional Law, which portion, those wishing to study Municipal Law only, can, if they choose, omit. On the text-books of both classes, prelections are delivered by the Professor, in which it is his object to supply what is deficient, and explain what is obscure in the text, and to offer such comments as he deems necessary to the thorough understanding of the subject under consideration. In the prelections on Municipal Law, he refers to the leading cases and authorities, American and English, illustrative of the topic treated by the author, and particularly explains, in its appropriate connection, the Statute Law of Virginia and the United States, and its effects on the pre-existing law. Each prelection is preceded by an examination on the last, together with its text. On the lectures delivered, the class are also examined. To assist them in their regular studies, and to accustom them to legal investigations, and forensic discussions, the students of this school have instituted a Law Society, at the meetings of which the Professor presides. In it, questions connected with the studies of the school are discussed, fictitious cases litigated in the form of regular pleadings, and the issue produced decided in the appropriate mode, and the members exercised in conveyancing, &amp;c. The students of Law, in common with the students of the other schools, have the use of the extensive Library of the institution; the Law department of which is large and valuable. Religious exercises are performed at the University every Sunday, by a Minister of the Gospel, residing there, whose services are rendered on the private invitation of the Professors, Officers and Students. Fencing, Gymnastics, &amp;c., are taught by Major A. Penci. EXAMINATIONS. There are two public examinations of all the students each session, the one at such convenient time about the middle of the session as the Faculty shall appoint; the other at the close of the session. These are thus conducted: The Professor of the School prepares, in writing, a series of questions to be proposed to the class, and affixes to them numerical values, according to his estimate of their relative difficulty. On the assembling of the class for examination, these questions are for the first time presented to them; and they are required to answer them in writing, in a prescribed time, without communication with one another or with other persons, and without any reference to books. Their answers are subsequently carefully examined and compared, and a value attached to each, not exeeding that of the corresponding question. In the schools of languages, subjects may also be selected for oral examination, and the values of these exercises are marked at the time. The students are then arranged into four divisions, according to the merit of their examination, as determined by the following method. The numerical values attached to all the questions are added together, and also the values of the answers given by each student. If this last number amounts to three-fourths of the first, the student is ranked in the first division; if it be less than three-fourths and as much as one-half, in the second; if less than one-half and as much as a fourth, in the third; if less than a fourth, in the fourth division.âThe examinations are conducted and the results ascertained by a committee, consisting of the Professor of the school and two other Professors. The standing of each student at the examinations is communicated to his parent or guardian; and the names of those who are in the first division are announced on the public day, at the close of the session, and published in one or more of the newspapers of the State. DEGREES. Three honorary distinctions are conferred in this Institution; a Certificate of Proficiencyâthat of Graduate in any Schoolâand that of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia. The first, the Faculty may confer on any student who shall, on examination, give satisfactory evidence of a competent acquaintance with any of those particular branches which, according to the regulations, may be separately attended in a school. The second, they are authorised to confer on any student who shall, on examination, give satisfactory evidence of his proficiency in the general studies of any of the schools. And the third, is obtained by graduation, in the schools of Ancient Languages Mathematics. Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and Moral Philosophy, and in any two of the Modern Languages. But in all cases, to obtain a diploma or certificate of proficiency, the candidate must give the Faculty satisfactory proof of his ability to write the English language correctly. No particular period of study is prescribed for the acquisition of these honors. The student obtains them whenever he can undergo the rigid examinations to which the candidates for them are subjected. The title of Doctor of Medicine is conferred on the graduate in the Medical Department. On the last day of the session, the Visitors, Faculty, Officers, and Students assemble in the Rotunda, and the public are invited to attend. On this occasion, the certificates and diplomas are awarded to the successful candidates, the results of the examinations are announced and orations are delivered, and essays read by students appointed for that purpose. EXPENSES, &amp;c. The expenses for the session of upwards of ten months, commencing the 1st of September, and ending the 4th of July following,) are as follows: Board, including bed and other room furniture, washing and attendance, $125 Fuel and candles, to be furnished by the Proctor, at cost, and 5 per cent. commission, estimated, if only one Student in the dormitotory, at $30,âif two students in the dormitory at 15 Rent of an entire dormitory $16; for half, if occupied by two Students, 8 Use of the library and public rooms, 15 Feesâif one Professor be attended, $50; if two, each $30; if more than two, each $25âsay, 75 Total (exclusive of books &amp;stationary, clothing and pocket money, $238 In addition to the regular fee, $20 is paid by Students who attend the Senior Class in the School of Law. The fee for attending the class of Materia Medica in the School of Chemistry; of Medical Jurisprudence in the School of Medicine; and of National Law, Government and Constitutional Law, in the School of Law; by those who do not attend those schools, is $15 each. Boarding-houses are provided within the precincts for the accommodation of students; and no student is permitted to board or lodge out of the precincts, unless in the family of his parent or guardian, or of some particular friend, approved by the Fuculty. Except, that students above the age of twenty years may reside out of the precincts, in such private boardinghouses as the Faculty may approve. Every student resident within the precincts, is required, on matriculating, to deposit with the Patron, all the money, checks, bills, drafts, and other available funds, which he shall have in his possession, or under his control, in any manner intended to defray his expenses while at the University, or on his return from thence to his residence. Nor shall he matriculate, till he shall have deposited a sum at least sufficient, after deducting the Patron's commission, (two per cent) to pay for the use of his dormitory and the public rooms, to pay the fees of the Professors whom he may design to attend, to pay three months' board to his hotel-keeper, to purchase the text-books and stationary which he may want at the commencement, and twenty dollars on account of fuel and candles, and ten dollars to cover contingent charges and assessments against him for injuries to the buildings, &amp;c., which two last mentioned sums are credited in the final settlement of his accounts. In like manner, he shall deposit with the Patron all the funds which he shall receive while a student of the University, for the purposes aforesaid. At the end of the first three months of the session, he shall deposit enough to pay his board and other expenses for the next three months; and at the expiration of the second period of three months, he shall deposite enough to pay his board and other expenses for the residue of the session. Students resident out of the University, are required, on matriculating to deposite with the Patron funds sufficient, after deducting the Patron's commission, to pay the fees of the Professors whom they may propose to attend, the sum charged for the use of the public rooms, and ten dollars to cover contingent charges. The expenses of the students resident in the University, are limited as follows:âfor board, the use of dormitory and public rooms, and tuition fees, the sums before stated; for clothing during the session, not exceeding a hundred dollars; for pocket money during the session, a sum not exceeding forty dollars; for books or stationary, whatever the parent or guardian may think fit to allow; for medicine and medical attendance whatever may be necessary. These limits are in no case to be exceeded, unless under special circumstances, the Faculty shall allow it. Resident students are forbidden to contract any debts whatseover; but for every thing purchased, they are forth with to pay, or to draw upon a fund in the hands of the Patron applicable thereto. Students, wherever resident, are required to wear the uniform prescribed by the enactments; consisting of cloth of a dark gray mixture, at a price not exceeding six dollars a yard. The Faculty at their discretion, may allow any man, of undoubted moral character, above the age of twenty-three years, to attend lectures in any of the schools of the University, and to reside out of the precincts, exempt from the rules and regulations prescribed for the government of students; except only, that he shall pay the usual Professors' fees, and the usual compensation for the use of the public rooms, and shall observe all those laws of the Institution which enjoin respectful and orderly deportment: But the privilege so allowed may be withdrawn by the Faculty, at any time, when in their opinion it has been used to the evil example of the students, or otherwise to the injury of the Institution. At the end of every month, a circular letter is addressed by the Chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from the lectures he was bound to attend, and any other irregularities of which he may have been guilty, that month; together with such information as to the student's progress and conduct as it may be deemed proper to communicate.</field>
