      <field name="fulltext">CHARTER OF The City of Charlottesville. Approved March 14, 1908. [Acts 1908, p. 442.] Section 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Virginia, That an act of the General Assembly of Virginia, in force March 3, 1900, entitled "An act to provide a new charter for the city of Charlottesville, and to repeal all acts inconsistent therewith," be amended and re-enacted so as to read as follows: Sec. 2. That so much of the land as lies and is contained within the following boundaries, beginning at the entrance to the Brennan estate from the Monticello road (the gate nearest to town); thence north forty-eight, east one hundred and six poles, crossing the Chesapeake and Ohio railway, to corner of the yard belonging to (the farm) late Thomas L. Farish estate, on the road to the woolen mills; thence with said yard fence, north thirty-three and one-half, east fifty-eight and one-half poles; thence north twenty-one, west one hundred and seventy-six and one-half poles, to the northeast corner of B. C. Flannagan's dwelling house; thence north seventy-two and one-half, west one hundred and fourteen poles, to the south bank of the Virginia Midland railway; thence along said southern bank, south forty-eight and one-half, west one hundred poles, and south fifty-eight and one-half, west thirty-five poles, to the south side of Preston avenue; thence along the south side of said avenue, north forty-seven and one-half, west thirty-seven poles, to the southeast corner of John M. White's lot; thence leaving the road or avenue, south eighty-seven and one-half, west thirty-seven and four-tenths poles to the southeast corner of Jesse Seay's lot; thence north eighty-two and one-half, west one hundred and forty-eight poles, to the southeast corner of Mistress Turner's slaughter-house; thence north sixty-nine and one-half, west thirty-four poles, to the lane leading to the said Mistress Turner's house; thence with said lane south twenty-six, west thirty poles, to the Chesapeake and Ohio railway; thence east with said railway to the crossing of the University avenue; thence leaving the railway, south thirteen and one-fourth, west one hundred and eighteen poles, crossing the Virginia Midland railway, to a corner in line with the Fife lots; thence south eighty-seven and one-half, east thirty-six poles, to the southern line of said lots, and along the same sixty-eight and one-half poles to the southwest corner of Thomas B. Bunch's lot, at the head of R. H. Fife's ice pond; thence south forty-three and one-half, east thirty-seven poles, to the corner in branch below said ice pond; thence south twenty-four and three-fourths, east one hundred and twenty-seven and one-half poles, to the southwest corner of James S. Barksdale's lot on the road to Hartman's mill; thence along the northern margin of said road, south sixty-one and three-fourths, east twenty-three and one-half poles, to the southeast corner of said Barksdale's garden; thence south eighty-one, east seventy-five poles, to Pollock's branch; thence with said branch as far as its several courses will admit, north forty-two and a half, east eighty-five poles, north seventy-four and a half, east twenty poles, and north forty-five and a half, east eight poles, to a point on said branch west of J. L. Hay's house; thence south sixty-nine and one-half, east one hundred and eleven ane one-half poles, crossing the Scottsville road (and including the said Hay's house) to the place of beginning, shall be, and is hereby, made the city of Charlottesville; and the inhabitants of the city of Charlottesville for all purposes for which towns and cities are incorporated in this Commonwealth, shall continue to be one body politic in fact and in name, under the style and denomination of the city of Charlottesville, and as such shall have all the rights, immunities, powers and privileges, and be subject to all the duties and obligations now incumbent and pertaining to said city as a municipal corporation; and by that name may sue and be sued, and be subject to all the provisions of the Code of Virginia, except so far as may be herein otherwise provided. Sec. 3. The said city shall be divided into wards as now constituted, but the number of wards may be hereafter increased or diminished and the boundaries thereof changed by the city council, as authorized by law. Sec. 4. The municipal authorities of the said city shall consist of a mayor, twelve aldermen, a clerk of the corporation court, a Commonwealth's attorney, a treasurer, a sergeant, a commissioner of the revenue, a justice of the peace, a constable, who shall be elected by the qualified voters of the city of Charlottesville at elections held at the intervals and on the days prescribed for such elections by the laws of the State. All persons who are qualified voters of the city of Charlottesville shall be eligible to any of the said offices. The terms of office of all of said officers shall begin and continue for such length of time as is prescribed by the general law: provided, that any one of said officers shall be eligible to one or more offices to be filled by the council—that is to say, that any officer elected by the people may hold the office to which he was elected as well as one or more offices to which he may be elected or appointed by the council. Sec. 5. The aldermen of said city (three from each ward) shall constitute the council of said city, and all the corporate powers of said city shall be exercised by said council, or under its authority, except when otherwise provided. Sec. 6. There may be elected by the council of said city from among the qualified voters of said city, an overseer of the poor, a city engineer, a street commissioner, a police justice, and such officers and clerks as said council may deem proper and necessary, and any one or more of said offices may be held and exercised by the same person. The officers herein mentioned shall be elected or appointed by the council on the first day of September, nineteen hundred and eight, or as soon thereafter as practicable, and biennially thereafter, except when elected to fill a vacancy (which may be done by the council) in which case the election shall be for the unexpired term. But no office or offices not specially provided for in this charter shall be created except by a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to the council in regular meeting assembled. It may be competent for the council, in order to secure the services of a suitable person as city engineer or street commissioner, to elect a non-resident to said offices, but each of said officers shall reside in the city during his tenure of office. Sec. 7. The mayor, aldermen and other officers elected by the people shall each, before entering upon the duties of their offices, take the oaths prescribed for all other officers by the laws of Virginia, and qualify before the corporation court of said city, or the judge thereof in vacation, and in the cases of the mayor and the aldermen, a certificate of such oaths having been taken, shall be filed by them, respectively, with the clerk of the council, who shall enter the same upon the journal of the council; but if any or either of said officers shall fail to qualify, as aforesaid, for ten days after the commencement of the term for which he, or they, were elected, or shall neglect for a like space of time to give such bond as may be required of him by the city council, his or their office shall be deemed vacant. Sec. 8. Whenever, from any cause, a vacancy shall occur in the office of mayor, alderman, president or vice-president of the council, the same shall be filled by the council at its next regular meeting from its own body or from the qualified electors of said city, and the officer thus elected shall hold his office for the term for which his predecessor was elected, unless sooner vacated by death, resignation, removal or from other cause: provided, that in case of an alderman, he shall be taken from the ward in which he is a voter. An entry of said election shall be made in the record book of the council. If the mayor of said city shall remove from the city limits, or an alderman shall remove from the ward which he represents, such removal shall operate to vacate his office. Sec. 9. At its first meeting in September, nineteen hundred and eight, and biennially thereafter, the council shall elect one of its members to act as president, who shall preside at its meetings and continue in office two years. Or if a vacancy occur in the office before the end of his term, such vacancy shall be filled by the council as provided in section eight. At the same time the council shall elect one of its members to be a vice-president, who shall preside at such meetings in the absence of the president, and who, when the president shall be absent or unable to perform the duties of his office, by reason of sickness or other cause, shall perform any and all duties required of, or entrusted to, the president, and when, for any cause, both the president and the vice-president shall be absent from any meeting, a president pro tempore shall be elected by the council, who shall preside. The president of the council, or the vice-president, when authorized, as above stated, to act, shall have power at any time to call a meeting of the council; and in case of absence, sickness, disability or refusal to act of both the president and the vice-president of the council, said council may be convened by the order in writing of any three members of the body, addressed to its clerk. Sec. 10. Seven aldermen shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the council. Sec. 11. The president, vice-president, or president pro tempore, as the case may be, shall be entitled to a vote on all questions before the council, as any other alderman, but in no case shall he be entitled to a second vote on any question, though it be necessary to break a tie—that is to say, his office shall not entitle him to a vote. Sec. 12. The council shall have authority to adopt such rules and to appoint such officers and clerks as it may deem proper for the regulation of its proceedings, and for the convenient transaction of business, to compel the attendance of absent members, to punish its members for disorderly behavior, and by vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to the council, expel a member for malfeasance or misfeasance in office. The council shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and its meetings shall be open, except when, by a recorded vote of two-thirds of those members present, the council shall declare that the public welfare requires secrecy. The council shall also require to be kept by its clerk a separate book, termed "the general ordinance book," in which shall be recorded all ordinances and resolutions of a general and permanent character, properly indexed and opened to the public inspection. Other documents or papers in the possession of the clerk of the council which may affect the interest of the city, shall not, without special order of the council, its president or vice-president, be exhibited, nor copies thereof furnished to other persons than the committees or city officials entitled thereto. Sec. 13. At each regular meeting of the council the proceedings of the last regular meeting and all intervening called meetings, shall be read to the council, and thereupon be corrected, if erroneous, and signed by the person presiding for the time being. Upon the call of any member the ayes and noes shall be recorded in the journal. Sec. 14. The council of the city shall have power within said city to control and manage the fiscal and municipal affairs of the city and all property, real and personal, belonging to said city; it shall have power to provide a revenue for the city, and approximate the same to its expenses, also to provide the annual assessments of taxable persons and property in the city, and it may make such ordinances, orders, and by-laws relating to the foregoing powers of this section as it shall deem proper and necessary. It shall likewise have power to make such ordinances, by-laws, orders and regulations as it may deem desirable to carry out the following powers which are hereby vested in it: First. To close, extend, widen, narrow, lay out, graduate, improve and otherwise alter streets and public alleys in the said city, and have them properly lighted and kept in good order, and it may make or construct sewers or ducts through the streets or public grounds of the city, and through any place, or places whatsoever, when it may be deemed by the said council expedient. The land included in any street that is closed shall revert to the abutting owners on either side of the same, each receiving one-half thereof. That is, the new line of each abutter shall be the middle of the former street. The said council may have over any street or alley in the city, which has been, or may be ceded to the city, like authority as over other streets or alleys, and may prevent or remove any structure, obstruction or encroachment over, or under, or in a street or alley, or any sidewalk thereof, and may have shade trees planted along the said streets. Second.

There shall be in every city a council, composed of two branches having a different number of members, whose powers and terms of office shall be prescribed by law, and whose members shall be elected by the qualified voters of such city, in the manner prescribed by law, but so as to give as far as practicable, to each ward of such city, equal representation in each branch of said council in proportion to the population of such ward; but in cities of under ten thousand population the General Assembly may permit the council to consist of one branch. No member of the council shall be eligible during his tenure of office as such member, or for one year thereafter, to any office to be filled by the council by election or appointment. The council of every city may, in a manner prescribed by law, increase or diminish the number, and change the boundaries, of the wards thereof, and shall, in the year nineteen hundred and three, and in every tenth year thereafter, and also whenever the boundaries of such wards are changed, re-apportion the representation in the council among the wards in a manner prescribed by law; and whenever the council of any such city shall fail to perform the duty so prescribed, a mandamus shall lie on behalf of any citizen thereof to compel its performance. Sec. 122. The mayors and councils of cities shall be elected on the second Tuesday in June, and their terms of office shall begin on the first day of September succeeding. All other elective officers, provided for by this article, or hereafter authorized by law, shall be elected on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, and their terms of office shall begin on the first day of January succeeding, except that the terms of office of clerk of the city courts shall begin coincidently with that of the judges of said courts: provided, that the General Assembly may change the time of election of all or any of the said officers, except that the election and the beginning of the terms of mayors and councils of cities shall not be made by the General Assembly to occur at the time with the election and beginning of the terms of office of the other elective officers provided by this Constitution. Sec. 123. Every ordinance, or resolution having the effect of an ordinance, shall, before it becomes operative, be presented to the mayor. If he approve he shall sign it, but if not, if the council consists of two branches, he may return it, with his objections in writing, to the clerk, or other recording officer, of that branch in which it originated, which branch shall enter the objections at length on its journal and proceed to reconsider it. If after such consideration two-thirds of all the members elected thereto shall agree to pass the ordinance or resolution it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other branch, by which it shall likewise be considered, and if approved by two-thirds of all the members elected thereto, it shall become operative notwithstanding the objections of the mayor. But in all such cases the votes of both branches of the council shall be determined by yeas and nays, and the names of the members voting for and against the ordinance or resolution shall be entered on the journal of each branch. If the council consists of a single branch, the mayor's objections in writing to any ordinance, or resolution having the effect of an ordinance, shall be returned to the clerk or other recording officer of the council, and be entered at length on its journal; whereupon the council shall proceed to reconsider the same. Upon such consideration the vote shall be taken in the same manner as where the council consists of two branches, and if the ordinance or resolution be approved by two-thirds of all the members elected to the council, it shall become operative notwithstanding the objections of the mayor. If any ordinance or resolution shall not be returned by the mayor within five days (Sunday excepted), after it shall have been presented to him, it shall become operative in like manner as if he had signed it, unless his term of office, or that of the council, shall expire within said five days. The mayor shall have the power to veto any particular item or items of an appropriation ordinance or resolution; but the veto shall not affect any item or items to which he does not object. The item or items objected to shall not take effect except in the manner provided in this section as to ordinances or resolutions not approved by the mayor. No ordinance or resolution appropriating money exceeding the sum of one hundred dollars, imposing taxes, or authorizing the borrowing of money, shall be passed, except by a recorded affirmative vote of a majority of all the members elected to the council or to each branch thereof where there are two; and in case of the veto by the mayor of such ordinances or resolution, it shall require a recorded affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to the council, or to each branch thereof where there are two to pass the same over such veto in the manner provided in this section. Nothing contained in this section shall operate to repeal or amend any provision in any existing city charter requiring a two-thirds vote for the passage of any ordinance as to the appropriation of money, imposing taxes or authorizing the borrowing of money. Sec. 124. No street railway, gas, water, steam or electric heating, electric light or power, cold storage, compressed air, viaduct, conduit, telephone or bridge company, nor any corporation, association, person or partnership, engaged in these or like enterprises, shall be permitted to use the streets, alleys or public grounds of a city or town without the previous consent of the corporate authorities of such city or town. Sec. 125. The rights of no city or town in and to its water front, wharf property, public places, and its gas, water and electric works shall be sold except by an ordinance or resolution passed by a recorded affirmative vote of three-fourths of all the members elected to the council, or to each branch thereof where there are two, and under such other restrictions as may be imposed by law; and in case of the veto by the mayor of such an ordinance or resolution, it shall require a recorded affirmative vote of three-fourths of all members elected to the council, or to each branch thereof where there are two, had in the manner heretofore provided for in this article, to pass the same over the veto. No franchise, lease or right of any kind to use any such public property or any other public property or easement of any description, in a manner not permitted to the general public, shall be granted for a longer period than thirty years. Before granting any such franchise or privilege for a term of years, except for a trunk railway, the municipality shall first, after due advertisement, receive bids therefor publicly, in such manner as may be provided by law, and shall then act as may be required by law. Such grant, and any contract in pursuance thereof, may provide that upon the termination of the grant the plant as well as the property, if any, of the grantee in the streets, avenues and other public places shall thereupon, without compensation to the grantee, or upon the payment of a fair valuation therefor, be and become the property of the said city or town; but the grantee shall be entitled to no payment by reason of the value of the franchise; and any such plant or property acquired by a city or town may be sold or leased, or, if authorized by law, maintained, controlled and operated, by such city or town. Every such grant shall specify the mode of determining any valuation therein provided for, and shall make adequate provision by way of forfeiture of the grant, or otherwise, to secure efficiency of public service at reasonable rates, and the maintenance of the property in good order throughout the term of the grant. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as preventing the General Assembly from presenting additional restrictions on the powers of cities and towns in granting franchises or in selling or leasing any of their property, or as repealing any additional restriction now required in relation thereto in any existing municipal charter. Sec. 126. The General Assembly shall provide by general laws for the extension and the contraction, from time to time, of the corporate limits of cities and towns; and no special act for such purpose shall be valid. Sec. 127. No city or town shall issue any bonds or other interest bearing obligations for any purpose, or in any manner, to an amount which, including existing indebtedness, shall, at any time, exceed eighteen per centum of the assessed valuation of the real estate in the city or town subject to taxation, as shown by the last preceding assessment for taxes: provided, however, that nothing above contained in this section shall apply to those cities and towns whose charters existing at the adoption of this Constitution authorize a larger percentage of indebtedness than is authorized by this section: and provided further, that in determining the limitation of the power of a city or town to incur indebtedness there shall not be included the following classes of indebtedness: (a) Certificates of indebtedness, revenue bonds or other obligations issued in anticipation of the collection of the revenue of such city or town for the then current year; provided, that such certificates, bonds or other obligations mature within one year from the date of their issue, and be not past due, and do not exceed the revenue for such year; (b) Bonds authorized by an ordinance enacted in accordance with section one hundred and twenty-three, and approved by the affirmative vote of the majority of the qualified voters of the city or town voting upon the question of their issuance, at the general election next succeeding the enactment of the ordinance, or at a special election held for that purpose, for a supply of water or other specific undertaking from which the city or town may derive a revenue; but from and after a period to be determined by the council, not exceeding five years from the date of such election, whenever and for so long as such undertaking fails to produce sufficient revenue to pay for cost of operation and administration (including interest on bonds issued therefor, and the cost of insurance against loss by injury to persons or property), and an annual amount to be covered into a sinking fund sufficient to pay, at or before maturity, all bonds issued on account of said undertaking, all such bonds outstanding shall be included in determining the limitation of the power to incur indebtedness, unless the principal and interest thereof be made payable exclusively from the receipts of the undertaking. Sec. 128. In cities and towns the assessments of real estate and personal property for the purpose of municipal taxation, shall be the same as the assessment thereof for the purpose of State taxation, whenever there shall be a State assessment of such property.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS RELATING TO CITIES UP TO AND INCLUDING THE YEAR 1908. (So far as applicable to the City of Charlottesville). CODE OF VIRGINIA. Sec. 114. Councils of cities to establish election districts. The council of a city shall establish for each ward as many election districts as they may deem necessary, and a voting place in each district (but so that there shall not be less than one election district for every one thousand voters or fractional part thereof above five hundred), and prescribe and cause to be published the boundaries of said districts; and they may alter the boundaries of any such election district, and arrange, increase or diminish the number thereof, and change the voting places or establish others therein, not to exceed, however, one voting place for each election district: provided, that no change shall be made in any of the said boundaries or voting places within thirty days next preceding any general election. Sec. 823. Councilment and other city officers forbidden to have interest in contract with, or claim against their city; such contract to be void. It shall not be lawful for any member of the council or board of aldermen, or any other officer, or agent, or any commissioner appointed for the opening of streets, or any other member of a committee constituted or appointed for the management, regulation or control of corporate property of any city, during their term for which they are elected or appointed, to be a contractor, or sub-contractor, with the said corporation, or its agents, or with such committee, nor shall they be interested, directly or indirectly, in any contract, sub-contract or job of work, or materials, or the profits or contract price thereof, or any services to be performed for the city for pay under any contract or subcontract; and no such councilman, officer or employee shall be interested, directly or indirectly, in any contract, sub-contract, or job of work, or materials, or the profits or contract price thereof, or services to be furnished or performed for the city for pay under any contract or sub-contract; nor as agent for such contractor, or sub-contractor, or other person furnishing any supplies or materials. Every such contract or sub-contract shall be void, and the officer, councilmen, agent, or member of such committee making such contract shall forfeit to the Commonwealth the full amount stipulated for thereby. No officer of a city, who alone or with others is charged with the duty of auditing, settling, or providing, by levy or otherwise, for the payment of claims against such city, shall, by contract, directly or indirectly, become the owner of or interested in any claim against such city. Every such contract or sub-contract void, and if any such claim be paid, the amount paid, with interest, may be recovered back by the city, within two years after payment, by action or motion in the Circuit or Corporation or Hustings Court having jurisdiction over said city. Sec. 1013a. Definitions of the words "incorporated communities," "cities" and "towns." As used in this chapter the words "incorporated communities" shall be construed only to relate to cities and towns; all incorporated communities having within defined boundaries a population of five thousand or more shall be known as cities, and all incorporated communities having within defined boundaries a population of less than five thousand shall be known as towns; but nothing in this section shall be construed to repeal the charter of any incorporated community of less than five thousand inhabitants, having a city charter at the time this act takes effect, or to prevent the abolition by such incorporated communities of the Corporation or Hustings Court thereof. Sec. 1014. Survey and plan of cities and towns to be made and recorded; effect of plan as evidence. The council of every city and town shall (unless it has already been done) cause to be made a survey and plan of such city or town, showing distinctly each lot, public street, and alley therein, the size and number of the lots, and the width of the streets and alleys, with such explanations or remarks as they may deem proper. The said plan, when approved by the council, shall be entered in some one of their books, and afterwards recorded, in the case of a city, in the clerk's office of the Corporation or Hustings Court of such city, and in case of a town, in the clerk's office of the county in which said town or the greater part thereof is, and when so recorded shall remain in said office. Said plan shall be prima facie evidence of the boundaries of the said lots, streets and alleys. Sec. 1015. Wards of cities; how changed; map of wards to be recorded, and description, etc., published. The wards of the several cities shall be as now established, except that the council of any city, in addition to the powers conferred upon them by section one hundred and fourteen, shall have power, from time to time, to alter boundaries and the names or numbers of the wards of said city, or any of them, and rearrange, increase, or diminish the number thereof, as they may deem proper, subject, however, to the provisions of sections ten hundred and fifteen (b) and tend hundred and fifteen (c) of this chapter. When any such change is made, the council shall cause a map or diagram to be made of the wards as changed, showing distinctly the boundaries and name or number of each, and lodge the same with the clerk of the Corporation or Hustings Court of the city, who shall record the same in his office and furnish an attested copy thereof to the keeper of the rolls. The council shall, moreover, as soon as the change has been made, cause a description of the boundaries and the names or numbers of the wards, as changed, to be published for ten days in some newspaper of general circulation published in the said city: provided, that no such change shall be made within thirty days next preceding any general election in said city. The council of any such city shall, in making any such change, so provide that each ward shall contain as nearly as may be an equal number of inhabitants, and for the transfer of all registered voters to the proper precincts and wards without re-registration by them on account of such change. Sec. 1015a. Councils of cities. There shall be in every city a council. In cities of ten thousand —3 or more population it shall consist of two branches, having a different number of members, one of which shall be called the "common council," and be composed of not less than fourteen nor more than forty members, and the other shall be called the "board of aldermen," and be composed of not less than eight nor more than twenty-two members. In cities of under ten thousand population the council shall consist of only one branch, which shall be called its common council, and be composed of not less than eight nor more than forty members. The members of the council of each city, and of each branch thereof, when the council consists of two branches, shall be residents of their respective wards and qualified voters therein, and shall be elected by the qualified voters of such wards, and, so far as practicable, each ward in every city shall have equal representation in the council, and in each branch thereof, where it consists of two branches, in proportion to the population of such ward. The members of every council, and of each branch thereof, when it consists of two branches, shall be elected for a term of four years; but upon the first assembling under this act of every council, and of each branch thereof, where there are two, the members of each branch thereof shall be divided into two equal classes, to be determined by lot, and the term of the members of the first class shall be two years, and that of the members of the second class shall be four years, and thereafter the terms of all the members of each class shall be four years, so that one-half of each branch shall be elected every two years: provided, however, that in cases where the total membership of a branch is uneven, provision may be made in such division into classes for the assignment of the odd number to one of such classes: and provided, that all elections to fill vacancies in any council shall be for the unexpired term: and provided, further, that nothing in this section in conflict with the charter of any city, whose council now consists of two branches, shall affect the charter of said city, except in so far as the same is affected by the Constitution. * * * In any city having a population of ten thousand or more, where the council now consists of only one branch, it shall be the duty of said council to provide by ordinance for the number of members of each branch, and to apportion the same among the wards of said city. Sec. 1015b. Council to reapportion representation among wards; when obligatory upon council to change boundaries of wards. The council, in every city, shall, in the year nineteen hundred and three, and every tenth year thereafter, and also whenever the boundaries of the wards of the city are changed, prescribe by ordinance the number of members of each branch of the council and reapportion the representation therein among the wards, but so as to give, as far as practicable, to each ward of such city equal representation in the council and in each branch thereof in proportion to the population of each ward. In determining such population, the council shall be governed by the last United States census, or by an enumeration to be provided for by ordinance of said council or such other enumeration as may be provided for by law: provided, however, that whenever, by the last United States census, or other enumeration made by authority of the council or as may be provided by law, it shall appear that the population in any ward exceeds that of any other ward by as much as three thousand inhabitants, or whenever the corporate limits of the city shall be extended or contracted, or whenever in the opinion of the council it is necessary, it shall be the duty of the city council to redistrict the city into wards, or so increase or diminish the number of wards as that no one ward shall exceed any other ward in population by more than three thousand inhabitants. For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this section, or whenever it shall be considered to the interest of the city, the council of each city shall have full power, by ordinance, to authorize an enumeration of the population of the city, and of the different wards thereof by such number of enumerators, with such compensation, and in such manner, as may be provided for in such ordinance: provided, that wherever such enumeration is authorized the enumerators provided for in such ordinance shall be named by the judge of the corporation court of said city, or if there be none, by the judge of the circuit court having jursidiction thereof: provided, however, that, if, by any change of the boundaries of a ward, or by the increase or diminution of the number of wards, any officer, who is required by law to be a resident of the ward from which he is elected or appointed, shall become a resident of a different ward, such officer shall, notwithstanding, serve as such to the end of his term. (An Act approved March 10, 1906—Acts 1906, p. 193.) 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Virginia, That an act approved March twelfth, nineteen hundred and four, entitled an act to amend and re-enact section one of an act approved March twenty-eight, nineteen hundred and three, in relation to changing the boundaries of wards in cities and for increasing or diminishing the number thereof, be amended and re-enacted so as to read as follows: Sec. 1. Be it enacted by the general assembly of Virginia, That in each city in this Commonwealth there shall be as many wards as the city council may establish; provided, however, that whenever, by the last United States census or other enumeration made by authority of law, it shall appear that the population in any ward exceeds that of any other ward by as much as three thousand inhabitants, or whenever in the opinion of the council it is necessary, or whenever the corporate limits of the city shall be extended or contracted, if necessary, it shall be the duty of the city council to redistrict the city into wards, or so change the boundaries of existing wards, or so increase or diminish the number of wards as that no one ward shall exceed any other ward in population by more than three thousand inhabitants. But in no case shall the city council redistrict the city into wards or change the boundaries of existing wards, except in so far as it may be necessary to change such boundaries for the purpose of attaching newly annexed territory to such existing ward or wards as may be contiguous thereto, oftener than once every five years, except upon a recorded vote of three-fourths of the members elected to the council, or three-fourths of the members elected to each branch thereof, when the council is composed of two branches; and in every such case the reason therefor shall be set forth in the ordinance providing for such redistricting: and provided, that whenever the city shall be so redistricted the judge of the corporation or hustings court shall appoint three commissioners, whose duty it shall be to rearrange and revise the registration books of said city, so as to place each registered voter on the proper precinct and ward registration books, and for this purpose the registrars shall, upon the order of the corporation court or judge thereof, deliver to the commissioners so appointed the registration books for the purposes aforesaid. The commissioner shall receive such compensation as the judge of the corporation court may allow to be paid by the city, together with all other expenses incurred thereby. A mandamus shall lie on behalf of any citizen to compel the performance by the council of the duty so prescribed. 2. In all cases in which cities have been redistricted into wards, or in which the boundary lines of existing wards have been changed, the ordinances of the said councils in so doing, which were first adopted since the present constitution took effect, are hereby validated; and said wards as designated and established thereby, are hereby declared to be the existing wards of said cities, and the time within which the same may be again altered or changed, or said cities redistricted, shall be computed from the date of the adoption of said ordinances, respectively. 3. No ordinance of any city redistricting the same into wards, or changing the bounds of existing wards, which may be adopted between the passage of this act and the time when the same shall take effect, shall be valid unless the same be adopted by a recorded vote of three-fourths of all the members elected to the council, or three-fourths of all the members elected to each branch, where the council is composed of two branches. 4. All acts or parts of acts inconsistent with this act are hereby repealed. Sec. 1015c. Mandamus to lie in case of failure of council to reapportion representation or change boundaries or wards as prescribed in the preceding section. Whenever the council of any city shall fail to perform the duty of reapportioning the representation among the wards of such city, or shall fail to change the boundaries of wards, as prescribed in the preceding section, a mandamus shall lie in favor of any citizen of any such city to compel the performance of such duty. Sec. 1015d. Members of city councils to be ineligible during tenure of office, and for one year thereafter, to any office to be filled by the council of which they may be members. No member of any council shall be eligible, during his tenure of office as such member, or for one year thereafter, to any office to be filled by the council—by election or by appointment. Sec. 1015e. Vacancy; how filled. When any vacancy shall occur in the council of a city having one branch, or in either branch of the council of any city having two branches, by death, resignation, removal from the ward, failure to qualify, or from any other cause, the council, or the branch, as the case may be, in which such vacancy occurs, shall elect a qualified person to supply the vacancy for the unexpired term. Sec. 1015f. Presiding officers of city councils; their duties. The council of a city having one branch, and each branch of the council of a city having two branches, shall elect one of its members to act as president, who shall preside at its meetings and continue in office two years, unless elected to fill a vacancy, when the election shall be for the unexpired term. The council, or each branch, as the case may be, shall also elect one of its members to be a vice-president, who shall preside at such meetings in the absence of the president, and who, when the president shall be absent from the city or unable to perform the duties of his office by reason of sickness or other cause, shall perform any and all duties required of or entrusted to such president under any provision of this chapter. When, for any cause, both the president and the vice-president shall be absent from any meeting, a president pro tempore shall be elected by the council or by that branch in which such absence may occur, who shall preside during the absence of the president and vice-president. The president, vice-president, or president pro tempore, who shall preside when the proceedings of a previous meeting are read, shall sign the same. The president of the council, or of either branch, or the vice-president, when authorized as above stated to act for the president, shall have power at any time to call a meeting of the council, or of his branch of the council, as the case may be; and, in case of absence, sickness, disability, or refusal to act of both the president and the vice-president of the council, or branch of the council, it may be convened by the order in writing of any three members of said council or branch. Sec. 1015g. Rules and officers of councils; investigations by councils and by boards of fire and police commissioners. The council, or each branch as the case may be, shall have authority to adopt such rules and to appoint such officers and clerks as it may deem proper for the regulation of its proceedings, and for the convenient transaction of business, to compel the attendance of absence members, to punish its members for disorderly behavior, and by a vote of two-thirds of its members, to expel a member for malfeasance or misfeasance in office. The council, or each branch, shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and its meeting shall be open, except when by a recorded vote of two-thirds of those members present, the council shall declare that the public welfare requires secrecy. The council, or either branch of the council, or any of its committees, when authorized by the said council or branch, the board of police commissioners, and the board of fire commissioners, if there be such boards, may each, in any investigation held by them, respectively, within their respective powers and duties, order the attendance of any person as a witness, and the production by any person of all proper books and papers. Any person refusing or failing to attend or to testify, or to produce such books and papers, may be summoned by such investigating body before the police justice, or in case there is no police justice, before the mayor, or other officer having the powers of a justice of the peace of the city, and upon failure to give a satisfactory excuse, may be fined by him not exceeding the sum of one hundred dollars, or imprisoned not exceeding thirty days, such person to have the right of appeal, as in cases of misdemeanor, to the hustings or corporation court of said city. Such witness may be sworn by the officer presiding at such investigation, and shall be liable to prosecution for perjury for any false testimony given at such investigation. Sec. 1015h. Rules as to quorum and the passage of certain ordinances. A majority of the members of the council, or of either branch, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. No vote shall be considered or rescinded at any special meeting, unless at such special meeting there be present as large a number of members as were present when such vote was taken. No ordinance or resolution appropriating money exceeding the sum of one thousand dollars, imposing taxes, or authorizing the borrowing of money shall be passed by the two branches on the same day, neither shall the branch in which any such ordinance or resolution is proposed, whether the council be composed of one or of two branches, pass the same on the day of its introduction, nor shall any such ordinance or resolution be valid unless at least three days intervene between its passage by the said branches respectively. Sec. 1016. Election or appointment of charter officers of cities. The officers of all cities, whose election or appointment is not otherwise provided for herein or under the general statutes of the State or charters of the several cities, shall be elected or appointed by the councils of the several cities: provided, that where provisions are made in the charter of any city for the office of register, or chamberlain, or assessor, no such officers shall be elected, but the duties heretofore devolving on such register, or chamberlain, shall be performed by the city treasurer, and the duties heretofore devolved on such assessors shall be performed by the commissioner of revenue: and provided, further, that wherever the council consists of more than one branch, the election or appointment by the city council shall be made by the two branches in joint meeting. The president of the board of aldermen shall preside at such joint meeting, and each member of the two branches shall be entitled to one vote in all such elections or appointments, as well as in all other joint meetings of the two branches of the council. Sec. 1017a. Powers and duties of the police force of the cities and towns of the Commonwealth of Virginia. (1) The officers and privates constituting the police force of the cities and towns of the Commonwealth of Virginia shall be, and they are hereby, invested with all the power and authority which now belong to the office of constable at common law in taking cognizance of, and in enforcing the criminal laws of the said Commonwealth, and the ordinances and regulations of the city or town, respectively, for which they are appointed or elected; and it shall be the duty of each and every one of such policemen to use his best endeavors to prevent the commission, within the said city or town, of offenses against the laws of said Commonwealth and against the ordinances and regulations of said city or town; to observe and enforce all such laws, ordinances and regulations; to detect and arrest offenders against the same; to preserve the good order of the said city or town, and to secure the inhabitants thereof from violence and the property therein from injury. (2) Such policeman shall have no power or authority in civil matters, but he shall in all other cases execute such warrant or summons as may be placed in his hands by any justice of the peace for said city or town, and shall make due return thereof. (3) Such policeman shall not receive any fee or other compensation out of the treasury of the Commonwealth or the city or town, for any service rendered under the provisions of this act other than the salary paid him by the city or town, and a fee as a witness in cases arising under the criminal laws of the said Commonwealth, except such policeman shall not receive any fee as a witness in any case arising under the ordinances of his city or town; nor for attendance as a witness before any police justice, or justice of the peace in his city or town. If, however, it shall become necessary or expedient for him to travel beyond the limits of said city or town in his capacity as a policeman, he shall be entitled to his actual expenses, to be allowed and paid as is now provided by law for other expenses in criminal cases. (4) Nothing contained in this act shall be construed as prohibiting a policeman from claiming and receiving any reward which may be offered for the arrest and detention of any offender against the criminal laws of this or any other Commonwealth or nation. Sec. 1018. Of city sergeant. The sergeant of a city shall perform the duties, receive the compensation, and be subject to the liabilities prescribed in the charter of his city or by law, and shall also, within the jurisdiction of the court of his city, exercise the same powers, perform the same duties, and be subject to the same liabilities touching all process issued by the court of such city, or by the clerk of such court, or otherwise lawfully directed to him, that the sheriff of a county exercises, performs, and is subject to in his county. Sec. 1019. Allowance to sergeant by city court. There shall be chargeable to each city such sums as the court thereof may allow to the sergeant attending it for services rendered to the said city: provided, that no such allowance shall be made under this section for services rendered by the said officer in criminal prosecutions on behalf of the Commonwealth; but the judge of the Hustings or Corporation Court of any city may, with the consent of the city council, make allowance to the sergeant of said city for services in criminal cases, payable out of the city treasury. Sec. 1032a. Clerk of courts of cities. In each city which has a court, in whose office deeds are admitted to record, there shall be elected for a term of eight years, by the qualified voters of such city, a clerk of said court, who shall perform such other duties as may be required by law. There shall be elected, in like manner and for a like term, all such additional clerks of courts for cities as may be authorized by law, so long as such courts shall continue in existence. But in no city of less than thirty thousand inhabitants shall there be more than one clerk of the court, who shall be clerk of all the courts of record in such city. Sec. 1032c. City and town officers to be chosen by electors when not otherwise provided. All city and town officers, whose election or appointment is not otherwise provided for, shall be elected by the electors of such city or town, or of some division thereof. Sec. 1033. Mayors of cities; how chosen; their duties; appeals from their decisions; how removed for malfeasance, et cetera. In every city there shall be elected by the qualified voters thereof a mayor for a term of four years, who shall be the chief executive officer of such city, and shall take care that the by-laws and ordinances thereof are fully executed. The mayor shall see that the duties of the various city officers, members of the police and fire departments, whether elected or appointed, in and for such city, are faithfully performed. He shall have power to investigate their acts, have access to all books and documents in their offices, and may examine them and their subordinates on oath. The evidence given by persons so examined shall not be used against them in any criminal proceedings. He shall also have power to suspend such officers and the members of the police and fire departments, and to remove such officers for misconduct in office or neglect of duty, to be specified in the order or suspension or removal; but no such removal shall be made without reasonable notice to the officer complained of, and an opportunity afforded him to be heard in person or by counsel, and to present testimony in his defense. From such order of suspension or removal, the city officer so suspended or removed, or the member of the police or fire department so suspended, unless the charter of the city provides for an appeal to the board of police commissioners, or to the board of fire commissioners, shall have an appeal of right to the corporation court; or, if there be no such court, to the circuit court of such city, in which court the case shall be heard de novo by the judge thereof, in term time or in vacation, whose decision shall be final. He shall have all other powers and duties which may be conferred and imposed upon him by general laws. The corporation court of a city may remove the mayor of said city from office for malfeasance, misfeasance, or gross neglect of official duty, and such removal shall be deemed a vacation of the office. All proceedings against a mayor for the purpose of removing him from office shall be by order of or motion before said court, upon reasonable notice to the party affected thereby, and with the right to said party of an appeal to the supreme court of appeals. In event of the death, resignation, removal of the mayor, or his inability to discharge his duties from some other cause, his place shall be filled and his duties shall be discharged by the president of the board of aldermen or by the president of the council, according as the city council has or has not the branches, until another mayor is elected and qualified, or until such inability shall cease. Within ten days after such death, resignation, or removal of the mayor, the corporation or hustings court of the city shall order a special election, which shall be held within thirty days after such order is entered, to fill the unexpired term of such mayor: provided, the unexpired part of said term remaining after such election is as much as one year. But nothing in this section shall be construed to alter or repeal the provisions of the charter of any city regulating the filling of any vacancy in the office of mayor. Sec. 1033b. Mayors, councils, and other elective officers of cities; when elected; when their terms begin, et cetera. The mayors and councils of cities shall be elected on the second Tuesday in June, immediately preceding the expiration of the term of office of their predecessors, and their terms of office shall begin on the first day of September succeeding; all other city officers elected by the electors of such cities shall be elected on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, and their terms of office shall begin on the first day of January succeeding, except that the terms of office of clerks of city courts shall begin coincidently with those of the judge of their said courts. The terms of members of the city council now in office shall be continued until September first, nineteen hundred and four, and all elections to fill such offices thereafter shall be held in pursuance of section ten hundred and fifteen (a) of this act. Sec. 1033c. Veto power of mayor of city: when ordinance may become operative, notwithstanding his objection; vote to be entered on journal; no ordinance, et cetera, appropriating over one hundred dollars in money or authorizing the borrowing of money to be passed, except by recorded affirmative vote of a majority of all members. Every ordinance, or resolution having the effect of an ordinance, passed by the council of a city, shall, before it becomes operative, be presented to the mayor of such city. If he approve he shall sign it, but if not, if the council consists of two branches, he may return it, with his objections in writing, to the clerk, or other recording officer, of that branch in which it originated; which branch shall enter the objections at length on its journal and proceed to reconsider it. If, after such consideration, two-thirds of all the members elected thereto shall agree to pass the ordinance or resolution, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other branch, by which it shall likewise be considered, and if approved by two-thirds of all the members elected thereto, it shall become operative, notwithstanding the objections of the mayor. But in all such cases the votes of both branches of the council shall be determined by yeas and nays, and the names of the members voting for and against the ordinance or resolution shall be entered on the journal of each branch. * * * If any ordinance or resolution shall not be returned by the mayor within five days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, it shall become operative in like manner as if he had signed it, unless his term of office, or that of the council, shall expire within said five days. The mayor of a city shall have the power to veto any particular item or items of an appropriation ordinance or resolution; but the veto shall not affect any item or items to which he does not object. The item or items objected to shall not take effect, except in the manner provided in this section as to ordinances or resolutions not approved by the mayor. No ordinance or resolution appropriating money exceeding the sum of one hundred dollars, imposing taxes, or authorizing the borrowing of money, shall be passed, except by a recorded affirmative vote of a majority of all the members elected to the council or to each branch thereof, where there are two; and in case of the veto by the mayor of such ordinance or resolution, it shall require a recorded affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to the council, or to each branch thereof, where there are two, to pass the same over such veto in the manner provided in this section. Nothing contained in this section shall operate to repeal or amend any provision in any existing city charter requiring a two-thirds vote for the passage of any ordinance as to the appropriation of money, imposing taxes, or authorizing the borrowing of money. Sec. 1033d. Streets, et cetera, of cities and towns not to be used for certain purposes, without previous consent of corporate authorities. No street railway, gas, water, steam or electric heating, electric light or power, cold storage, compressed air, viaduct, conduit, telephone or bridge company, nor any corporation, association, person or partnership engaged in these or like enterprises, shall be permitted to use the streets, alleys, or public grounds of a city or town, without the previous consent of the corporate authorities of such city or town. Sec. 1033e. Restrictions on the granting of franchises and selling of public property by cities and towns. The rights of no city or town in and to its water front, wharf property, public landings, wharves, docks, streets, avenues, parks, bridges, and other public places, and its gas, water, and electric works shall be sold, except by an ordinance or resolution passed by a recorded affirmative vote of three-fourths of all the members elected to the council, or to each branch thereof, where there are two, had in the manner heretofore provided for in this chapter, to pass the same over the veto. No franchise, lease or right of any kind to use any such public property, or any other public property or easement of any description, in a manner not permitted to the general public, shall be granted for a longer period than thirty years, except for a trunk railway, the municipality shall first, after due advertisement, receive bids therefor publicly, in such manner as is provided by the following section, and shall then act as may be required by law. Such grant, and any contract in pursuance thereof, may provide that upon the termination of the grant the plant as well as the property, if any, of the grantee in the streets, avenues and other public places shall thereupon, without compensation to the grantee, or upon the payment of a fair valuation therefor, be and become the property of the said city or town; but the grantee shall be entitled to no payment by reason of the value of the franchise; and any such plant or property acquired by a city or town may be sold or leased, or, if authorized by law, maintained, controlled, and operated by such city or town. Every such grant shall specify the mode of determining any valuation therein provided for, and shall make adequate provision by way of forfeiture of the grant, or otherwise, to secure efficiency of public service at reasonable rates, and the maintenance of the property in good order throughout the term of the grant. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as repealing any additional restriction now required in any existing municipal charter, in relation to the powers of cities and towns in granting franchises or in selling any of their property. Sec. 1033f. Regulating the grant of franchise, et cetera, by cities and towns, and providing for the advertisement thereof and the public reception of bids therefor, and providing for the enforcement of the obligations of the grantees, grantors, or owners of franchises, and providing penalties for the usurpation of or violation of the terms and provisions of franchises. (1) Before granting any franchise, privilege, lease, or right of any kind to use any public property, or easement of any description, except in the case of and for a trunk railway, it shall be the duty of the city or town proposing to make the grant to advertise the ordinance proposing to make the grant, after its terms shall have been approved by the mayor, or the ordinance passed over the mayor's veto, as in case of other ordinances, once a week for four successive weeks in a newspaper published in said city or town; or, if no newspaper be published therein, then in some newspaper having general circulation therein; and the ordinance may be also advertised as many times in such other newspaper or newspapers, published in or out of the city or State, as the council or board of trustees, as the case may be, may select and determine upon. (2) Such advertisement shall invite bids for the franchise, privilege, or right proposed to be granted in the ordinance, which bids are to be in writing and delivered upon a day and hour named in the advertisement to the presiding officer of the council or board of trustees of the city or town; or, if there be more than one branch thereof, to the presiding officer of the most numerous branch of the city council, in open session. The costs of the advertising herein required shall be paid by the city or town; which, however, shall be reimbursed by the person or corporation to whom the grant is finally made. The city or town shall have the right to reject any and all bids, and shall reserve this right in the advertisement hereinbefore required. (3) The presiding officer aforesaid shall read aloud, or cause to be read aloud, the bids that have been received for public information, and shall then inquire if any further bids are offered. If further bids are offered they shall be received until no further bid is offered; but if not, the presiding officer shall declare the bidding closed, and the bids that have been received shall be communicated in due course to the other branch of the city council, if there be another branch. After reference to committee and such other investigation as the council, or either branch of the council, sees fit to make, it shall be the duty of the council, if it sees fit to make the grant, to accept the highest and best bid, and to enact the ordinance as advertised, without substantial variation, except as to the insertion of the name of the accepted bidder: provided, that the council may, by a recorded vote of a majority of the members elected to the council, and to each branch thereof, if it be a council having two branches, reject a higher and accept a lower bid, and award the said franchise, right, or privilege to the lower bidder, if, in its opinion, some reason affecting the interest of the city or town makes it advisable so to do, which reason shall be itself expressed in the body of the subsequent ordinance granting the franchise, right, or privilege; but if, after such advertisements, no bid, or no satisfactory bid, shall be made, the council may advertise for further bids, and in case no bid at all is made, the council may, if it sees fit so to do, enact an ordinance in the manner required by law granting such franchises, rights, or privileges to any person or corporation making application therefor: provided, further, however, that the person or corporation to whom any such franchise, right or privilege is awarded, whether by competing bids or otherwise, as hereinbefore provided, shall first execute a bond, with good and sufficient security, in favor of the city or town, in such sum as said city or town shall determine, conditioned upon the constructing and putting into operation and maintaining the plant or plants provided for in the franchise, right, or privilege granted. (4) The subsequent ordinance actually making the grant, with a detailed list giving names, amounts, and addresses of all bidders, shall be presented to the mayor for his information and for his approval or disapproval, as in the case of all other ordinances. (5) No amendment or extension of any such franchise, right, or privilege that now exists, or that may hereafter be authorized, which extends or enlarges such franchise, right, or privilege, either as to the time during which it is to last or as to the territory in which it is to be enjoyed, shall be granted by any city or town until the provisions of this act shall have been complied with; and no amendment that releases the grantee, or his assignee, from the performance of any duty required by the ordinance granting the franchise, or that authorizes an increase in the charges to be made by such grantee or assignee, for the use by the public of the benefits of such franchise, shall be granted unless and until notice of such proposed amendment shall be given to the public by advertising the proposed amendment for ten days in some newspaper published in the city or town; or, if there be no newspaper published therein, then in some newspaper having circulation therein. The cost of such advertising shall be paid by the city or town, which shall be reimbursed by the person to whom the amendment is granted. No such amendment shall be adopted except by ordinance. (6) The corporation courts of the cities and the circuit courts of the counties in which the towns may be situated shall have jurisdiction by mandamus, according to the provisions of section one hundred and forty-four of the Code of Virginia, to enforce compliance by said cities or towns and by all grantees of franchises, whether now in force or granted under the provisions of this act, with all the terms and contracts and obligations of either party, as contained in franchises. Services of process in such mandamus proceeding may be made upon any agent or employee of such grantees residing in said city or town, or otherwise, as provided by law for service of process on a defendant: provided, however, that such jurisdiction in mandamus shall not preclude any party from bringing any other suit or —4 action which such party would be entitled to bring without the passage of this act, at law or in equity. (7) Any person or corporation that shall undertake to occupy or use any of the streets, avenues, parks, bridges, or any other public places or public property, or any public easement of any description in any city or town, in a manner not permitted to the general public, without having first legally obtained the consent thereto of the city council or board of trustees, as the case may be, or a franchise therefor, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not less than five dollars nor more than fifty dollars, each day's continuance thereof to be a separate offense, and such occupancy shall be deemed a nuisance, and the court or justice trying the case shall have power to cause the said nuisance to be abated, and to commit the offenders and all their agents and employees engaged in such offenses to jail until such order of the court shall be obeyed. Sec. 1033g. Regulating the issue of bonds and other interest-bearing obligations by cities and towns. No city or town shall issue any bonds or other interest-bearing obligations for any purpose, or in any manner, to an amount which, including existing indebtedness, shall at any time exceed eighteen per centum of the assessed valuation of the real estate in the city or town subject to taxation, as shown by the last preceding assessment for taxes: provided, however, that nothing above contained in this section shall apply to those cities and towns whose charters, existing at time of the adoption of the Constitution, which went into effect July tenth, nineteen hundred and two, authorize a larger percentage of indebtedness than is authorized by this section: and provided, further, that in determining the limitation of the power of a city or town to incur indebtedness, there shall not be included the following classes of indebtedness: (a) Certificates of indebtedness, revenue bonds, or other obligations issued in anticipation of the collection of the revenue of such city or town for the then current year: provided, that such certificates, bonds, or other obligations mature within one year from the date of their issue, and be not past due, and do not exceed the revenue for such year. (b) Bonds authorized by an ordinance enacted in accordance with section one hundred and twenty-three of the Constitution, and approved by the affirmative vote of the majority of the qualified voters of the city or town voting upon the question of their issuance, at the general election next succeeding the enactment of the ordinance, or at a special election held for that purpose, for a supply of water, or other specific undertaking from which the city or town may derive a revenue; but from and after a period to be determined by the council, not exceeding five years from the date of such election, whenever and for so long as such undertaking fails to produce sufficient revenue to pay for cost of operation and administration (including interest on bonds issued therefor and the cost of insurance against loss by injury to person or property), and an annual amount to be covered into a sinking fund sufficient to pay, at or before maturity, all bonds issued on account of said undertaking, all such bonds outstanding shall be included in determining the limitation of the power to incur indebtedness, unless the principal and interest thereof be made payable exclusively from the receipts of the undertaking. Sec. 1033h. Assessment of property for municipal taxation to be the same as that for State taxation. In cities and towns the assessment of real estate and personal property, for the purpose of municipal taxation, shall be the same as the assessment thereof for the purpose of State taxation, whenever there shall be a State assessment of such property. Sec. 1038. General and enumerated powers of councils of cities and towns. In addition to the powers conferred by other general statutes, the council of every city and town shall have power to lay off streets, walks, or alleys; alter, improve, and light the same, and have them kept in good order; to lay off public grounds and provide all buildings proper for the city or town; to provide a prison house and work house, and employ managers, physicians, nurses, and servants for the same, prescribe regulations for their government and discipline, and for persons therein; to prescribe the time for holding markets and regulate the same; to prevent injury or annoyance from anything dangerous, offensive, or unhealthy, and cause any nuisance to be abated; to regulate the keeping of gunpowder or other combustibles, and provide magazines for the same; to provide places for the interment of the dead in or near the city or town; to acquire or otherwise obtain control of or establish, maintain, operate, extend and enlarge water works, gas works, electric plants, and other public utilities within or without the limits of said city or town; to acquire within or without the limits of the city or town by purchase, condemnation or otherwise whatever land may be necessary for acquiring, locating, establishing, maintaining, operating, extending or enlarging said water works, gas works, electric plants and other public utilities and the right of way, rails, pipes, poles, conduits or wires connected therewith, or any of the fixtures or appurtenances thereof; provided, that no city or town shall have the right to acquire by condemnation the steam and electric plants, gas and water works, or water power and the fixtures and appurtenances, or any part thereof, owned and operated in whole or in part on the eighteenth day of February, nineteen hundred and eight, by any manufacturing corporation or public service corporation, for the purpose of acquiring, establishing, maintaining, operating or enlarging its electrical plant or water works; to prevent the pollution of the water and injuries to water works, for which purpose their jurisdiction shall extend to five miles above the same; to make, erect and construct, within or without said city or town, drains, sewers, and public ducts and to acquire within or without said city or town by purchase, condemnation or otherwise, so much land as may be necessary to make, erect, construct, operate and maintain the same; to make regulations concerning the building of houses in the city or town, and in their discretion to establish and maintain parks, playgrounds and boulevards, and cause the same to be laid out, equipped or beautified, and in particular districts, or along particular streets, to prescribe and establish building lines, or to require property owners in certain localities or districts to leave a certain percentage of lots free from buildings, and to regulate the height of buildings; to make regulations for the purpose of guarding against danger from accidents by fire, and, on the petition of the owners of not less than two-thirds of the ground included in any square, to prohibit the erection in such square of any building, or an addition to any building more than ten feet high, unless the outer walls thereof be made of brick and mortar, or stone and mortar, and provide for the removal of any building or addition erected contrary to such prohibition; to provide for the weighing or measuring of hay, coal or any other articles for sale, and regulate the transportation thereof through the streets; protect the property of the city or town and its inhabitants, and preserve peace and good order therein. The council of any city or town may, in their discretion, authorize or require the fire department thereof to render aid in cases of fire occurring beyond their limits, and may prescribe the conditions on which such aid may be rendered. For carrying into effect these and their other powers, they may make ordinances and by-laws, and prescribe fines or other punishment for violation thereof, keep a city or town guard, appoint a collector of its taxes and levies, and such other officers as they may deem proper, define their powers, prescribe their duties and compensation, and take from any of them a bond, with sureties, in such penalty as to the council may seem fit, payable to the city or town by its corporate name, and with condition for the faithful discharge of the said duties. Cities and towns of this commonwealth are hereby authorized to make appropriations of public funds, of personal property, or of any real estate to any charitable institution or association, located within their respective limits; provided, such institution or association is not controlled in whole or in part by any church or sectarian society. But the words "sectarian society" shall not be construed to mean a non-denominational young men's Christian association or a non-denominational women's Christian association. And nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit any city from making contracts with any sectarian institution for the care of indigent, sick, or injured persons. Provided, that no property shall be condemned for the purposes specified in this section unless the necessity therefor shall be shown to exist to the satisfaction of the court having jurisdiction of the case. Provided, further, that no property of any public service corporation, except lands required for drains, sewers, or public ducts shall be condemned except in accordance with clauses fifty-two and fifty-three of section eleven hundred and five (e) of Pollard's Code of nineteen hundred and four. And provided further, that the provisions of this section shall in no wise repeal, amend, impair or affect any of the powers, rights and privileges conferred on cities and towns by charter or under the provisions of the general law. Sec. 1038a. To exempt those engaged in the publication of newspapers from being required to obtain a license for the privilege or right of printing or publishing the same in the cities, towns and counties of the State. The councils of any incorporated city or town, or board of supervisors of any county in this State, shall not require a license to be obtained for the privilege or right of printing or publishing any newspaper in said cities, towns or counties. But this act shall in no manner be construed so as to exempt those so engaged in the publication of newspapers from the payment of tax upon the plant, machinery, capital or other property so used in such business, or upon the income derived therefrom. Sec. 1038b. To authorize the city councils of cities to adopt reasonable ordinances to prevent improper interference with scholars attending or boarding at any female school situated in cities. The city council of any city, or the town council of any town, may adopt any reasonable ordinance necessary to prevent any improper interference with or annoyance of the scholars attending or boarding at any female schools situated in such city or town.

(1) Hereafter each county or city in which any bank, either national or State, is so located may, subject to the conditions mentioned below, tax all the shares of stock issued by any such bank so located within its limits at the same rate as is assessed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individuals residing in such county or city. (2) That in so taxing said shares the said county or city authorities, respectively, shall follow the mode of assessment and manner of collection prescribed by statute for the collection of State taxes upon said shares. (3) Whenever any commissioner of the revenue, before closing his assessment rolls or tax lists, shall receive from the cashier of a bank furnishing a list of the holders of bank stock, as required by law for the purposes of State taxation, or from the owner of any stock mentioned therein, a certificate of the commissioner of the revenue of the county or city of the State in which the owner of such stock lives, stating that certain shares of the stock mentioned in said list are owned by a resident of that county or city, and that the same have been returned for taxation for that year in such city or county, then the said commissioner of the revenue, to whom the said list of the holders of such bank stock has been furnished, shall deduct from the aggregate value of the shares set forth in said list the aggregate value of the shares mentioned in said certificate. The shares owned by non-residents of this State shall be taxed only at the place where the bank issuing the shares is located. Sec. 1041. Penalty for non-payment of levies. It shall not be lawful for the authorities of any city or town to impose or receive, in any case, a higher rate of penalty for the non-payment of levies than is prescribed in the cases of persons delinquent in payment of State taxes. Sec. 1041a. Providing for local assessments to pay for certain public improvements in cities and towns. No city or town shall impose any tax or assessment upon abutting land owners for street or other public improvements, except for making and improving walkways upon then existing streets, and improving and paving then existing alleys, and for either the construction, or for the use of the sewers; and the same, when imposed, shall not be in excess of the peculiar benefits resulting therefrom to such abutting land owners. But such improvement may be ordered by the council, and the cost thereof apportioned in pursuance of an agreement between the city or town and the abutting land owners, and, in the absence of such agreement, improvements, the cost of which are to be defrayed in whole or in part by such local tax or assessment, may be ordered on a petition from not less than three-fourths of the land owners to be affected thereby, or by a two-thirds vote of all the members elected to the council; but, when no petition is so filed, notice shall first be given as hereinafter provided to the abutting land owners notifying them when and where they may appear before the council or some committee thereof, to whom the matter may be referred, to be heard in favor of or against such improvement. When the council consists of two branches, any committee acting under this or subsequent provisions of this section shall be composed of not less than three members from the larger and two members from the smaller branch. The cost of such improvement, when the same shall have been ascertained, shall be assessed or apportioned by the council, or by some committee thereof, or in any city having by the last United States census a population of more than forty-six thousand inhabitants, by some officer authorized by its council to make such assessment or such apportionment between the city or town and the abutting land owners where less than the whole is assessed: provided, that except when it is otherwise agreed the portion assessed against the abutting land owners shall not exceed one-third of the total cost. The amount assessed against each land owner, or for which he is liable by agreement, shall be reported as soon as practicable to the collector of taxes, who shall enter the same as provided for other taxes. When the assessment or apportionment is not fixed by agreement, notice thereof, and of the amount so assessed or apportioned, shall be given each of the then abutting owners, and he shall be cited thereby to appear before the council, or the committee thereof, or before the officer having the matter in charge, not less than ten days thereafter, at a time and place to be designated therein, to show cause, if any he can, against such assessment or apportionment. The notices required by this section may be given by personal service on all persons entitled to such notice, except that notice to an infant or insane person may be served on his guardian or committee, and notice to a non-resident may be mailed to him at his place of residence, or served on any agent of his having the property in charge, or on the tenant of the freehold, or, in any case where the owner is a nonresident or where the owner's residence is not known, such notice may be given by publication in some newspaper published in the city or town once a week for two successive weeks, the last publication to be made at least ten days before the day on which the parties are cited to appear. Any land owner wishing to make objections to an assessment or apportionment may appear in person or by counsel, and state his objection. If his objections are overruled, he shall, within thirty days thereafter, but not afterwards, have an appeal as of right to the corporation or hustings court of the city, or, in case of a town, to the circuit court of the county in which such town is situated. When an appeal is taken the clerk of the council, or of the committee, or of the officer having the matter in charge, shall immediately deliver to the clerk of the court which has cognizance of the appeal the original notice relating to said assessment, with the judgment of the council, committee or officer endorsed thereon, and the clerk shall docket the same. Every such appeal shall be tried by the court or the judge thereof, in a summary way, without pleadings in writing and without a jury, in term time or in vacation, after reasonable notice to the adverse party, and the hearing shall be de novo. The amount finally assessed against or apportioned to each land owner, or fixed by agreement with him, as hereinbefore provided, shall be a lien on his abutting land, from the time when the work of improvement shall have been completed, subject, however, to his right of appeal and objection as aforesaid, and may be enforced by suit in equity; and, provided that as against a purchaser for value and without notice, such assessment or tax shall not be a lien except and until it shall have been reported to the collector of taxes as above provided. Sec. 1042. Licenses. In addition to the State tax on any license, the council of a city or town may, when anything for which a license is so required is to be done within the city or town, impose a tax for the privilege of doing the same, and require a license to be obtained therefor; and in any case in which they see fit, require from the person licensed bond, with sureties, in such penalty and with such condition as they may deem proper, or make other regulations concerning the same. They may also impose a tax and require a license to be obtained for the privilege of keeping in the city or town for hire any wheeled carriage. Sec. 1042a. To prohibit the several cities and towns of the Commonwealth from imposing and collecting any tax, fine, or other penalty upon persons selling farm and domestic products, grown or produced by them, within the limits of such town or city outside of and not within the regular market houses and sheds of such towns and cities. It shall be unlawful for any city or town of this State, or for any agent or officer thereof, to impose upon or collect from any person any tax, fine, or other penalty for selling farm and domestic products within the limits of any such town or city and outside of and not within the regular market houses and sheds of such city or town: provided, such products are grown or produced by such person. Sec. 1043. Authorizing cities and towns to make city and town levies. The council of every city or town shall cause to be made up and entered on their journal an account of all sums lawfully chargeable on the city or town which ought to be paid within one year, and order a city or town levy of so much as in their opinion is necessary to be raised in that way in addition to what may be received for licenses and from other sources. The levy so ordered may be upon the male persons in the said city or town above the age of twenty-one years, and upon any property therein, and on such other subjects as may at the time be assessed with State taxes against persons residing therein. Sec. 1044. Collector may distrain for city or town levies. The officer of a city or town, whose duty it is to collect city or town levies, shall have the same power to distrain therefor goods and chattels within his city or town as is given by sections six hundred and twenty-two and six hundred and twenty-three to the officers named therein. Sec. 1045. Delinquent lists. He shall, after using due diligence to collect said levies, make out the lists of such as cannot be collected upon forms similar to those prescribed in sections six hundred and five and six hundred and six, with the names of the persons chargeable with such levies placed alphabetically in said lists, and at the foot of each list subscribed the following oath: "I, A. B. —, of the city (or town) of —, do swear that the foregoing list is, I verily believe, correct and just; that I have received no part of the city (or town) levies mentioned in the said list; and that I have used due diligence to find property within my city (or town) liable to distress for the said levies, but have found none." Sec. 1046. How examined and allowed; copy of list of real estate to be sent to auditor. The said lists shall be returned, examined and posted or published as the council of the city or town may prescribe, and such credit given to the officer on account thereof as they may direct. The lists, whereof credit may be allowed, shall be preserved in the office of the clerk of the council.

A list of the delinquent taxes on personal property, with the names and residences of the persons assessed therewith, said list to indicate whether such persons be white or colored. Third.

The Treasurer shall, on the 15th day of September in each year, deliver the first and second of said lists, together with the tickets or bills so listed, to the Auditor, who, with the chairman of the Finance Committee and Commissioner of Revenue, shall compose an examining board, which shall examine the same. If the said board be satisfied that the lists are correct the Auditor shall allow the Treasurer credit for the amounts thereof, in his annual settlement, which shall be made as of the first of September, in each year, but if such lists, or any of them, be found incorrect, credit shall be allowed for only so much thereof as is correct. The Auditor shall deliver a copy of the first of said lists to the Commissioner of Revenue, who shall correct his book accordingly. Sec. 94. Same—delinquent lands. The Treasurer shall, on the first day of September in each year, consolidate or combine the third list mentioned in section 91 of this chapter, with the list of lands delinquent for the non-payment of State taxes for the like year, arranging said lists in separate columns, and shall advertise and sell the same in accordance therewith, and at the same time and in the same manner as is prescribed for the sale of lands delinquent for the non-payment of State taxes, and shall make report thereof, as is provided by law, to the Corporation Court. After said lands have been confirmed or corrected by said court, they shall be recorded in the office of the clerk of said court, in a book to be known as "The Delinquent Land Book," and said lands may be redeemed in accordance with the statute made and provided for the redemption of delinquent lands sold for State taxes. Sec. 95. Same—false returns by; penalties. If the Treasurer shall return real estate in any such list as delinquent for the non-payment of taxes, when such taxes or any part thereof shall have actually been received by him, he shall forfeit, if the return was by design, ten times the amount of the taxes so actually received, and if the return was by mistake, twice the amount—one-half of which forfeiture shall, in any case, go to the city, and the other half to the person charged with such taxes. And if the Treasurer shall return in any such list any real estate as delinquent, when he had either found, or by using due diligence might have found, sufficient property liable to distress for the taxes for which such real estate is returned delinquent, he shall forfeit to the city five times the amount of said taxes. Sec. 96. Same—fiscal year; when taxes due; liens. The year for which taxes on real estate are assessed shall be deemed to commence on the first day of February, and there shall, from that day, be a lien on real estate, and a further lien upon the rent of said real estate, whether the same be payable in money or in kind, for taxes for the current year assessed thereon, until the same are paid, and the fiscal year for which assessed until payment thereof. All taxes shall be regarded as due and payable at such time as may be prescribed in the annual tax ordinances. Sec. 97. Same—taxes; payable by whom. All taxes on real estate imposed by any ordinance of the Council, shall be payable by the persons who, on the first day of February in each and every year, were the respective owners thereof.

The said Constable, or other collector, shall then proceed to collect said taxes, and for so doing he shall be entitled to receive twenty-five per centum of the amount so collected. He shall have the same right of distress, levy and garnishment in collecting the same as is vested in any collector of State taxes. He shall make monthly payments to the City Treasurer of the sums collected by him on his account, and for such payments shall be allowed credit on the books of the Auditor; and one year after said list is placed in his hands, he shall settle his account with the Auditor, returning such uncollected tickets as under oath he may declare insolvent, and shall be allowed due credit therefor. Sec. 99. Collection of gas and water bills. The Treasurer shall collect water and gas bills and shall comply with all ordinances in relation thereto. As to water bills, he shall notify each debtor on a postal card the amount due by him to the city, and notice shall be printed on said card that the amount is due and payable not later than the tenth day of the month or quarter for which the bill is rendered. He shall supply the Superintendent of Gas and the Superintendent of Water with a list of delinquents on the eleventh day of each month or quarter, as the case may be, except when such day may fall on Sunday, then the following day; but, the furnishing of such list of delinquents to the superintendents as aforesaid, shall not relieve the Treasurer of the liability for the collection of said delinquent bills. For any negligence on the part of the Treasurer to furnish such lists, he shall be held responsible for the amount of the bills. Sec. 100. Wages—when withheld. The Treasurer shall not pay the wages to any officer or employee of the city who may be indebted to the city unless the amount of indebtedness shall be less than the amount of wages due, in which case he may pay over the excess.

Sec. 103. Treasurer's compensation. From and after the first of January, 1910, the Treasurer shall be allowed two per centum for his services in receiving and collecting the revenues amounting to one hundred thousand dollars or less, and one per centum on all revenues in excess of one hundred thousand dollars; but he shall not be allowed any compensation for disbursements. The word "revenue" shall be construed to mean only money arising from taxes, licenses, water and gas; that is to say, money arising from some ordinance of the Council or general law of the State to raise funds for the general benefit of the city. In no case shall the Treasurer be entitled to any compensation for receiving or disbursing funds arising from the sale of bonds or the issuing of notes by the city for any purpose. CHAPTER IX.

He shall submit all accounts so audited and approved, except bills for freight or for provender for keep of horses in the several departments, to the Council for its approval.

CHAPTER XIV. STREETS AND SIDEWALKS. Sec. 152. Streets and sidewalks—general provisions. The term "streets" when used in these ordinances shall be held to mean streets, sidewalks, alleys, lanes and public highways of the city, except where by the context or by reasonable intendment sidewalks are not included. The proper corners of the streets shall be designated by proper stones or posts, placed at such points as the City Engineer may direct. All sidewalks hereafter constructed shall be four and one-half feet in width in streets whose width is thirty feet, and in the same proportion in streets of greater width, except when otherwise specially ordered by the Council. Sec. 153. Same—grading and paving. Whenever the paving, grading or making of sidewalks or streets anywhere in the city is ordered by the Council, it shall be the duty of the City Engineer, when in his opinion such street or sidewalk should be so graded as to raise or lower the same materially with reference to the property of abutting lot owners, to make his plans of such improvement, showing accurately in feet and inches the elevation or lowering of the street with reference to such adjacent property, and submit the same to the Committee of the Council on Streets before making such improvement. Whereupon the said committee shall summon adjacent lot owners, either by personal service or by notice published once in some newspaper of this city, to appear before it at a designated time and place to show cause, if any they can, against the proposed improvement. No such improvement shall be made by the City Engineer until his plans have been approved by the Council, after consideration of the report of the committee thereon as herein provided. Sec. 154. Same—laying sidewalks anl pavements. Whenever a new pavement or sidewalk shall be ordered by the Council, the city shall cause the curb to be put down and the owner of the property along the boundary of which said sidewalk shall extend, shall be required to pay two-thirds of the cost of constructing the same. Whenever any citizen desires a sidewalk to be put down along the boundary of his property he shall, in writing, make application through the chairman of the Street Committee, and thereupon the Street Committee shall have an estimate made by the Engineer of the cost of such improvement, and present same to the Council for its action. Whenever the Council shall order a sidewalk to be laid, it shall be the duty of the Engineer, before beginning work on same, to have the property owner for whose benefit said walk is being laid, enter into an agreement in writing with the city stating what amount said property owner shall pay by reason of the proposed improvement and the terms of payment. Upon the completion of such work the City Engineer shall deliver such contract to the Auditor who shall render to the property owner a bill in accordance therewith, also a duplicate bill to the Treasurer for collection. Sec. 155. Removing pavements and excavating in streets and alleys. No person, unless specially authorized by the Council, shall take up or remove any portion of the pavement of the carriageway or of the sidewalk, or any street surface, or excavate in any street or public alley of the city without written permission of the City Engineer. Said Engineer shall not refuse permission to any applicant except for cause approved by the Street Committee, but in case of refusal the applicant may appeal to the Council. It shall be the duty of every person to whom a permit to remove a pavement or street surface or excavate in any street or alley shall have been granted to institute at once and prosecute without delay the work for which such permit was obtained, and promptly on its completion give written notice thereof to the City Engineer. No pavement, sidewalk or street surface shall be replaced, after being taken up, by any person except the City Engineer, who shall cause the same to be done at the expense of the city and he shall make out in duplicate against such person to whom the permit was granted, bills in duplicate for the actual cost of the same, one of which bills he shall deliver to the Auditor, and the other to the Treasurer for collection as other city dues are collected. Before any pavement, sidewalk or street surface shall be replaced, or when a permit is granted for excavating in an unsurfaced street or alley, it shall be the duty of the City Engineer to see that the excavations have been properly filled and tamped. Any person found guilty of taking up any pavement, sidewalk or street surface, or excavating in any street or alley in the city without the written permission of the City Engineer, shall pay a fine of not less than $5 nor more than $10 for each offense, and each day that such violation continues shall constitute a separate offense. Any person to whom a permit is granted to do such work as provided in the foregoing ordinance shall place guards or barracks around such excavations and shall protect it by warning lights at night until taken in charge by the City Engineer. Any person failing to place such guards, barracks or lights, as required by this section, shall be fined not less than $1 nor more than $10, and each day's neglect shall constitute a separate offense. Every person who shall make application as above specified shall be deemed to have assented thereby to all the provisions and terms of this section including the right of the city to collect the actual cost of replacing the pavement, sidewalk or street surface in the manner above directed. The superintendents of water and sewers, and gas may remove pavement, etc., without the permission of the City Engineer, but shall comply with all the requirements of the foregoing section as to filling and tamping, and shall then report the same to the City Engineer, and shall properly guard and protect the same until taken in charge by him.

Said City Engineer shall note the particulars in his book, and give the applicant a written memorandum of such line by which the said applicant shall be governed in making his said improvement; for every such service said Engineer shall make a charge against the person for whom the line was given, if the line be fifty feet or less, $1.50, and two cents per lineal foot for any excess, said fee to be turned into the city treasury. Such applicant shall not, thereafter, be required to alter or remove any such improvement which he may have erected in accordance with such memorandum. If any person erect any such building, wall, fence or other structure contrary to this section and in such manner as to encroach upon the line of or interfere with the grade of any street, he shall be fined $20, and further required to remove such building, wall, fence or other structure.
