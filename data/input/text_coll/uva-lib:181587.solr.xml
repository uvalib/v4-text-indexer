      <field name="fulltext">Eleventh Annual Report on Historical Collections, University of Virginia Library, For the Year 1940-41 IN June 1940, when the disastrous Battle of France was running its course and invasion of Britain was impending, the President of the United States declared that a national emergency existed and Congress at his request voted large appropriations to launch a program of defense. A larger segment of the American people began to take the war seriously and some leaders in various fields of activity undertook to make preparations for any eventuality. Archivists and custodians of historical manuscripts were particularly fortunate in having the problem of preparedness brought to their attention by the president of the Society of American Archivists, Dr. Waldo G. Leland, at their fourth annual meeting held in Montgomery, Alabama, November 11-12. Dr. Leland spoke from long experience with archival problems at home and abroad and from his service as secretary of the National Board for Historical Service in Washington, D. C., during American participation in the first World War.1 1. Waldo G. Leland, "The National Board for Historical Service," American Historical Association, Annual Report for 1919 (3 vols., Washington, 1923-24), I, 161-89. In his presidential address on "The Archivist in Times of Emergency,"2 2. The American Archivist, IV, no. 1 (Jan. 1941), 1-12. he discussed the custodian's responsibility for the safety of the records in his establishment and for the preservation of materials produced during the emergency and basic for subsequent historical writing. As a result of certain specific suggestions made by Dr. Leland to the Society, four committees were appointed: one on the Protection of Archives against Hazards of War, another on Emergency Transfer and Storage of Archives, a third on the History and Organization of Government Emergency Agencies, and a fourth on Collection and Preservation of Materials for the History of Emergencies. These committees went to work promptly at their respective tasks, the first two conferring with the Historical Records Survey to obtain WPA labor for a survey of available depositories. The third committee began plans for the compilation of a handbook of federal World War agencies, including their organization, activities, and records, and requested the cooperation of the National Archives, where most of these records are housed.3 3. Ibid., IV, no. 3 (July 1941), 210. Before the summer of 1941 a few other organizations and cultural institutions initiated projects in preparation for total war, if or when it came. In April the National Resources Planning Board of the federal government formed a Committee on the Conservation of Cultural Resources which proceeded to draw up recommendations for voluntary state action in preserving historical records, art objects, museum pieces, old buildings, etc., against the hazards of war. The Library of Congress worked overtime to classify material in all departments according to its relative value and irreplacability and to earmark those portions which should most certainly be evacuated when it was deemed necessary.4 4. Jerrold Orne, "The Library of Congress Prepares for Emergencies," American Library Association, Bulletin, XXXV, no. 6 (June 1941), 341-48. While archivists along the Atlantic seaboard were more conscious of the potential danger of a sudden crisis than those in the Middle West, from Illinois as early as February came words of caution and advice on the preservation of certain fundamental records during war.5 5. Margaret C. Norton, "Archives and War," Illinois Libraries, XXIII, no. 2 (Feb. 1941), 17-19, especially those records "essential to citizenship and property rights." In August the Committee on Business Archives of the Society of American Archivists addressed a letter to over three hundred firms. It requested them to give attention to the safekeeping of certain types of their records concerning war conditions and problems since the beginning of the conflict in 1939. News of both the destruction and the safe-guarding of cultural materials in the warring countries of Europe reached America in an ever increasing tide by radio, in the daily press, and through professional journals. Among some thoughtful citizens these accounts, some of them emotional, others matter-of-fact, raised the question: To what extent could American scholarship step into the breach and assume responsibility for preserving at least a part of the cultural heritage of western civilization? This query was partially answered by a large-scale project under the direction of the American Council of Learned Societies for microfilming important manuscript collections in European and Latin American countries. In the early summer of 1940 a committee, headed by Herbert A. Kellar of the McCormick Historical Association, asked scholars throughout the country to list significant materials abroad which, from their own first-hand knowledge or other reliable information, ought to be microfilmed. A high percentage of replies to the questionnaire came in promptly with a wealth of suggestions pertaining to almost every nation of Europe. Unfortunately events had occurred so rapidly during 1940 that few repositories still provided even partial access, if any at all, for the copying of records, except under great difficulties. Microfilming was begun in England, however, in 1941 and the preservation of some records, at least in millions of copies, was assured. Nevertheless it became evident that scholars would always regret that they had not taken action as soon as war broke out. Although during the year ending in September 1941 the threat of war seemed ominous in the United States on various occasions, peace-time pursuits were generally the order of the day. Advancement in the general field of archives and historical manuscripts proceeded apace, continuing many lines of activity undertaken in the 1930's.6 6. Cf. Tenth Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library, for the Year 1939-40 (University, Va., 1940), pages 4-6. Custodians of records look increasingly to the National Archives for suggestions on matters of policy and procedure as this great institution expands its services to departments of the federal government, to administrators in the states, and to individual research workers. The vast resources of the National Archives are gradually being made more available by means of preliminary checklists of certain "record groups," and by files of master-negative microfilm copies covering complete series of archival material. If such copies are wanted by a number of users, they can be furnished easily in positive form.7 7. Preston W. Edsall, "The File Microcopy Program of the National Archives," Journal of Documentary Reproduction, IV, no. 1 (March 1941), 9-14. A most valuable reference tool is the Guide to the Material in the National Archives (1940),8 8. Publication No. 14 of the National Archives (Washington, U. S. Government Printing Office, xviii, 303 pages). arranged by fonds (under the general headings of legislative, executive, judiciary, and independent agencies) with a descriptive paragraph of each and helpful bibliographical references. The problem of handling an ever increasing bulk of materials in the National Archives was partially solved by an Act of Congress, approved August 5, 1939, permitting the disposition of records having "no permanent value or historical interest" by the agency of origin, with approval of the Archivist of the United States and a joint committee of Congress, before the intended transfer of such records to the National Archives. In September 1940 microphotographic copies were authorized to take the place of original records to be disposed of with approval of the Archivist of the United States, and such copies "have the same force and effect as the originals thereof would have had" for use as legal evidence.9 9. The second act was approved September 24. The texts of these two acts are available in the Sixth Annual Report of the Archivist of the United States for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1940 (Washington, 1941), pages 47-49, 50. See also Daniel F. Noll, "Some Recent Developments in Public Record Microfilming," Journal of Documentary Reproduction, IV, no. 2 (June 1941), 109-17. The National Archives has made notable progress in its in-service training courses and in the expansion of its program for the training of archivists on the Ph.D. level in conjunction with the American University. These two institutions have established a high standard which other universities and archival agencies will do well to emulate if they venture into this field.10 10. Sixth Annual Report of the Archivist of the United States . . . [1939-] 1940, page 40; Tenth Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library . . . 1939-40, pages 6-8. No phase of archival work in the United States has been less developed than administrative history. The study of the organization, functions, evolution, and activities of the federal government throughout its existence has been possible on a broad scale only since its records have become more accessible by transfer and classification in the National Archives. There is less excuse for this belated research in many of the states where archival departments, replete with records, have functioned with serious limitations, because of misguided emphasis upon muster rolls and genealogical data and blissful ignorance of the historical structure and functions of state agencies which a study of the archives would reveal. Research in administrative history for the archivist, however, should be only a means to a greater end: to be able to serve more effectively the administrator of a particular agency, the student of public administration, and the general scholar who seeks certain data but knows not where to find them in the maze of records. Many of these problems were discussed in a timely session of the Society of American Archivists at Montgomery, Alabama, in November 1940, on "Administrative History of Governmental Agencies in Relation to Archives."11 11. Three papers were read: Karl L. Trever, "Administrative History in Federal Archives," American Archivist, IV, no. 3 (July 1941), 159-69; George M. McFarland, "Archives and Local Administrative History," ibid., 170-77; and Dan Lacy, "Archives and State Administrative History," unpublished. For other pertinent ideas on this and related subjects see Philip C. Brooks, "What Records Shall We Preserve?" The National Archives, Staff Information Circulars, no. 9 (June 1940), and "The Role of Records in Administration," articles by Ernst Posner, Helen L. Chatfield, and Edna B. Poeppel, ibid., no. 11 (July 1941). During the past few years the Historical Records Survey has contributed much essential information in the survey of federal archives in the states and especially through the "legal research" which formed the basis for essays on state and local governmental bodies appearing in the various inventories of archival records published throughout the nation. In Illinois Miss Margaret C. Norton, state archivist, has written a series of scholarly articles describing certain local governmental agencies, their changing functions since the dates of origin, and their records in relation thereto.12 12. Illinois Libraries, XXIII (1941), no. 5 (May), 21-24; no. 6 (June), 24-27; to be continued. Intensive research in the field of public administration is of comparatively recent date despite some exceptional contributions by scholars during the last half-century. That the political scientist and the archivist can find many problems of mutual interest and profit by co-operative effort is clearly indicated in the minutes of the first meeting of the Special Committee on Research in the History of Administrative Institutions, sponsored by the Social Science Research Council and held in Washington, D. C., on March 1-2, 1941.13 13. Those present were Leonard D. White, chairman, Solon J. Buck, John M. Gaus, Julius Goebel, Jr., James Hart, Lloyd M. Short, William Anderson, and Charles S. Ascher; cf. Minutes of First Meeting . . . March 1-2, 1941 (7 pages, mimeographed). Throughout the discussion the need for a wide variety of historical studies was pointed out, studies on the relation of changes in the character and occupations of the population to the growth of administrative agencies, on the diffusion of administrative ideas and institutions, on the emergence of administrative law enforcement, etc. Repeatedly the discussion led to basic questions concerning the sources. Are they extant, and if so, are they accessible? Are records in archival establishments so arranged as to preserve the organic structure and functioning of the particular agency to be studied?14 14. For a criticism of arrangement of records strictly by administrative agency see E. G. Campbell, "Functional Classification of Archival Material," Library Quarterly, XI (1941), 431-41. What does the researcher need to know about the archives in order to use them effectively? It is clear that developments in "archival science" and the "philosophy of archives" will not only serve as a cause but also benefit by the results of research in administrative history. As the National Archives has become the center in America for the inception of many new archival developments, experimentation with them, and dissemination of information about them, so in the realm of books, historical manuscripts, and other research materials, the Library of Congress has taken recently a more vital part in national projects which try to solve certain complex problems of to-day and to anticipate some of to-morrow's. No better illustration of this assertion could be cited than its Experimental Division of Library Co-operation set up in the spring of 1941 with Herbert A. Kellar in charge. Mr. Kellar has undertaken a national study of a number of fundamental problems confronting research institutions during the past decade. They are problems arising in large measure from the growing tide of materials, old and new, manuscript and printed (or duplicated in other ways), which necessitate far-reaching changes in library policy and technique in order to provide maximum service. Especially important are certain questions involving the acquisition, control, and mobility of research materials. The process of cataloguing must be modified because, under the present elaborate system, it cannot keep pace with acquisitions. Documentary reproduction by microfilm, microprint, and other inexpensive methods of duplication offers, it is true, some controversial problems; but it also affords almost unlimited opportunities for co-operation among libraries. The expanding field of bibliography needs probing in relation to other reference tools and a national clearing-house of information is highly desirable to increase the efficiency and use of such works. Union catalogues, by geographical area, subject, and type of material, are invaluable, but what are their practical limits and their relation to one another?15 15. Herbert A. Kellar, Memoranda on Library Cooperation, No. 1, The Library of Congress, Experimental Division of Library Cooperation (Washington, D. C., September 1941). During field trips throughout the country Mr. Kellar will discuss these problems with librarians, archivists, and research scholars in order to obtain a wide variety of opinions and reactions for an approach to the solution of these questions. The Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress has begun a union catalogue of yearly manuscript accessions of American research libraries according to a plan formulated by the Committee on Historical Source Materials (Sub-Committee on Manuscripts) of the American Historical Association, aided by the Historical Records Survey in assembling the data. A separate union catalogue of newspapers on microfilm in libraries throughout the United States was also undertaken in the Library of Congress.16 16. George A. Schwegmann, Jr., "Preliminary Check-list of Newspapers on Microfilm," Journal of Documentary Reproduction, IV, no. 2 (June 1941), 122-34. The indispensable service of the great national union catalogue of imprints located in the Library of Congress has been an incentive for the establishment of similar regional, state, and metropolitan card files in the Pacific North-West, Florida, Ohio, Philadelphia, Providence, and Cleveland. The Hayes Memorial Library in Fremont, Ohio, is launching a union catalogue, arranged by subject, of every imprint during the period 1865-98.17 17. The Hayes Memorial Library, . . . Annual Report, 1939-40 (Fremont, 1940), page 6. The project of the American Library Association for surveying the resources of all research libraries, begun about five years ago, was carried another step forward by Robert B. Downs in his report on additional acquisitions during the year 1939-40.18 18. Robert B. Downs, "Notable Materials Added to American Libraries, 1939-40," Library Quarterly, XI (1941), 257-301. The annual meetings of the American Library Association, in its sections on Public Documents and on Archives and Libraries, continue to be occasions for helpful discussions of many of the problems already mentioned.19 19. On these sessions at the Boston meeting of the A. L. A., June 1941, see its Bulletin, XXXV, no. 9 (Sept. 1941), pages P85-89, 134-38. What can be done on a national scale in the related fields of archives, manuscripts, and other research materials depends to a very large degree upon the progressive attitude which assures accomplishment in the several states and localities. The Historical Records Survey has demonstrated, in spite of many doubts and misgivings, that valuable reference tools can be compiled throughout the country by semi-skilled and unskilled persons on relief, if properly directed. In most cases where results proved disappointing, certain local conditions were beyond the control of the Washington office. The unparalleled opportunities which the microfilm offers have been realized in practice largely through projects to which numerous libraries have given mutual support. Our perspective with regard to co-operative cultural undertakings has broadened exceedingly in recent years. There is scarcely any category of research materials or fundamental problem concerning their accessibility and use that has not been embraced in some comprehensive collaborative study. The individual scholar and the local institution must know, therefore, what project would be a waste of effort as well as what would be worth while, in relation to the broader field that has already been charted. In the midst of prolonged economic depression we made great strides in co-operative effort on a national scale. Some of this experience has already been turned to good account in facing the greater emergency of to-day. The custodian of historical records ought to visualize his job as part of a larger cultural movement with which he should keep abreast, even though he may have no ideas to contribute. He is not justified in being much concerned with inconsequentials, although the "challenge of historical materials" may escape him.20 20. See Richard B. Morris's fine essay on "The Challenge of Historical Materials," in The American Archivist, IV, no. 2. (Apr. 1941), 91-116. Events in many of the states provide ample evidence of constructive planning and commendable accomplishment, paralleling national trends. During the meeting of the Society of American Archivists in Montgomery the archives section of the new Alabama World War Memorial Building was dedicated and special tribute was paid to the late Dr. Thomas McAdory Owen, pioneer in state archival work and founder of the Alabama Department of Archives and History.21 21. R. D. W. Connor, "Dedication of the Archival Section of the Alabama World War Memorial Building," ibid., 77-90. Field trips are a new feature of the Department's activities to keep in touch with archival policies and record-keeping in the counties and to encourage the transfer of certain materials to the state achives for safety and better accessibility. In the neighboring state of Mississippi the Department of Archives and History also moved into new quarters in the War Veterans Memorial Building. Similar achievement may be noted at Harvard University in the transfer of its manuscripts and valuable imprints from the old Treasure Room in Widener Library to the Houghton Rare Book Library near by; and at Hyde Park, New York, in the occupation of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library which had been formally presented to the United States Government on July 4, 1940.22 22. William A. Jackson, "The New Rare Book Library," Harvard University Library Notes, IV, no. 1 (June 1941), 23-24; The National Archives, First Annual Report of the Archivist of the United States as to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library . . . [1939]1940 (Washington, 1940). The Public Relations Committee of the Society of American Archivists has been of assistance in promoting archival legislation in certain states. The collection and preservation of research materials have long been recognized as an important function of historical agencies, but never has this activity been so widespread as to-day. There is no region of the United States which has not felt the impact of this movement as it gained momentum steadily during the past decade. Numerous examples have been pointed out in previous numbers of this series of reports. Two new projects deserve mention here, at the risk of slighting others. In the State of Washington a plan proposed by Dr. Charles M. Gates of the University of Washington is under discussion for a co-operative enterprise by state and privately supported institutions to collect materials and locate others which, through a central committee of information, might be acquired later by whatever agency may have the best approach to the owner. If the plan is carried out, it may provide good proof for the argument that, within a given area, practicable controls can be established to accommodate overlapping interests and increase the benefits to all concerned. It suggests also the value of a preliminary inventory of existing library resources and the function of microphotography in meeting identical needs of several institutions. At Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell, South Dakota, a regional culture project, known as Friends of the Middle Border, has been launched to preserve and study the heritage of the Great Plains.23 23. Middle Border Bulletin, Mitchell, S. D., I, no. 1 (March 1941). Art objects and museum pieces as well as manuscripts and printed materials compose the growing collection located in one of the university buildings. Having staked its claim to a vast area where research libraries are few, this organization is wise in outlining its program with a perspective correspondingly broad that will appeal to scholars in many fields and to the average citizen. The field of local history, long dominated by the antiquarian and shunned by most professional historians, has been subjected to re-appraisal in recent years. Sociological and historical studies of certain communities, cities, and towns have provided new interpretations of regional and national problems with the result that local materials have achieved a new dignity in the eyes of those scholars who have learned how to use them. The custodian of these research materials who collects them and makes them available for the scholar must also serve the amateur historian. Many of the latter have a real contribution to make and are deserving of well directed encouragement rather than ill concealed tolerance. The need for interchange of ideas and information on these and kindred problems of local historical work was only partially met by the old Conference of Historical Societies under the aegis of the American Historical Association. It has been replaced by the American Association for State and Local History, organized at a meeting in New York City, December 27, 1940. The new society offers opportunities for discussion at its meetings and for publication of timely articles, news notes, and other pertinent information. The first issue of its quarterly State and Local History News appeared in July 1941. A revised edition of the Handbook of Historical Societies (last edition, 1936) is in preparation. From its inception the association's nation-wide membership has increased steadily. Part of this encouraging interest in local history has undoubtedly resulted from the constructive work of the Historical Records Survey during the past five years. At the end of August 1941 the number of inventories of state and local archives, federal archives in the states, church records, American imprints, guides to manuscript depositories and collections, etc., totaled over fifteen hundred volumes.24 24. . . . Check List of Historical Records Survey Publications, WPA Technical Series, Research and Records Bibliography No. 4 . . . Work Projects Administration . . . (Washington, D. C., Sept. 1, 1941). In Virginia another chapter was begun in the long story of her colonial and state records when the State Library moved into its impressive new building in December 1940. For many years the library and archives had operated with scarcely a minimum staff amid badly congested conditions. Now there is ample space to carry out the plans of the archivist, Mr. William J. Van Schreeven, for reorganizing the records and making a careful inventory of them. The building also allows adequate room for future growth of the collections. Some valuable old records have been transferred to the archives from the attic of the capitol which indifferent officials have regard at various times as a convenient storage place (if so dignified a term may be used). Over a long period the Archives Department has been borrowing numerous seventeenth and eighteenth century county records to make photographic copies and, in some instances, it has been possible to retain the originals. Recently the law authorizing such loans has been amended to include the period 1790-1865. Furthermore the state librarian may request an order from any local court for the removal to the State Library of records prior to 1866 (except wills and deeds) not properly cared for. No agency of the state government may dispose of any records without examination of such materials by the state librarian and the comptroller.25 25. Acts . . . of Virginia . . . 1926 (Richmond, 1926), chapter 359, pages 654-55, amending an Act of 1918; Acts . . . of Virginia . . . 1940 (Richmond, 1940), chapter 216, pages 342-44. An interesting project begun this year by Mr. Van Schreeven in co-operation with Virginia's oldest fire insurance company is the microfilming of early policies of the Mutual Assurance Society of Virginia. These records, containing a wealth of economic and social data, have not been easily accessible hitherto. During the past year the Virginia Historical Records Survey has published two inventories of federal archives in the state— records of the Departments of Justice and Agriculture—but no county inventories. A third volume issued is an Index to Obituary Notices in the "Religious Herald," Richmond, Virginia, 1828-1938, a Baptist periodical. The reconstruction and enlargement of the Washington and Lee University Library have provided more space for research materials and an incentive for the collection of manuscripts and imprints pertaining to the history of the university, the county of Rockbridge, and the neighboring region in the Valley of Virginia. A special project is about to begin for the assembling of data on the location and content of Robert E. Lee manuscript material in libraries and private hands in the United States or abroad. The university will supplement its own Lee collection as much as possible. Thus it hopes to offer specialized reference service, enrich its own resources, and attract scholars to the University Library. In Williamsburg the first fruit of the Restoration's research and publication program appeared: a reprint of the Hartwell, Blair, and Chilton Present State of Virginia, and the College,26 26. Originally written in 1697 by Henry Hartwell, James Blair and Edward Chilton, but first published in 1727. edited with an introduction by Dr. Hunter D. Farish. The Library of the College of William and Mary continued its collecting of historical materials, with emphasis by Dr. E. G. Swem upon records of or about the College, in preparation for a detailed history of the institution.27 27. College of William and Mary, Annual Report of the Librarian, [1940-41 (Williamsburg, Va., 1941)], mimeographed. Local historical societies have never been numerous in Virginia, either at any one time or throughout the long history of the Old Dominion. This is regrettable if one thinks merely of the loss of original materials which such societies might be in a better position to preserve than would any other agency. Some of the historical interest throughout the state has found expression through patriotic organizations. Although they have made a real contribution in financing the repair and restoration of certain early county records, the historical interest of their members has been restricted too closely to the heroics of military events. In many states local historical activities have been stimulated, and to some extent co-ordinated, by efforts of the state historical society or by means of a state-wide association with annual meetings. In Virginia, however, no such program has ever been undertaken. Local initiative and enthusiasm have produced encouraging results in four counties during the past few years, as evidenced in their publications. These are the Papers of the Albemarle County Historical Society, the Proceedings of the Clarke County Historical Association, the Papers of the Rockbridge Historical Society, and the Bulletin of the Washington County Historical Society. The Committee on Legal History of the American Historical Association has authorized the editing and publication of the oldest records of Accomac County on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, by Dr. Susie May Ames of Randolph-Macon Woman's College. At the University of Virginia the research activity in the Alderman Library has been for the most part a continuation of the previous year's program. Materials acquired by gift, loan, and purchase during 1940-41 are set forth in the list accompanying this report. As knowledge of the Library's resources and its facilities for their use has become more widespread, an ever increasing number of collections and separate items has come in from persons who, without direct suggestion from the University, have decided to entrust their family papers or other historical records to the Library. Experience has shown that few deposits on loan are withdrawn; in fact, many of them have been supplemented from time to time. Two endowments provide a modest income which is apportioned throughout the year for weekly purchases of research materials. Recommendations for purchase are passed upon by a committee of five composed of the librarian, the director of rare books and manuscripts, and the three professors of American history in the University. Funds of the Tracy W. McGregor Library are available for acquisition of more rare and expensive items, especially Virginiana or southern Americana. A separate yearly report is prepared for the Advisory Board of the McGregor Library by John C. Wyllie, curator, who is also director of the Rare Books and Manuscripts Division of the Alderman Library. The collection of materials by field trips in various parts of Virginia and occasionally outside the state has continued, with the aid of Dr. Glenn Curtis Smith and his successor, Dr. William Dana Hoyt, Jr., and of Mrs. Helen Bullock during the summer of 1941. The program for enriching the resources of the Alderman Library has been accompanied by a consistent effort to provide for maximum use of those resources by a practicable arrangement of the collections, by catalogues, and other finding media. Work on several calendars of manuscripts has been mentioned in previous reports.28 28. Tenth Annual Report of the Archivist, pages 25-26. During the past year the calendar of eighteenth century manuscripts in certain collections was prepared in typescript and the Jefferson calendar was completed and indexed by Mrs. Bullock. The latter has a special value because it includes not only original manuscripts but all the photographic copies in this Library, many of which were obtained from widely scattered collections in public and private hands, both in this country and abroad. Associated with this research on Jeffersoniana, extensive as well as intensive, is the project of a card catalogue showing the location of all known Jefferson material, identifying each item, and citing printed texts. Thus the Alderman Library aspires to become the clearing-house for information on this subject. The co-operation of other libraries is indispensable for the success of such an undertaking, and several have already responded. The past year has seen the inception of two series of publications, a product of the Library's research program in collaboration with certain scholars in the University. The McGregor Library series aims to publish manuscripts or imprints of special historical interest in its collection, each volume to be edited by some scholar who has made a study of the documents and the circumstances under which they appeared. The first McGregor publication is Dunmore's Proclamation of Emancipation of 1775, with an historical introduction by Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., who is in charge of manuscripts in the Alderman Library. The second project is known as the University of Virginia Bibliographical Series. These studies bear the imprint of the Library but will not be restricted to research subjects carried on in the University. Number One of this series is A Survey of Research Materials in Virginia Libraries, 1936-37, by Harry Clemons. This is a printing, with a few revisions, of the mimeographed edition of 1938 which provided the data on Virginia used in the American Library Association's volume of the resources of southern libraries. Number Four is a Check List of Letters to and from Poe, by John Ward Ostrom. Numbers Two and Three are in press: a bibliography of Virginia geology, by Joseph K. Roberts, and a short title catalogue of early English books at the University of Virginia, by Clarence W. Miller. The Alderman Library is participating in several co-operative research projects of regional or national significance. A large number of cards in near-print form for books and pamphlets here have been prepared and copies sent to the Union Catalogue in the Library of Congress. Through Mr. Wyllie's efforts entries have been contributed to the Union Catalogue of Floridiana at Winter Park, to the American Bibliographical Society's checklist of nineteenth century American publishers, and to Dr. William Warner Bishop's catalogue of American holdings in Short Title Catalogue books in progress at the University of Michigan. A large percentage of American imprints to 1876 in the Alderman Library have been recorded by workers of the Historical Records Survey for the American Imprints Inventory. The Library has established an informal exchange agreement with the Virginia State Library for microfilm acquisitions. The Eleventh Annual Report on Historical Collections is a continuation of the Annual Report[s] of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library, begun in 1930-31. The change of title was advisable because the position of archivist has been replaced by that of consultant in history and archives. The manuscript accessions printed herewith from notes prepared by Mrs. Bullock, Dr. Hoyt, and Mr. Rex Beach, are presented in the form of an alphabetical list to facilitate its use as a reference tool and to supplement from year to year a proposed Guide to manuscript resources of the Library. The present introduction is an attempt to get a perspective of nation-wide trends in the related fields of archives and historical manuscripts without which the task in any one state, however efficiently carried out in other respects, cannot attain the best results.

      <field name="fulltext">EXPLANATORY NOTES Each entry describes the papers of a single acquisition, all the manuscripts in such a group being usually the papers of the single individual or family whose name is given. The word "records" is added in the case of the papers of an organization, and "collection" for groups of manuscripts assembled by a collector from various sources. Birth and death dates of persons are given in parentheses following the name. Dates not in parentheses indicate inclusive years of the manuscripts, with an occasional added date in parentheses to show the period covered by the bulk of the material. Thus 1725(1900)-1928 means that while the earliest manuscript is dated 1725, the majority of papers fall in the period after 1900; 1805-(1850)1910 means that the body of the material ends in 1850, with a few scattering items up to 1910; and 1791(18401860)1902 means that the bulk of the papers fall between 1840 and 1860. The successive issues of the Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library . . . are referred to, after the first citation, as Archivist Report. In addition to the usual abbreviations, "MS." for manuscript, "ALS" for autograph letter signed, etc., the abbreviation "incl." has been used for "including." Titles of persons have been omitted except when the first name is unknown. The numbers given at the end of each entry are accession numbers, included for their convenience as a finding aid in the Library. The names of depositors of manuscripts on loan to the University are not included; it should be understood that while the majority of such manuscripts are accessible for research, all are subject to such restrictions as the depositor has made, and none may be reproduced without consent of the owner.</field>

William Lewis Maury (1813-78), and their descendants. The earliest portion of the collection contains letters, diaries, and sermons by members of the Fontaine and Maury families, whose kinship began in 1716 with the marriage of Matthew Maury (d.1752) of Castle Mauron, Gascony, and Anne Fontaine (1690-1755) who emigrated to Virginia in 1718. John Fontaine (b.1693), a Huguenot exile in England, came to Virginia, and in 1714 joined Governor Alexander Spotswood's famous trans-montane expedition. A copy of his diary for 1710-18 was made in 1840, and letters of the Maury and Fontaine families in England and Virginia were collected and published by Ann Maury in The Memoirs of a Huguenot Family, Being the Autobiography of Rev. James Fontaine, 1658-1722 (New York, 1853). Sermons and letters by Rev. James Maury (1717-69), rector of Fredericksville Parish, Albemarle County, Va., who taught Thomas Jefferson and Bishop James Madison, include those dealing with the Conventions of the Virginia Clergy which were held at the College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, and with the famous "Parson's Cause" in which he was plaintiff and Patrick Henry an attorney for the defense. The bulk of the correspondence for 1790-1865 is that of James Maury (1746-1840), who served as U. S. Consul at Liverpool, 1790-1829, until removed by President Jackson, with his business associates; his wife Margaret (Rutson) Maury (1764-1830); their children, James Sifrein Maury (1797-1864), William Maury (1799-1849), Matthew Maury (180077), Rutson Maury (1805-82), and Ann Maury (1803-76). Excellent material on early mercantile relations between Liverpool and New York, South Carolina, Virginia, Louisiana, Ohio, and Mississippi; social history in those sections; slavery; early abolitionist movement in the South as well as the North; descriptions of early American cities and towns; speculation in tobacco, cotton, and wheat; early steamboats, railroads, and other means of transportation; life at the Virginia springs; manufactures and conditions in southern manufacturing places; party politics of the era.

Correspondence of William Lewis Maury, distinguished U. S. and Confederate naval officer, with his wife, Anne Fontaine Maury (1832-90) who was in Milton, N. C., during the war, and their letters to Ann Maury, then in New York, are sources on war conditions in Virginia and North Carolina, on Confederate and naval history, and on the reconstruction era.
