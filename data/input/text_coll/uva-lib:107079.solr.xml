      <field name="fulltext">PART I. HISTORY AND ORGANIZATION: OFFICERS AND STUDENTS: DEGREES CONFERRED. HISTORICAL SKETCH. By an act of January 12, 1803, of the Legislature of Virginia, certain citizens of Albemarle County were incorporated under the style of "Trustees of Albemarle Academy," and were empowered to take such steps as seemed practicable to raise the funds necessary for erecting buildings and putting the Academy into operation. Albemarle Academy was destined never to exist except on paper, but under the guidance of Thomas Jefferson, who was elected to the board of trustees on March 23, 1814, a process of development was begun leading first to the organization of Central College, and afterwards to that of the University of Virginia. On August 19, 1814, the committee of the trustees appointed to select a site, reported that it would be desirable to locate the Academy in the vicinity of the town of Charlottesville, distant not more than one-half mile therefrom. By an act of February 14, 1816, the Legislature authorized the establishment of "Central College, in the County of Albemarle, at the place which has been, or shall be, selected by the trustees of Albemarle Academy, and in lieu of such Academy." All rights and claims of Albemarle Academy were, by the same act, vested in Central College. The board of visitors of the college consisted of six members, of whom Jefferson was the only one who had been a member of the Academy board. The other five members were James Madison, James Monroe, Joseph Carrington Cabell, David Watson, and John H. Cocke. On May 5, 1817, Jefferson was elected Rector of the board, and, on the same day, the board authorized the purchase of a farm of about two hundred acres lying one mile west of Charlottesville as a site for the College. This tract now forms a part of the grounds of the University of Virginia. The cornerstone of Central College was laid on October 6, 1817, in the presence of Thomas Jefferson, Rector, and of James Madison and James Monroeâthe latter then President of the United States. This building, located on what is known as the West Lawn of the University, is now utilized as a professor's residence. Jefferson's plan was to erect a distinct building, a pavilion for each individual professorâbuildings to be arranged around a rectangular lawn. Each pavilion was to contain "a school room and apartments for the accommodation of the professor"; and one-story dormitories for the students were to be erected adjacent to the pavilions. Jefferson drew most of the sketches for the buildings with his own hands, basing them upon designs by Palladio; and his ideas of architectural effect and grouping were carried out in detail when Central College was merged in the University of Virginia. HISTORICAL SKETCH. The prime object in Jefferson's mind, while Rector of the board of visitors of Central College, was to get the college well under way, and then have it adopted by the Legislature as the State University. Accordingly, in the first report of the visitors to the Legislature, of date January 6, 1818, it is recommended that a state university be established on the site of Central College. By an act of February 21, 1818, the Legislature authorized the appointment by the Governor of a board of twenty-four members, to be known as the "Board of Commissioners of the University." It was the duty of this board to meet on August 1, 1818, at the Tavern in Rockfish Gap, on the Blue Ridge Mountains, and report upon the following points regarding the organization of a state university: 1. A proper site for the projected university. 2. A plan for the building thereof. 3. The branches of learning which should be taught therein. 4. The number and description of professorships; and 5. Such general provisions as might properly be enacted by the Legislature for the better organizing and governing of the University. Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe were present at the meeting of the Commissioners, and their able and elaborate report to the Legislature (indicating much careful thought) had probably been prepared by Jefferson before the meeting was held. This report, recommending, among other things, the site of Central College as the most advantageous one for the University, was forwarded in duplicate to the Speaker of the House and the Speaker of the Senate on August 4, 1818. On January 25, 1819, the Legislature adopted a formal act "for establishing an University," and this date must be reckoned as the year of the origin of the University, although the institution was not opened to students until March 7, 1825. Although Jefferson's was the dominant spirit and the shaping hand in the whole movement for the establishment of a state university, it should be stated that but for the influence and efforts of Joseph Carrington Cabell, the close personal friend of Jefferson, the acts of February 21, 1818, and January 25, 1819, would probably have failed of adoption by the Legislature. The act of January 25, 1819, establishing the University, is as follows: "1. Be it declared by the General Assembly of Virginia, That the conveyance of the lands and other property appertaining to the Central College in the County of Albemarle, which has been executed by the proctor thereof, under authority of the subscribers and founders, to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund, is hereby accepted, for the use and on the conditions in the said deed of conveyance expressed. "2. And be it enacted, That there shall be established, on the site HISTORICAL SKETCH. provided for the said College, an University, to be called The University of Virginia; that it shall be under the government of seven visitors to be appointed forthwith by the Governor, with the advice of Council, notifying thereof the persons so appointed, and prescribing to them a day for their first meeting at the said University, with supplementary instructions for procuring a meeting subsequently, in the event of failure at the time first appointed. "3. The said visitors, or so many of them as, being a majority, shall attend, shall appoint a rector, of their own body, to preside at their meetings, and a secretary to record, attest, and preserve their proceedings, and shall proceed to examine into the state of the property conveyed as aforesaid; shall make an inventory of the same, specifying the items whereof it consists; shall notice the buildings and other improvements already made, and those which are in progress; shall take measures for their completion, and for the addition of such others, from time to time as may be necessary. "4. In the said University shall be taught the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages; French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Anglo-Saxon; the different branches of Mathematics, pure and physical; natural philosophy; the principles of agriculture; chemistry; mineralogy, including geology; botany; zoÃ¶logy; anatomy, medicine; civil government; political economy; the law of nature and nations; municipal law; history; ideology; general grammar; ethics; rhetoric; and belles lettres; which branches of science shall be so distributed, and under so many professors, not exceeding ten, as the visitors shall think proper and expedient. "5. Each professor shall be allowed the use of the apartments and accommodations provided for him, and those first employed such standing salary as the visitors shall think proper and sufficient, and their successors such standing salary, not exceeding one thousand dollars, as the visitors shall think proper and sufficient, with such tuition fees from each student, as the visitors shall from time to time establish. "6. The said visitors shall be charged with the erection, preservation, and repair of the buildings, the care of the grounds and appurtenances, and of the interests of the University generally; they shall have power to appoint a bursar, employ a proctor, and all other necessary agents; to appoint and remove professors, two-thirds of the whole number of visitors voting for the removal; to prescribe their duties and the course of education, in conformity with the law; to establish rules for the government and discipline of the students, not contrary to the laws of the land; to regulate tuition fees, and the rent of the dormitories occupied; to prescribe and control the duties and proceedings of all officers, servants, and others, with respect to the buildings, lands, appurtenances, and other property, and interests of the University; to draw from the literary funds such monies as HISTORICAL SKETCH. are by law charged on it for this institution; and, in general, to direct and do all matters and things which, not being inconsistent with the laws of the land, to them shall seem most expedient for promoting the purposes of said institution; which several functions they shall be free to exercise in the form of by-laws, resolutions, orders, instructions, or otherwise, as they shall deem proper. "7. They shall have two stated meetings in every year, to-wit, on the first Mondays of April and October; and occasional meetings at such other times as they shall appoint, or on a special call, with such notice as themselves shall prescribe by a general rule; which meetings shall be at the University; a majority of them constituting a quorum for business, and on the death, resignation of a member, or failure to act for the space of one year, or on his removal out of the Commonwealth, or by the Governor, with the advice of Council, the Governor with like advice shall appoint a successor. "8. The said rector and visitors shall be a body corporate, under the style and title of `The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.' with the right, as such, to use a common seal; they shall have capacity to plead and be impleaded in all courts of justice, and in all cases interesting to the University, which may be subjects of legal cognizance and jurisdiction; which pleas shall not abate by the determination of their office, but shall stand revived in the name of their successors; and they shall be capable in law, and in trust for the University, of receiving subscriptions and donations, real and personal, as well as from bodies corporate or persons associated, as from private individuals. "9. And the said rector and visitors shall, at all times, conform to such laws as the legislature may, from time to time, think proper to enact for their government; and the said University shall in all things, and at all times, be subject to the control of the legislature. And the said rector and visitors of the University of Virginia shall be, and they are hereby required to make report annually to the president and directors of the literary fund (to be laid before the legislature at the next succeeding session), embracing a full account of the disbursements, the funds on hand, and a general statement of the condition of said University. "10. The said board of visitors, or a majority thereof, by nomination of the board, shall, once in every year at least, visit the said University; enquire into the proceedings and practices thereat; examine the progress of the students, and give to those who excel in every branch of science, there taught, such honorary marks and testimonials of approbation as may encourage and incite to industry and emulation. "11. On every twenty-ninth day of February, or, if that be Sunday, then HISTORICAL SKETCH. on the next, or earliest day thereafter on which a meeting can be effected, the Governor and Council shall be in session, and shall appoint visitors of the said University, either the same or others at their discretion, to serve until the twenty-ninth day of February next ensuing, duly and timely notifying to them their appointment, and prescribing a day for their first meeting at the University; after which, their meetings, stated and occasional, shall be as hereinbefore provided: Provided, that nothing in this act contained shall suspend the proceedings of the visitors of the said Central College of Albemarle; but for the purpose of expediting any objects of said institution, they shall be authorized, under the control of the Governor and Council, to continue the exercise of their functions, and fulfill those of their successors, until the first actual meeting of their said successors. "12. And be it further enacted, That the additional sum of twenty thousand dollars shall be, and the same is hereby, appropriated to the education of the poor, out of the revenue of the literary fund, in the aid of the sum heretofore appropriated to that object, and to be paid in the same manner and upon the same conditions in all respects as is prescribed by the fourth section of the act, entitled `An act appropriating part of the revenue of the literary fund, and for other purposes, passed the twenty-first day of February, eighteen hundred and eighteen.' "13. This act shall commence and be in force from and after the passing thereof." (Revised Code, 1819, ch. 34, p. 90.) The first Board of Visitors consisted of four members of the old board of Central Collegeânamely, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Joseph Carrington Cabell, and John H. Cocke; the additional appointees were James Breckenridge, Chapman Johnson, and Robert Taylor. The board met for the first time on March 29, 1819, and elected Thomas Jefferson Rector. Henceforth, until his death in 1826, Jefferson was the dominating and directing power of the University, not only evolving the entire system of education introduced, but actually devising, to the minutest detail, every feature of construction and administration. GOVERNMENT AND ORGANIZATION. The organization of the University, its government, discipline, and methods of instruction, were virtually prescribed by Jefferson alone; and in many respects they still retain the impression derived from him. By virtue of its charter, the supreme government of the institution, under the General Assembly, is invested in the Rector and Visitors. Under the general direction of this board, and subject to its regulations, the affairs HISTORICAL SKETCH. of the University were administered, for the first eighty years of its existence, by the Faculty and its Chairman, the latter being a member of the Faculty, who occupied temporarily the position of chief executive officer of the institution. As the University grew, it became more and more difficult for a member of the teaching staff to fill the position of chairman, and attend to the manifold executive duties attached to that office. In October, 1903, the Visitors decided that modern conditions rendered necessary the creation of the office of president; and in June, 1904, Dr. Edwin Anderson Alderman was elected first president of the University of Virginia. The scheme of instruction organized by Jefferson contemplated no fixed uniform curriculum of studies to be pursued by every student alike, without discrimination. Each distinct branch of knowledge was, as far as was practicable, assigned to an individual "School" with its own instructors; and the University was to consist of a collection of independent Schools. The origin of the elective system at the University of Virginia is found in the fact that students were permitted to matriculate in any School or Schools of the University for which they were prepared. The original organization consisted of eight independent Schoolsâ namely, Ancient Languages, Modern Languages, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Moral Philosophy, Chemistry, Medicine, and Law. The first seven Schools mentioned were opened to matriculates on March 7, 1825,â with an aggregate attendance, during the first session, of 123 students. The School of Law was not opened until 1826. This original organization was, of course, gradually enlarged and modified. As early as 1837 the School of Medicine was elevated to a Department, consisting of three individual Schools; while in 1850 the School of Law was enlarged to a Department consisting of two Schools. Other Departments and Schools have been added from time to time, until the University organization arrived at its present condition, as described elsewhere in this catalogue. It was provided by the first Board of Visitors, in accordance with Jefferson's wishes, that but two degrees should be conferred by the University. The lower degree, characteristic of the institution for many years, was conferred upon a student who had completed all the work offered in any one School; to such a candidate the untitled degree of "Graduate" in the School in question should be given. The other, the higher degree, was to be the Doctor's degree, and was to be given to the graduate in two or more Schools who had, in addition, exhibited well-developed powers of research. There is abundant evidence that, in planning the organization of the HISTORICAL SKETCH. University of Virginia, Jefferson had in mind the so-called continental type of university. The first faculty were, however, with one or two exceptions, Oxford or Cambridge men. Naturally they had in mind the English type of university: the result of which was that they soon substituted (in 1831) for the Doctor's degree proposed by Jefferson, the Master's degree, common in England. The degree of "Master of Arts of the University of Virginia" was accordingly, for more than half a century, the leading degree conferred by this institution. As at present organized, the University comprises twenty-five distinct and independent Schools. The courses of instruction given in these are so coÃ¶rdinated as to form six Departments, two of which are academic, and four professional (or technical); viz.: THE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS. The College, with the degrees of: Bachelor of Arts; Cultural Bachelor of Science; Vocational Bachelor of Science. The Department of Graduate Studies, with the degrees of: Graduate in a School; Master of Arts; Master of Science; Doctor of Philosophy. THE PROFESSIONAL DEPARTMENTS. The Department of Law, with the degree of Bachelor of Laws. The Department of Medicine, with the degree of Doctor of Medicine. The Department of Engineering, with the degrees of: Civil Engineer; Mechanical Engineer; Electrical Engineer; Mining Engineer; Chemical Engineer. The Department of Agriculture, with the degree of Bachelor of Science in Agriculture. THE CORPORATION OF THE UNIVERSITY. THE CORPORATION OF THE UNIVERSITY.

Charlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The Sanitary arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete; there are two athletic fields; the Fayerweather Gymnasium affords ample facilities for bathing and exercise; and in all ordinary cases of illness students receive treatment from the University Physician, with skilful nursing, when necessary, in a well equipped hospital. Faculty, Endowment, and Equipment.âThe faculty numbers ninety-nine; the libraries contain 70,000 volumes. The University owns five hundred and twenty-two acres of land, valued at $600,000; has thirty buildings which cost approximately $1,547,000; holds productive funds to amount of $1,224,420, and receives an annual appropriation from State of Virginia of $80,000. The annual expenditures are $212,318.14. In scientific studies large facilities are offered by the Leander McCormick Observatory, the Rouss Physical Laboratory, the Chemical Laboratory and the Museum of Industrial Chemistry, the Lewis Brooks Museum, the Biological Laboratory, the Anatomical Laboratory, the Pathological Laboratory, Physiological Laboratory and the Hospital, and Dispensary. The Engineering Department possesses a well equipped Mechanical Laboratory and Machine Shop. The Courses of Instruction are comprised in six Departments, two of which are Academic, and four professional. The former include the College and the Department of Graduate Studies: the latter the Departments of Law, Medicine, Engineering, and Agriculture. In the various departments there are altogether twenty-five distinct Schools, each affording an independent course, under the direction of professors who are responsible for the systems and methods pursued. Elective System.âThe system of independent Schools assumes that opportunities for study and instruction are privileges to be sought voluntarily and eagerly. Students are therefore allowed to elect for themselves the courses of study to which they are led by their individual tastes and proposed pursuits in life, as far as the time appointed for lectures and ANNOUNCEMENTS. examinations permits. Nor is it alone to those who wish to make special attainments in single departments of knowledge that this freedom of election commends itself. It has decided advantages also for most of those students who seek the common goal of liberal education by ways which varying aptitude, varying preparation, or varying opportunities render of necessity different. The wisdom of the founder in establishing such a system has been amply vindicated in the history of this University; and in recent years many schools of higher education throughout the country have adopted methods involving this principle. The Session begins on the Thursday preceding the seventeenth of September, and continues, with a recess of ten days at Christmas, until the Wednesday before the nineteenth of June. The first three days of the session are given to registration, and all students, both old and new, are required during that time to place their names upon the books of the University and the rolls of their respective classes. Lecture courses begin upon the following Monday, and absences will be recorded against any student not present, from the opening lecture of each course. Students entering after the first three days will be charged a fee for registration. Religious Worship.âMorality and religion are recognized as the foundation and indispensable concomitants of education. The discipline of the University is sedulously administered with a view to confirm integrity, and to maintain a sacred regard for truth. Great efforts are made to surround the students with religious influences; but experience having proved that it is best to forbear the employment of coercion, the attendance on religious exercises is entirely voluntary. Divine service is conducted twice on Sunday in the University Chapel by clergymen invited from the principal religious denominations; and other religious exercises are directed by the Young Men's Christian Association. The Examinations in each class at this institution have, from the beginning (A. D. 1825), been held in writing. Oral examinations are held in some departments, but they are auxiliary to the written examinations, which, in conjunction with the class standing as determined by the daily work of the student, are the main tests of the student's proficiency. A special examination may be granted upon physician's certificate of sickness on the day of examination, or other cause which the Faculty of the Department in question may accept as adequate ground. See also pp. 87-91. The written examinations are, in every case, of a public character, and are conducted by a committee of three professors, one of whom is the professor whose class is examined. This committee is expected to remain in the room during examination, supervise the proceedings, determine doubts, grant special examinations in cases covered by law, and make ANNOUNCEMENTS. report to the Faculty of the results of the examination. The committee, not the professor solely, is responsible throughout. Reports.âReports are sent, at stated intervals, to the parent or guardian of each student. These reports give the number of times the student has been absent from lectures; and indicate, as nearly as is practicable, the nature of the progress made by him in his work at the University. Honor System.âFor eighteen years after the opening of the institution, honesty at the written examinations was sought to be secured by the strict surveillance of the committee alone. This was often found to be ineffectual. In June, 1842, Judge Henry St. George Tucker, Professor of Law, offered the following resolution, which the Faculty at once adopted: Resolved, That in all future written examinations for distinction and other honors of the University, each candidate shall attach to the written answer presented by him on such examination a certificate in the following words: "I, A. B., do hereby certify on honor that I have derived no assistance during the time of this examination from any source whatever, whether oral, written, or in print, in giving the above answers." This was the beginning of the honor system at this institution. In subsequent years the pledge was extended so as to preclude the giving as well as the receiving of assistance. The system has been in operation since 1842 without interruption. Its wisdom and its beneficial results have been abundantly demonstrated. Its administration imposes no burden upon the Faculty. Experience shows that the students themselves are its sternest guardians and executors. Violation of examination pledges has been of rare occurrence. In every case the culprit has been quietly but promptly eliminated without need of Faculty action. The spirit of truth and honor, thus fostered in the examination-room, has gradually pervaded the entire life of the institution, and all the relations between the student and professor. It is not believed to be essential to the honor system, nor indeed to be right, to expose the examinee to unnecessary temptation to violate his pledge. The student is regarded as one to be shielded from such influences and to have his honorable tendencies carefully reinforced and not wrecked. Hence the examination is held in one place where all candidates are assembled, and in the presence of a committee of the Faculty. Conversation among the candidates and absence from the room are discouraged. They are cautioned to avoid even the appearance of evil. These safeguards have been found to be in entire harmony with the absence of espionage. The fact that the candidate is not suspected, ANNOUNCEMENTS. has been found to lead always to the avoidance of conduct which would give rise to suspicion. Degrees are conferred only upon examination after residence The requirements for these degrees are given under the several departments. No honorary degree is conferred by the University of Virginia. Licentiates.âAny person of unexceptional character and habits, upon producing to the Faculty satisfactory evidence of suitable capacity, and attainments, may be licensed by the Faculty to form classes for private instruction in any School of the University, in aid of and in conformity to the public teachings of the professor upon any subject taught therein. The employment and compensation of any such Licentiate are matters of private agreement between him and the student. Students whose preparation is defective for the work of the University classes may often economize time and energy by securing the services of a Licentiate at the same time that they are attending the regular course of lectures. Directions for New Students.âNew students will find it greatly to their advantage if, as soon as possible after reporting to the Dean of the University, they will go to Madison Hall, where a committee of students will be found who will gladly be of any service in assisting them to get settled as quickly as possible. A general information bureau, a complete list of boarding houses with prices of board, a directory of the students with their addresses, a list of all forms of employment open to students, copies of the University Handbook, and other things of interest to the new men will there be accessible to all. The General Secretary of the Association will be pleased to correspond with prospective students during the summer with regard to all such matters, and it is suggested that every man who expects to enter the University inform him of that fact. See p. 264. REGULATIONS. REGULATIONS. REGISTRATION. Registration of New Students.âApplicants seeking admission to the University for the first time are required to present themselves to the Dean of the University at his office in the Administration Building at some time during the first three days of the session. Each candidate for admission must be at least sixteen years of age. In each instance a certificate of good moral character must be presented, signed by the proper official of the institution attended during the previous session, or by some person of known standing. Each candidate who satisfies these requirements, and also those for admission by diploma, certificate, or examination previously stated, will be directed to the Dean of the Department which he purposes to enter. The Dean in question will, upon being satisfied that the candidate is fitted to enter upon the work of the Department, issue to him a card containing the names of the courses which the candidate proposes to pursue during the session: this card must be presented in turn to each professor concerned, who will, on satisfying himself that the applicant is prepared to pursue the course in question with profit, sign the card and enter the applicant's name upon the roll of the class. The card must then be returned to the Dean of the University, who will endorse upon it the amount of fees to be paid to the Bursar. On payment of these fees the registration (for the session) of the applicant as a student of the University will be completed. Registration of Matriculated Students.âStudents who have already been matriculated as members of the University are required to present themselves directly to the Dean of their respective Departments upon one of the first three days of the session, and to conform, as regards their registration in their respective classes and the payment of fees, to the requirements stated in the preceding paragraph. Registration after the Christmas Recess.âOn the first week-day after the Christmas Recess every student is required to register with the Dean of his department between the hours of nine a. m. and two p. m. Any student failing to thus register, will have his name dropped from the rolls of his classes until further order from the Dean, but such student may be registered by the Dean and restored to his position in his classes on payment to the Bursar of the delayed registration fee of $3.00. In case the delay in the student's return is due to illness, or to REGULATIONS. other like providential cause, the Dean is authorized to remit the fee and excuse the absence; in every other case the absences due to delayed return shall be recorded as unexcused absences; shall be so reported to the parent or guardian of the student; and shall be given serious adverse weight in considering the fitness of the student for graduation. Delayed Registration.âStudents are not permitted to delay their registration through carelessness or for inadequate reasons. Any student, new or old, who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session and between the hours of nine a. m. and 2 p. m. on the first week-day after the Christmas Recess will (except in the case of an applicant admitted to special examinations, as provided in a previous paragraph) be admitted to registration only upon the consent of the President, and will be charged a special registration fee of three dollars. RESIDENCE, ATTENDANCE AND GRADE. The Academic Year extends from the morning of the Thursday preceding the seventeenth of September to the evening of the Wednesday before the nineteenth of June. Thanksgiving Day is a holiday, and there is a Christmas recess beginning on the morning of the twenty-fourth of December and closing on the evening of the second of January. Attendance is required of each student throughout the entire session, with the exception of the days above indicated, unless he has received permission to be temporarily absent, or to withdraw before its close. Leave of absence is granted by the Deans for sufficient reasons, and must in every case be obtained in advance. Voluntary withdrawal requires the written consent of the student's professors and of the Dean of the University. While in residence each student is required to attend regularly all lectures and other prescribed exercises and all examinations in the courses which he pursues (unless excused for cause) and in every way to conform to the regulations of the University. Absence from the University is permitted upon the written leave of the Dean of the Department in which the student is registered, obtained in every case in advance. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or musical clubs on excursions will not be granted, except to the officers and members of the organizations. Absence of Athletic Teams and other Student Organizations.â The laws relating to absence from the University of members of the Athletic teams are found in the section upon Physical Training (pp. 265-269). The same resolutions apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors, but REGULATIONS. only for sickness or like providential cause. Such excuses must be rendered on the day of the first lecture attended after the absence. Unexcused absences from lectures render the student liable to be disciplined by the Faculty. In case of delayed entrance the student is regarded as having been absent from all lectures or other exercises that have been given, in the courses which he enters, since the beginning of the session. Absence from Examinations will not be excused except for sickness on the day of examination (attested by a physician's certificate) or other cause which the Faculty of the Department by special order may approve. An unexcused absence, or the presentation of an unpledged paper, is counted as a total failure in the examination in which it occurs. A student whose absence from examinations is excused is admitted to the Fall Examination in the subject in question in each of the departments where such examinations are held. Where necessary, he is admitted to a special examination. Change of Schools, with transfer of fees, cannot be made except by special order of the Faculty. But a student may change from one class to another of the same School with the advice and consent of the professors concerned. The Grade of the Student in any course, either for a term or for the session, is determined by the combined class standing and the result of examination, each being considered in such proportion as the professor in charge may decide for the course in question. Class Standing in any course is determined by the regularity of attendance of the student upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercises where included) in the course in question, and by the faithful performance of his work as indicated by his answers when questioned, by his written exercises, notebooks, the faithful performance of laboratory (or other similar) work, etc. Students are regarded by the Faculty as under the law of honor in matters affecting class standing as in examinations. Probation.âAny student in the College or the Department of Engineering whose term grade is below forty per cent. at either the December or the March examination in each of two subjects will be put upon probation until the following examination: a like failure at that time will make it necessary for him to withdraw from the University. Any student whose term grade is below forty per cent. in all courses at any examination will be required to withdraw from the University. A student in any Department of the University who is evidently making no real progress in one of his courses of study may at any time, after due admonition, be required to drop the course in question. A student in REGULATIONS. the College or the Department of Engineering who falls under this rule will be put upon probation if he fails to attain a grade of forty per cent. in a single one of his remaining courses at a succeeding examination. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the student's professors and of the Dean of the University. When a permit is granted upon the University Physician's certificate that withdrawal is necessary on account of the student's ill-health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct, the fees are returned pro rata. Under no other circumstances will there be a return of fees. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the Faculty for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also "Probation" above. CONDUCT. Conduct.âThe laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or not. They require from the student regular and diligent application to his studies, and if, in the opinion of the Faculty, any student be not fulfilling the purposes for which he ought to have come to the University, and be not likely to fulfill them, either from habitual delinquency in any of his classes, or from habitual idleness, or from any other bad habit, the President, upon recommendation of the Faculty, may require him to withdraw from the University, after informing him of the objections to his conduct and affording him an opportunity of explanation and defense. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University for the residue of the current session every student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. The Keeping of Dogs by students within the University grounds is forbidden. In all cases of Discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. Prohibition of Credit.âAn act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting minor students. The license to contract debts, which the President is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity. REGULATIONS. DORMITORY, BOARD, MEDICAL ATTENDANCE. Dormitory.âStudents may reside in the University dormitories, in private houses approved by the President, or in their homes. Any change of residence during the session should be reported at the office of the Registrar. The occupant of a dormitory has first right to it, and may reserve it for the next session by registration with the Bursar before the end of the current session; thereafter any vacant dormitory is assigned to the first applicant. But unless a deposit of fifteen dollars is made with the Bursar on or before September 1, the room is forfeited. No dormitory may be sublet or used for other than its proper purpose. Boarding.âStudents may board and lodge either in the University precincts or at their homes, or in houses licensed by the Faculty. It is the duty of the President to withdraw the license from any house in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Change of lodging should be reported at the Registrar's office. Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the University Physician; and, if necessary, to skilful nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for his maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, chronic cases, or to constitutional disorders of long standing from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Students who take the responsibility of boarding at houses not approved by the Board of Health forfeit the right to this exemption. Students residing at their own homes, who waive this right, are entitled to the remission of a portion of the University fee. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the University Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. Physical Training.âNo student is permitted to undertake an amount of work greater than he may reasonably be expected to do well without detriment to his physical health; and every student is advised to take a due amount of daily outdoor exercise, for which ample opportunities are afforded upon the athletic fields, the tennis courts, the golf course, and in other forms; and in addition, to make systematic use of the facilities afforded without cost for definite and judicious physical training at the Fayerweather Gymnasium, under the advice and instruction of the Director and his assistants. Further information upon this important subject will be found upon a subsequent page. EXPENSES. EXPENSES. All tuition fees, University fees, the contingent deposits, rents of rooms in the University buildings, and charges for service in the same, are payable upon entrance. Under special conditions the President is authorized to allow credit; but these deferred payments are in all cases to be properly secured. Students permitted to register during a term are required to pay the full fees for the term in which they register. Under no circumstances will there be a return of fees except upon certificate from the University Physician that withdrawal from the University is necessary on account of the student's illness, which must not be due to dissolute conduct. Upon receipt of the University Physician's certificate, the President will return the fees, pro rata. A student's necessary expenses are as follows: I. University Charges, which are the same for all students, except College and Graduate students from Virginia, as stated in a following paragraph; II. School Fees, which depend upon the course of study pursued; III. Cost of Living, board, etc. I. University Charges.âUnder the first head are included (a) University fee, $40 ($10 for Virginians in Academic Departments), and (b) the contingent deposit, $10; as well as (c) the special Entrance Examination fee of five dollars, (d) the delinquent registration fee of three dollars, and (e) a fee for reÃ¶xamination in any subject where any of these is incurred. (a) The University Fee goes to the fund intended to defray the general expenses of the University. Payment of this fee entitles the student, without additional charge, to the use of the Library; to the privileges of the Gymnasium, with baths, private lockers, etc., and the advice and aid of the Instructor in Physical Culture; and to free medical attendance by the University Physician in cases of illness, including, if needed, care and nursing in a well-equipped hospital maintained on the University grounds, under the limitations stated in a preceding paragraph. It also covers all regular examination and diploma fees. (b) The Contingent Deposit is liable for any damage to the University property for which the student is responsible, or for violations of Library EXPENSES. or other University rules. It is returned at the end of the session, less any charges that may have been made against it; it is, therefore, not necessarily an expense, although mentioned in this connection. From this deposit there will be deducted the sum of $2 for the support of the Chapel Services and General Religious Work of the University, unless within one month after registration the student shall request the Bursar not to deduct this contribution. It will be observed that this amount also (which is less than the average contribution made by the students who have given toward the Chapel Fund in past years) is not a necessary expense, as the support of the religious work of the University is left entirely to the option of the students and professors. This method of collection is intended merely as a substitute for the canvass formerly made, and it is the desire of the Faculty that the students will thus unite with them in sustaining the religious work of the University. (c) The Special Entrance Examination Fee of five dollars is required of all applicants for admission to the University by examination who for good reason are unable to be present at the regular entrance examinations on the dates as set forth on p. 71 of the catalogue. All candidates who take entrance examinations on the regular dates, are examined free of charge. (d) The Delinquent Registration Fee of three dollars is charged where the student or candidate, through carelessness or other inadequate reason, fails to present himself for registration, during the first three days of the session; or where the student fails to register with the Dean of his Department, between the hours of 9 a. m. and 2 p. m. on the first week day after the expiration of the Christmas Recess, unless his late return be due to illness or like providential cause. (e) The Re-examination Fee: A student of the College who attains in any course a grade below 75 per cent. but not below 65 per cent. may, upon the written recommendation of the Professor in charge, be admitted by the Faculty at their final meeting in June, to re-examination upon that course, during the registration week of the following September. The fee for each re-examination shall be $5.00 payable to the Bursar on or before the 15th day of July. II. School Fees.âUnder the second head is comprised the charge for instruction, including the Tuition Fees proper, and in some cases, the cost of apparatus and materials consumed in laboratory work. In the Academic Departments the tuition fee for one School is $50; for two, $30 each; for three or more, $25 each; except that in Analytical Chemistry the charge for tuition and materials for one course is $50 and EXPENSES. for apparatus about $10, and for both courses $100, and for apparatus, about $15. In the Chemistry courses for undergraduates, a laboratory fee of $10 is charged, and apparatus and materials are furnished at cost. The charges for a graduate course in Chemistry are: Tuition, $50; laboratory fee, $10; apparatus and material are furnished at cost. In the Physics Courses a laboratory fee of $5 is charged. The fee for agricultural Chemistry is $15, but this course is free to students in the Schools of Chemistry, to Virginia students, and to unmatriculated farmers; and in ZoÃ¶logy or Comparative Anatomy there is a laboratory fee, for materials, of $10 in the undergraduate courses and $20 in the graduate courses. Students from Virginia.âIn compliance with the statute (Virginia Code 1887, Ch. 68, Sec. 1554), the University offers to white male students from Virginia who are sixteen years or more of age, instruction, without charge for tuition, in all the Schools of the Academic Departments (excepting the laboratory courses in Chemistry and Physics), subject to the conditions stated below. Such students are required to pay the University fee to Virginia students in the Academic department of $10 and make the usual contingent deposit. They are also required to pay the regular laboratory charges for materials, etc., in the courses of study where such charges occur. If they occupy rooms on the University grounds they are of course subject to the usual charges for rent and service. The saving to Virginia students varies from $90 to $130, according to the number of Schools elected. To be entitled to free tuition as a Virginia student under the above mentioned statute, it is necessary that the applicant's parents be bona fide residents of the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; if he has attained his majority, it is necessary that he be a bona fide resident. A resident of the State is one who is living in it at the time the application is made and has no present intention of removing therefrom in the future. No other person can honestly avail himself of this privilege. White Male Teachers and Superintendents of the Public Schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Schools of the Academic Departments of the University without payment of fees, upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the Public Schools of the State during the year. Immediately after the Spring Examinations any of the following courses may be entered upon with profit by an applicant prepared for them: Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, German, English, English Literature and Rhetoric, History, Moral Philosophy, Mathematics, Astronomy, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Geology, and Descriptive Botany. Special courses for teachers will be offered in English and Mathematics, EXPENSES. and perhaps in several other subjects during the approaching spring term, if the demand for them is sufficient. Applicants for admission as teachers are required to send in their names to the President of the University not later than March 5th. Lodgings can be had near the University. The only necessary expense will be for board, lights, and washing, which will together cost from $5 to $7 a week. Privileged Students.âMinisters of the gospel may attend any of the Academic Schools of the University without the payment of tuition fees. The same privileges will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet the expenses of education at the University without aid.

For such irregular courses, the fee may be estimated approximately, by multiplying the number of lecture periods in the courses taken, by 30, and dividing by 100. The result will approximately represent the fee in dollars. EXPENSES. COMPARATIVE STATEMENT OF PROBABLE NECESSARY EXPENSES.

For these students the fee for tuition is $90 for the first year, $80 for the second, $70 for the third, and $60 for the fourth. A laboratory fee of $10 is charged in General Chemistry Course 1; an additional charge of $60 is made for materials and instruction in Analytical Chemistry to students of Mining Engineering. The payment of the Department fee entitles the student not only to attend all the regular courses for one year, but also to take over, without additional charge, such courses of any previous year as he may have failed to complete. Virginians are entitled to a reduction of $45 a year from the charges. EXPENSES. COMPARATIVE STATEMENT OF PROBABLE NECESSARY EXPENSES. FOR VIRGINIANS FOR NON VIRGINIANS Low Aver. Liberal Low Aver.

Cost of Living.âUnder the third head fall the expenses of living and the cost of books and stationery. A student may, either alone or with a room-mate, rent a dormitory, and take his meals in the University Commons, or in an approved private boarding-house; or he may take both room and board in such boardinghouse, in which case he pays no room-rent or servant's hire to the University. The price of University rooms ranges, according to their desirability, from $30 to $50 for the session, exclusive of heat and light; the large majority rent for $40; but there are a few single rooms at $30, and a few whose price is above that of the majority. If two students occupy one room, each pays half the rent; the University charge for service is $9 per session for each student, whether there be one or two in a room. The minimum cost of furnishing a room may be placed at $15, fuel and lights combined cost $25 for the session, and washing from $1.50 upward per month. With strict economy the cost of board, fuel, lights, service, and laundry can be brought within $15 a month as an average for the session. Rooms and board may be had in private families or boarding-houses at varying prices. The cost of books and stationery varies much with the branches studied. It is probably greatest in the Department of Law, where, for the entire three years' course, it amounts to about $105. But in this department as in that of Medicine, the books purchased form the necessary nucleus EXPENSES. of a professional library, and their cost does not belong to transient expenses. Pecuniary Aid to Students.âEffort is now being made to provide a fund, the income of which will be applied in rendering financial aid to deserving students. In the meantime, opportunity is afforded as far as possible to those who are desirous of helping themselves by their own industry, and it may be safely stated that any student with sufficient resources to carry him through the first half of the session, can be reasonably sure of obtaining work enough to pay living expenses and university fees for the remainder of the college year. While it is difficult for any student to be assured of remunerative work before he reaches the University, correspondence with reference to such employment may be had by addressing the Secretary of the Committee on Student Self-Help, Madison Hall. The University Commons.âThis Building conveniently situated near the center of the University, provides an attractive Dining Hall, with accommodations for more than 250 students at once. Board is furnished at the rate of $15 per month, which means that students in straitened circumstances need not be deprived of daily association with their more fortunate fellows. The Commons is the means of greatly reducing a student's living expenses at the University. SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS. SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS. GENERAL SCHOLARSHIPS. The following regulations with regard to the General Scholarships offered by the University have been adopted by the Board of Visitors: The Faculty is authorized to prepare a list of such schools and colleges tributary to the University as by the regularity of their patronage, of the success of their graduates, may deserve special recognition. To each one of the schools placed on this list, the Faculty is authorized to award a scholarship in the College; to each of the colleges, a scholarship in the Department of Graduate Studies, these scholarships to be known as the University of Virginia Scholarship in â School or College. The scholarship shall entitle the holder who must be a graduate of his institution of the preceding session, to the remission of all tuition and University fees, except the fees in Analytical Chemistry, if he be a Virginian; and if he be not a Virginian, to the remission of all tuition fees, except in Analytical Chemistry, and one-half of the University fee. The contingent fee must be deposited in either case. This list of Schools and Colleges may be extended from time to time and further scholarships assigned as above. In accordance with this regulation, the Faculty has selected the following institutions for such recognition, and pending the consideration of other institutions, invites application for enrollment in this list from such schools as fall within the conditions prescribed above: Atlanta University School, Atlanta, Ga.

VIRGINIA PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL SCHOLARSHIPS. The University offers to accredited Public High Schools of Virginia, one scholarship each in the College, on the conditions prescribed below. This scholarship, for one session (that following the incumbent's graduation from the High School), when awarded by the designated High School to a white male graduate, who has pursued and completed with credit the High School course, and who is endorsed by the principal of the High School in question as to both preparation and character, shall entitle the holder to a remission of all fees payable to the University, except the fees in Analytical Chemistry. The holders of these scholarships are required to deposit the contingent fee. Any school accepting this scholarship shall make due announcement SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS. of it both to the scholars of the school and through the local papers; and at the end of the session shall, during the graduating exercises and through the public press, announce the award; and these appointments shall be duly certified to the Dean of the University. This list of Virginia Public High Schools may be extended from time to time and further scholarships assigned as above. In accordance with this regulation of the Board of Visitors, the Faculty has selected the following institutions for such recognition, and, pending the consideration of other institutions, invites applications for enrollment in this list from such schools as fall within the conditions prescribed above: Bedford City High School, Bedford City, Va.

At the meeting of the Board of Visitors on March 2d, 1899, the following system of Alumni Scholarships was created: 1. These Scholarships shall be known as Alumni Scholarships. 2. The incumbents shall be appointed by such local Alumni Association as are members in good standing of the General Alumni Association and are so reported from year to year by its Secretary; and by such of these only as may have ten or more active members who are entitled to vote on the appointment of an incumbent. 3. No incumbent shall hold such Scholarship for more than one year; but one who has passed satisfactory examinations at the University in one or more of his classes may be eligible for reappointment the following session upon the recommendation of the Faculty. 4. These Scholarships shall be confined to those courses in the Academic Schools of the University to which Virginia students are now admitted without charge under the laws of Virginia (that is, all Academic courses, save the course in Analytical Chemistry). The Scholarship shall entitle the incumbent to exemption from tuition fees in the Schools referred to, and to the remission, if he be a Virginian, of the University fee; if he be not a Virginian, to one-half of the University fee. The Contingent fee must be deposited in all cases. 5. Only such persons may be appointed as actually stand in need of such aid, and such as otherwise would not, in the judgment of the Association making the appointment, be able to attend the University: and no student will be permitted to enjoy the privileges of an Alumni Scholarship while holding an endowed Scholarship or Fellowship. 6. The incumbent must be at least eighteen years of age, and must be one who, in the judgment of the Association naming him, is studious, of good moral character, and prepared to enter the University. He shall be subject to the same entrance requirements as other students. 7. Every local Alumni Association, as above described, having ten or more active members, shall be entitled annually to have one appointee at the University; if hereafter such Association ceases to have as many as ten active members, it shall not be entitled to make an appointment until that number be restored. 8. Every such local Association having fifty or more active members shall be entitled to fill two such scholarships annually, as long as it shall continue to have as many as fifty such members, or as soon as it shall have reached that number. SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS. 9. By "active" members as herein used, is meant Alumni of the University, who have been admitted by the Association as active members thereof, in accordance with the rules laid down by the Association. No Alumnus shall be entitled to vote upon the appointment of an incumbent in more than one Association during the same year, nor for this purpose shall an Alumnus be considered as an active member of more than one Association, at the same time. But graduation in any Department or School of the University is not hereby required. 10. Only one Association in any city or town shall be entitled to appoint incumbents to the Scholarships hereby created. 11. The final appointment of each incumbent shall be made by a vote of the whole Association, a majority of the active members voting for the applicant. It shall not finally be made by any committee or by any officer or officers of the Association. But such committee or officers may be appointed by the Association to nominate or examine candidates, and to report to the Association. 12. A statement, which shall include the full name and address of the successful candidate, the fact of his appointment, and the specific compliance of the Association and the candidate in question with conditions above stated, must be certified to the President of the University of Virginia, attested by the signature of the Secretary of the Association making the appointment. This certificate must be in the hands of the President on or before the fifteenth day of August preceding the opening of the session for which the incumbent is appointed. The President will send printed forms of such certificates upon application. 13. The above requirements having been complied with, the person or persons so appointed shall be entitled in each instance to attend the University for the session immediately following the appointment without payment of any tuition fees (save for the course in Analytical Chemistry) and to the remission, if he be a Virginian, of the University fee; if he be not a Virginian, of one half of the University fee: the Contingent fee being deposited in each case; and shall enjoy the same privileges and be subject to the same restrictions as other students. 14. To guard against any possible ill-feeling or sense of injustice on the part of any local Association in respect to the construction of these provisions, all such matters shall be referred to the Executive Committee of the General Alumni Association, the decision of which, when approved by the President of the University, shall be final. SPECIAL SCHOLARSHIPS. One of the Miller Scholarships is awarded, at the close of each SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS. session, to the candidate who passes with the highest aggregate of marks, in Physics 1B, Chemistry 1B, and Biology 1B. The tenure is for two years, and the emolument is two hundred and fifty dollars a year, with free tuition in the Scientific Schools. Other conditions are stated in connection with the Department of Agriculture. The McCormick Scholarship, established in honor of the late Leander J. McCormick, the founder of the Astronomical Observatory, is awarded by Mr. Robert Hall McCormick, of Chicago. The emolument is free tuition in any Department of the University, with remission of the University fee. The Isaac Carey Scholarship is awarded by the Carey Trustees. Its value is about three hundred dollars a year. The Thompson Brown Scholarship is awarded by its founder. Its value is one hundred and twenty dollars a year.

The Henry Coalter Cabell Scholarship is awarded by the Visitors to a graduate student upon the recommendation of the Committee of the School of English Literature. Its value is fifty dollars a year. FELLOWSHIPS. The Vanderbilt Fellowships are supported out of the working fund of the Leander McCormick Observatory. They are assigned to advanced students who take Astronomy as their major subject and occupy a portion of their time in work connected with the Observatory. They are appointed upon the recommendation of the Director of the Observatory, to whom applications for further information should be made. The value of each Fellowship is three hundred and fifty dollars a year, with the remission of all fees. The John Y. Mason Fellowship, founded upon the gift of Archer Anderson, Esq., of Richmond, Va., is awarded by the Visitors to some competent and deserving graduate student, born in Virginia and in need of such assistance. The value is two hundred dollars a year. The William Cabell Rives Fellowship, founded in honor of the distinguished statesmen of that name by his grandson, Dr. William Cabell SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS. Rives, of Washington, D. C., is awarded by the Board of Visitors, on the nomination of the President of the University, to a graduate student in History.

A., Assistant in Astronomy The Academic Schools comprise the Schools of Languages, Mathematics, Sciences, History, Literature, Economics, Philosophy, Education, and Biblical Literature. In the undergraduate courses of these Schools is comprised the work of the College with the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science; in the graduate courses is comprised the work of the Department of Graduate Studies, with the degrees of Graduate in a School, Master of Arts, Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy. The professors and instructors in the Academic Schools compose the Academic Faculty, which deals with questions concerning the work both of the College and of the Department of Graduate Studies. A full statement of the requirements for the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science will be found under the head of the College; of the requirements for the other academic degrees, under the Department of Graduate Studies. In the detailed account of the courses and equipment of the Academic Schools, given in the following pages, the order of the courses in the particular School, and the relation of each course to the academic degrees of the University, is indicated as follows: The numeral placed after each course indicates the order of the course in the particular School; the letter placed after the numeral indicates the value of the course as a part of the work required for an academic degree, viz.: A: the first-year course in a School, in which more than one year's work is required, if the School in question is elected as one of the subjects for the B. A. or for the B. S. degree. B: a course that has full value only as an elective for the B. A. or for the B. S. degree. C: a graduate course of full value, either as an elective-at-large for the B.

D: all graduate courses having full value for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, either as primary minor or major courses for that degree. The Academic Schools are here arranged according to the grouping of subjects for the B. A. and B. S. degrees. THE ACADEMIC SCHOOLS. SCHOOL OF LATIN. Professor Fitz-Hugh. Mr. Bolling. Mr. Myers. Mr. McLemore. Required for Admission to the Work of the School: The four units prescribed on page 78 for admission to Latin 1A. Preparation.âThe Latin work of the University finds its logical place in the public school system as the continuation of the Latin work of the High School. It presupposes accordingly four years of competent instruction in Latin, involving the Roman pronunciation, habitual observance of quantity and accent, regular drill in grammar and prose composition through all preparatory years, elementary Reader (Viri Romae), Nepos (Roman Lives), CÃ¦sar's Gallic War, Cicero's easier Orations. Ovid's Metamorphoses, and Vergil's Aeneid. If the preparation of the student justifies it, he will be admitted to advanced standing, with due credit for all work done elsewhere by him. Attention is further called to the importance of beginning Greek for all who wish to reap the full cultural benefit of the University courses in Latin. The study of at least one Romanic language also is very desirable. The Greek illumines incomparably all parts of Latin study, which bears in turn a like relation to the Romanic. General Statement.âThe first three years of University Latin are devoted to the broad cultural study of the language, literature, and life of the Romans. In the course of the instruction the effort is made to exhibit, as far as possible, the relation of Roman civilization to the Greek, on the one hand, and to Romanic and modern on the other, and thus to emphasize the unity and continuity of all human culture. The great desirability of a knowledge of Greek and of at least one Romanic language is therefore specially commended to the student of Latin. The work is organized in all years as follows: I. In Language: Systematic study of Latin grammar, with oral and written exercises in prose composition. One hour a week. II. In Literature: Reading of authors in culture-historical series. Two hours a week. III. In Life: Systematic study of Roman culture-history in English, hand in hand with the study of the Latin authors. Course 1A: The Higher Entrance Examination in Latin prerequisite. I. In Language: General grammar (Hale-Buck), with oral and written exercises (Moulton-Collar, Mather-Wheeler). II.

Course 2B: Course 1A or its equivalent prerequisite. I. In Language: General grammar (Gildersleeve-Lodge), with oral and written exercises (Gildersleeve-Lodge, Nutting, Bennett). II. In Literature: Historical and biographic, Livy's Early History of Rome (Books I-II), and Tacitus' Agricolaâlyric and didactic, Catullus' Odes and Vergil's Georgics, with study of the meters of lyric and didactic verseâphilosophic, Cicero's De Officiis and Seneca's Moral Essays. III. In Life: The religion, and mythology of the Romans, (Bailey's Religion of Rome, Fairbank's Mythology of Greece and Rome). Course 3B: Course 1A or its equivalent prerequisite. I. In Language: General grammar (Gildersleeve-Lodge), with oral and written exercises (Gildersleeve-Lodge, Nutting, Bennett). II. In Literature: Historical and descriptive, Livy's Hannibalic War, and Tacitus' Germaniaâlyric and idyllic, Horace's Odes, and Vergil's Bucolics, with study of the meters of lyric and idyllic verseâcritical and didactic, Cicero's De Claris Oratoribus and Quintilian's Training of the Orator. III. In Life: The artistic life of the Romans, (Tarbell's History of Greek Art, Goodyear's Roman Art). Course 4C: Course 2B or Course 3B or the equivalent of either prerequisite. I. In Language: Higher Syntax of the Cases and Moods (Gildersleeve-Lodge, Peters), with oral and written exercises (Bennett, Moore, Nettleship). II.

III. In Life: The history of Roman Literature, (Mackall's Latin Literature, and Laing's Masterpieces of Latin Literature). Course 5C: Course 2B or Course 3B or the equivalent of either THE ACADEMIC SCHOOLS. prerequisite.âGiven in alternate years with Course 4C, and furnishing a second M. A. elective in Latin. I. In Language: The History of the Latin Language (Bennett, Grandgent), with oral and written exercises (Bennett, Moore, Nettleship). II. In Literature: Historical and epistolary, Tacitus' Histories, and Pliny's Lettersâdramatic and satiric, Plautus' Mostellaria, Terence's Phormio, and Juvenal's Satires, with study of the meters of scenic and satiric verseâphilosophic, Lucretius' De Rerum Natura, and Cicero's De Natura Deorum. III. In Life: The history of Roman philosophy (Mayor's History of Ancient Philosophy from Thales to Cicero, and Pater's Marius the Epicurean). Course 6D: Course 4C or Course 5C, or the equivalent of either, prerequisite.âThis course is intended for those who desire to specialize in classical philology, and especially for those who choose Latin as their major elective for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Roman civilization is the link between the Hellenic and the Romanic, and hence Latin philology, which is the science of Roman civilization, has vital points of contact with Greek philology on the one hand and with Romanic on the other. If the candidate's main subject be Latin, a respectable familiarity with Greek is required, since the language, literature, and higher culture of the Romans are saturated with Greek influence. If the candidate's main subject be Romanic, the Greek requirement is waived as far as practically possible, and he is guided into the history of the Roman folk speech, the common source of the Romanic tongues, and into acquaintance with the authors who illustrate it in literature. Plan of Work.âIt is the aim of this course, as far as the teaching force and the resources of the School permit, to prepare the candidate to investigate independently the sources of our knowledge of the language, monuments (literary and objective) and life of the Romans. The following is therefore an outline of the course: I. In Language: Elements of comparative grammar (Giles, supplemented by Hirt and Sommer on Sounds and Inflections and by Brugmann and Schmalz on Syntax)âintroduction to Latin historical grammar (Lindsay, supplemented by Landgraf)âsystematic grammar (KÃ¼hner) with stylistic exercises, oral and written, in conjunction with Cicero's De Oratoreâreading of epigraphic and literary monuments illustrating the history of the Latin Language. II. In the Literary and Objective Monuments of the Romans: Reading of authors in groups systematically planned to illustrate the GREEK. literary life of the Romansâhistory and interpretation of textsâelements of palÃ¦ography (Johnson, supplemented by Thompson), epigraphy (Lindsay, supplemented by Egbert and Cagnat), numismatics (Gnecchi, supplemented by Hill), topography and remains (Platner, Peterson, Huelsen, Mau, Strack, Furtwaengler). III. In Roman Life: Constructive study of Roman culture-historyâ reading of authors illustrating the development of Roman civilizationâ study of modern authorities in Roman culture-history (Philippson, Nissen, Mommsen. Marquardt-Mommsen, Preller-Jordon, Springer-Michaelis and Winter, Schanz, Windelband). Aids.âFor the sake of first-hand access to important modern authorities in Latin philology, the candidate is urged to acquire a good reading knowledge of German, French, and Italian. Such a mastery of German and French is imperative. SCHOOL OF GREEK. Professor Humphreys. Mr. Hays. Required for Admission to the Work of the School: The General Entrance Examination. This school comprises the following courses: Course 1A: A course for beginners. Text-Books: Benner and Smyth's Beginner's Greek Book; Xenophon's Anabasis.

At present the additional work consists of four special courses, each comprising three hours per week during a half session. The lectures will be employed chiefly in directing the private study of the students. The four special courses offered at present are as follows: I. A course of selected readings extending over the whole field of Greek literature in the order of historical development. This course is intended as a general survey. II. A course in Attic Prose, especially the orators, directed partly to questions of grammar, and partly to the artistic form and style. III. A study of the Attic drama, including the special study in class of the Ådipus Tyrannus of Sophocles and the Frogs of Aristophanes. IV. A study of the Greek poets, with special reference to music, rhythm, meter, and structure. The ancient doctrine of meter and rhythm will be carefully examined, and portions of the Lyric poets, including Pindar, read in class. For all the classes of this School private reading is prescribed, and the examinations will be partly upon this and the work done in class, and partly upon passages selected from the Greek authors at will. Text-Books.âGoodwin's Greek Grammar; Goodwin's Moods and Tenses; Veitch's Verbs; Liddell and Scott's Lexicon (intermediate, and in Course 4C and above, unabridged edition); Morey's History of Greece; Smyth's Greek Literature.

I. English. Course 1B: Course 1A in English Literature prerequisite.âCourse 1B in English is designed to lay a broad foundation for the intelligent study of the language on both the historical (philological) and the literary side. The opportunity is seized from the beginning to interest the student in the history and etymology of current English words and phrases, to point him by a general course of Anglo-Saxon (Old English) and Middle English to the gradual evolution of Modern English as we have it now, and to furnish him with ample material for the prosecution of further study and research. A carefully graded series of texts and text-books will lead the student from the language of Alfred through Chaucer and the Elizabethans to the English of Victoria. Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 12â1, Cabell Hall: Professor Harrison, Adjunct Professor Faulkner. Course 2C: Course 1B prerequisite.âThis course is a more specialized form of Course 1B on the same general lines; a knowledge of Anglo-Saxon is essential to its profitable prosecution. The historical study of the language is pursued in greater detail; the student's attention is concentrated on the history and origins of English; lectures on the Poetry and Life of the Anglo-Saxons are given; Fourteenth Century English receives detailed attention, and selected works of the Elizabethan period will be examined and studied critically. The effort will constantly be made to make these courses in the English Language run parallel on the linguistic side with the courses in English Literature, so that the two may profitably be taken together. Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, 12-1, Cabell Hall: Professor Harrison, Adjunct Professor Faulkner. Course 3D, Course 4D: Course 2C prerequisite.âCourses 3D and 4D are open to students who desire to specialize in the subject of English. and especially to those who select English as their major subject, or as the primary minor subject for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. A general statement only of their character can be given. English Literature of the Old, Middle, and New English periods to the time of Shakespeare will be exhaustively studied; English Philology, the foundations of which will be laid in a thorough knowledge of Gothic, Old and Middle English, Old and Middle High German, and Old French phonology and grammar, will receive thorough treatment; general phonetics will be carefully studied; and the principles of comparative grammar and syntax will be duly explained. The completion of either of these two courses will satisfy the requirements THE ACADEMIC SCHOOLS. for English as the primary minor for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy; the completion of both courses and the preparation of a satisfactory dissertation will fulfill the requirements for English as the major subject for the same degree.

Professor Echols. Professor Page. Dr. Luck. Mr. Michil. Mr. Giv. Mr. Burt. Required for Admission to the Work of the School: Mathematics A, B and C, of the general entrance requirements, p. 77. In this School, as at present organized, there are eight courses. The class in Course 1A meets in three Sections; and that in course 2B in two Sections. Course 1A, Sections I and II: Admission to the School prerequisie.t Each Section meets three times a week, and devotes about three months to each of the three subjectsâGeometry, Trigonometry, and Algebra. In Geometry the work begins with the solution of numerous original exercises in Plane Geometry, and proceeds through Solid Geometry with constant drill in original exercises. In Trigonometry, a complete course in Plane and Spherical Trigonometry is pursued with constant drill in the solution of problems, and exercises in the use of logarithms. In Algebra, the work begins with the Progressions and proceeds with MATHEMATICS. the study of the Binomial Formula, Convergence and Divergence of Series, with special study of the Binomial, Exponential, and Logarithmic Series. The study of Inequalities and Determinants prepares for the Theory of Equations with which the course is closed. Course 1A, Section III: Mathematics A, B, C and D, of the general entrance requirements, prerequisite. This Section meets three times a week, and devotes about three months to each of the three subjects, Trigonometry, Algebra, and elementary Analytical Geometry. The first two terms of the session are devoted to Trigonometry and Algebra, respectively; and the courses covered in these subjects are exactly the same as those described above for Sections I and II of Course 1A. In elementary Analytical Geometry, to which the third term is devoted, the class begins with a study of the Cartesian and polar systems of Coordinates, with numerous exercises in the graphical representation of equations. Especial attention is paid to the straight line and the general equation of the first degree in two variables. The course is intended to prepare for the study of the Analytical Geometry of the Conic Section. In addition to the regular examination held during the session, there will be held a special examination on the work of Course 1A on the first day of each session, to which any student registered in the School of Mathematics will be admitted. To a student successfully passing this examination will be given a certificate of proficiency in the work required in Course 1A. Professor Page. Text-Books.âVenable, Legendre's Geometry, with Exercises; Loney, Trigonometry, Part I; Murray, Spherical Trigonometry; Charles Smith, Treatise on Algebra, Analytical Geometry; text to be announced later. Course 2B: Course 1A prerequisite.âThe work of this course is carried on in two sections, each of which consists of Analytical Geometry, Differential and Integral Calculus. The arrangement of the work in the two sections is slightly different. Section I. Course 1A prerequisite.âThe class devotes three months to Analytical Geometry and six months to the Differential and Integral Calculus. In Analytical Geometry, the Cartesian method of representing a function by points, lines, and surfaces is considered, and a special study of the conic sections is made. In three dimensions, as far as the time permits, the straight line, the plane and the conicoids are introduced and discussed. In the Calculus a careful study of the functions of one variable is made, and is followed by the study of functions of two and three variables as far as the time allows. In this class both the educational and the practical value of the topics THE ACADEMIC SCHOOLS. considered, as well as their importance with regard to all further work in mathematics, are clearly brought to view. Constant drill at the board and frequent examination and repetition of principles are insisted on. Professor Echols. Section II. This course is required of all engineering students, the Course 1A, section III, being prerequisite. All engineering students applying for advanced study in this course must pass a written examination on the topics of the Course 1A. The work of the section begins the analytical geometry of the conic sections with the study of the circle and takes up the Differential Calculus early in November, concluding it in March. The remainder of the session is devoted to the Integral Calculus. In this section less attention is given to the educational and theoretical value of Mathematics and more to the utilitarian aspect. Professor Echols. Text-Books.âCharles Smith, Conic Sections; Notes on Analytical Geometry of Three Dimensions; Echols, Differential and Integral Calculus. Course 3C: Course 2B prerequisite.âThis course begins with the study of Analytical Geometry of Three Dimensions. The Differential and Integral Calculus is taken up, at the point left off in Course 2B, and is systematically studied along broad lines. A course of parallel reading on the History of Mathematics is assigned and an examination held in this subject. The course closes with the study of Ordinary Differential Equations. Professor Echols. Text-Books.âCharles Smith, Solid Geometry; Echols, Differential and Integral Calculus; Williamson, Differential Calculus; Williamson, Integral Calculus; Murray, Differential Equations; Cajori, History of Mathematics.

Professor Echols. Course 5D: A Course in Differential Geometry: Course 3C prerequisite.âIn this the year will be devoted to a course in the applications of the Differential and Integral Calculus to Geometry, with special reference to the theory of the General Space Curve, the Surface, and the Surface Curve. Professor Page. Course 6D: A course in the Theory of Continuous Groups: Course 3C prerequisite.âIn this will be presented an outline of the General Theory of Continuous Groups of point and contact transformations. Numerous applications to Geometry and Differential Equations will be adduced. Professor Page. Course 7D: A Course in Differential Equations: Course 3C prerequisite.âIn this there will be presented a course in Ordinary and Partial APPLIED MATHEMATICS. Differential Equations. In the discussion of the Ordinary Differential Equation particular attention is paid to the theory of integration of such equations as admit of a known Transformation Group, and the classic methods of integration are compared with those which flow from the Theory of Continuous Groups. A similar method is adopted in the study of the Linear Partial Differential Equation of the First Order. As far as the time admits, the theories of integration of the Complete System, as well as those of the General Partial Differential Equation of the First and Second Orders, will be discussed. Professor Page. [Not more than two of the Courses 5D, 6D, 7D, are offered in one session.] Course 8D: A Course in the Theory of Functions: Course 3C prerequisite.âIn this class is offered to advanced students a course in Mathematical Analysis. The treatment of the subject is arranged under three heads, as follows: The design of the numbers of analysis and the laws of the operations to which they are subject are studied after the methods of Dedekind and Tannery, Cantor and Weierstrass, as introductory to the study of functions. The study of the Theory of Functions of a Real Variable, including series, products, and continued fractions. The General Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable is studied after the methods of Cauchy, Riemann, and Weierstrass. A special study is made of the series of Taylor and of Fourier. Professor Echols. The work in Courses 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D and 8D is carried on by means of lectures, notes, and the systematic reading of the standard authors in texts and in journals. SCHOOL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS. Professor Thornton. Required for Admission to the Work of the School: The General entrance examination, plus Mathematics 1A. Course 1B: General Mechanics: This class meets three times a week. The Fall Term is devoted to a preliminary study of General Mechanics, in which the fundamental doctrines of motion, force, and energy are discussed and applied to the simpler problems of the Dynamics of a Particle, the Statics of Particles and Rigid Bodies, and the Dynamics of Revolving and Rolling Solids. In the Winter Term the methods of Graphical Statics are studied and applied to the analysis of the simpler forms of roofs, bridges, beams, THE ACADEMIC SCHOOLS. and masonry structures. The elementary idea of the Strength of Materials are also taught. The Spring Term is given to the study of Hydrostatics, with simple problems on the pressure of water and of air, and their applications in the construction and use of the barometer, the hydrometer, the hydrostatic press, and so on. The elements of Hydraulics are also taught. For the successful pursuit of this course the class in Mathematics 2B must be taken parallel with it, unless the student has already had the equivalent training.

SCHOOL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY. Professor Dunnington. Required for Admission to the Work of the School: The General Entrance Examination. The regular work of this School, constituting a complete course in Practical Chemistry, is divided into two courses, as follows: Course 1B: This course consists of three lessons a week throughout the session, after each of which the students spend three or four hours in practical experiments in the Laboratory. A course in Chemical manipulation, is first given, then Blowpipe Analysis, Fire Assaying of Ores of Lead, Gold, and Silver, and a systematic course in Inorganic Qualitative Analysis, followed by practice in analysis of salts, alloys, and ores, determination of minerals and the examination of potable water, coal, limestone, clay, and so on, together with some simpler quantitative determinations. Weekly written exercises are required. Course 2C: The work of the second course is also given in three lessons a week throughout the session, each being followed by four hours or more of practical laboratory work. This course is primarily one in Quantitative Analysis. After some training in manipulation and gravimetric estimations, the class pursues volumetric estimations and a full course in Quantitative Analysis of minerals, ores, coal, soil, iron and steel, technical products, and so on. Weekly written exercises are required. As the student advances in the course he is encouraged to undertake original research and assist in its prosecution; and in determining his fitness for graduation, work of this kind is considered as having much weight. The Laboratory is open to students six days in the week, during all the working hours of the day. Students may register either for the first course, or for both courses at the same time; candidates for the M. A. elective are required to complete both courses. Those who accomplish this are prepared for work as Analytical Chemists, Assayers, Druggists, or Teachers of Chemistry. Among the works recommended to laboratory students are: Fresenius' Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis, A. I.

D., and also for such students as desire to increase the range of their experience as analysts, and to cultivate their powers of original investigation. It is required for those who enter this course that they shall have previously completed Courses 1B and 2C, in this School, and Courses 1B, 2C, 3C, and 4D in that of General Chemistry, or that they shall have previously made equivalent attainments elsewhere. Laboratory work will be conducted daily, and suggestions and due assistance will be given in its prosecution. While the work is adapted to the special aims or tastes of each student, it will in all cases comprise some practice in the more elaborate processes of analysis, ultimate and proximate organic analysis, some study in analytical methods and some original problems, also the reading and the summarizing of extracts from current journals, and, for all who are seeking the degree of Ph. D., a dissertation embodying the results of some original research. The Chemical Laboratory is a building planned and erected for the purpose. It is warmed throughout by hot water, completely fitted with the most approved appliances, and stocked with apparatus, models, materials, and specimens. The commodious lecture-room, with work and storeroom attached, is provided with every convenience for exhibiting a complete series of experiments illustrating the lectures on General Chemistry. The Analytical Laboratory will accommodate forty working students, and is furnished with work-tables, gas, water, and all proper laboratory fixtures; smaller rooms are devoted to weighing, evaporations, assaying, etc., and all requisite apparatus, chemicals, minerals, materials for analysis, etc., are kept constantly supplied by home purchases and importation. MILLER SCHOOL OF BIOLOGY. Professor Tuttle. Adjunct Professor Kepner. Required for Admission to the Work of the School: The General Entrance Examination. The Biological sciences are here studied chiefly from a morphological rather than from a physiological standpoint. Prominence is given to the histology, and as far as possible to the cytology and to the life-histories (both ontogenetic and phylogenetic) of the organisms studied, especially in the advanced courses in each of the two principal sciences, with a view BIOLOGY. to the elucidation of the great fundamental laws that underlie the phenomena of life. The work of the school is designed to meet the wants of students who desire such knowledge of either Botany or ZoÃ¶logy (or both), and of the methods of biological study, as may properly form a part of a liberal education: or of those who desire such training as will fit them for independent work as students or as teachers in either of these sciences, or for other vocational work therein: and also of those who seek such acquaintance with the facts and the underlying principles of the biological sciences as will prepare them for entrance upon the study of Medicine, or for an intelligent study of the relations of these sciences to the art of Agriculture as set forth in another portion of this catalogue (p. 246). Each student who enters upon the work of either of the courses described below is required to provide himself with a small case of dissecting instruments and a note-book of approved pattern. Other necessary pieces of apparatus will be issued to each student: a deposit with the Bursar of a sum covering the value of articles so issued is required; this will be refunded at the end of the session subject to deduction for loss or damage. There is a laboratory fee for materials consumed in connection with the work of each of the courses. I. Botany. Professor Tuttle. Course 1B: Botany.âIn this course a study is first made of the essential factors of plant structure; this is followed by a brief survey of the vegetable kingdom, beginning with the fission-algae and ending with the seed-plants. As each group is discussed in the lectures, as many representative members as practicable will be studied in the laboratory, including where possible the important phases of the life-history. The principles of classification will be considered and illustrated, and as far as possible applied in connection with the forms studied. Lectures, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 12 to 1 p. m. Laboratory periods, Tuesday Thursday, Saturday, 9 to 11 a. m. The class is limited for the present to thirty members. Three courses are offered in Plant Morphology, one of which will be given each session: each course comprises two lectures and two laboratory periods of three hours each weekly: participation in the weekly biological seminar is also required: the course for the year may, however, be withdrawn if not elected by at least four students.

It includes practice in the more advanced methods of technic, and a critical discussion of the microscope and its intelligent use, as means to the ends in view. It is accompanied by the consideration of the fundamental laws of General Biology as founded upon cytological study. Hours by assignment: the number is not limited. Opportunity will be afforded to individual students for further advanced work chiefly along the lines of this course. A biological seminar will be conducted weekly at an hour that will be assigned at the beginning of the session, participation in which is required of all students in courses above Botany 1B and ZoÃ¶logy 1 B. THE ACADEMIC SCHOOLS. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF NATURAL HISTORY AND GEOLOGY. Professor Fontaine. Required for Admission to the Work of the School: The General Entrance Examination. In this School two subjects are taught, Geology and Descriptive Mineralogy. There are two courses, as follows: Course 1B: Three lectures a week will be given throughout the session. The design of the course is to enable the student to obtain such a knowledge of the science of Geology as should be possessed by a well-educated man. As full an exposition of the fundamental principles will be given as the time will allow. Text-Books.âScott's Introduction to Geology, and Notes of the Professor's lectures. Course 2C: Course 1B prerequisite.âThis course consists of two divisions, one in Mineralogy, the other in Geology. Mineralogy.âThe course in Mineralogy closes in February. Three lectures a week are given in it. In this course attention is paid to crystallography, and especially to the physical properties of minerals. In Descriptive Mineralogy the relations, geological occurrence, and history of the individual species are made prominent. Text-Books.âDana's Manual of Mineralogy and Petrology. The instruction will be in part by lectures. Geology.âThis division of the course begins after the completion of Mineralogy in February. The more general and complicated problems in all the branches of Geology will be dealt with in this course. As thorough a treatment as possible will be given of Stratigraphy, Lithology, and Paleontology. More stress will be laid on the methods of field-work and the application of geological principles. The aim will be to give such a knowledge of the subject as may be useful to the student in breadwinning pursuits, or may serve as a basis for the more specialized course required for the attainment of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Text-Books.âChamberlin and Salisbury's Geology in part. For reference: Geikie's Text-Book of Geology. The instruction will be in part by lectures. The advanced course in this School is intended to give the student as large a stock of useful information as possible, to teach him methods of investigation, and to train him in habits of observation. Original research will be insisted on, and opportunity will be given for the student to concentrate his efforts in some line of special study. NATURAL HISTORY AND GEOLOGY. Topics for study will be taken from both of the subjects taught in this School. The abundant material in the Lewis Brooks Museum, mentioned below, gives unusual facilities for the pursuit of graduate work. Course 3D: Descriptive Mineralogy.âThe course of Mineralogy is so selected as to give the student a good knowledge of as wide a range of the principles as possible, and at the same time to cause him to acquire a practical knowledge of the various mineral species. In the practical study, the more common minerals, and those of more importance from an economic and geologic point of view, will have preference. A practical knowledge of the crystal forms and of the characteristic groupings and massive forms of minerals, will be required. Special attention will be paid to the relations of minerals, their association in nature, and their geological occurrence. The student will be trained to determine minerals, as far as possible, by their obvious characteristics, without the help of tests, and practical examinations will be held, from time to time, to test his skill. One or more these will be required. Dana's Text-Book of Mineralogy, and Weisbach's Mineral Tables will be used; and topics from various authors will be assigned for study in special cases. Course 4D: Geology.âIn Geology the aim will be to fit the student for independent and original research. He will study as thoroughly as possible the broader problems of the science, involving the knowledge of stratigraphical principles. Special attention will be given to imparting a practical knowledge of the various rocks, and of the animal and plant fossils of the different eras, with the view of using them in determining unknown formations. Stress will be laid upon field work, and the methods of determining and describing the geology of new regions. To impart such knowledge, the student will be required to work up some particular region or formation, and report his results. Topics involving a knowledge of the literature and growth of opinion in relation to particular questions may be assigned to form the subject of theses. Camberlin and Salisbury's Geology will be used as a text-book, and selected books of other authors will be used when necessary. The Lewis Brooks Museum contains collections illustrating the main subdivisions of Natural History. Each of the collections is arranged so as to exemplify the principles of the science, and at the same time offers a large variety of subjects for advanced study. In Geology the specimens show all the different kinds of rocks, classified according to mineral character and the formation in which they occur; the collection of fossils, plaster casts, maps, etc., is exceptionally fine, and fully illustrates Historical Geology. In Mineralogy the principles of the science are made plain by well-chosen suits of specimens, models of crystals, etc. The general collection of minerals contains all the important minerals, and THE ACADEMIC SCHOOLS. many of the rarer ones, in good specimens. ZoÃ¶logy is well illustrated by a fine and large collection of mounted skeletons, stuffed animals, dried specimens, plaster casts, etc. In Botany the collections contain charts, papier-machÃ© models of flowers and fruits, sections of wood, etc.: the bulk of the collection is in the form of an herbarium, selected from the most important and interesting botanical regions of the world. In addition to the above, a beginning has been made of a collection to illustrate the geology and mineralogy of the State of Virginia, and this will be increased as rapidly as possible. These large and carefully selected collections of geological and mineralogical objects afford unsurpassed facilities for the full illustration of the principles taught. As free access to these collections is allowed the student, he can find in their study an opportunity, rarely obtained, for gaining a practical acquaintance with natural objects acquired from various parts of the world, and chosen for their typical character. These collections are especially useful to students pursuing advanced work in Geology and Mineralogy. WILLIAM BARTON ROGERS SCHOOL OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGY. Professor Watson. Adjunct Professor Grasty.

Course in Public Speaking. Adjunct Professor Paul. The course in public speaking organizes a new course and modifies an existing course in the School of English Literature, and also trains men from the Literary Societies for several intercollegiate contests. The course deals with the theory and practice of Public Speaking. Its aim is to prepare the student to express his thoughts and feelings clearly and effectively before an audience. No attempt is made to give the more elaborate discipline necessary for the public reader and impersonator. In order that emphasis may fall upon improvement in form, speeches from the great orators are used as material for drill work. At each lesson, every member in the section is called in turn before the class to render his lines and receive suggestions for further progress. The theory is not set forth by lectures, but by comments upon the efforts of the individual student and upon the end sought by the author of the oration under interpretation. The regular English course in Argumentation, if time permits, will PHILOSOPHY. be supplemented by practical experience in debating before the class and will deal not only with logical structure and effective tactics but also with manner of delivery. From the Literary Societies, by the sifting process of preliminary trials, candidates for three oratorical and three debating contests are chosen. The successful men will then be eligible to individual instruction in daily rehearsals until the final competition takes place. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF PHILOSOPHY. Professor Lefevre. Professor Payne.

L., LL. D., President. RICHARD HEATH DABNEY, M. A., Ph. D., Dean. Required for Entrance upon the Work of the Department.âThe possession of a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank: or, in the case of a graduate of an institution of such rank that does not confer a baccalaureate degree, presentation of a certificate of graduation in a course of study accepted by the Academic Faculty as fully equivalent to that ordinarily required for the degree in question. A candidate entering the University under these conditions will be registered as a Graduate Student if he is pursuing one or more graduate courses: he may, however, be permitted, or, if he is a candidate for a degree who enters from another college, be required to take in addition such strictly undergraduate courses as may be desirable or necessary for his purpose. Graduate in a School. Any student who successfully completes all the courses offered in any Academic School is entitled to a diploma of graduation in that School: but a student thus pursuing graduate studies will not be registered as a member of this Department unless he has satisfied the conditions above stated. Master of Arts. The degree of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia will be conferred upon a Bachelor of Arts of this University who has completed the work in four fully organized graduate courses chosen by himself and approved by the Academic Faculty; each of which courses must be one in which the professor regularly meets the class not less than three hours a week. The four courses must be chosen from at least three distinct subjects distributed among three different Academic Schools, except by special order of the Academic Faculty; and three of the courses must be cognate. Students who take such graduate courses in some subjects before receiving the B. A. degree will not be granted the M. A. degree unless they take at least two of their graduate courses in the academic year when the latter degree is conferred. A brief summary of the C courses open to candidates for the Master's DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. degree is given upon a following page, together with a schedule of the hours of lectures and examinations: a description of each is given in its proper connection in that portion of the catalogue which treats of the work of the independent Academic Schools. The courses indicated are also, in many cases, included among the advanced courses that may be offered as electives at large for the degree of Bachelor of Arts: credit can be obtained for any such course in but one of these capacities by the same candidate; work done for the lower degree being in no case counted again as part of the work required for the attainment of the higher degree. Students holding baccalaureate degrees from other chartered institutions of learning and desiring admission to candidacy for the degree of Master of Arts should write immediately to the Registrar of the University and ask for a blank form of application, to be filled out (partly by the applicant, and partly by the President of the institution from which the applicant has received a degree) and promptly returned to the Registrar. When the Committee on Academic Degrees has duly considered the application and reported to the Academic Faculty, the latter will decide whether the application will be accepted; and, if so, the applicant will then be informed what work he will have to do in order to obtain the M. A. degree. In general, the Faculty will require that, unless the baccalaureate degree of the candidate conforms with reasonable closeness to the B. A. degree of the University in the character of its requirements, the candidate must take such undergraduate courses here as will supplement his deficiencies. In particular, the Faculty will require the candidate to take not only the four graduate courses mentioned above, but also the undergraduate courses in the same subjects, unless convinced by the report of the Committee on Academic Degrees that the candidate's work done elsewhere in one or more of these subjects has been fully equal in quality and quantity to the undergraduate work required in such subject or subjects at the University of Virginia. Nor can the candidate be excused from doing the undergraduate work in any one of these four subjects without the consent of the professor of that subject. Master of Science. The degree of Master of Science of the University of Virginia will be conferred upon a holder of the cultural degree (p. 154) of Bachelor of Science, under regulations exactly similar to those under which the degree of Master of Arts is conferred upon a Bachelor of Arts. Candidates for the degree of Master of Science need, therefore,âin order to see in detail what will be required of them,âmerely substitute the DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. letters "B. S." for "B. A.", and the letters "M. S." for "M. A.", wherever "B. A." and "M. A." respectively occur in the statement (pp. 165-166) of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts. Doctor of Philosophy. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy of the University of Virginia will be conferred upon the holder of a cultural baccalaureate degree of this University, or (under the regulations mentioned below) upon the holder of a similar degree from some other chartered institution of learning who possesses a reading knowledge of French and German, and who completes the prescribed graduate work in three cognate subjects, chosen by himself from at least two Academic Schools, and approved by the Academic Faculty; this graduate work to be pursued for at least three years in the major subject, for at least two years in the primary minor, and for at least one year in the secondary minor subject. It is also provided that any student taking the second or third year of graduate work in a subject may be required by the professor, with the approval of the Academic Faculty, to attend such lectures or courses in any of the Academic Schools as the professor may deem necessary. The "reading knowledge" of French and German mentioned above is intended to enable the candidate to pursue his chosen subjects through the medium of books and periodicals in the French and German languages. His ability to do this must be tested at the beginning of the first year of his candidacy by examinations on these languages in the presence of a committee consisting of the professor of the candidate's major subject and the professors of French and German. In case of failure on either or both of the examinations, he will be required to enter the appropriate class or classes in one or both of the languages, and will not be regarded as a regular candidate for the doctorate until he has fulfilled the requirements in French and German. It is provided, however, that any student who has already passed on the B course in either or both of the languages at this University shall be considered as having the requisite knowledge of either or both of them, as the case may be. Graduate work done in other universities may be accepted in lieu of resident work done here, provided sufficient evidence is furnished by examination, written or oral, or both, that such work has been of a grade similar to that required here, and has been satisfactorily performed, and provided also that, while it shall be possible for a candidate to get credit in this way for the whole of his secondary minor subject, every candidate must take here at least one advanced course in his primary minor, and at least one year's work in his major subject. It is also provided that a candidate who is a professor, in charge of the subject selected by him as major, in a chartered college or university, DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. may be allowed by the Academic Faculty to spend only two years in resident work at this University. The graduate work of the last year of candidacy shall in all cases be done at this University, unless the Academic Faculty shall for special reasons direct otherwise. Upon the completion of the approved courses, the candidate shall submit to the Academic Faculty a Dissertation exhibiting independent research in some branch of his major subject. The Dissertation must be submitted not later than April 15 of the year in which the candidate applies for the degree. Moreover, the copy presented for the Faculty's approval shall be written (type-written, if feasible) on paper of prescribed quality and size; shall be bound; and shall have certain prescribed phrases on the cover and title page. If accepted as satisfactory by the Faculty, this copy shall immediately become the property of the University. If approved, the Dissertation must be printed at the candidate's expense before the degree is conferred, and one hundred copies deposited in the Library of the University; or, if this be impracticable on account of lack of time, the candidate must deposit with the Bursar a sum of money sufficient to have a hundred copies of the Dissertation printed. The instruction open to candidates for the Doctor's degree in each of the Academic Schools is described in a preceding portion of the catalogue. No graduate course can be counted for the Doctor's degree unless the professor regularly meets the class not less than three hours a week. The conditions on which students holding baccalaureate degrees from other chartered institutions of learning are admitted to candidacy for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy are as follows. Each applicant should write to the Registrar of the University and ask for a blank form of application to be filled out (partly by the applicant, and partly by the President of the institution from which the applicant has received a degree) and promptly returned to the Registrar When the application has been duly considered by the Committee on Academic Degrees and by the Academic Faculty, the applicant will be informed as to the work which he, if accepted as a candidate, will have to do in order to secure the Doctor's degree. The general rule will be that unless his baccalaureate degree conforms with reasonable closeness to one of the cultural baccalaureate degrees of this University in the nature of its requirements, he must take such undergraduate courses here as will supplement his deficiencies. In particular, he will be required to take not only the graduate work in his three chosen subjects, but the undergraduate courses as well, unless the Faculty is convinced that his work done elsewhere in one or more of these subjects has been fully equal in DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. quality and quantity to the undergraduate work required in such subject or subjects at this University. Moreover, the individual professor of any of these three subjects may require the candidate to take his undergraduate course, should he regard him as insufficiently grounded in the fundamental facts or principles of the subject. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses at the University for a Virginia student in the Department of Graduate Studies may be estimated at from $160 a year upward, according to the mode of living; for students from other States this minimum should be increased by a sum ranging from $90 to $130 for tuition fees. A fuller statement of expenses, including the conditions under which Virginia or other students are entitled to free tuition, will be found on pp. 92-98. Applicants for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy who are granted the privilege of non-residence during a portion of their candidacy, under conditions above stated, are required to matriculate and to pay the annual University fee of $40 if not Virginians, and $10 if Virginians, during such period of non-residence. COURSES IN THE ACADEMIC SCHOOLS WHICH ARE OPEN TO GRADUATE STUDENTS. A brief summary is here presented of the courses open to election by candidates for the Master's and Doctor's degrees. Where an undergraduate course is stated to be prerequisite to a graduate course, the latter may be taken parallel with the former if, in the judgment of the professor concerned, the circumstances justify such a privilege.

For information as to lodgings, board, expenses, etc., and for catalogues, and other printed literature, address the Registrar. For other information address the Dean of the Law School.] Among the original schools contemplated in Mr. Jefferson's plan for the organization of the University of Virginia was "Law: Municipal and Foreign; Embracing the General Principles, Theory, and Practice of Jurisprudence, together with the Theory and Principles of Constitutional Government." Accordingly the School of Law was established in 1826, and has been in continuous operation since, even during the four years of the civil war. From its inception until 1894, the course comprised the work of a single year. Beginning with the session of 1894-95, a two years' course was inaugurated, which has continued up to the present time. As indicated below, commencing with the session of 1909-10, the course will be extended to three years. The aim of the Department of Law has always been to maintain a high standard as a requirement for graduationâthe degree being conferred only upon such students as are thorough masters of the prescribed DEPARTMENT OF LAW. course of study. This policy has been rigorously enforced, and its wisdom has been vindicated by the high position to which the graduates of the law school are accustomed to attain at the bar or in public life. The course of instruction has been extended from time to time to conform to changing conditions and to meet the increasing needs of the profession. It is confidently believed that the enlarged course now offered will enable those who complete it more surely to maintain that rank at the bar which the University has always expected of her sons. Formerly it was possible for the law student to begin and complete his professional studies in the office of some friendly member of the barâ Blackstone's Commentaries and the Code of his State forming the main portion of his curriculum. Then the authorities were few, the leading principles alone were settled, and their application was comparatively simple. In more recent times, so widened is the scope of the law, so complex its principles, so nice and yet so important its distinctions, so numerous and conflicting the authorities, that it is scarcely practicable for even the most diligent student to master the subject, in its multiform phases, without the systematic instruction of skilled teachers. Furthermore, the increased and increasing scope and rigor of the examinations for admission to the bar in the several States call for a more extensive course of study than was afforded in former days by the law school, and a wider and more intimate knowledge of legal principles than can generally be acquired by private study. It is a maxim sanctioned by long and wide experience that "he who is not a good lawyer when he comes to the bar, will seldom be a good one afterwards." In order to acquire such thorough knowledge of the elements of the law, thought as well as reading is requisite; and, for the purpose of thought, there must be time to digest as well as industry to acquire. One cannot gorge himself with legal principles and digest them afterwards; the process of assimilation, if it is to proceed healthfully and beneficially, must accompany the reception of knowledge. These considerations have led to a general conviction among the leaders of professional thought throughout the country that no student should essay the practice of the law who has not spent at least three years in close and attentive study in a law school. Three Year Course.âIn view of the foregoing considerations, instead of the two years' course heretofore offered, a more extended course of three years will be inaugurated, after the session of 1908-1909. An outline of the new course appears below. Suggestions as to Preliminary Education.âStudents, and their parents or guardians, are warned that the Law is peculiarly an intellectual profession, and demands for its successful prosecution, whether at the Law School or in the broader fields of professional life, a well-trained DEPARTMENT OF LAW. mind. If it be true that untrained intellects, in rare instances, under diligent and persistent effort, develop after entrance upon practice, such exceptional cases but serve to illustrate the rule, that out of a given number of young men entering upon the study of the Law, those with sound preliminary training will have incomparably the advantage, while those without it will be seriously handicapped, and are likely never to rise above mediocrity in their profession. The experience of the Law Facultyânay, of all law teachersâis, that the standing and progress of law students are, in large measure, in the ratio of their academic preparation. Young gentlemen are therefore advised not to begin their legal studies until they have completed an academic course approximating that ordinarily required for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. So high a standard, however, is not exacted as a condition of entrance into the Law School. These conditions are shown in the following section, and its references. Required for Entrance upon the Work of the Department.âThe General Entrance Examination, or admission to the University by certificate or diploma, as stated in a preceding portion of this catalogue, pp. 69-82. For exemption from this rule in the case of Special Students not candidates for the degree, see the section following. Candidates for the degree must have attained the age of eighteen before entering the Law School. Special Students.âApplicants for registration who are twenty years old, and desire to enter for the pursuit of special elective courses, must present adequate proofs of good character and of the needful maturity and training. Such applicants may then be registered as Special Students, and will be admitted without formal examination to the privileges of the Law School, but not as candidates for the degree. With the admonition that over-zealousness, whereby an ambitious student is beguiled into the assumption of more work than he can thoroughly master in a given time, leads to cramming and inaccuracy, and often to complete failure, the special student is free to select his own work. Admission to Advanced Standing.-No credit is given for attendance at another law school, nor for time spent in private reading. The candidate for graduation must spend all three years in residence. Late Entrance.âRegistration commences Thursday, September 16, and the work of the Law School begins promptly the Monday following. Students are advised that late entrance is a serious hindrance to progress. The student who enters late must begin his work at the point to which the work has advanced at the time of his entrance; and credit for three years' attendance cannot be given unless the student's DEPARTMENT OF LAW. actual residence averages at least thirty weeks per session. No registration in absentia is permissible. As regards conditions of admission in case of late entrance, reference is made to the Regulations concerning Registration, as stated ante p. 87. Expenses.âA detailed estimate of the necessary expenses of a student in the Department of Law will be found in an earlier part of this catalogue, under the general head of "Expenses." The University fee applicable to all law students, (including those from Virginia) is $40; and the tuition fee is $100 for the regular work of each session. For Special Students who desire to take selected courses, the tuition fee is estimated according to the proportion which the work chosen bears to the whole. Plan of Instruction.âThe course is planned with a view to acquaint the student familiarly and practically with the principles of his profession. Care is taken to teach him to think for himself, and to rely upon reason and principle, rather than upon memory; it being considered better that the student follow principle to its legitimate conclusion, though this be at variance with the decisions of the courts, than that he should arrive at a faultless result by the exercise of memory or by accident. The instruction is as thorough as possible, and is given partly through text-books and lectures, and partly through the study of cases. While convinced of the value of the combined text-book and lecture system, which has prevailed for more than half a century in the Law School, and from which, in the inauguration of the more extended course, it is not meant in any wise to depart, the Law Faculty have long appreciated the value which the study of cases possesses, in illustrating the practical application of legal principles, and in forcing the student to extract for himself the doctrine which the cases establish. The enlargement of the course gives opportunity for more emphasis upon this form of instruction, and the case-book will, therefore, be used more extensively than hereto-foreânot as supplanting, but as supplementing, the text-book and lecture. The daily quiz has long been a marked and, as experience has proved, a most valuable feature of the system of instruction. As cross-examination exposes error and develops truth, so the daily quiz enables the instructor to discover and rectify misconceptions of legal principles on the part of the student. REQUIRED FOR GRADUATION. The degree of Bachelor of Laws (LL. B.) is conferred upon such students as have attained the age of twenty-one years; have satisfied the DEPARTMENT OF LAW. entrance requirements; have attended three full sessions of the Law School; and have successfully passed the required examinations, with satisfactory performance of the work of the Moot and Practice Courts, and of the assigned work. More specifically, the candidate for graduation must have completed all of the obligatory courses (see Outline of Courses, below), the credit value of which is six hundred (600) units, and elective courses of at least the credit value of two hundred and fifty (250) unitsâor a total of eight hundred and fifty (850) units. Candidates for the degree, who in any session have less than one full year's course to complete, may be required to take such additional work, and to stand such additional examinations as shall be prescribed. OUTLINE OF COURSES. The entire course of three years embraces 1000 lecture periods (or units) of one and a half hours each, and to each subject satisfactorily completed is attached a credit value of one unit for each lecture period comprised therein. Of the total units, 600 are classed as obligatory and the remaining 400 as elective. Graduation requires the completion of all the obligatory courses (credit value 600), plus elective courses having a credit value of at least 250 unitsâor a minimum required total of 850 units. This contemplates an average of nine lecture periods (or 13Â½ hours) per week during the first and second years, and eight periods (or 12 hours), the third year. The credit value of course number 4 (see table below) is 16 units. Each session is divided into three terms,âSept 15 to Dec. 23âJan. 3 to March 21âand March 22 to June 6. Written examinations are held during the final week of each term, on the subjects completed during the term. The following tabular outline indicates the scope of the courses offered.

Alteration of Courses and Schedules.âThe right is reserved to make such alterations in the nature or number of courses offered, or in the schedules of lectures and examinations, as may be deemed necessary or expedient. MOOT COURT. A Moot Court is organized by the students in the First Year's course for the discussion of legal questions. Its meetings begin at the opening and continue to the end of the session, with such interruptions only as are incident to the proximity of the examinations. Attendance is voluntary, as presence during the debates is intended to be a privilege and not a burden. But every candidate for the degree is required to argue at least one case in the Moot Court, and to hand in a carefully prepared brief of his argument, with a digest of the authorities relied on. The questions are chosen by the Law Faculty, one of whom presides over the discussions. Interest and life are added to the proceedings by the open debate held after the argument, the presiding judge acting as interlocutor, and leading into the debate those whom diffidence prompts to silence. PRACTICE COURT. The object of the Practice Court is to afford to the student practical facility in the procedure which he will be called on to apply at the bar, and to familiarize him with the whole proceedings in actions at law, and suits in equity. The Practice Court is presided over by members of the Law Faculty, and is organized shortly after the beginning of the session. Its terms are held weekly. Attendance, with punctual performance of all assigned work is an essential part of the courses in Virginia Pleading and Practice, and Equity Procedure. PRIZE. Edward Thompson Company Prize.âThe prize for the best thesis on a subject assigned by the Law Faculty is awarded annually in a competition open to members of the third year class, who are candidates for graduation. It is donated by the Edward Thompson Company of Northport, N. Y., and consists of a set of the second edition of the American and English Encyclopedia of Law (32 volumes), of the estimated value of $240. The Edward Thompson Company Prize for the session of 1907-'08 was awarded to William Kenneth Jackson, B. A., of Jacksonville, Fla. The subject for the thesis was: "Scope and Effect of the Sunday Laws in Virginia." DEPARTMENT OF LAW. LIBRARY. The Law Library is accommodated by its own library rooms, separate from the general University library. The rooms are heated by steam and lighted by electricity, and are located with special reference to the convenience of the law students. A librarian is in attendance during working hours. The library contains practically a complete set of the English Reports to date; the reports of nearly all the States; the United States Supreme Court Reports; the National Reporter System Complete; modern annotated reports, such as the American Decisions, American Reports, American State Reports, Law Reports Annotated, English Ruling Cases, etc.; and all the modern search-books, in the form of general digests (including the Century) and Encyclopedias, besides a large collection of textbooks. Law students have all the privileges of the general University Library, containing more than 60,000 volumes, without extra charge. NEW LAW BUILDING. By the liberality of the Virginia Legislature, a sufficient appropriation is immediately available for the erection of a handsome building for the Law Schoolâplans for which are now being drawn. It is hoped that by the beginning of the session of 1909-10, or shortly thereafter, the building will be ready for occupancy.

ANNOUNCEMENTS Requirements for Admission to the Department of Medicine.â Applicants for admission to the work of the first year of the Course in Medicine are required to present the diploma of a recognized institution of collegiate rank; or a certificate of good standing in such an institution; or the diploma of a recognized public or private high school having at least a three years' course; or acceptable certificates which represent work equivalent in amount and character to such a high school course; and, in addition, to present satisfactory evidence of the completion of college courses in physics, chemistry, and biology equivalent to but not necessarily identical with those at this institution. A student may be conditioned on physics or biology (but not on both), this condition to be removed before entering on the work of the second year. The requirement in biology may be waived in the case of graduates of approved colleges and universities. Further information concerning the character of these requirements and forms for certificates may be obtained by addressing the Dean of the University, or Mr. Howard Winston, Registrar, at the University. Announcement of Change in Entrance Requirements beginning with 1910.âFrom and after June 1, 1910, the minimum amount of preparation necessary for admission to the Medical Department will be the completion of a four-year high school course or its equivalent, and, in addition, the completion of college courses in Inorganic Chemistry, Physics, Biology, and one foreign language, preferably German. Facilities for and Methods of Instruction.âIn recent years many additions have been made to the laboratory facilities of the Department, so that there are now well-equipped laboratories for the study of Organic Chemistry, Gross Anatomy, Histology and Embryology, Bacteriology and Pathology, Physiological Chemistry, Physiology, Pharmacology, and Materia Medica. These laboratories are all presided over by trained teachers, to whom teaching and investigation are primary considerations. The number of hours assigned to the laboratory subjects is quite large and affords ample time for thorough study by the best methods. The student is brought into close contact with teachers who are both willing and able to guide him; he gains a very large part of his knowledge at first hand and by his own exertions, and thus acquires the habit of working out things for himself; he becomes self-reliant, a quality essential to the practice of his difficult profession. Trained in this manner he not only acquires an understanding of the medical sciences but, more important than this, the ability to apply the facts of these sciences to the subsequent study of disease. For these reasons the great fundamental sciences receive DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. the utmost consideration, constituting the entire work of the first two years. The methods of clinical instruction are based upon the belief that no clinical teaching is efficient which is not governed by essentially the same principles as those which govern the best laboratory teaching. This instruction is accordingly designed to enforce a careful, thorough, face-to-face study of disease and its management by the individual student. The facilities afforded by the University Hospital and Dispensary are described on a subsequent page. In the third year, after two sessions devoted to laboratory training, the student is introduced to the study of disease in living persons. In the dispensary and, to a less extent, in the hospital, he learns the methods of examining patients, of diagnosing their diseases, and of instituting rational treatment; and he learns these things in much the same way as he studied in the laboratory, that is to say, by doing them himself under the direction and criticism of the instructors. The material for this purpose is ampleâall that can be employed thoroughly. With this preparation the student is ready to enter upon the hospital work in his fourth year. Here he has advantages for clinical training similar to those enjoyed by internes. Each clinical patient on admission to the hospital is assigned to a student, and that patient is regarded as his "case." The student conducts a complete examination, records his observations in a scientific manner, makes a diagnosis, states his views as to the treatment indicated, and keeps a complete record of the case, all under the advice and criticism of the physician or surgeon in charge. He is expected to keep himself informed of the progress of the case throughout its course; if it is one requiring surgical treatment, he assists at the operation, and thus is able to follow all the procedures of the operator at close range. In addition students make frequent visits to the wards with the attending physicians and surgeons, during which visits the nature, treatment, and progress of various cases are gone over in detail. To carry out this method of clinical instruction the Hospital had last year 850 cases. When it is added that this number will be largely exceeded this year, and that the classes of students are quite small, it is clear that the Department offers capable young men clinical advantages which are distinctly exceptional. Opportunities are offered in the fourth year for more extended training in certain subjects with a view toward possible specialization after graduation. See especially the description of courses in physiology, pharmacology, and pathology. A Medical and Biological Journal Club is maintained by members of the faculty, at which reviews of important articles or original research are presented by the instructors and by invited guests. Its sessions are open to the more advanced students. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Regulations.âThe records given after the regular examination on a course, with their explanations, are as follows: PASSED indicates the satisfactory completion of the course and admits to all dependent subjects. CONDITIONED means that to obtain a clear record on the course the student must pass the next special examination. Failure to take or to pass this examination is equivalent to a record of "failed." DEFICIENT indicates that part of the work of the course has not been completed. Upon the satisfactory completion of this work within the time and in the manner prescribed by the professor in charge the student receives the record "passed"; otherwise the record is "failed" on the entire course. FAILED indicates that the course must be repeated; except that when the laboratory or other practical work has been satisfactorily performed, the professor in charge may, at his discretion, excuse the student from repeating the same; and, by special vote of the faculty, the student may be granted optional attendance upon the course, in whole or in part. In general a student who is repeating a course will be required to attend all the exercises of the course, and will not be excused from any exercise thereof because of schedule conflicts with more advanced work. Absence from a regular examination, when excused because of illness or other equivalent cause, gives a record of conditioned; if not excused, a record of failed. To pass a regular or a special examination a grade of eighty per cent. is required. If the grade is less than eighty per cent. but not less than seventy per cent., the student is entitled to the record conditioned. No student will be admitted to any subject of the second or the third year if more than one third of the work of the preceding year remains unfinished. If at the beginning of the year his deficiencies have not been made up by the satisfactory completion of courses at some school approved by the instructors in charge at this University, he may continue as a student in the Department of Medicine only by repeating the courses in which he has failed. In the interpretation of this rule the values of the subjects of the first and second years are estimated in points as follows: Anatomy 1, 16 points; Anatomy 2, 5 points; Organic Chemistry 15 points; Histology, 14 points; Embryology, 6 points; Physiological Chemistry, 8 Points. Anatomy 3, 16 points; Physiology 2, 20 points; Bacteriology, 8 points; Pathology, 20 points; Pharmacology, 8 points. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Students will not be allowed to undertake the work of the third or fourth year until they have completed that of the first year, save by special consent of the Medical Faculty. A student may not take any course, either in whole or in part (as explained under the above definition of "failed"), more than two times. A second record of "failed" on the same course involves withdrawal from the Department of Medicine. Advanced Standing.âStudents are admitted to advanced standing in the second and third years under the following conditions: 1. Satisfaction of the requirements for entrance into this Department. 2. The presentation of a certificate from an accredited school of medicine showing that the applicant has completed work equivalent to that maintained by this Department with a grade of at least eighty per cent. in each subject for which credit is sought. Applicants complying with these conditions will be admitted to advanced standing without examination. Applicants who have not completed all of the work of the year or years preceding that to which they seek admission are admitted to the Fall Examinations under the conditions stated in the subsequent paragraph on Examinations. The right is reserved in every case to obtain satisfactory evidence of the genuineness of a certificate by correspondence with the proper authority of the school from which the applicant comes. No credit can be allowed for time not spent in a regular school of medicine; except that applicants holding the degree of A. B. or B. S. from a reputable college or university will be admitted to the second year, provided their academic course has included the equivalent of the first-year medical course. A student who is already a graduate of a reputable school of medicine may be received as a student in this Department for the fourth year. Certificates of Attendance.âStudents who attend the whole regular course of one or more of the fourth years are entitled to certificates of attendance. Requirements for Graduation.âThe degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred by the University of Virginia upon candidates who have complied with the entrance requirements of this Department; attended a regular medical course of four years of at least eight months each, the last two of which must have been at this institution; and have satisfactorily completed all of the subjects included in the medical course. Examinations.âThese are in writing, accompanied in most subjects by individual practical examinations. The regular examinations DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. are held at stated periods during the session. In addition, examinations are held each year during the week immediately preceding the beginning of lectures. To the latter are admitted: 1. Students of the previous session, who from illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty, were unable to present themselves for examination in any particular subject at the regular time. 2. Students who at the regular examination of the preceding year have attained a grade less than eighty per cent. but as much as seventy per cent. on one or more subjects, as explained in a preceding paragraph; or any student who has received the record of "conditioned" on a course taken in this University. 3. Certain applicants for advanced standing, who satisfy the requirements stated under "Advanced Standing," and meet the above conditions of this section. The Fall Examinations for 1909-1910 begin September thirteenth, and close September eighteenth. Application for admission to them should be made in writing to Dr. R. H. Whitehead, Dean of the Department of Medicine, not later than September first. Expenses.âThe tuition fees are $110 for the first year, $100 for the second year, $80 for the third year, and $60 for the fourth year. The annual expenses exclusive of tuition are $40 for the University fee (which entitles the student to the use of the library, the gymnasium, to medical attention, etc.), an average of about $200 for living expenses, and $20 for books. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. The work of each of the four years of the course in Medicine continues through the nine months of the University session. Studies included are arranged as follows: During the first session: Organic Chemistry, Anatomy and Anatomy of the Nervous System; Normal Histology, and Embryology; Physiological Chemistry. During the second session: Anatomy; Physiology; Bacteriology and Pathology; Pharmacology; Physical Diagnosis. During the third session; Materia Medica, Pharmacy, and Toxicology; Clinical Diagnosis; Theory and Practice of Medicine; Surgery and Gynecology; Clinics. During the fourth session: Surgery and Gynecology; Neurology, Pediatrics, Dermatology, and Therapeutics; Hygiene; Diseases of the Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat; Forensic Medicine; Clinics. In the following description of courses, the number of hours represents the amount of time each student devotes to the course. In the clinical work, where the class is divided into sections, it is often possible to give only approximately the number of hours spent by each student on each subject. ANATOMY. Professor Whitehead. Adjunct Professor Byrnes. Adjunct Professor Jordan. Mr. Smart. The work in this subject extends through the entire first year and the first six months of the second year. It is divided, for the sake of convenience, as follows: Anatomy 1.âSix hours weekly until November 1st; twelve hours weekly from November 1st to the end of the winter term of the first year. This course begins with a systematic study of the bones, on the completion of which a part (either the head and neck with the upper extremity and thorax, or the lower extremity and abdomen) is assigned to each student for dissection and study. For this purpose each cadaver is considered as composed of four parts; on the completion of this course and Anatomy 3 each student has dissected a lateral half of the body. Emphasis is placed upon the benefit to be derived by the student who obtains his knowledge at first hand and by his own personal efforts. While practical dissection and the consideration of topographical relations make up the essential features of the course, there are occasional lectures and frequent recitations, followed by a final written examination in March. ANATOMY, HISTOLOGY, AND EMBRYOLOGY. The satisfactory performance of the laboratory work is essential to a passing grade. Dr. Whitehead. Anatomy 2.âSix hours weekly during the spring term of the first year. In this course, the central nervous system is studied in some detail. The study begins with the spinal cord, its membranes, circulation, and gross anatomy. One complete spinal cord is given to each two students. This is followed by the microscopic study of sections from the more important spinal segments. The brain is then studied in a similar manner. In the gross study one entire brain is furnished to each two students, supplemented by transverse and sagittal sections. The microscopic sections consist of a transverse series extending from the pyramidal decussation to the head of the caudate nucelus, so arranged that each student will have at least twenty-five sections in series, thus affording sufficient continuity of structure. Great emphasis is attached to laboratory work, and the actual knowledge of the specimens studied. This is supplemented by recitations, and occasional lectures. Dr. Byrnes. Anatomy 3.âTen hours weekly from October 1st through the fall term and fourteen hours weekly during the winter term of the second year. This course is the continuation of Anatomy 1, and consists of the systematic dissection and study, by essentially the same methods, of the parts not studied during the first year. Dr. Byrnes. Histology.âThree lectures or recitations and nine hours of laboratory work weekly during the fall and winter terms of the first year. The student's record in the course will depend upon his recitations, laboratory drawing books, and final examination, both written and practical. The course aims to acquaint the student primarily with the microscopic structure of cells, tissues, and organs. Cytogenesis and histogenesis are briefly considered in the case of many tissues studied; and the relation of the whole subject of histology to pathology is never lost sight of. The student is also given opportunity to acquaint himself with the principles and practice of histological technique. The laboratory is excellently equipped with microscopes, paraffin baths, microtomes, and various accessories essential to the most favorable presentation of this course. A record of seventy per cent. in this course is required for admission to Physiology 2, and of eighty per cent. for admission to Pathology. Dr. Jordan and Mr. Smart. Embryology.âNine hours weekly during the spring term of the first year. The laboratory work (six hours weekly) is accompanied by lectures, recitations, and the study of models and text-books. The course aims to DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. give the student a knowledge of developmental processes, in the light of which he may the better understand the more abstruse normal conditions of adult anatomy, as well as many anomalies and variations, neoplasms and malformations. The close correlation of obstetrics is recognized. and a correct knowledge of the fetus and its membranes is taught from the embryological approach. The course is made as practical as possible for the student and practitioner of medicine. It begins with a consideration of maturation phenomena, fertilization, segmentation, and the development of the germ-layers. This study is made chiefly upon the ova and early stages of an invertebrate, followed by a comparison in an amphibian. The chick is used for the primary relations of the systems to one another; and this is followed by the study of pig embryos, where each system is taken up separately and the organology and histogenesis of its parts are studied. Finally, the fetal membranes and their relations to the fetus and uterus are studied in their variations among the amniota. Dr. Jordan and Mr. Smart. CHEMISTRY. Professor Bird. Adjunct Professor Bedford. Organic Chemistry.âThree hours of lectures and six hours of laboratory work during the fall and winter terms of the first year. In this course a very intense and systematic study is made of the principles of organic chemistry, with special reference, at appropriate places, to compounds of medical importance. Such constant reference is made to the analogous phenomena of inorganic chemistry as will coordinate the work as far as possible with the student's previous study of general chemistry. The object is to lay a good foundation for the courses that follow in physiological chemistry, pharmacology, etc.; and also to instruct the student carefully in the methods of investigation of chemical problems. The student prepares in sufficient quantity one or more compounds that illustrate the essential characteristics of each of the more important classes of organic compounds, a compound of medical interest being selected wherever advisable. Great stress is laid on the proper experimental method of studying chemistry, and numerous questions are attached to the directions for each experiment in order to force the student to adopt a comparative method of studying at the time the type compound is being prepared and its reactions illustrated. Brief instruction is given in the methods of quantitative analysis of organic compounds, both ultimate and proximate. A record of seventy per cent. on this course is required for admission to Physiology 1 (Physiological Chemistry.) PHYSIOLOGY. PHYSIOLOGY. Professor Hough. Mr. Purdum. Mr. Setzler. Mr. Vaiden. The required course of study in this subject begins with the spring term of the first year and continues throughout the second year. It is divided into two courses, as follows: Physiology 1: Physiological Chemistry.âThree lectures, three recitations, and nine hours of laboratory work weekly during the spring term of the first year. The fundamentals of physiological chemistry, especially the chemical structure, properties, and reactions of the more important compounds with which the student must deal in his subsequent studies of physiology. The laboratory work, for which ample facilities are provided, consists of the thorough study of the properties of the carbohydrates, fats, soaps, fatty acids, and proteins and of the more important members of each of these groups; the composition of blood, milk, muscle, pancreas, and other organs; the action of the more important digestive enzymes and of the bile; and the chemistry of the urine. Accurate quantitative determinations are required of urea (Folin), total nitrogen (Kjeldahl), uric acid (Hopkins-Folin), ammonia (Folin), sugar (Fehling and Benedict), and kreatinin (Folin). Other processes of quantitative analysis, such as the Soxhlet method of fat determination and the silver nitrate method of determining the total purins, are either demonstrated or their essential manipulations carried out by the student himself. The exceptional preparation of students not only in general but also in organic chemistry makes it possible to acquire in this course not only a clear understanding of the problems of physiological chemistry but also skill in the use of the fundamental qualitative and quantitative methods. A grade of 70 per cent. on this course is required for admission to Physiology 2. Open only to students who have attained a grade of 70 per cent. in Organic Chemistry. Physiology 2.âThe Physiology of Function.â Four hours weekly of lectures, recitations, and demonstrations throughout the second year; six hours weekly of laboratory work in the fall term and three hours weekly in the winter term. The physiology of muscle and nerve; blood and lymph; the circulation; respiration; secretion; digestion and nutrition; excretion; the sense organs; and the central nervous system. The laboratory is equipped with kymographs, induction coils, signals, muscle and heart levers, tambours, manometers, etc. for thirty men working at one time in pairs. The work of the laboratory closely follows the lectures and is an integral part of the study of each subject. The student becomes practically acquainted with the methods of modern physiological DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. investigation and is required to hand in tracings or other records together with full descriptions of his experiments. The satisfactory completion of the laboratory work is as necessary to a clear record on the course as is the passing of the final examinations. Open only to students who have obtained a grade of seventy per cent. in Histology and in Physiological Chemistry. The satisfactory completion of the laboratory work of this course is necessary for admission to Pharmacology. During the winter and spring terms a student's Physiological Journal Club meets with the professor one evening every two weeks to report and discuss current literature. Advanced Physiology.âSix hours weekly throughout the fall and winter terms. An elective open to fourth year students who have completed Physiology 1 and 2. Some one portion of physiologyâthe subject changing from year to yearâis studied more fully than is possible in the required courses and students are referred to the original literature as far as possible. As an introduction to the methods of experimental investigation, either a number of more difficult experiments are assigned or else the student repeats the experimental work of some original memoir. He then undertakes, under the guidance of the professor in charge, an investigation, which may be continued, if desired, into the spring term. There are weekly conferences for the discussion of the assigned reading and experiments. The object of the course is to afford those students who are inclined to specialize in physiology the opportunity to do so. Application for admission to the course must be made at the close of the third year, since the course must at present be limited to four students. BACTERIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY. Professor Marshall. Adjunct Professor Meloy. Mr. Jones. Thirteen hours weekly throughout the second year. Bacteriology and pathology are taught throughout the second year from September to June. Practical laboratory work by the student with daily individual attention from the instructors forms the basis of each course. In Bacteriology the student is taught to prepare culture media and to employ the usual methods necessary for the isolation and identification of bacteria, and he learns the biological peculiarities of the microorganisms concerned in the common bacterial diseases. After a few days have been spent in the making of culture media, sterilization, etc., the general technic is learned by isolating the bacteria BACTERIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY. from the air and from exposed surfaces. Following this, the pathogenic bacteria are taken up serially. Those receiving special attention are the bacteria concerned in wound infections, in respiratory and intestinal diseases, and in tuberculosis. With several diseases the pathogenic action of the bacteria is studied directly upon animals, the anatomical changes are observed, the bacteria are recovered, and the diseased tissues are prepared by the student for microscopic examination. The lectures which accompany the laboratory work are designed to set forth clearly the relation which bacteria bear to disease, to immunity, and to preventive medicine. The course in Pathology extends from January to June. The greater part of the practical work is devoted to the study of the microscopic changes occuring in disease. This is supplemented by the study of autopsy material and museum specimens. Wherever it is possible the development and progress of the lesions are studied experimentally. The practical work includes the consideration of the vascular disturbances, degeneration, inflammation, regeneration, and of benign and malignant tumors. The diseases produced by animal parasites are considered briefly. During the course the student has an opportunity to learn the standard methods employed in preparing tissues for microscopic examination, and he is called upon to witness and assist in the autopsies. A lecture precedes the practical work each day and in addition selected topics are discussed more fully in a series of lectures. Both in Bacteriology and Pathology frequent recitations are held, and the standing of the student is determined largely from these and from the character of his daily work. In addition to the courses outlined above, there will be opportunities for qualified students to engage in special work. The work in Pathology is open only to students who have obtained a record of eighty per cent. on Histology. PHARMACOLOGY, MATERIA MEDICA, AND TOXICOLOGY. Professor Eyster. Mr. Wilde. Pharmacology.âFive hours of lectures, recitations, and demonstration and six to eight hours of laboratory work weekly during the third term of the second year. In this course a study is made of the chemical characteristics and physiological action of representative drugs from the different pharmacological groups. The satisfactory completion of the laboratory work of Physiology 2 is required for admission to the course. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Materia Medica and Pharmacy.â Two hours of lectures and recitation and two hours of laboratory work weekly during the first term of the third year. The more important drugs and preparations of the Pharmacopea, together with newer non-official which bid fair to attain or have attained considerable use, form the subject of study. In the laboratory the student becomes familiar with the peculiarities and methods of preparation of the different preparations of the Pharmacopea, as well as solubilities and other characteristics of the more important drugs. Especial attention is paid to chemical and pharmaceutical incompatibility. Prescription writing is dealt with by lecture and frequent practical exercises. Toxicology.â One hour of lecture and three hours of laboratory weekly during the first term of the third year. The methods of separation and identification of poisons. Forensic Medicine.â One lecture weekly during the first term of the fourth year. To replace the course in Medical Jurisprudence after the present session. The laboratory is well equipped for special study and investigation in Pharmacology and Toxicology, and offers at all times this opportunity to medical students and others who may wish to pursue some special line of inquiry. The head of the department will be glad to suggest and outline problems for investigation to any medical or other student who has had the necessary preliminary training in physiology or chemistry for such investigation. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS. Adjunct Professor Flippin. Clinical Diagnosis.âSix hours weekly during the fall and winter terms of the first year. In this course the student is made familiar with those modern laboratory methods which are practically helpful in the diagnosis of disease. These include, among others, the systematic examination of blood, sputum, urine, gastric contents, feces, exudates, transudates, and milk. The student is not only required to understand the methods employed in such examinations, but by practice to acquire the skill necessary for accurate results. The instruction is given in the new Clinical Laboratory, situated in the north wing of the Hospital. This laboratory is well equipped with instruments and apparatus, and the wards of the Hospital furnish ample material for the proper presentation of the subject. PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. Professor Davis. Adjunct Professor Flippin. Dr. Magruder. Dr. Nelson. Dr. Rea. Dr. Garnett. Third Year. Theory and Practice of Medicine.âThree hours weekly of lectures and recitations throughout the third year; six hours weekly in the Dispensary for one half the session. A systematic course of lectures, supplemented by work in the Dispensary. The third year class is divided into two sections each of which devotes itself for half the year to the medical service in the Dispensary. Dr. Davis, Dr. Flippin, Dr. Magruder, Dr. Nelson. Fourth Year. In the fourth year the same plan is followed in the clinical work; each of the two sections of the class devotes itself for half the year to the medical service in the wards of the hospital. Full histories are taken of every case, thorough examinations made, and management indicated by the students of each division. The records thus obtained are kept up by the student assigned to the case, which he is expected to follow until its discharge. The accuracy and completeness with which this is done constitutes a large element in the determination of fitness for graduation. The subjects treated with the approximate division of time between them are as follows: Nervous Diseases and Insanity.âThree lectures and recitations weekly supplemented by clinical work during the fall term of the fourth year. In this course is given also instruction in electro-therapeutics. Dr. Davis. Pediatrics.â Three lectures and recitations weekly, supplemented by clinical work during the winter term of the fourth year. This course of lectures is intended to point out in a brief way how disease is modified by childhood and to indicate how the difficulties of diagnosis and treatment due to early age may best be encountered. The principles of infant feeding are emphasized and the student is taught how to prepare the food. Instruction in the practical details of the subject is given by work at the Dispensary and in the wards of the Hospital. Dr. Davis and Dr. Rea. Dermatology.âA brief course of lectures is given on this subject embodying a consideration of the commoner diseases met with in medical DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. practice. At the Dispensary two clinics a week throughout the year are devoted to the diseases of the skin. The senior class is divided into sections for the work in this branch. After a brief review of the anatomic and histologic structure and of the physiology of the skin, the diseases most commonly met with are discussed. The clinical material available at the University Dispensary is utilized to the best advantage to give the students a practical working knowledge of the diagnosis and treatment of affections of the skin. Dr. Davis and Dr. Garnett. Case Teaching, Medical Ethics and Economics, and Insurance Examinations.âTwo hours weekly during the spring term of the fourth year. Dr. Davis. Therapeutics.âTwo lectures weekly during the second half of the fourth year, with five hours weekly of ward rounds for one half the session. The treatment of internal diseases is discussed in a systematic course of lectures and practically demonstrated in the wards of the Hospital. Especial attention is given to the clinical side of the teaching of this subject, the student being required to suggest treatment for cases assigned to him and to follow closely and make a record of the results of the therapeutic agents employed throughout the course of the disease. The course includes a discussion of the preparation of food for the sick; demonstrations of the preparation of stupes, plasters, and poultices; and the methods of giving therapeutic baths, electrical treatment, massage, and other therapeutic measures. Dr. Flippin. SURGERY AND GYNECOLOGY. Professor Watts. Adjunct Professor Stone. Dr. Pendleton. Mr. Bardin. Surgery and Gynecology.âDuring the third year, five hours weekly of lectures and recitations, and two hours weekly of surgical clinic throughout the session, with six hours weekly in the Dispensary for one half the session. During the fourth year, two hours weekly of surgical clinic throughout the session; three hours weekly of ward classes, supplemented by clinical work in the wards and operating room for one half the session. Third Year. The study of Surgery begins in the third year and continues through the fourth year. In the third year the class room work consists SURGERY AND GYNECOLOGY. of lectures and recitations, as arranged in the schedule, in which the Principles and Practice of Surgery, Surgical Diseases, Surgical Diagnosis, etc., are thoroughly discussed. This also includes the surgical specialties, Orthopedics, Genito-urinary Surgery, etc. The Dispensary course in the third year gives opportunities for diagnosis and treatment of clinical cases under close personal supervision. Experience in dressings, bandaging, anesthesia, and minor surgery is afforded. Surgical appliances and technique are demonstrated to the students, divided into small groups. Fourth Year. In the fourth year the instruction is carried on by clinics and bed-side demonstrations in the hospital. In the wards the students are assigned cases, whose histories they must take, make complete physical and clinical examinations, urine analyses, blood examinations, etc. In the ward rounds the diagnosis, operative and other treatment, post-operative care of the cases, complications, prognosis, etc., are discussed in detail. A large variety of cases is available, and the close contact of the students with their cases and with the routine of hospital management offer many of the opportunities that an internship affords. In the operating rooms the students, in small groups, take part in the operations, thus acquiring familiarity with technique, anesthetization, etc. Those of the class who are not assisting, witness the operations, whose important features are demonstrated to them. The work in Gynecology follows closely the outlines already described for surgery. In the third year the general principles of gynecology are taken up in lectures and recitations. In addition, the dispensary affords practice in palpation, diagnosis and treatment. In the fourth year the students have the same general work as in surgery, consisting of the examination and recording of cases in the public wards, attendance on ward rounds, at which the cases are discussed, and observation and assistance in the operating rooms. Dr. Watts, Dr. Stone, and Dr. Pendleton. In addition to the above course, required of all students the following elective courses are offered: Surgical Pathology.âTwo hours weekly during the first half of the third year. The work in this course is optional and comprises lectures upon the pathology of surgical lesions, with especial emphasis upon the clinical diagnosis of tumors and inflammations, the examination of microscopic sections, and the study of fresh tissues in the gross, obtained from DEPARTMENT OF LAW. the operating room. The purpose of the course is to supplement the general courses in pathology and surgery, and to acquaint the student with the appearance of fresh pathological material from surgical cases. Dr. Stone and Mr. Bardin. Operative Surgery.âFive hours a week during the second half of the third year. This is also an optional course, consisting of lectures upon the development of operations, descriptions of steps in the more common operations, and the actual performance by the student of these operations upon living animals. The course affords experience in the use of anesthesia, the handling of living tissues, and post-operative treatment. The students care for the animals from the time they enter the clinic until they are well. Dr. Stone. OBSTETRICS. Professor Macon. Obstetrics.âThree hours weekly during the third year, of lectures, recitations, and manikin demonstrations, supplemented by work with living subjects in the wards of the Hospital. The class is divided into sections of five for manikin instruction and for examination of patients in the Hospital. The manikin course forms an important part of the work, not only for teaching presentation, position, and posture, but also the mechanism of normal and abnormal labor and the application of forceps. When the section is taken into the wards of the Hospital, the methods of examination, particularly abdominal palpation, are practiced on the living subject. In the fourth year the student attends, under the guidance of an instructor, the labour cases in the Hospital, is required to prepare the history of patients, and to follow up the cases through the puerperium. Instruction is also given in the care of the new born. In addition the student has the chance of attending patients in the outpatient department and each student is expected to attend at least four cases of labour. DISEASES OF THE EYE, EAR, NOSE, AND THROAT. Professor Hedges. Professor Compton. Diseases of the Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat.âTwo lectures weekly from the beginning of the session to the first of March, supplemented by regular clinics twice weekly throughout the fourth year and clinical lectures to sections of the class as suitable cases occur. No attempt is made to train specialists, but every effort is made to render the class familiar with such common diseases of the eye, ear, DISEASES OF EYE, EAR, NOSE AND THROAT. HYGIENE. nose, and throat as the general practitioner meets in his daily work. To this end the class is divided into small sections and each student is taught the methods of examination and the use of the ophthalmoscope, head-mirror, and of the laryangeal and post-nasal mirrors. In the clinics each patient is assigned to a student who must take the history and keep the record of that patient; the case is then demonstrated by the professor in charge, and, if possible, each student makes his own examination under the personal supervision of the attending physician. Clinical cases are abundant, and during the year the student sees and handles practically all the common diseases of the eye, ear, and upper respiratory tract. At the operations in the Hospital only as many students are allowed to be present as can really see and appreciate what is being done. Valuable work is also given in the dissecting room, where the technic of operative work is shown in a way that cannot be employed with the living patient. Students do this work as far as possible for themselves, especially in tracheotomy and intubation of the larynx. Finally the attempt is made so to ground the student in the anatomy, physiology, general pathology, and in methods of examination and treatment that he may diagnose and treat intelligently many of the cases that cannot afford to go to a perhaps distant specialist; that he may treat successfully that large class of emergency cases that first come to the general practitioner and in which immediate treatment is imperative; and, lastly, that he may recognize and intelligently refer these cases that need the services of one specially trained to this branch of work. HYGIENE. Professor Lambeth. Hygiene.âThree hours weekly throughout the fourth year. The course begins with a historical sketch of the development of preventive medicine, including short biographical sketches of the pioneers of Hygiene. With this introduction the story of the natural history of contagious and infectious diseases, modes of propagation and methods of prevention engage the attention of the student. With this preparation, the chemical and bacteriological contamination of food, water, air, and soil is made an important study. Instruction is also begun in the proper location and construction of habitations, hospitals, schoolhouses, etc., with special reference to the modern methods of heating, ventilating and draining. Notice is taken of the special relations involved in military and naval hygiene. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE. Professor Lambeth. A brief course of lectures in which the general relations of medicine to law are discussed, and the duties and rights of the medical expert as a witness. The other special branches of legal medicine and surgery are taken charge of by the other professors of the Medical Department, to whose chairs the several subjects are naturally most cognate. After the present session the place of this course will be taken by that in Forensic Medicine, given by Professor Eyster. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HOSPITAL. THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HOSPITAL. This Hospital is the property of the University, and is under the exclusive control of its Medical Faculty. It was designed and is administered as a teaching hospital, being so arranged that free use can be made of its clinical material without in any way disturbing or violating the privacy of other patients. The buildings are arranged upon the pavilion system, consisting of a central structure, four stories in height, devoted to the purposes of administration, and two wings. The administration building contains, on the main floor, reception and consultation rooms; an amphitheater and private operating rooms, with sterilizing and anesthetizing rooms attached, and an X-ray room. The upper floors furnish accommodation for the nurses of the training schools, while the basement contains the heating plant, laundry, kitchen, etc. From this building corridors in three stories lead out to the wards. These wards, having a capacity of about eighteen beds each, are beautifully lighted, have direct indirect hot-water radiators, and forced ventilation. Opening from each ward on the east is a large protected porch, of great value to convalescents. The south wing has been in use for several years; the new north wing, completed in 1907, gives the Hospital a capacity of about 100 beds. The equipment throughout is new, and conforms in all respects to the best usage of the day. During the past year the number of patients has steadily increased, and the range of influence of the Hospital has been greatly widened, patients being received from all parts of the State. Attention is particularly called to the fact that this hospital, with its associated dispensary, constitutes a valuable adjunct to the teaching facilities of the Medical School. The variety of cases presented, and more especially the opportunities offered for a thorough study of the individual case, afford unusually satisfactory conditions for clinical instruction.

COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. The candidate who has satisfied the requirements for entrance as above defined is matriculated as a student of Engineering and admitted to the regular Freshman Class. The studies of this class comprise lecture-courses in Mathematics 1, Physics 1, and Chemistry 1, with associated laboratory courses in Physics, Chemistry, and Drawing, as specified below. For advancement to the Sophomore Class the student must have completed at least two thirds of his Freshman work. Upon entering this class he elects his specialty. The courses thereafter diverge according as the student is an applicant for a degree in Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Mining, or Chemical Engineering. Programmes of study for each degree are given below. The courses are so ordered that the specified entrance requirements are adequate for the work of the Freshman Year. Each succeeding year presupposes the completion of the work for all the foregoing years. Students are advised to adhere strictly to the regular programmes. The arrangements specified in them have been carefully planned and are the best. Haphazard election is discouraged and in extreme cases will be prohibited. No student will be registered for a course unless in the opinion both of the Dean and of the professor his preliminary training has fitted him for the profitable pursuit of that course. Students are especially advised against the attempt to crowd too many studies into their scheme of work, and are warned that admission to advanced courses will be granted only to those who have adequate mathematical and scientific training to profit by them. Men overloaded with work, too great in volume or in difficulty for their powers, suffer inevitable discouragement and incur almost certain failure. Mathematics 1.

The purpose of this course is to familiarize the beginner with the technique of Engineering Drafting. The student executes each week under the supervision of the Instructor a plate (15Ã20 inches), the entire course consisting of about twenty-four such plates. The Fall Term is given to Mechanical Drawing, including practice in lettering and dimensioning; the Winter Term to Projection Drawing, including DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. the intersections and developments of curved surfaces; and the Spring Term to Machine Drawing. Three periods a week of three hours each are assigned to the course; one hour is devoted to a lecture by the Professor on the theories and constructions illustrated in the weekly plate and the remaining eight hours to practice in the Drafting Room under the Instructor. Drawing 2. [Thornton and West]. The object of the Sophomore course in Drawing is to train the student in the use of the graphical method not merely as a means of representation, but as an instrument of research. The work is organized as in Drawing 1; one hour a week being devoted to a lecture by the Professor on the problems of the plate and eight hours a week to practice under the direction of the Instructor. The Fall Term is devoted to a systematic course in Descriptive Geometry; the Winter Term takes up Graphical Statics and includes the analysis of roofs, bridges, beams, reservoir walls and dams, chimneys, and so on; the Spring Term is given to Topographical Drawing, including the construction of maps and plans. Drawing 3. [Thornton and West]. The Junior course in Drawing furnishes striking illustrations of the power of the graphical method in achieving easy and rapid solutions of problems, before which analytical methods are comparatively impotent. The work is organized as in the other courses; one hour of lecture and eight hours of practice. In the Fall Term a series of problems in the Strength of Materials is given for graphical solution. The Winter Term is devoted to the analysis of high masonry dams, retaining walls, continuous girders and trusses, masonry and reenforced concrete arches, and like problems of Structural Drawing. The Spring Term concludes the course with a series of plates on Shades and Shadows, and Linear Perspective. CONFERENCE CLUB AND THESIS WORK. Every candidate for a degree in Engineering will be required at the beginning of his graduating year to submit to the Dean some subject for independent study suited to the student's especial course and aims. After such subject has been approved by the Dean and the Professor in charge, the student will be expected to carry out for himself the necessary literary and laboratory researches and to present his results in the form of a Graduating Thesis. Such thesis must be typewritten on standard sheets, 8 by 10Â½ inches, bound in DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. a proper cover, and handed in for final approval not later than May 25th. All necessary computations and drawings must accompany the thesis. Serious weight will be given to this work in estimating the student's fitness for graduation. To stimulate the independent work of the candidates for graduation the Junior and Senior students of this Department and the members of the Faculty will be organized into a Conference Club, which will conduct weekly conferences on engineering problems of immediate value and present importance. At these meetings the candidates for graduation will make from week to week reports of progress on their thesis work. In addition reports will be made and illustrated. lectures will be delivered on great engineering undertakings of current interest. From time to time addresses will be made before the Club by the alumni of this Department and other engineers engaged in professional practise. By vote of the regular members a limited number of the students of the lower classes may be granted the privileges of the Club. A Reading Room has been fitted up for the use of the regular members of the Club. In it the more important Engineering periodical publications will be kept on file. EXAMINATIONS AND REPORTS. Written Examinations are held at the end of each term covering the work of that term and the results of these examinations, combined with the student's class standing, give his Term Grade. The Regular Reports sent out at the end of every term to the student's parent or guardian state for each course followed the term grade and the number of absences. Further comment may be added by the Dean or the Professor, if it appears probable that such comment would be helpful to the student. Parents are urged to examine these reports carefully, and to exert such parental influence as may seem needed to establish and confirm the student in habits of industry and order. Special Reports are sent to parents at the end of each month for students delinquent in attendance or studiousness and for delinquents only. When a student is making steady progress and showing due diligence in his work only the regular reports are sent. The receipt of a special report is evidence that, in the judgment of the Faculty, prompt and pointed parental admonition is urgently needed. Reexaminations are held during registration week in September. To these reexaminations the Faculty will admit, on the recommendation DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. of his professor, any student of the previous session who in any course fell below the pass mark of seventy-five per cent., but made at least sixty-five per cent. at the regular examination. For every such reexamination the student must pay to the Bursar on or before July 15th a fee of $5, which fee is in no case returnable. The student who fails in any course and does not make up his deficiency on reexamination will be required to register anew for that course and attend the lectures and pass the regular examination, unless relieved by special vote of the Faculty. The Dean will send to every student eligible for reexamination a programme of the dates of the September examinations. DEGREES. Upon the completion of the four year course as defined in any one of the following Programmes of Study and the presentation of an acceptable graduating thesis the Faculty will award to any student in regular and honorable standing the appropriate Degree of Civil Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Mining Engineer, or Chemical Engineer. In each programme will be found the Topics of Study for the several years and the hours of lecture or of laboratory exercises, where such hours are fixed and non-adjustable. In the more advanced laboratory, shop, and field courses the hours for the exercises will be adjusted to the convenience of the students. Arabic numerals give the hours for Monday, Wednesday and Friday; Roman numerals give the hours for Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.

The average annual expenses of a student who pursues the regular course in Engineering will be: Outside Students. Virginians. University Fee $ 40 $ 40 Department Fee (average of four years) 75 30 Living Expenses (for nine months) 225 225 Books and Drawing Materials 20 20 Incidental Expenses (for nine months) 45 45 Total for average conditions $405 $360 The Department Fee is $90 for the Freshman Year, $80 for the Sophomore, $70 for the Junior, $60 for the Senior, and averages $75. It entitles the student to take over again without charge any single course of the previous year on which he may have failed. But students who fail on two or more courses of any year are required to take them over and pay the full fee of that year. The University Fee of $40 entitles the student to the free use of the Library, Gymnasium, Shops, and Laboratories; to free medical attention; to the services of the Instructor in Physical Culture; to the facilities of the Hospital in case of need; and covers all fees for the regular examinations, degrees, and diplomas. The Living Expenses include board, lodging, fuel and lights, servant and laundry; the average is $25 a month, minimum $18, and a reasonable maximum $32. Books and Drawing Materials will cost about $80 for the four year course. Incidental Expenses ought to be kept within modest bounds; the above estimate is sufficient; large allowances of pocket money promote idleness and attract companions of the baser sort. No allowances are made for clothing or travelling expenses, which vary too much to be introduced into any general estimate. The following are payable on entrance: University Fee ($40); Department Fee ($90-60); Contingent Deposit ($10); Books and Instruments ($20); and one month's Living Expenses ($32-$18). The student will need at entrance about $200. In Mining and in Chemical Engineering there are additional laboratory fees as noted below for the advanced courses in Analytical and General Chemistry. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. REQUIREMENTS FOR ADVANCED STANDING. Applicants from other colleges will be admitted provisionally to advanced standing as candidates for a degree in Engineering upon presentation of proper certificates covering the courses for which credit is desired. Such certificates must be filed with the Dean, and must be acceptable both to him and to the professors in charge of the accredited courses. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the college; must specify the character and content of the course followed by the student; must give his marks, which should not fall below the standard seventy-five per cent. of this University; and must recommend the student as worthy of admission to the University of Virginia in respect of both character and scholarship. The final validation of such a certificate is effected by the successful completion of the courses attended in this University. The programme of studies offered by such a candidate for his degree in Engineering must satisfy all the requirements for that degree as here established. He must devote at least two full sessions to engineering studies in this University. Credits on Practical Work will be allowed to applicants, who have accomplished successfully courses in Drawing, Field-work, or Shop-work equivalent to those given in this University, or have acquired in professional practice the training which these courses represent. To secure credit for such work the student must make written application to the Dean of the Department, and with this application must file the certificate of the chief draftsman or other officer under whom the work was done. Applicants for admission to the Engineering Department, who are twenty years old, and desire to enter for the pursuit of special elective courses, must present adequate proofs of good character and of the needful maturity and training. Such applicants are then registered as Special Students, and are admitted without formal examination to the privileges of the University, but not as candidates for any titled degree. The Expenses of special students, and of all students who pursue elective courses, are the same as those of regular students, except as to fees for tuition. The fee for each class taken will be $25, with the addition of the prescribed laboratory charges, which are $5 for each class in Mechanics, Engineering, and Physics; $10 for Chemistry. For each class in Analytical Chemistry a special fee of $50 is charged for tuition, plus $10 for apparatus and supplies. The fee for each class in Drawing is $10. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. HUMANISTIC STUDIES. Students, who have enjoyed the benefits of sound preliminary training in good high schools, are advised in all cases to enrich and liberalize their professional course by the introduction of humanistic studies. Under the elective system of this University it is easy to plan a schedule of work for a well prepared matriculate, which will at the end of five years give him in addition to his professional degree the general culture degree of Bachelor of Science or of Bachelor of Arts. The additional courses required are two languages (elected from French, German, and Latin), one historical science (History, or Economics, or English Literature, or Biblical History and Literature), and one philosophical science (Logic, or Ethics, or Psychology). The following is a sample schedule leading at the end of five years to the two degrees of B. S. and C. E. I. Mathematics 2, Chemistry 1, French 2B. II. Physics 1, English Literature 2B, German 2B, Drawing 1. III. Civil Engineering 1, Mechanics 1, Logic 1B, Drawing 2. IV. Civil Engineering, 2, Mechanics 2, Geology 1, Drawing 3. V. Civil Engineering 3, Mechanics 3, Electives, Thesis. The courses printed in italics are those added from the College. Only students of good training and robust intelligence are advised to attempt the double course. DRAFTING ROOMS. The drafting rooms are abundantly lighted and are provided with solidly constructed tables with locked drawers for instruments and materials. Each student is assigned to a table and has a drawer for his exclusive use. The regular Drawing Classes execute each one plate a week under the supervision of the Instructor in Drawing. The more advanced students have such additional drawings assigned by their respective professors as are needed for the full development of the courses of study. Careful attention is given to the training of the students in lettering, in the conventional signs of mechanical drawing, in the proper lay-out of drawings, and in neat and accurate execution. Exercises are required also in tracing and in blue-printing, the rooms for which are conveniently arranged and in close contiguity to the drafting rooms. While, however, technical dexterity is demanded, the graphical DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. method is taught and used primarily as a powerful and indispensable instrument of research, the thoughtful mastery of which is essential for the instructed Engineer. The construction and theory of the Polar Planimeter, the Slide Rule, and the Pantograph are carefully taught, and the student is trained in the practical use of these appliances for the rapid and accurate production of estimates and copies from finished drawings. SHOPS. The Shop Equipment is throughout of the best quality, the machines being all from good makers and of sizes ample for the purposes of instruction. A full outfit of hand tools is maintained at all times. Each shop is equipped for the instruction of a squad of sixteen students, this being as large a number as one instructor can properly direct at once. The Machine Shop is provided with four first-class engine lathes, illustrating the practice of the best American makers; with a planer, a shaper, two drill presses, a universal drilling machine (Brown and Sharpe), and a universal grinder (same makers); also with a gas forge for tempering tools, a cut-off saw for metal rods, an emery wheel, and so on. The Wood Shop is furnished with several small lathes, a large pattern maker's lathe, a jointer, a planer, a saw bench for slitting and cross-cutting, a band-saw, a jigsaw, and a wood trimmer for pattern making. The Foundry has a cupola furnace for working cast iron, a brass furnace, a core oven, and all needful accessories for moulding and casting; the blast for the cupola is furnished by a special blower, driven by a small high-speed steam engine. The Forge Room is equipped with Buffalo down-shaft forges; and the necessary smith's tools; the draft is furnished by the same blower, and the exhaust is operated by a fan driven also by the engine. Shop instruction is given for its educational value. The purpose of this Department is to train engineers, not artisans; and the claims of the shops are not permitted to infringe on the truly vital functions of the laboratories, the drafting rooms, and the lectures. FIELD INSTRUMENTS. The outfit of Field Instruments contains compasses, transits, and levels of various approved makes; a solar transit, furnished also with stadia wires and gradienter for tachymetric work; hand-levels and clinometers for railway topography; a plane table; a sextant; together with an adequate supply of leveling rods, telemeter rods, signal poles, chains, tapes, pins, and so on. For hydraulic work and hydrographic surveys a hook guage and a current meter are provided. All students are instructed in the theory and adjustments of the field-instruments DEPARTMENT OF LAW. and in their practical use in the field. They are also required to make up their field-books in standard forms; to reduce their surveys and execute all the necessary profiles, plans, and maps; and to determine lengths, areas, and volumes both from the maps and from the original notes. A polar planimeter is provided for facilitating such estimates and a pantagraph for making reduced copies of finished drawings. LABORATORY WORK IN STRENGTH OF MATERIALS. The Sinclair Laboratory for work in Strength of Materials.âThis was founded on the original donation of Mrs. John Sinclair, of New York City, as a memorial to her late husband. The collection has since been considerably enlarged. It contains Riehle and Olsen machines, each of 100,000 pounds capacity, arranged for tensile, compressive, and transverse tests; an Olsen torsion machine of 50,000 inch pounds capacity; an Olsen compression machine of 40,000 pounds capacity; a Ewing tester for the elasticity of rods; hand machines for testing rods and wires and small specimens of timber and cast iron under transverse loads; Fairbanks and Olsen cement testers of 1,000 pounds capacity each; apparatus for torsional tests on both long wires and short wires; together with the necessary accessory apparatus for utilizing these machines. LABORATORY AND FIELD-WORK IN HYDRAULICS. The equipment for this work comprises a steel tank for weir experiments with adjustable bronze notches; a hook gauge for accurate measurement of surface levels; a cast-iron stand pipe for experiments on efflux with adjustable bronze orifices; a series of pipes with bends, elbows, and tees for measuring pipe friction; and the proper manometers and gauges for reading pressures. For the field-work the outfit of field instruments has been enlarged by a current meter of modern construction and a set of hollow copper ball floats for direct stream velocity measurements. ENGINE AND BOILER TESTS. The Steam Engine Tests are made on the high-speed Ball engine, which operates the shops. This motor has been specially equipped for the purpose. It receives steam from the main line through a Sweet separator; humidity determinations are thus made twiceâonce by a separating calorimeter before the steam enters the separator, and again by a throttling calorimeter as it enters the cylinder. It is fitted with proper indicators, and permanent indicator rigging so that at any time cards may be taken and the indicated horse-power determined DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. In like manner a rope friction brake is so arranged that it may be at once applied for the determination of brake horse-power. Connections are so made with a Wheeler surface condenser that the engine may at will be operated either condensing or non-condensing. Provisions are made for measuring the temperatures and the amounts of the condensation water and the condensed steam produced during the run. With these data a complete heat balance of the experimental run is attainable. For Steam Boiler Tests the boilers of the University heating and lighting plant are available. The department is equipped with the necessary apparatusâthermometers, gauges, steam calorimeters, fuel calorimeters, gas analyzers, scales, tanks, and so on. Students of Mechanical Engineering are taught by practical lessons in the boiler room the standard methods for boiler trials, and the class makes each session at least one complete trial. The Gas Engine Tests are made on an Otto machine of 15 I. H. P. and 12 B. H. P. This is also provided with its friction brake, indicator rigging, and indicator. The cooling water is run in from calibrated tanks and provision is made for observing not only its amount but the initial and final temperature. Gasoline or alcohol is used as fuel, and is run in from a graduated wrought-iron bottle, so that the amount consumed is determined. The heating power is obtained by an independent test with a Rosenhain calorimeter. Samples of the burnt gases are drawn from the exhaust pipe and analyzed in an Orsat gas apparatus. The temperature of the exhaust will be determined by a platinum resistance thermometer inserted close to the exhaust valve. With these data, and the observed numbers of revolutions and explosions, the heat balance is worked out. The Refrigerating Tests are made on a Remington Ice Machine of one ton capacity. This is an ammonia compression machine driven by an electric motor. Instead of brine, plain water is used, heated by a steam jet to 100 degrees and then cooled down to 40 degrees by the machine. A run is first made with the pipes empty in order to determine the friction horse power. The ammonia is then turned on and the run is made under load. In both cases the power consumed is measured both by watt-meter and by am-meter and volt-meter readings. The tanks are accurately calibrated and careful measurements of the temperature are made through the run. Indicator cards are also taken from the ammonia cylinders and the number of revolutions is registered by counter. With these data the mechanical and thermodynamic performance of the machine are figured out. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. LABORATORY WORK IN ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING. The Scott Laboratory of Electrical Engineering.âThis laboratory was equipped and endowed by Mrs. Francis Branch Scott, of Richmond, Va., as a memorial to her late son, an alumnus of this University. In addition to full sets of electric meters with the appliances for testing and calibrating them, galvanometers of the best modern types, standard cells and resistances, standard condensers, and all other necessary apparatus for minor tests, it contains numerous pieces of the very best construction. Such are the Wolff potentiometer, the Siemens and Halske Double Bridge, the Magnetic Induction apparatus, the Duddell Oscillograph, the Station Photometer, and so on. It contains also a number of direct current generators and motors, a two-phase alternator, induction motors of two and three phases, several pairs of transformers, and all the apparatus used in testing such machines. Important additions to this equipment have been recently made. ROAD MATERIAL TESTS. In the Road Material Tests the machines used are mainly those devised by Dr. Logan Waller Page, director of the United States office of public roads. For measuring the strength of the stone cylindrical samples are cut out with a diamond drill and tested under impact and in the 40,000-pound compression machine. The resistance to abrasion is measured on fragments of the stone, rotated in heavy cast iron cylinders mounted on their diagonals. The binding power of the dust is measured by impact tests on cylindrical briquettes formed under heavy hydraulic pressure. The dust for these briquettes is produced in a ball mill fed with fine stone broken in a small crusher. This part of the testing outfit has been installed largely by the generous aid of Dr. Page. It is hoped that useful experimental researches on the road-building rocks and gravels of Virginia may be carried out with it. BUILDINGS. The buildings devoted wholly or in part to the work of the Department of Engineering are the following: The Mechanical Laboratory is the main seat of the instruction in technical studies. It is 180 by 70 feet and contains on the main floor the Dean's office and the offices of the three adjunct-professors; the main lecture room; the laboratory of electrical engineering; and the drafting room for the First and Second Year students. Above are a smaller drafting room for advanced students, and blueprint and photographic rooms. Below on the ground floor are another class room, the reading room, the testing laboratory, the wood shop, the metal DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. shop, apparatus and store rooms, the tool room, and the students' lavatory. The Power House is a single-story building 110 by 40 feet. In addition to the University boiler plant and the electric lighting plant this contains the foundry and the forge room. The boiler plant consists of two horizontal return-tubular boilers, each of 140 horse power. The lighting plant consists of three electric generators directly connected to high speed engines, the respective capacities being 25, 50, and 75 kilowatts. The whole plant is available for purposes of instruction, study and experiment. The Laboratory of General Chemistry, situated at the southern end of West Range, is one of the older buildings recently remodelled and fitted up for the work of instruction in undergraduate chemistry. It is furnished with all the necessary apparatus and supplies, and is comfortably heated and lighted. The Engineering students, who are taught in a separate section, have three hours in lecture each week and six hours in the laboratory. The work is specially adapted to their needs. The Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry is 150 by 60 feet. It is a single-story building, containing the lecture room, the laboratory of analytical chemistry, the rooms for assaying, the balance rooms, the offices and private laboratories of the professors of Industrial and Analytical Chemistry, and a number of store rooms. These contain not only the usual laboratory supplies, but an extensive collection of specimens, illustrating very completely the processes and products of industrial chemistry, and of especial interest to engineering students. The Geological Museum is 120 by 50 feet. It is a three-story building. The main floor is devoted to the very extensive geological collection of specimens, charts, relief maps, and so on. The gallery above contains an equally good collection of minerals and numerous models of typical crystallographic forms. The upper floor contains the lecture rooms and the new laboratories of Economic Geology. In the basement are stored subsidiary collections and new material accumulated in more recent geological surveys. The Physical Laboratory faces the Mechanical Laboratory on the opposite side of the quadrangle, and has almost the same proportions. The main floor contains the lecture room, the professors' offices, the laboratory of experimental physics, and the store room for the very large collection of apparatus used in the lectures. On the ground floor is the laboratory of theoretical electricity, the storage battery room, a well equipped shop for the repair and manufacture of apparatus, and numerous smaller rooms for the work of graduate students.

The Department of Agriculture is founded on the gift of one hundred thousand dollars by the late Samuel Miller, of Lynchburg, Va.; this sum having been given to establish a fund, the income of which should be applied, as far as practicable, to the maintenance of experiments in agriculture, training in the art of farming, and instruction in those sciences which underlie that art, as well as in their practical relations thereto. Since the income in question is manifestly inadequate to provide for all these important ends in an efficient manner, it has become necessary for those directly charged with its administration to decide how it can be most usefully applied within the limits indicated. Agriculture is the art of cultivating the soil with a view to profit; as usually applied, the term implies the successful raising and marketing of crops of plants or of animals, or of their products. Its theory is based directly upon the sciences of Chemistry, Botany, and ZoÃ¶logy; and also, but less directly, upon the allied sciences of Physics, Mechanics, and Geology. Education adapted to the prosecution of this vocation calls, therefore, at the outset, for sound and thorough instruction in these sciences; and subsequently for the discussion of its principles DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. and processes as based upon them. The experience of some years has shown conclusively that neither agricultural experimentation nor instruction in the routine of farm work can be profitably conducted here with the means at command; nor is such application of these means in accordance with the needs or expressed desires of students who come to the University for the purpose of entering this Department. It seems wisest, therefore, as well as most consonant with the other functions of the University, to apply the income of this fund to the enlargement, as far as possible, of the opportunities here afforded to those who desire to acquire a knowledge of the sciences on which the art of agriculture is based, and of which it is the practical application; to understand their theoretical principles, as well as their economic relations; and to be capable of following their progress in all its bearings. Instruction is therefore offered in this Department to all who desire such training in the descriptive and experimental sciences as this would imply, together with a knowledge of the closely affiliated mathematical sciences, and of the modern languages of immediate importance to the scientific student; in accordance with the following plan: Required for Entrance Upon the Work of the Department.âThe General Entrance Examination, or admission to the University by certificate or diploma, as stated in a preceding portion of this catalogue. Based upon this preparation the degree of Bachelor of Science in Agriculture will be conferred upon students who satisfactorily complete one B course each in Physics, General Chemistry, Botany, ZoÃ¶logy, Geology, and Analytical Chemistry; together with an advanced course in each of any three of the Schools represented by these courses; of one B course (to be elected by the student) from the group of mathematical sciences, viz., Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, or Astronomy; and of the B courses in French and German. The B courses are the same as, or the equivalent of, the B courses described in a previous portion of this catalogue; the advanced courses in the various scientific Schools have also been previously described. Agricultural Chemistry.âThere is offered in connection with the graduating course in Analytical Chemistry a course of lectures in Agricultural Chemistry, including a discussion of the chemical and physical properties of the atmosphere, of soils, and of plants; the chemistry of the processes of vegetable life so far as they are related to Agriculture; the chemical composition and preparation of DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. manures; the chemistry of stock feeding, and of fungicides and insecticides. This course is open without charge to students who have registered in Analytical Chemistry, to Virginia students, and to farmers who are not matriculated students. For Reference: Johnston's Elements of Agricultural Chemistry; 17th Edition; London, 1894. In addition to the courses in Biology described in a previous portion of this catalogue, there are offered in the School of Biology and Agriculture the following courses, which provide for the discussion of the relation of the biological sciences to the art of Agricultture: Practical Biology and Agriculture.âThe relations of the biological sciences to Agriculture are so manifold, and the subdivisions of the latter subject so numerous, that it would be impossible to exhaust the discussion of either in the work of any one year. Courses consisting in part of lectures and in part of an equivalent amount of practical work and collateral reading will be offered yearly as follows: 1B. Botany and Agriculture: Botany 1B prerequisite.âIn this course a study will be made of the anatomy and physiology of the higher plants, especially as related to nutrition and growth; and of the principles of crop raising as based on the laws of plant life. Professor Tuttle. Text-Books.âStevens' Plant Anatomy: Pierce's Plant Physiology: Vorhee's Principles of Agriculture. 2B. ZoÃ¶logy and Agriculture: ZoÃ¶logy 1B prerequisite.âIn this course a study will be made of the parasitic Protozoa, Worms, and Arthropods: the Insects will be considered in their economic relations: and the anatomy of the domestic animals examined. The relations of animals to the soil and to plant life will be discussed. Adjunct Professor Kepner. Text-Books.âOsborn's Economic ZoÃ¶logy; Folsom's Entomology; Chauveau's Anatomy of the Domestic Animals. Candidates for a diploma of graduation in Biology and Agriculture are required to complete the courses in Botany, ZoÃ¶logy, and one advanced course in each, and also the courses above described. In this Department, as in the College, the order in which studies shall be taken is left largely to the discretion of the student (subject to the restriction that not more than three classes may be undertaken in any one session without the consent of the Faculty): the following is, however, suggested as a convenient arrangement of a four years' course for this DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. degree; and as one of several combinations of subjects possible under the requirements above stated. First Year: Geology 1B; Physics 1B; Botany 1B; Second Year: French 2B; General Chemistry 1B; ZoÃ¶logy 1B; Third Year: German 2B; Analytical Chemistry 1B; Botany and Agriculture; Fourth Year: * * Substitution may be made of either Pure Mathematics 2B or Astronomy 1B for Mechanics; each of these three courses requires the previous completion of Mathematics 1A. Mechanics 1B; â  â  Substitution may be made for either of these advanced courses by advanced courses in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, or Geology. Analyt. and Agri. Chem. 2; â  â  Substitution may be made for either of these advanced courses by advanced courses in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, or Geology. ZoÃ¶logy and Agriculture. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses at the University of a student in the Department of Agriculture may be estimated at from $290 a year upwards, according to the mode of living. A fuller statement of expenses, including the conditions under which Virginia students are entitled to free tuition, may be found in a preceding section. (See pp. 92-98). MILLER SCHOLARSHIPS. A scholarship is awarded at the end of each session to the candidate who at that time passes the graduation examinations in the B courses in ZoÃ¶logy, Chemistry, and Physics with the highest aggregate of marks. The scholarship is tenable for the following two years. The emoluments consist of $250 a session, with free tuition in the Schools of the Department of Agriculture. The holder of a Miller Scholarship is required to elect at least one-third of his work in Biology and Agriculture, Analytical Chemistry, or Applied Mathematics, and the remainder from any courses offered in the Academic Schools: he is also required to act as a student assistant in the Biological Laboratory. The tenure of the scholarship depends upon the good conduct and studious diligence of the scholar, the Faculty being authorized to withdraw its benefits from any student who does not avail himself of the opportunities for study which it is intended to secure. Condidacy must be announced at the beginning of the session. SUMMER SCHOOL. SUMMER SCHOOL SESSION OF 1908 ADMINISTRATIVE BOARD. EDWIN ANDERSON ALDERMAN, D. C. L., LL. D., President of the University.

THE SESSION will begin Friday, June 18th and close Saturday, July 31st, 1909. Friday, June 18th, will be devoted to the registration of students. All students should register on this day. The entire faculty of the Summer School will be in the room adjoining the Registrar's office from 8.45 to 1.30 for counsel, on June 18th. Students should consult freely with members of the Faculty in case of difficulty in choosing courses. No certificate will be granted to students who fail to register before Wednesday, June 23rd. FEES.âNo registration fee will be charged. The tuition fee will consist of $5.00 for each course taken, except in the School of Methods, where a fee of $5.00 admits the applicant to all courses. The Department of Public Instruction of Virginia has provided by donation that SUMMER SCHOOL. Virginia teachers shall be charged only $3.00 for the School of Methods. Further exception is made to the $5.00 fee in certain other courses where a special fee is mentioned in connection with the outlined course in the Summer School Catalogue. Before being enrolled in a class each student is required to register and to pay all fees. No reduction of fee will be allowed for late entrance or withdrawal. Laboratory fees will be charged in all courses in which materials are required to be used by students or demonstrators. CREDIT.âCertificates will be granted in each course in the University Department to those students who attain a grade of 75%. This grade will be the average of the recitation and examination marks. No student will be allowed to take more than three courses without the permission of the Director. This regulation does not apply to the School of Methods. As a rule, students wishing University credit should not attempt more than two courses in one summer: they must receive in all cases permission to take more than three. In registering, students should state what credits they desire, as arrangements for credit must be made before taking the course. 1. Professional Certificate.âThe following regulations with reference to credits towards the Professional Teaching Certificate in Virginia have been passed by the Board of Examiners: "Resolved, That those teachers holding first grade certificates, who attend the Summer School of the University of Virginia for two sessions of six weeks each, and who make an average of 75% on class work and examinations, in six courses, other than elementary school subjects, shall be entitled to the Professional Certificate which shall continue in force for seven years, subject to renewals from time to time." These six courses would necessitate the work of at least two sessions and must include at least four different subjects. 2. Credit Allowed by Other States than Virginia.âApplication has been made to other Southern States for credit equal to that accorded by the Virginia Board of Examiners. Credits are now allowed toward the extension of the certificates by certain other States. In others the University Summer School instructors are appointed to hold State examinations. In some other States arrangements may be made upon application of the teachers from those States. All persons wishing to arrange for credits with their respective school authorities should correspond with the Director of the Summer School. 3. University of Virginia Credit.âBelow are stated the conditions SUMMER SCHOOL. upon which credit in the University of Virginia may be granted for work done in the Summer School. (a) The student must satisfy the entrance examination requirements of the University of Virginia and matriculate before he can receive credit in the College for any work done in the University of Virginia Summer School. (b) The Dean of the College will accept the completion of the courses in the Summer School in lieu of the entrance examinations in the same subject, provided that in his judgment the courses are equivalent to those required for entrance to the University of Virginia, and provided, that the certificates of courses completed be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned. (c) The Dean of the College and the professor in charge of the school in which credit is desired will accept certificates of completion of summer courses in lieu of A courses in the University of Virginia, provided that such summer courses be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned as the full equivalent in character and scope of the corresponding A courses in the University. (d) Certificates of completion of certain summer courses approved by the Academic Faculty will be accepted in lieu of portions of B courses, provided that in each case the Dean of the College, the Faculty Committee on Degrees, and the professor in charge of the courses for which credit is desired certify in writing that the summer courses completed are equivalent in character and scope to that portion of the regular sessional work for which credit is desired. (e) The character of the examinations and the numerical standard (75%) required for their successful completion shall be the same as those of the sessional examinations. TEACHERS' POSITIONS.âThe University Appointment Committee receives more demands for teachers than it is ever able to fill. This Committee would be glad to have well qualified teachers who are in attendance upon the Summer School leave their applications with the Director, who is a member of the Committee. BOARD AND ROOMS.âBoard and rooms may be had at prices ranging from $3.00 per week, where several stay in the same room, upwards, according to accommodations, the average being $4.00 per week. Many of the boarding-houses are situated on, or immediately adjoining the University grounds. A limited number of students may, upon application, procure rooms in the University buildings at a nominal rental to cover actual expenses of furniture and attendance. The Commons, the handsome new dining hall on the University grounds, is now at the service of Summer School students. The cost of board in the din- SUMMER SCHOOL. ing hall will not exceed $4.00 per week. Applications should be made as early as possible. REDUCED RAILWAY RATES.âAll students coming to the Summer School from points south and west of Virginia should apply several weeks in advance to their local agents for reduced rates. In case the agent has received no instructions for selling reduced rate tickets to Charlottesville, Virginia, the Director of the Summer School should be written to promptly for information.

The collection contains more than sixty thousand volumes, and books are available for use by the officers and students and some others under the following regulations: 1. Books of the Reference Collection are not to be removed from the Library, but may be freely consulted at the tables. All bound magazines are classed as reference books. Books in current use in connection with the courses of instruction will be temporarily placed on the shelves of the Reference Collection, and will then be subject to the above rule. Works of special value or specially liable to injury on account of their rarity, illustrations, etc., are not to be removed from the Library, except by permission. New periodicals cannot be borrowed within two weeks after they are placed on the shelves. 2. The Librarian is required to make an entry of every book removed from the Library with the time when the same is to be returned. 3. Students may borrow books upon the following terms: No student can have more than three volumes at the same time. Each book must be returned by the borrower within two weeks from the date of its withdrawal. The loan may be renewed unless another person entitled to the books has signified his need of it. Ten cents a volume will be charged for each day that a volume remains unreturned after the two weeks for which it was withdrawn. 4. Members of the Faculty have at all times free use of the Library within its walls, and borrow books under the following regulations: Each book borrowed is to be presented to the Librarian to be charged to the borrower. THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. Each book borrowed is understood to be taken out for a period not exceeding one month, but this time may be extended unless the Librarian notify the borrower that some one else desires the book. Not more than two volumes at any time may be borrowed for the use of any other person than the professor himself, and the Librarian is always to be notified at the time of borrowing that the book is not for individual use. 5. All books borrowed from the Library must be returned and on the shelves by the fifth day before the close of each session. 6. The Librarian may permit persons residing at the University for the purpose of studying during the vacation to use the Library, with the approval of the President, and under the above general regulations, but at such hours as may be specially arranged for, on condition that each such person pay to the Librarian a fee of $3 and make a contingent deposit of $15, against which may be assessed any charges for loss or injury of books. 7. The Librarian is charged with the general duty of maintaining order in the Library, preserving the room and its contents from damage and reporting to the Bursar any fines and penalties which may have to be enforced.</field>

THE BARBOUR-PAGE LECTURE FOUNDATION: LITERARY SOCIETIES: RELIGIOUS WORK: PHYSICAL TRAINING: COLONNADE CLUB: ALUMNI ASSOCIATIONS: REGISTER OF STUDENTS, 1908-1909: INDEX. THE BARBOUR-PAGE LECTURE FOUNDATION. THE BARBOUR-PAGE LECTURE FOUNDATION. The University of Virginia is indebted for the establishment of the Barbour-Page Foundation to the wisdom and generosity of Mrs. Thomas Nelson Page, of Washington, D. C. In 1907, Mrs. Page donated to the University the sum of $22,000, the annual income of which is to be used in securing each session the delivery before the University of a series of not less than three lectures by some distinguished man of letters or of science. The conditions of the foundation require that the Barbour-Page lectures for each session be not less than three in number; that they be delivered by a specialist in some branch of literature, science, or art; that the lecturer present in the series of lectures some fresh aspect or aspects of the department of thought in which he is a specialist; and that the entire series delivered each session, taken together, shall possess such unity that they may be published by the Foundation in book-form. LECTURERS ON THE BARBOUR-PAGE FOUNDATION. 1907. Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, of Philadelphia, Pa. Subject: Some Literary Reminiscences. 1908. Prof. Basil L. Gildersleeve, of Johns Hopkins University. Subject: Vitality of Greek Studies in America. 1. November 19th, The Channels of Life. 2. November 20th, The Pervasiveness of Greek Language and Literature. 3. November 21st, Hellas and HesperiaâAnalogies of Ancient Greek and Modern American Life. 1909. President Charles W. Elliot, of Harvard University. STUDENTS' LITERARY SOCIETIES. STUDENTS' LITERARY SOCIETIES. Connected with the University, are two literary societies of long standingâthe Jefferson Society and the Washington Society. At weekly meetings in their respective halls, they hold debates, conduct parliamentary drills, and practice extemporaneous and other forms of public speaking. Each society annually offers gold medals for excellence in debate and oratory, and each organization yearly contends for the possession of the Harrison Trophy. All intercollegiate contests are managed for the Societies by the Debating and Oratorical Council. It sends competitors for the prizes of the Central Oratorical League, the Southern Inter-State Oratorical Association, and the Virginia State Oratorical Association. During the session of 1908-1909, it will conduct a triangular debate with the University of North Carolina and Washington and Lee University. Its present officers are W. B. Buford, President; Maurice Hirsch, Vice-President; W. N. Neff, Secretary; C. W. Paul, Adjunct Professor of Public Speaking, Treasurer; and J. C. Jamison, Assistant Treasurer. MEDALISTS. 1907-1908. Jefferson Society Orator Samuel Clay Williams. Washington Society Orator George Marvin Warren. Inter-Society Debater Samuel Clay Williams. Magazine Medalist for best Essay James Cook Bardin. Magazine Medalist for best Story Jean Ross Irvine. Magazine Medalist for best Verse James Cook Bardin. Colonial Dames Prize for the best Essay on Virginia Colonial Subject won by Robert Edward Lee Strider. Linden Kent Prizes for best Essay on an unexploited Virginia author won by Weldon Thomas Myers. The University of Virginia Magazine, designed to encourage literary work among the students, is published by the students with the advisory assistance of the Linden Kent Memorial School of English Literature, eight months of the session. Editor-in-Chief for 1908-1909. James Cook Bardin. RELIGIOUS WORK. RELIGIOUS WORK. I. YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION, INCORPORATED. Object.âThe Young Men's Christian Association, founded in 1858, is the largest student organization in the University, and is the oldest student Young Men's Christian Association in existence. It stands for a higher spiritual life among the members, and for united effort to help others in the attempt to live consistent Christian lives. Work.âThe distinctive work of the Association consists in promoting individual study of the Bible and Foreign Missions by means of small classes under student leaders, in maintaining a weekly Prayer-Service, held on Wednesday night at seven-thirty o'clock, in assisting, through some of its members, the work of the Churches and Sunday Schools in the vicinity of the University, in inviting eminent Christian workers to address the students on religious matters, and in promoting social intercourse among the students by means of lectures, entertainments, and other social events. The English Bible.âThe Young Men's Christian Association offers the following courses in Bible Study, open to all students: Studies in the Life of Christ. Studies in the Acts and Epistles. Studies in Old Testament characters. Studies in the Teaching of Jesus and His Apostles. Studies in the Social and Political Teaching of Jesus. These courses, arranged by the International Committee of Young Men's Christian Associations, are intended to form a four years' cycle of study, and are conducted by student leaders. The Y. M. C. A. Equipment.âThrough the munificence of Mrs. William E. Dodge and family, of New York City, the Association possesses one of the handsomest and most conveniently arranged college association buildings in the world, which was recently erected at a cost, including furnishings, etc., of about $75,000. The students, alumni, and friends of the University have subscribed an endowment fund of nearly $20,000 for the maintenance of the property. This building, called "Madison Hall" in honor of President Madison, who was so intimately connected with the early history of the University, faces the north front of the Rotunda. It contains editorial rooms for the college periodicals, game rooms, kitchen, club room, exercise room, elaborate bathing facilities, reception room, RELIGIOUS WORK. reading room, meeting room, parlor, office, writing room, auditorium, guest room, bed rooms for the secretaries, and rooms for the Bible and Missionary departments of the Association. A full equipment of current literature for the reading room, and a library of nearly a thousand volumes of the best religious works and fiction, have been donated by a member of the Dodge family. The tennis courts, nineteen in number, for the use of the students of the University, are on the Association grounds immediately in the rear of the building, and form one of the most beautiful tennis fields in the country. Help for New Students.âThe Association publishes during the last week of August a Handbook of useful information concerning the University and community, and also a detailed report of the religious work of the session. The General Secretary will gladly send either of these publications, or give any further information desired, upon application of any prospective student. New Students are requested to come direct from the trains to Madison Hall, where the Association conducts a general Information Bureau, including a complete boarding house register, a directory of the students, and a list of all forms of employment open to students. The boarding house list, with locations and prices, is not made up till the first week in September. It is suggested that new students arrive a day or two before the session opens, so that they may choose a boarding place for themselves and get well settled before their work begins. All correspondence with regard to rooms in the University dormitories should be directed to the Bursar. Membership.âThe membership of the Association consists of two classes, active and associate; any member of an evangelical church, who wishes to take some part in the work of the Association, may become an active member of the Association; any young man of good moral character may become an associate member. The annual fee is $2.00 for all members, an extra charge being made for the use of the baths and tennis courts. Indorsement.âThe Visitors and the Faculty of the University heartily commend the work of the Association, and it is earnestly desired that every parent or guardian see to it that the student under his care be encouraged to join the Association as soon as he reaches the University. II. CHAPEL SERVICES. The religious services of the University consist of the regular preaching services in the Chapel on Sunday morning and evening, PHYSICAL TRAINING. which are conducted by representative ministers of all evangelical denominations, invited mainly from Virginia and adjacent States. The general oversight of the Christian work is entrusted to the Association Secretary. All the details of this plan, which takes the place of the chaplain system used in former years, are entrusted to a Committee on Religious Exercises composed of five members of the Faculty. The list of the University preachers for the year 1908 is given on page 28. PHYSICAL TRAINING. WILLIAM ALEXANDER LAMBETH, M. D., Ph. D., Director of the Gymnasium. HENRY HADEN LANNIGAN, Associate Director of Athletics. PEYTON MONCURE CHICHESTER, A. B., Instructor in Physical Training. The method of instruction pursued does not adhere blindly to any system, so called. Proper recognition is given to any method the whole or parts of which have been useful or which indicate efficacy; for, however valuable any system may be, it cannot be maintained in its entirety without the consideration of hereditary tendencies, and of individuality in physical possibilities, physical conditions, and physical tastes. The plan of individual training is encouraged in every case, and especially where an examination discloses the student's inability to pursue general or concerted exercises, either from threatened injury or inability to profit by such work. Students, upon entering the University, are entitled, without cost, to a thorough physical examination by the Director. The examination includes an accurate measurement of his physical proportions, a careful examination of the condition and action of the heart and lungs and the strength of the principal muscular groups; at the same time information is solicited concerning his heredity. Upon the basis of the information so gathered instruction will be given as to particular exercises and the use of the various developing appliances, as indicated. The examinations are repeated at intervals, the changes noted and new work suggested, if desirable. In addition to individual work, daily classes are given in light gymnasticsâmarching, figure running, calisthenics, dumb-bells, and clubs, adapted as nearly as possible to individuals of all ages and physical conditions. The exercises are gradual and progressive, commencing with the simplest movements and proceeding to the more complicated and arduous when the more rudimentary forms have been mastered. PHYSICAL TRAINING. During the winter months gymnastics which require great strength and agility are indulged in by those who are fitted for these classes by previous training. This work, of admitted spectacular character (yet having its usefulness), is terminated by an annual gymnastic tournament, usually in the first half of March. The Faculty regulations on athletics require that members of the University athletic teams shall give evidence of satisfactory physical conditions by making the following strength tests when deemed necessary, in addition to the regular physical examination: Members of the football teams are required to make a strength test of 1300 points; members of the baseball team a test of 1100 points. The points are reckoned as follows: The strength of back in pounds, the strength of legs in pounds, strength of chest in pounds, strength of forearms in pounds (pressure), added to one-tenth of the weight (in pounds), multiplied by the number of times the body is lifted by the upper arms. The Fayerweather Gymnasium, the gift of Daniel Fayerweather, of New York, is a handsome and commodious structure on classical lines, situated on the eastern slope of Carr's Hill, overlooking the Athletic Campus. The first floor contains a spacious exercise hall, equipped with the best and most approved developing appliances, as well as apparatus for light and heavy gymnastics, a one-twentieth mile concave-inclined running track, a visitor's gallery, lavatory, trophy-room, and the various offices. The basement floor is concrete throughout and contains the bathsâneedle, shower, spray, tub, and plungeâsupplied with both hot and cold water; bowling alleys, ball-cage, boiler-room, lockers, locker-room, dressing-rooms, and barber shop. The building is heated by a hot water system, ventilated by airshafts, registers, and skylights, and lighted by gas and electricity. The gymnasium is open from 8 a. m. to 7 p. m. every day except Sunday. Attendance is voluntary and free of cost to every regularly matriculated student. Classes are arranged at such hours as not to conflict with other University duties. The Athletic Park contains twenty-one acres, a part of which has been laid out into a driving park, set with trees and hedges, containing the site for the proposed Athletic Clubhouse. Two hundred thousand surface feet have been perfectly graded, drained, and fenced for football, baseball, and track work. This surface was completed at a cost of about ten thousand dollars, and the removal of forty-eight thousand cubic yards of earth. A grand stand and bleacher have been erected, each seating a thousand persons. The work of turfing, protection, and decoration is going steadily on, and will, it is estimated, cost ten thousand dollars more. PHYSICAL TRAINING. ATHLETICS. Games and sports of all kinds are under the special direction of the General Athletic Association, a student organization whose object is to promote this class of physical exercises. The Faculty, by means of its committee on athletics, exercises a general advisory control, endeavoring to foresee and avert dangerous tendencies or excess in physical exercises, while giving to the students, as far as possible, entire liberty of management: a strict limit is placed upon the character of intercollegiate games and the number played away from the University. REGULATIONS OF THE GENERAL FACULTY CONCERNING ATHLETICS. 1. The Faculty Committee on Athletics is intrusted with the general oversight of athletics, and is authorized to forbid any features in these exercises which endanger the health or morals of the participants, and to foster the true spirit of amateur sport among them. 2. No student shall play upon the University athletic teams except after physical examination by the Director of the Gymnasium (or by a responsible expert officer of the University acting in his stead and by his request) and with the approbation of the Director. 3. Only students who act as regular or substitute members of the Athletic teams will be granted leaves of absence to accompany them on trips away from the University, except during vacation and holidays. 4. Special reports may be made to the President from time to time by any minor faculty with respect to the class-standing and progress in study of each regular and substitute player on the athletic teams, and if the President and such faculty are convinced that his class-standing is discreditable, such student may be required to sever his connection with such team. 5. The athletic teams shall not have contests elsewhere than upon the University grounds with any except teams from other institutions of learning. 6. Before any student can become a member or substitute member of any athletic team in the University and take part in any intercollegiate contest, he shall make application in a prescribed form in writing to the Faculty Committee on Athletics, and secure the endorsed approval of the committee to his application. It shall be the duty of the Athletic Committee to have the executive officers of the University endorse such application to the effect that the applicant is an unconditionally registered student of the University. 7. It shall be the duty of the Athletic Committee to inquire into and make a record of the Athletic experiences of the applicant, and it shall be the duty of the applicant to appear before the Committee and answer on his honor such questions as the Committee may see fit to ask. 8. It shall be the duty of the Athletic Committee, before it endorses an application, to require a pledge in writing of the applicant certifying on his honor that he has never accepted directly or indirectly remuneration, compensatory gift, valuable consideration or the promise thereof for or on account of his athletic services, and that he is in the proper and strict sense of the word an amateur athlete. 9. No student who has been a member or a substitute member of a football or baseball team of another college or university shall be permitted to become a member of either team of this University during his first session; but in no case shall such student be eligible for these teams, at this University unless he shall PHYSICAL TRAINING. have been a student here at least five months. The above provision shall also apply to all students who enter this University without entrance certificate or examination.* * This rule goes into effect September, 1908. It does not, however, apply to such students as entered this University under our previous "five months' residence rule." 10. No person whose name appears in the catalogue list of officers of instruction and administration of the University, and who receives remuneration therefrom shall be a member of any athletic team representing the University. 11. It shall be the duty of the President of the Athletic Association, the Executive Committee of that Association, the Manager and the Captain of the team concerned, the Director of the Gymnasium, the Associate Director of Athletics, and the Treasurer of the Association, to furnish, on request, a statement to the effect that each member of an athletic team is above their suspicion as to his eligibility to represent the University as a proper amateur player, before such player shall be allowed to take part in any contest. 12. No "coach," not an alumnus, and no "trainer," not an officer of the University, shall be employed for the purpose of instructing or training any athletic team in this University.â  â  The Faculty Committee on Athletics may permit the employment of coaches other than alumni for a period not exceeding two weeks for any one individual during any one season. But in no case shall such coach be in responsible charge of the team. 13. The Faculty Committee on Athletics is authorized and instructed to establish a maximum period after which a player on a team representing any branch of athletic sport at this or any other University or college shall be ineligible to become a member of any athletic team of this University. 14. The Faculty Committee on Athletics is directed to assume responsible charge of the details of the Athletic situation and to permit the playing of intercollegiate games with such colleges only as express a general conformity with the Code of Rules adopted by this Faculty. 15. The members of any athletic team may be allowed not more than eight days leave of absence from the University for the purpose of engaging in athletic contests; but no student who is a member of more than one athletic team shall be allowed more than sixteen days leave of absence during the entire session for such purpose. REGULATIONS OF FACULTY COMMITTEE ON ATHLETICS. 1. "Training Tables" for football, baseball and track teams are hereby abolished. 2. No student of this University shall be eligible for any athletic team who shall have played upon, or been a member or substitute member of any of the professional or league teams named in Classes A, B, C, and D, in the publication of the American Sports Company. To the list of professional teams thus prescribed shall be added all league teams in any State or States, which the leading University of such State or States declares professional and from which it debars its own players. 3. The term "college" as used in the Faculty Regulations concerning Athletics is hereby interpreted to mean any college named in Table 28 of the Report of the U. S. Commissioner of Education of 1902, which has not less than 150 male students of collegiate grade recorded in the catalogue of the institution in question as students of the session preceding the applicant's entrance into this University. PHYSICAL TRAINING. In case such faculty fails to distinguish between students of collegiate and preparatory grade, the President of the college concerned shall be requested to render or to authorize an official decision of the members belonging to each head. 4. The term "substitute" is interpreted to mean a student who has taken part in an intercollegiate contest. 5. The term "general conformity," as used in the Faculty Regulations, is interpreted to mean conformity in regard to period of residence, maximum period of eligibility and amateur standing. 6. The maximum period of eligibility for baseball and football shall be four years. In estimating the period of eligibility the years of baseball and football shall both be taken into account; but in no case shall a player be charged with four years' athletic work, unless at least four calendar years have elapsed from the time he entered upon his first intercollegiate contest, omitting from the calculation any sessional intermission by non-attendance. In case the player does not participate in either baseball or football during a college session, such session shall not be counted, but if such player does play on either the baseball or the football team during any intermediate session, this shall count as if the player had played on both teams during such session. College Topics is a weekly newspaper, published under the auspices of the General Athletic Association, devoted to the interests of Athletics and the University at large. Editor-in-Chief for 1908-1909. George Boardman Eager, Jr. THE COLONNADE CLUB. THE COLONNADE CLUB. Incorporated in October, 1907, under a Perpetual Charter granted by the State of Virginia, the Colonnade Club occupies Pavilion VII., West Lawnâthe interior having been suitably and tastefully remodeled for the Club, and comprising assembly, reading, chess, sleeping, pool, billiard and bath rooms. The Resident Members, about 88 in number, include all the administrative officers and nearly all the Faculty and Teaching Staff, together with a number of local alumni and friends of the University. Through the dues paid by them the Club is amply self-sustaining for all purely local purposes. There are 4 honorary Members, in addition to the (ex-officio) members of the University Board of Visitors and the Trustees of the Miller Fund. One of the Club's most notable features is now its rapidly growing list of Non-Resident Members. Just as the Club's founders intend that it shall be an attractive place for local social intercourse, they earnestly desire that it shall become the recognized center of the alumni-life of the Universityâa center at which the returning alumnus can always feel himself thoroughly at home, thus inducing him frequently to revisit the old college-haunts. For these visits, as well as for the Reunions of Alumni Associations, Graduate Classes, etc., the Club's hospitalities are cordially offered. Its founders believe that it is the mission of this Club to help thousands of the University's widely scattered sons to keep in closer touch with their Alma Mater and with each other than would otherwise be possible. The earliest accessions were in May, 1908, no active steps looking toward enlargement having been taken until the September following. At this writing (January 1, 1909) there are about 210 Non-Resident Members. The warm welcome this movement is receiving is well attested by the fact that this branch already includes representative names in 30 States. The Club's founders believe that this list will in time include a substantial proportion of the University's Alumni. It is with this end in view that the very low rate of dues fixed for non-resident membership (namely, $4 a year) was decided upon. Designed as a means by which Alumni and other non-residents might specially evidence their hearty cooperation, it is hoped that the Club's class of Life Membership will commend itself to many friends of the University. Rate, $100; no other fee or dues. GENERAL ALUMNI ASSOCIATION. The Officers of the Club are: Thomas W. Page, President; R. Marshall Price, Secretary-Treasurer. The members of the Board of Governors are: Thomas W. Page, Richard Heath Dabney, Wm. M. Thornton, Armistead M. Dobie, Stephen H. Watts, Wm. Minor Lile, L. Bruce Moore. GENERAL ALUMNI ASSOCIATION.
