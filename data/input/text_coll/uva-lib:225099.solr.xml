      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I.—A THE BROTHERS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 2 ADVERTISEMENT. A PORTION of the work now submitted to the public may probably be recognised as having been before them in a somewhat different form—several of the earlier chapters having been originally published in the pages of the American Monthly Magazine. For reasons with which it is unnecessary to trouble the world, the publication of The Brothers in monthly parts was discontinued; and it is, he fears, rather through the partiality of his friends, than through the sobriety of their judgment, that the author has been induced to unite these passages into a connected form, for the purpose of submitting them, with their sequel and conclusion, to that ordeal which must decide whether their existence shall continue beyond the hour in which they see the light. New-York, June 10th, 1835.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO COLONEL JOHN TRUMBULL, OF THE ARMY OF THE REVOLUTION. To one of his most esteemed friends, than whom, he is alike proud and thankful to say, he has found none more valuable, or more true—as a slight, but not, he trusts, impertinent token of his sincere veneration and most warm gratitude—this book is dedicated by the author; with a deep sense, that, should it elsewhere meet so favourable a reception as it is like to do from him to whom it is now tendered, it will scarcely be indebted less to the indulgence of the public, than he is himself to the friendship of the individual. New-York, June 10, 1835.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION. “Myself— Have stooped my neck under your injuries, And sighed my English breath in foreign clouds, Eating the bitter bread of banishment: While you have fed upon my seignories, Disparked my parks, and felled my forest woods; From my own windows torn my household coat, Rased out my impress, leaving me no sign,— Save men's opinions and my living blood,— To show the world I am a gentleman.” King Richard II. It has been a day of storm and darkness—the morning dawned upon the mustering of the elements—vast towering clouds rose mass upon mass, stratum above stratum, till the whole horizon was over-canopied. Then there was a stern and breathless pause, as if the tempest-demon were collecting his energies in silent resolution; anon its own internal weight appeared to rend the vaporous shroud asunder, and the big rain poured down in torrents. At moments, indeed, the sunbeams have struggled through the driving rack, and darted down their pensiles of soft light, showing even more blithely golden than their wont, from the very contrast of the surrounding gloom. Still—noon arrived, and there was no cessation of the strife. At that hour, the blue lightning was splitting the tortured clouds in twain, and the thunder roaring and crashing close above our heads. The melancholy wailing of the winds among the sculptured pinnacles and ivyed turrets of our Elizabethan mansion—the sobbing and creaking of the immemorial oak-trees, their huge branches wrestling with the gale—the dashing and pattering of the heavy rain—and, deeper and more melancholy than all, the gradually increasing moan of the distant river, have conspired all day long to cast a gloom alike upon the face of nature and the heart of man. Yet now evening has brought back peace, and calm delicious sunshine. I sit beside my open casement, and the fresh odour of the drenched herbage rises refreshingly to my senses—the west is clear and beautifully blue—the broad sun sinking slowly below the horizon, cloudless, indeed, but veiled in that soft haze, which enables me to gaze upon his glories with undazzled delight. Towards the east the heavy clouds are rolling away, their edges touched so sweetly by the last rays of the declining day-god that it is hardly possible to conceive them—as they seemed a few short hours ago —the harbingers of desolation and dismay. The very rain-drops sparkle like diamonds on every blade of grass, on every leaf of those old oaks, which smile as tranquilly in the glow of this soft evening as though they had never borne and shuddered beneath the weight of the tempest—there is a mute voice of rejoicing breathed up from all around me—thousands of summer flies are on the wing— the rooks are wheeling on their balanced pinions high up in the breezeless air—the deer have come forth from the tangled coverts wherein they cowered during the tempest, and are grazing in picturesque groups in all directions—the clustered woodbines, twining over every coigne and buttress, smell wooingly—it is an evening of fragrant loveliness. Such has been the picture of my own career. My youth and manhood have been spent in domestic feuds and foreign warfare, in banishment, hardship, bloodshed, sorrow—my declining years are flowing away in peace, tranquillity, and happiness. I know not how it is, nor wherefore, but my thoughts have been cast backward towards the eventful past more strongly during this morning than at any previous period in the course of many years. I have lived in a singular and most important age; an age which will, I believe, hereafter date as an era—which will be a precedent for future centuries—the seed of a harvest that shall be reaped hereafter. In almost every region of the earth there have been strange commotions—a new spirit seems to have gone forth among the people—a thinking, questioning, resisting spirit. I have seen a king—a mild and, in the main, a well-intentioned king—dragged down from the throne of his ancestors—haled, like the vilest of criminals, to the ignominious scaffold, for the mere upholding of that dignity, and asserting that prerogative, which, a hundred years ago, a man would have been considered frantic to have called in question. I have seen the people triumph by the mere force of popular opinion, and by the steadiness of their united efforts, over the bravest, the wealthiest, the most enlightened aristocracy of the universe. I have seen liberty degenerate into license; and despotism—as it has at some time done in every age and every country—spring up, VOL. I.—B the very consequence of that same license. I have seen a puissant people break all the bonds of civil and political society, with the avowed intention of shaking off an oppressive government. I have seen them plunge into the maddest anarchy, till, sickened and wearied out with the abuse of that very freedom for which they had so greatly done and suffered, they have themselves called forth an iron despot from their own peculiar ranks —have erected over themselves a power ten thousand times more absolute—ten thousand times more galling, than that which they had previously cast down. I have seen a man—a man of the people—of the despised and trampled people—set himself upon a par with the mightiest potentates of his age. I have seen a usurper raise my native country to a situation, to a pre-eminence among the nations of the world, such as she never occupied before, no, not in the days of the greatest of her legitimate sovereigns. I have seen his unassisted wisdom defeat the deep diplomacy of the most crafty statesmen; I have seen the navies of Spain and Holland humbled before his all-victorious banner. I have seen monarchs courting the alliance of one who was, a few brief years before, a by-word and a laughing-stock to our bold cavaliers. All this have I seen, and more—all this have I seen in my own native England; and though I strove against the elevation of that wondrous being with the whole energies of my mind and body; though I was an exile from the land of my fathers during the plenitude of his power; though I have subsequently seen the restoration of the ancient dynasty, and with it have recovered my patrimonial possessions—I faithfully confess my own conviction that Cromwell was—ay! and will be considered—the mightiest of usurpers, and the most wise of conquerors. I believe that his enlightened policy will be resumed hereafter; I believe that the harvest he has sowed will be reaped and garnered by our sons, and our sons' sons; I believe that the spirit which he has set afloat will go on increasing from hour to hour— will go on working, whether for good or for evil I know not, for centuries yet to come; I believe that it will give brith to revolutions such as our fathers have never dreamed of, such as ourselves have never witnessed; I believe, even now, that convulsions are at hand, greater in their result than those in which it has been my lot to play no humble part, and which shall themselves but pave the way for greater that shall follow; I believe that the ages of legitimacy have already passed from earth; and when I look upon the madness, the baseness, the loathsome sensuality, the frantic ingratitude of present rulers, I could almost rejoice in the belief— did I not foresee the wreck of many a noble institution—did I not foresee the fall of much that is venerable, much that is in itself good—did I not foresee that the march will be still onward—onward— till reform shall have degenerated into revolution— till the pruning away of excrescences shall have led to the uprooting of the tree—till the mania for freedom shall have become a mania for change— and that of change for abolition. I look upon the present peace, the present gleam of national repose and welfare, but as a brief precarious truce, originating from the mere necessity of taking breath. We have already witnessed how the triumph of the popular faction, and the establishment of a self-styled republic in Britain, gave birth to the assertion of equal rights, to popular excitement, and to civil war in the neighbouring realm of France; and though, for a time, the flame of popular spirit hath in this country, as it were, burnt itself out, and so perished for the lack of sustenance—while on the other side of the Channel it hath been extinguished by the still powerful hand of the nobility—I yet believe that the suppression hath been but for the moment; and that it will again burst forth with a broad and all-pervading radiance. It is my firm conviction that the order of things which has been, never will be again!—that the events which in my youth were hourly taking place as familiar things, not only never will take place again, but, in the lapse of a single century, will be either utterly forgotten, or, if recorded, be looked upon as wild and extravagant, almost as impossible fictions. It is this conviction which has now determined me to revise some papers, on which I stumbled accidentally, as it were, this morning; relating to events which—while they have been altogether the most important of my own life—possess so much of what even now, in the comparatively settled state of affairs throughout the world, appears wild and marvellous, that I cannot but feel certain, that to remote posterity they will bear the semblance of things wholly out of the course of society, and may, therefore, if preserved, convey to them much information, and some entertainment. The events in my own life, to which I have already alluded, are so intimately connected with the history of France during the period at which they occurred, and the account of them seems to me to furnish so admirable a commentary on the state of things as they then were, that I have determined, before giving them to the public—which B 2 it is my intention to do precisely as the journal in which they are imbodied was written at the time— to preface them by a slight sketch of the situation of that country in which alone they could have happened. It will be of course borne in mind that the triumph of free principles in England—although it had ended in the elevation of a despot to the throne—had, nevertheless, been in itself complete; and although the powers that were in France had looked on for the most part in apathy, or, perhaps, in sympathy with the misfortunes of Charles, there can be no manner of doubt but the people received encouragement to make an effort for the establishment of such a constitution as might preserve to them the liberties to which they now for the first time began to consider themselves entitled. The weakness of the hands in which government was vested; the debility of the aristocracy, which, during the long reign of Louis XIII., had been humbled to the very dust by the iron policy of Richelieu; their want of union among themselves, which prevented the possibility of their either rallying in a mass to the defence of the throne, or of their successfully resisting the attacks designed against their own body; the youth and consequent long minority of the king; the infatuation of the queen-regent, Anne of Austria, for the feeble yet crafty successor of the stern Richelieu; the poverty of the country; the exhaustion of the treasury, through the constantly recurring expenses of the Spanish War; the heavy taxes levied, now on the office-holders, now on the people at large; and, above all, the bitter hatred which was almost universally entertained against Mazarin, operating more than all the rest to divide and distract parties —all conspired to render the moment in the highest degree favourable to an attempt which would probably have taken place long before, had it not been that the preceding minister had been no less ready to defend than willing to execute to the utmost his despotic powers—that his talents were inferior only to his ambition, and his ambition—when his passions or his fears were once fairly excited—to his cruelty. The immediate cause of the popular outbreak, which in our days received its denomination of the Fronde—from the mimic warfare of children about the streets, who would occasionally resist the police sent to disperse them with slings and stones—was the attempt to impose a tax upon all the sovereign courts of judicature throughout the realm, the Parliament alone excepted. These bodies, composed of the most distinguished jurists of the day, at once passed the celebrated Edict of Union; under which, all those who hated the cardinal, whether from public disaffection or from private pique, from self-interest or patriotic feelings, banded themselves at once. After many fruitless negotiations between the court and the Parliament, which only served to render the intriguing parties more desperately hostile to each other, both parties took up arms nearly simultaneously: a bourgeois guard was organized; the streets of Paris were barricaded; the Archbishop coadjutor of Paris De Retz raised a large force of cavalry at his own private expense; and the armies thus levied were intrusted at once to the command of some score of exceedingly clever, but no less profligate, nobles, who had, moreover, no feelings in common with the mass of their party, save hatred to Mazarin—a passion which was always ready to give place to aught that might further their own self-advancement. The Dukes of Elbeuf and Beaufort, Monsieur de Bouillon, and the celebrated Rochefoucault were on the instant openly and actively engaged on the popular side; while Turenne was more than suspected of an intention to bring up the army—with which he had first foiled, and then defeated, the brave De Merci on the Rhine —to the aid of the Frondeurs. On the other side, the Prince de Condé and the Duke of Orleans were appointed leaders; multitudes of the young and profligate noblesse, who, during the administration of Mazarin's predecessor, had been excluded from all power of intriguing for or against the government, rushed forward with all that mad levity which constituted the national character of France. To this it was that I attribute the success of the court faction: the people, doubtful of their own power—sufficient, by-the-way, to overturn a stronger government than that of Mazarin— united the nobles to their cause, who fought for them, as they intrigued for themselves, vigorously enough, till some new caprice, some fresh amour, or some hope of advancement, caused them to desert their party, and go over at once by scores at a time to the opposite faction. This levity, this utter want of principle, this vacillation of purpose among the leaders—not one of whom, by-the-way, is free from the charge of repeated acts of treachery to his party—tended not only to weaken the popular party, but finally to render the bourgeoisy, with whom the spirit of rebellion in the first place originated, so weary of a war by which they speedily found that they were gaining nothing, while they were suffering extremities, that they finally suffered it to cease, as it were, by common consent of all engaged. For aught I know, it is the only rebellion which ever extinguished itself, which died of exhaustion, unsuppressed by its political antagonists, and unpunished, when all was over, by its political conquerors. This tergiversation it is, also, that will hereafter tend to render the annals of the Fronde a mass of inextricable confusion; and which can hardly fail to place obstacles of the greatest weight in the way of future historians. There is no one prominent character among the principal actors—Molè, the president of the Parliament, alone excepted— who did not repeatedly turn sides, as interest or humour prompted him; and the slightest pretext was held cause enough for defection from the banners of either faction! The promise of favours from a vain and capricious beauty; the hope of a higher station—of the government of a petty town, or of the command of a regiment; the most trivial disgust at any others of his party, were enough to overturn all scruples of honour, consistency, or principle, even in the bosoms of such men as Hocquincourt, Turenne, and Condé. Historians, for the most part, err in attributing great popular movements, great political results, to individual leaders, overlooking entirely the will and action of the great masses, on which, in truth, the conduct and bias of the leaders must generally depend. In this strange rebellion the people were in earnest—the leaders in sport: the people were striving for liberty, from an ardent thirst for freedom in the abstract, from a desire to ameliorate their present condition, and to establish government on sound and popular principles; the leaders were striving, as I have said before, in very levity of heart, from the mere desire of action and momentary importance, or at best from the lust of personal aggrandizement. To this, then, I ascribe the fact that the people were overthrown; and to this I am willing to assign, by anticipation, the failure of all those who shall hereafter strive to reconcile the strange confusion of this wild rebellion to any of the ordinary standards of principles and actions, causes and effects. Since my restoration to my own country--from which I was a weary exile for many a long year, fighting, like my betters, for my own hand, and perhaps also from a mistaken predilection for the royalist party, which had been not a little strengthened by the unfortunate termination of our English civil wars, and by the mad abuses there consequent upon the triumph of the populace--since my restoration to my own country, I have heard actual spectators of the commotions of the Fronde term it[1] [1] The date affixed to this preliminary chapter, and the internal evidence, contained in the whole work, that the writer was deeply engaged in the conflicts which he describes, go far to prove that the great historian Hume, in falling into the same mode of expression, must have plagiarised some older writer. “a rebellion unennobled by the spirit of liberty;” and actually turn it into a jest, as a trivial senseless uproar, excited by men of ambition and women of light character, begun in levity, and prosecuted to satiety. I, on the contrary, feel certain that I can see in its blind and undigested movements the working of a spirit which will one day shake the world; which will place it beyond the power of ministers or princes to sway public opinion like a wind-waved reed; which is even now working onward, in my own country, towards a mighty revolution, provoked by the insanity of the monarchs who, taking no lesson from the fate of their fathers, are rushing headlong to their own destruction; and which will one day, unless I err more wildly than I can easily believe, pervade the whole of Europe. But enough has been said already to give a slight clew to the reader of the following pages, by which he may find his way through the mazes of this almost forgotten period. The ensuing chapters were written immediately after the occurrence of the events to which they relate—many of them almost contemporaneously. The only judgment I can form of the influence they may exercise on the minds of others, is from that which they possess on my own. From having perused them this morning—distant as is their date, and widely as I feel my own character to have been changed in the interim—I have returned, as it were, to the very days of my prime— the actors are before my eyes—I can hear their voices—I can read their countenances. It is for this reason that I am unwilling to change a word, even for the improvement of the style: much of the language is even now becoming antiquated; and, ere mysons shall be of age to read them, will probably be obsolete. There is, nevertheless, a life in its very roughness, which I am loath to alter, fearing lest, by over-polishing the blade, I may wear away a something of its sterling metal: as it is, I commit it to the hands of posterity; only reminding those who may perchance take it up to kill a heavy hour, that the writer was one in his day more ready with the sword than the pen, and that to him the camp and the court-martial stood in the lieu of schools or académe.

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. “His breast with wounds unnumbered riven, His back to earth, his face to heaven, Fall'n Hassan lies—his unclosed eye Yet lowering on his enemy, As if the hour that sealed his fate Surviving left his quenchless hate; And o'er him bends that foe, with brow As dark as his that bled below.” The Giaour. The morning lacked a full hour of the time when the cold sun of January should pour its faint rays, as if in mockery, over the chilled and cheerless world, which at that season of the year they can neither fertilize nor beautify. A thick raw mist was drawn like a curtain over the universal face of nature; the skies looked blank and dismal; there was not a cloud of darker hue, not a speck of light, however pale, to relieve the solid wall of dull gray fog, which limited the view to a dozen feet around me. The air was piercingly cold, though perfectly breezeless; and it froze so keenly that the sharp ringing sound of my horse's feet on the hard soil might have been heard at a mile's distance; while the moisture of the atmosphere hung in wreaths of hoary rime, not only on my cloak and charger's mane, but on my eyebrows, and on the floating locks which, at the period I speak of, were cultivated with peculiar care as the distinctive marks of gentle blood. Indeed, so bitter was the morning, and so dreary the prospect that lay before me, that I almost blamed myself for having quitted the cabin in which I had passed the preceding night, although the motives for my expedition were in the highest degree pressing and important. What those motives were,—employed as I now am in the relation of an event which, bearing in no single point upon any portion of my past time, produced effects the most striking on my after-life,—I am not at present inclined to relate; nor is it probable that my readers would find much either of profit or of pleasure in the perusal of occurrences so intimately connected with facts, which have already become history, as to baffle all attempts at unravelling them from the skein in which their humble thread is blended. Suffice it to say, I am an Englishman; by birth noble, and by education, association, or prejudice if you will, a cavalier. Yes!—with my eyes fully open to the danger and iniquity of those arbitrary doctrines, whether of church or state, which had filled the green homes of my native land with misery and with blood,—perfectly conscious of the inability of the king to be a governor of freeborn men,—I had yet drawn my sword in every skirmish from the first unfolding of the banners of rebellion to the final triumph of the commonwealth on the scaffold of Whitehall. An ardent adorer of freedom in the abstract, I had lent all the energies of my mind, all the powers of my arm, to establish a tyranny which, at a later period of my life, I should probably with equal zeal have striven to overthrow. Dazzled by the influences of those splendid associations, by that almost religious veneration for ancient institutions, merely because they are ancient, and by that false glare of nobility, of accomplishment, and of chivalrous honour, which served to conceal the injustice of the royal cause behind a halo no less delusive than it was brilliant, I had surrendered my mind to the romantic rather than to the rational. The cry of patriotism was no less alive in the mouths of one than of the other party; and if liberty were the magic sound which swelled the chorus of the victors, there were still many among the vanquished to whom the shout of loyalty appeared to “become the mouth as well.” Thus was it then with me; I had fared hardly, fought hardly, and gained small reward save hard blows. I had not, it is true, served through the desperate fights of Naseby and Long Marston without acquiring some reputation, which, if it were not so bright as that of Capel, Rupert, or Goring, was at the least sufficient to obtain for me the appellation of an arch-malignant, and a fair proportion of the enmity of that singular being who, assuredly, at some future day, when the clouds of party prejudice, of envy, and of detraction shall have been dispersed, will be esteemed the greatest man that ever raised himself to a throne. Still, as the party to which I had attached myself had sunk, as it would seem, for many a year, it would, perhaps, have been better for me to possess no character whatever for bravery or talent, than to be notorious as one of the most constant, if not of the most distinguished, adherents of the fallen dynasty. When all was over, and it was evident to men that the star of Cromwell was in the ascendant, and that of the Stuarts obscured, perhaps, for ever,—when my master had expiated his crooked counsels with his blood, and his son had preserved himself from a C 2 similar fate only by a rapid flight,—I found myself so situated, that I had but the choice of dying to no purpose for a lost cause, or of leaving the land of my ancestors till times should prove more favourable. To be brief, I made good my escape to France; and ere long, in default of better occupation, I found myself again in arms, under the direction and patronage of no less a man than the celebrated Mazarin, in whose service I was acting when I encountered the adventures which it is now my purpose to recite. It was in vain that I endeavoured to banish my recollection of the pinching cold, by indulging in bright reveries of a glorious and happy future; it was in vain that I strove to animate my flagging spirits by anticipating the stirring scenes in which I expected ere long to be engaged, or by picturing to myself the manner in which it would become me to act in this or that emergency; it was in vain that I whistled or hummed some bacchanal or martial tune;—the dulness of the time oppressed me; my mind had assimilated itself, as it were, to the colouring of surrounding objects, and I felt as miserable as though I were about to ascend that scaffold, which had terminated the carrer of so many of my brave companions. Yet it could not be the weather only that had cast so deep a gloom over a spirit naturally buoyant and excitable;—many a day had I mounted guard in back and breast-piece, when the frost was so keen that it would have been scarcely less painful to grasp the barrel of my musketoon with ungloved hand than to touch a bar fresh glowing from the furnace;—many a day had I ridden from dawn to dusk in soaking rain, and after grooming my jaded horse, though chill and famished, jested and laughed as merrily as the most jovial ruffler of a court. But now it seemed as if there were a vast black shadow covering, as with a mighty wing, the whole horizon of my mind. I felt as though I were abandoned by the world, surrendered to sure destruction, devoted, doomed,—yet, at the same time, I had no care, no anxiety, no excitement. I, who in times of peril have felt the fiery blood dancing through my veins with the eagerness, the rapture of the strife,—I, the enthusiastic, reckless soldier, should have entered the fray, had a cause for fray occurred, in dogged, sullen, calm desperation. Thus had I ridden onward for some miles, when the gradual brightening of the atmosphere, not in any one quarter of the heavens, but all over the firmament, gave token, not that the fog was about to melt away, but that the hours of night were ended. My road lay over a vast unbroken plain, without an ascent to scale, or a valley to descend, for miles on miles; the highway stretched, as it were, into interminable distance, bounded on either side by rows of that to me most dismal and monotonous of trees—the poplar. The misty state of the morning cut off all view beyond these limits; but it was evident that, had the eye been at liberty to roam over the landscape, there would have been little either of variety or beauty in the view. I had already passed through several extensive tracts of woodland, which bore, however, no resemblance to the lovely woods of my own England, with their bosky dells and open glades, their gnarled oaks and silvery birches, gleaming out from the dark hollies and waving fern; in these forests of France, all is monotonous, tame, and regular. A long straight vista, sweeping right onward through ranks of trees, undistinguished by their individual magnitude, and unbroken by dewy lawn or brooklet,— an occasional carrèfour, or point of union to several avenues, each as perfect in resemblance to the other as Will Shakspeare's kings of Banquo, with a broken cross or defaced guide-post in the centre, presenting a picture of desolation and dreary sameness, which I am at a loss for words to describe, composed the eternal scene. I had ridden thus, as I have said, for miles; not a human being had crossed my eyes, not a human dwelling had I passed,—even the rude huts of the charcoal burners, which are in general to be met with at brief intervals in the taillis, which constitute the greater proportion of the French woodlands, were wanting. Nay, more, not a deer or rabbit had hurried athwart my path, not a chirrup had I heard from bird or insect. It seemed as if I were passing through a country buried in profound midnight slumber; the constant clack of my charger's hoofs on the frozen road, waking the echoes as we passed along, had grown so wearisome to my ear, that I should have welcomed a thunder-clap for its variety. Suddenly my horse pricked up his ears, and though I could hear no sound, whinnied repeatedly, and at length, quickening his pace, gave vent to his impatience in long shrill neighings. Once or twice, it is true, I fancied that an answering neigh was borne to my ears from the remote distance; but if it were so, the sounds were so faint that they might have passed for an echo. Nevertheless, though little confident in the truth of what I had heard or imagined, I suffered Bayard to continue the more rapid trot into which he had struck at the time of his first uneasiness. After proceeding thus about a mile, the full ringing report of a shot came down the road, and ere I could strike my spurs into the horse's side, another and another, followed, or rather accompanied, by the most fearful screams I ever remember to have heard. They were not thee ries of terror, nor of pain, but of the most wild and horror-stricken phrensy. Peal upon peal, volume upon volume, they rang through my brain, till my blood positively curdled in my veins, and I felt the cold creeping over my head with a sensation as though every hair were standing erect, “like quills upon the fretful porcupine.” The terror which came upon me—for terror it was—was not of the body, but of the soul. Not a second, nor the hundredth part of a second, did I pause;—my rapier loosened in its scabbard, its hilt brought forward in readiness for my grasp, a long pistol in my right hand, and my reins gathered firmly in my left, I dashed along the causeway at a pace which must in a few minutes have brought me up to any thing not winged; for out of hundreds that I have backed, never did I bestride a beast to match in speed, or blood, or bottom, with that brave horse. Notwithstanding the rate, however, at which I dashed along the forest road, such was the unusual distance at which the sounds had reached my ear,—owing, doubtless, to the peculiar state of the atmosphere, no less than to the almost unnatural silence of the country,—that more minutes had elapsed, than I had counted upon seconds, before I reached the scene of the affray. The spectacle that met my eyes—the mist having yielded in a considerable degree to the increasing power of the sunlight—was, perhaps, even more singular than terrible, although its horrors were sufficient to have struck a chill to the heart of one less used than I had been to scenes of rapine and of bloodshed. A travelling-carriage, one of the huge and cumbrous vehicles of the age, lay in the centre of the carrèfour, evidently overset by the struggles of the affrighted brutes, one of which was stretched out motionless,—unless the fitful quivering of his limbs, fast draining of their life-blood, might be termed motion,—while the others kicked, flung, and screamed in all the wild confusion of vice and terror. A little way in the rear of the carriage lay the driver, slain by the passage of a bullet, which had shattered his head almost to atoms with its ghastly wound. His death must have been instantaneous; but had it not been so, the ponderous wheels, both of which had passed over his body from hip to shoulder severing it almost in sunder, would have been sufficient to divorce the spirit from a giant's trunk. The door of the carriage, forced from within, stood open, and a dark-coloured fluid trickling through the aperture, proved that even more of horror had been wrought than met the eye. It must not be supposed that all which I have here endeavoured to portray, met my eyes in the fearful excitement of that first moment. My quick glance fell upon two men engaged in mortal conflict. Many a time, before and since, have I witnessed the strife of men in every different aspect; on the tented field, “i' the imminent deadly breach,” in single duel, or in confused mêleé; but never—never did I see such deadly hate glare from the eyes of human beings,—such desperate contempt of life—such fierce determination to kill,—as manifested themselves in every look, in every motion, of those two combatants. I had leisure enough to mark them well; for my horse, having almost trampled on the body of the slaughtered servant, swerved so wildly from the carcass,—though he had borne me without a start or stumble over scores, ay, hundreds, in many a pitched field,—and strove so fiercely against the spur and rein, as I endeavoured again to bring him up, that wellnigh a minute had elapsed ere I could reach the spot. They were both in the prime of life,—strong, finely formed, and active; and, even before I could distinguish their features, I had been powerfully impressed by the striking similarity of their forms and general appearance. One seemed perhaps some six years older than the other; but neither did his activity seem so far impaired, or his strength increased, by the difference, as to render him an unequal match for his antagonist. At a glance I perceived that they were gentlemen, and that too of no ordinary rank or station; not by their dresses, indeed, for it seemed that—whether for purposes of disguise, or for some other motive—their habits were below, rather than above, their situation in life; but by the contour of their heads, the flowing and soft hair that floated down their necks, the smallness of their hands, and above all the general grace and dignity of person, which are as certain tokens of nobility in man as are the clean limbs, flashing eye, expanded nostril, and full vein signs of blood in the—I had well-nigh said—more noble animal which man so frequently debases to be the minister of his crimes, the instrument of his passions. There they stood, hand to hand, and foot to foot, glaring in each other's faces with an expression of fiendish malignity,—stamping, lunging, springing to and fro, their long bright rapiers flashing at VOL. I.—D every thrust—each, as it seemed, wholly indifferent whether he lived or died himself, so he should slay before he fell. Darting from my horse, I rushed towards them blade in hand with the intent of mastering their weapons; but such was the rapidity and fury of their fencing, that, as I perceived at once, there was more probability of interference on my part accelerating than preventing a fatal result. With two swordsmen nearly equal, and such it was manifest were these, the risk is so great of disconcerting the guard of one, without materially deranging the thrust of the other, that, after a moment's reflection, I judged it wiser to attempt no interruption of their deadly pastime, until weariness or want of breath should render my object more easily attainable. Nor did I much doubt but that this would briefly be the case; for more perfect masters of the fence never crossed blades than those whom I then, for the first time, beheld. I stood beside them, with my rapier ready at a glance's warning to interpose, adjuring them from time to time to cease, if it were only to explain the cause of their encounter; but they heeded me no more than did the leafless trunks which stood around them in the glittering garb of winter. Indeed, I doubt whether either of the two was conscious of my presence. Once I looked around me, in search of some one from whom to learn the meaning of this fearful sight; but, save the murdered groom and a confused heap within the vehicle, which scarcely showed the outlines of a human form, not a creature was in sight. Burning, as in truth I was, to explore the secrets of that charnel-carriage, I could not tear myself away from the wild interest of the strife before me; the rather that, from a vague and undefinable likeness in the features of that pair, so desperately pitted together, I could not but fancy some dread domestic tragedy to be in process. The younger, indeed, of the combatants, was blue-eyed and fair complexioned; while his floating love-locks might have been easily mistaken for the golden ringlets of a girl. The elder was swarthy-skinned, black-eyed, and raven-haired; yet there was a resemblance in the massive breadth of the foreheads, in the curl of the lips, in the flash of the eyes, which at one moment amounted to conviction of their kindred blood, while at the next instant it seemed but a vague and foolish fancy. The swords of both were already dimmed with blood, but not enough had flowed to impede their motions, or to check their animosity. Their wounds had been felt, but, as the spur by the mettled horse, to urge them to renewed exertion. Their breathings came thick—they panted, almost sobbed—their lips frothed with the violence of their struggles—their thrusts were looser and more wild, their parries less deliberate. The moment had arrived when I might hope for success in parting them; my foot was already between them—my blade had all but crossed their rapiers,—when the younger, stumbling in a furious lunge, received the weapon of the other in the muscles of his shoulder; the point came out behind his back; but ere his adversary could disengage it to repeat the blow, he had grasped it by the net-work of the guard, and running up it, like a wounded boar, drove his own sword hilt-deep into the bosom of his foe. Quick as lightning I sprang back. I perceived it was too late. I might have given an undue advantage to the one; I could not rescue either. The dark-browed combatant fell back without a word or groan; but the blood flashing from his deep wound, like water from a pump, as his convulsed bosom rose and fell, and his eye, still fixed upon the visage of his slayer in unquenched, unblenching hatred, showed that the spirit was yet alive within him. The other, who had staggered back for an instant, and dropped his weapon in the struggle, now tore the rapier from his own pierced breast, and leaping forward, with a yell more like the cry of a maimed tiger than the voice of a human being, planted his foot upon the chest of his foe, and gazed into his eyes as though he would have perused his very soul. “What, no remorse!” he cried; “no terror—no despair! With your own weapon, cursed, murtherous dog! With your own weapon!”— The spasmodic action of his throat cut short his words, but the point glanced downwards towards the heart of the fallen man. An inch was not between the weapon and its living sheath, when by a desperate parry, I struck it up—the maniac rage of the victor was turned at once on me, but little did I reck his anger. I was too calm, and he too furious, even had he been my equal in strength or vigour. But the blood, which gushed from three wide gashes, was beginning at length to tell; his thrusts, though well directed, were feeble; and at the third pass, binding his blade with mine, I sent it, by a single motion of my wrist, twinkling like a meteor through the haze. The shock, which disarmed him, completed his exhaustion. He made one effort more to dash his heel into the features of his foeman, who lay, as he had fallen, with the frown on his brow, the distorted smile on his lip, and the deadly glare of his glazed eye fixed for ever; but, slipping in the effort, he fell beside the D 2 dead, the blood from their wounds actually mingling as they lay. “Dead!” he muttered, “dead—Isabel, where art thou?—Isabel!—beloved!” His head sank down upon the gored breast of him he had destroyed. I thought the life had left him, but I was in error. With a wild cry he sprang into the air. “Brother,” he shrieked, “brother, we shall meet in hell!” He fell upon his victim, a dead man ere he struck the ground. I have seen sights of horror a thousand and a thousand times,—on the field, on the scaffold, in fire, and on the sea,—but never did I know the meaning of the word FEAR till then. I shook like a weak infant, my sword dropped from my hand, a humming was in my ears, my eyes swam, my senses wandered! I stood gazing in motionless awe upon the kindred corpses. Fearful self-accusation rose up against me. I had witnessed—I had permitted—I had, in not prohibiting, abetted that most hideous and unnatural slaughter. My brain reeled. I was on the point of falling. A sudden stir behind me—a quick rustle as of garments—a step—and the same wild shriek, which had caught my attention while at a distance, roused me from my stupor. I turned, and there,—her delicate feet slipping in the gore, that had already frozen as it flowed from the veins of that guilty, miserable pair—her long fair tresses stained with blood, and her white garments dabbled with the same fatal stains,—there stood the loveliest female form—the loveliest even in that moment of heart-rending agony and terror—my eyes had ever dwelt upon. “Dead!” she cried; “all dead! Merciful! merciful Heaven! Spare, spare my senses!” She started in my face with a vacant gaze for a moment, shook her head mournfully, and with a wild sound between laughter and a groan, would have fallen to the earth, had I not caught her in my arms. The fearful scenes which she had undergone had been too much for her delicate intellects; madness was hovering at the very portals of her mind, when, by a blessed providence, that timely swoon preserved her. One glance into the empty carriage,—it contained the corpse of a young girl! By her garb I judged her to be the attendant of the lovely being pillowed insensibly upon my heart,—killed, as it seemed, by a random bullet; for who could have wantonly shed the blood of one so insignificant, so harmless, and so helpless? One glance towards the slaughtered brothers, sleeping side by side as peaceably as though no angry passions, no unearthly hate had ever cast its shadow over them!—and, with my precious treasure in my arms, I was again upon the back of my brave Bayard, riding for life, for life, along the road which late had seemed so dull and dreary, now converted into the channel which I felt must guide me to the harbour of my future happiness, or to the eternal shipwreck of my hopes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. “ `She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush, and scaur; They'll have fleet steeds that follow,' quoth young Lochinvar. There was mounting 'mong Græmes of the Netherby clan; Fosters, Fenwicks, and Musgraves, they rode and they ran: There was racing and chasing on Cannobie Lea, But the lost bride of Netherby ne'er did they see. So daring in love, and so dauntless in war, Have ye e'er heard of gallant like young Lochinvar?” Marmion. So wildly had my imagination been excited by the strange scenes I had beheld, so completely had I acted under the impulses of sudden feeling, as opposed to deliberate reflection, that many minutes passed ere I recovered the full mastery of my thoughts from the dreamy whirl into which they had been plunged. A mile, or perhaps two, had already vanished beneath the fiery speed to which almost unconsciously I continued to goad my gallant horse, yet no decided sense of my position had as yet crossed my mind; I knew not why, or whither, I was flying at so desperate a pace; I rode on, like one drunk with wine, satisfied with the present and careless of the future. The only feeling which I remember to have entertained, was one of tenderness for the pale creature in my arms; an eagerness to protect her from the slightest harm, to shield her tender frame from the concussions which the high elastic bounds of the hot war-horse could not fail to inflict on a being so exquisitely delicate, and, according to every probability, so tenderly nurtured. It was, perhaps, well for me, at the time, that my mind was partially obscured; it spared me, at least, worlds of anxiety and doubt; and, by precipitating me headlong, as it were, into action, caused me to act on the spur of the moment with a decision, a readiness of heart and hand, which I have ever found in my own case, however it may be with others, more promptly serviceable on sudden, and what might be deemed startling, emergencies, than after hours of mature deliberation. When called upon by the imminence of present peril, I have ever found my thoughts to suggest themselves with the speed of lightning; or, rather, my actions have proceeded with a rapidity that seemed independent of thought,—instinctive, if you will. The danger has been averted, and I have sat down, a thousand and a thousand times, coolly to reflect whether my utmost ingenuity could have suggested, had the crisis been foreseen, any mode preferable to that adopted on the instant; and invariably have I found that the first impulse was correct. On the other hand, when, aware of an approaching crisis, I have matured plan after plan, I have determined on one course of action, only to determine in the next moment its utter inefficiency; and, when the time of trial has arrived, it has found me, if not absolutely hesitating or unprovided, less prompt at least, and far less confident of victory. It is a strange constitution of mind—yet in every minute circumstance of my life have I been able to trace its prevalence. When a boy, following the winged game in my ancestral woods, the bird which sprang from the brake, unmarshalled save by the whirring of its own rapid motion, invariably fell before the momentary precision of my instinctive aim; while that which fluttered slowly up, from beneath the nostrils of the sagacious dog that had betrayed its lair, escaped unharmed from a weapon levelled in the irresolution of anxiety. So, in after days, when, in the stormy debates of the Lower House, I lent my voice to defeat that which I have since learned to regard as the better cause, I invariably found, when I had passed days and nights in study,—when I had arranged my thoughts, marshalled my very words, and sharpened, as it were, the sword of my spirit for the keen encounter,— that the ideas so prepared deserted me, and the periods, already rounded for the occasion, fell unimpressively from a faltering tongue. On the other hand, I have repeatedly arisen from my seat unprepared, roused by sudden indignation to confute some calumny, to level some pile of sophistry to the earth; and never yet have words been wanting to express the rapid flow of ideas, which thronged, as it were, with the stormy speed of a torrent from my excited brain. I have dwelt, perhaps, too long on these peculiarities of my own mental constitution; but it seems to me that those who have thus far followed the course of my narration, will not be wholly unwilling to learn something of that character, which, of course, materially influenced the events that occurred in the progress of this wild adventure. It is probable—probable, did I say?—it is certain, that had I been of the cooler and more reflective disposition, which is far more common to men than that which I have endeavoured to portray as my own, I should immediately have perceived the difficulty, not to say the impossibility, of bestowing to any advantage the unfortunate girl, with whom I had so rashly, as some might deem it, encumbered myself. Myself a soldier of fortune, in a foreign land, unknown, nameless, and fortuneless, travelling on a mission of military service through a district utterly strange to me, and in the performance of duties entirely incompatible with delay, and which must remove me yet farther from the spot whereon the present occurrences were proceeding,—what should I, what could I, what ought I to do with a tender and high-born female? for such—from those distinctive marks of natural aristocracy which I was fond to fancy I could trace in the clear high brow, the silken tresses, the full blue veins, the grace and symmetry of her whole form—I at once conjectured her to be. To protect her from immediate peril would be, in itself, an arduous task; to bear her with me, an impossibility; to procure for her a protector in a district which I knew not, and in which I was myself unknown, would have defied the ingenuity of the most wily schemer; and to linger with her myself, a crime, a breach of duty and of honour, from which I should have shrunk with a dread even greater than that of death. It was, therefore, as I have already hinted, fortunate both for me and for my hapless protégée, that I was so completely bewildered by what I had witnessed, and so completely absorbed in the business of the moment—in guiding my noble VOL. I.—E Bayard, and in supporting my precious burden clear of the peaked bow of my steel-bound demipique—that I had no time left for reflection. I trust, indeed, and confidently believe, that under no possible combination of circumstances could I have soiled that character of a cavalier and man of honour, which it has been the object of a life to preserve untarnished, by the deliberate desertion, in a situation so horrible, of an unprotected female. A mile, and perhaps two, as I have before mentioned, had already been passed, without my experiencing any direct sensation, except that of immediate anxiety for my lovely charge. The character of the country was unchanged; the same wide tracts of stunted woodland overspreading a barren and level soil, with the road stretching interminably onwards in dull and solitary sameness. Not a house—not a sign of man or beast was to be discovered. Suddenly I was recalled to myself. At the descent of a gentle slope a sluggish brook crept with an almost imperceptible current over a muddy bottom across the unfrequented road, and, running parallel to the course of the streamlet, a pathway from the forest intersected the highway. I had already checked my horse, and was scrutinizing, with a practised eye, the nature of the narrow ford which lay before me,—when; with a loud shout, several men—some on foot, some mounted, but all well-armed, and dressed in liveries similar to those of the slaughtered servant I had observed beside the carriage—rushed impetuously from the left-hand pathway. Before I had become well aware of their intent, the grasp of the foremost was on my bridle-rein. “'Tis he! Thank God! Forward, my comrades!”— “Down with the murderer!”-- “No quarter to the ruffian!”—burst simultaneously from the throats of my fierce assailants. Fire-arms were levelled, swords were brandished, and, for an instant, it seemed as if my advance were cut off. It was but for an instant; ere a second ruffian could come to the aid of his fellow, my trusty pistol was discharged within three inches of his ear. I felt by the slackening of the rein, which a moment before had been as tight as a bowstring, that the bullet had done its bidding. Without casting a glance on the senseless clay, which had fallen with a sullen splash into the water, I hurled the now useless weapon full in the face of another of the footmen, and, striking my brave charger with the spur, lifted him hard and steadily with the heavy curb. He reared almost erect, plunged forward with a short curvet, dashing his fore-feet into the muddy margin of the stream, and, springing from thence with a mighty effort, cleared the dangerous channel, and darted away with a speed hardly inferior to that of the hunted deer. Loud and sharp rang the volleyed reports of a dozen pieces on our track; the bullets whistled round us; a rustle as of heavy wings above me, and my sight was darkened; while, at the same instant, a swerve from his direct course, and his quickened gallop, told me that my noble animal was wounded; the tall plume, with which the fashion of the day had decked my head, was severed, and had fallen over my eyes. Hastily I tore the shattered remnant from my hat; and, eager to escape beyond the range of musketry, rose in my stirrups and spurred fiercely onward. In another moment, the clatter of hoofs behind me told that I was pursued: for this I little cared; for well I knew that not a private gentleman, from Calais to the bright shores of the Mediterranean, could match, with a chance of success, the pride of his stables against the horse I backed. With a grim smile, I turned my head to mark the progress of the chase. A sharp, quick stroke across my forehead,—the singing of the leaden missiles, and a second volley! This time I had not myself escaped unscathed. Large gouts of blood trickled down to my beard from a long gash athwart my brows—you may see the furrow of the scar to this day—but the hurt was superficial; the third part of an inch closer, and my career had been cut short for ever. The object of my glance was however gained; in the point of time, it was no more, before the ball had grazed me, I had taken in, as it were intuitively, all that was passing in the rear. Three of the horsemen had already crossed the stream, two mounted on the large and cumbrous horses of Flanders,—which, since the complete panoply of the men-at-arms had fallen into disuse, were now considered fitter for draught than for the saddle—from these, as they thundered and already panted along the causeway, it was evident there was but little to be feared; but the third, a cavalier of some pretension in his dress, backed an Andalusian jennet of no mean points or common speed, and he, to my astonishment, was hard upon my heels. Struggling through the miry ford were several other riders, mounted, for the most part, on the active, wiry horses of Brittany, which, from experience, I well knew it might be difficult to throw far behind in a chase, as this seemed like to prove, of long continuance. I also E 2 perceived, grouped on the other bank, the fellows from whose musketry I had already suffered, and from whom I doubted not but I should meet yet further interruption. Another report! but this time the direction must have been bad, or the distance—though I should not have imagined it so— too great, for not only none of their bullets took effect, but I did not hear the well-known hurtling of their passage through the air. Nothing now remained but to shake off, as soon as possible, the pursuit of the horsemen, without running the risk of bringing my own flight to a speedy conclusion, by blowing my overloaded charger. Again I turned in my saddle, and gazed steadily to the rear. The cavalier, who pressed most closely on my traces, was scarcely three lances' length from my croup; the others straggled on, at various distances, spurring, shouting, and swearing at their jaded brutes, and occasionally, as they pulled up in despair, discharging their pistols, more to the peril of their own comrades than of him for whom their contents were intended. The leading horseman held his naked rapier in his hand as he bent over his courser's neck, in the full confidence, as it seemed, of overtaking his victims in a few bounds more or less of his mettled beast. It was, perhaps, fortunate for us, that he either carried no pistols in his holsters, or had already discharged them; for, at the close distance which separated us, had he halted for a second, he could hardly have failed of disabling me, or bringing down my horse. Husbanding his powers, then, with the utmost care that was consistent with haste holding him at the same time well in hand—for I was fully conscious that the slightest stumble must put us at once in the power of our inveterate enemies—I kept my brave bay at three-quarters speed. Hill and hollow vanished before us; stunted woodland and marshy glade glanced by us, as though they were in motion; the wind had risen, and, as it blew keen and cold over the bleak country in advance, freshened the courage of the gallant creature, shook abroad his long thin mane, already clogged with sweat, and scattered the foam-flakes from his nostrils like the commencement of a snow-storm, while its chilly breath curdled the blood that had flowed over my features in black and stiffened lines. Our race had at this time lasted above an hour; and, to my infinite annoyance, I began to feel that my horse's gait, if not actually less fleet, was far less springy than its wont. It might be that the double burden which he was bearing had begun to tell; the rather, as, during my journey through that wild and steril region, his provender had not only been deficient in quantity but inferior in quality; or it might be the blood, which had flowed abundantly from a deep though not dangerous wound in his quarters, had impaired his strength. Though not as yet actually failing, I began to be aware that a few miles farther would exhaust his powers of flight. Our pursuers, though scattered, still held their own. I began to look anxiously about for some place of refuge, or at least of temporary concealment; but, as fortune would have it, even the scanty and imperfect shelter that might have been afforded by the coppices through which our route had lain so long, was now beyond our reach. The forests were already miles in our rear; the causeway, bordered on either hand, as I have before described it, by the eternal poplar, stretched, as straight as the bird flies, over an arable country, now a vast expanse of bare and frost-bound soil, limited, indeed, on the distant horizon by a fringe of wood, but without glen or dingle, cottage or castle, for miles and miles, that could yield a chance of shelter. Before us lay a long bleak ascent, the brow of which, standing in dim relief against the uncertain sky, bounded the prospect. At every stroke I felt my courser's vigour leaving him; at every stroke, I too well knew, our foes were nearing us. The clang of their hard gallop, those hateful echoes, which for the last hour had been lost in the distance, again reached my ears. I dared not—by the immortal light of heaven I dared not—look behind me. On—on—the brow of the hill was wellnigh gained,—the sound of a convent-bell came faintly up the wind,—hope, angelic hope, swept in a flood of tenderness over my soul. I felt a tear-drop—it might have been the chilly blast that drew it from its locked recesses—upon my cheek. My charge, my adored, though yet unconscious charge, might still be rescued. I breathed a prayer,—I strained my eyeballs almost from their sockets, as my head rose above the summit. The sounds came clearer, swelling on the breeze, and with them, in the lull of the gale, I could distinguish the harmony of choral voices, and the deep diapason of the organ. Another stride, and the holy habitation lay before me. At the distance of a short half-league, its gray walls and slated belfry glinted back the rays of the faint January sunshine, which slept in duller tints upon the wide meadows and clustering sycamores that spread their peaceful shades around the house of God. The first glance was rapture—rapture such as perhaps I never felt before or since—the second was despair. It was, as I have said, but a short half-league; the road sloped smoothly down a gentle hill, fair, broad, and easy as that which churchmen tell us leads to the abyss of hell; and scarcely could the horror of the wretched sinner, trembling on the pinnacle from which he first discovers the home to which his flowery path conducts him, exceed the blighting chill which numbed my very life-blood, when I beheld, at the foot of that gentle hill—placed there to bar me from my paradise—a broad and bridgeless river. Dark, dull, and turbid, it flowed along through deep and rugged banks; the best carbine mortal workman ever wrought would have sped no certain death across those sullen waters. A bridge, it seemed, had lately spanned it; for to either bank the loosened joists of the abutments yet partially adhered, though, as the waters sapped their foundations, I could see the white spray leap into air, and hear the heavy roar, as one by one they toppled into the current that had swept their frailer comrades before them to the ocean. In despair, I checked my horse; I stood still, rooted, as it were, to the ground in horror; east and west I gazed over the barren country for aid, but aid was none. I set my teeth, loosened my rapier in its scabbard, and cocked my remaining pistol. Already I had half-wheeled my charger round, determined to remain, dead or alive, the master of the ground on which I stood; but, at the very moment when I was on the point of rushing to the fray, my eye fell on the sweet pale features of her, who lay in my arms as calmly and as still as though the grave had already claimed her for its own. Strangely had her state of insensibility been protracted, although, in the wild excitement of my spirits, its length had passed unnoticed. During the whole term of that long and rapid flight, she had rested, senseless and motionless, on my arm. Not a quiver of a limb, not a flutter of her breath, had announced a return of the suspended animation. Now, whether it was that the sudden cessation of our fleet motion had broken the trance, as the quick stopping of a carriage will oftentimes arouse a sleeper, or whether it was the result of a more evident interposition of Providence, I know not; but those deeply-curtained lids arose, and, ere they closed again, displayed a pair of eyes which, though their bright intelligence was partially obscured, spoke volumes, as I fancied, of languid tenderness. A shudder ran through her limbs, her lips parted, and unconsciously she murmured, in tones of the most silvery music,— “Oh save me—for the love of God—rescue the wretched Isabel!” That which has occupied minutes in the relation, passed in the space of a single second. “If I should fall,”—the thought flashed upon me like a meteor—“what will be the fate of her? and if I conquer, what will it profit us?” The tension of my nerves relaxed; the feelings of the gladiator passed; my triumphant pursuer had already raised the shout of triumph, when I skirred away, as it were, from his very clutches, and, scarcely certain of my own ulterior purpose, dashed at the top of my horse's speed, somewhat recruited even by that momentary pause, down the brief descent. A dozen bounds, as it appeared to my excited fancy, brought us within a stone's throw of the brink; and, if the river had seemed from a distance dark and dangerous, a nearer approach revealed a thousand terrors, which might well have appalled a stouter heart than mine, had I not been buoyed up by the unnatural phrensy—for such I may almost call it—of the moment. Again I faltered!—not for myself, but for the angel in my arms. Hardly knowing whether she were capable of comprehending my words, I whispered, in the softest tones my agitation would permit—“Dare you,” I said, “dare you, sweet lady, at imminent peril of your life, brave yon swollen stream? 'Tis but a single chance of safety, a thousand of destruction! Yet must we brave it, or they have you. Command me; I am yours—yours to the death!” “I dare!” she spoke calmly, and without the slightest tremour of voice or form; “I dare!— better a thousand times to die! But you—” I tarried not to mark her concluding words. I saw at a glance that the banks of the wintry torrent were lined by a broad margin of ice, although the force of the stream had prevented its formation elsewhere. This we must clear, or perish. I loosed the buckle of my broad buff belt, passed it around her slender waist, and secured it firmly to my own. “Cling to my collar with your hands,” I cried, in accents far more cheerful than the bodings of my heart; “but, as you value life, leave my arms free. God aid us, or we perish!” Rowel-deep I plunged my spurs into the sides of the brave beast that never failed his rider, and nobly did he answer them; brave as a lion, with extended nostril and unblenching eye, he charged the river. The bank was sheer and broken, an abrupt descent of full ten feet,—and well for us it VOL. I.—F was so. Without a pause, he leaped! Deep— deep we plunged into the wheeling waters, that closed above our heads; but as suddenly did we rise to the surface, clear of the treacherous ice, dripping and shivering, but as yet unharmed. Before taking this fearful step, I had marked, about a quarter of a mile below, a spot on the opposing shore, at which the soil was gravelly and shelving while the rippling of the waters at its base denoted a hard and shallow bottom. Had I been alone, my safety was now certain. Confident of my own powers, and of the qualities of my horse—whose action in the water was nearly as familiar to me, if not so often proved, as were his paces on the good greensward—I should have cared but little for even a longer swim. It was not, however, to be denied, that the season was fearfully against us. Large blocks of floating ice, which had probably destroyed the bridge, came crashing down the tide, and it required all the skill that I could command to steer my course among them. And then the cold—the cutting, agonizing cold—I felt my own case-hardened muscles shiver, and my teeth jar in my head, with the excessive chill; yet, Heaven is my witness, I thought not of myself,—unless it were with scorn, that I should flinch so much as even to feel the elements, which that heroic girl so nobly battled with, so manfully overcame. Never, in all my long and turbulent career, never have I witnessed human intrepidity that could compare with the serene holy fortitude with which she made her agony subservient to her will. Her clear bright eye never wavered; her cheek paled, indeed, but trembled not; she would not even permit—so perfect was the mastery of mind over matter—she would not even permit her limbs to shiver, lest they should interfere with my control over the swimming charger. After running a dozen times, as I thought, upon certain destruction, and a dozen times almost miraculously escaping—for, encumbered by his unwonted burden, and overdone by his previous exertion, Bayard swam not with his accustomed vigour, but floundered heavily, so that it needed all the exertions my benumbed limbs could muster, to hinder him from turning tail to the current, and floating head foremost to perdition—we reached the landing-place. The struggle was severe, but it was successful. We landed—we were saved! My first thought was of gratitude to my God, and my eyes glanced upward to his holy heavens,—my second was of my love. I looked on her—but she had fainted. The peril she had endured and conquered! The revulsion of ecstasy had prevailed. A short gallop placed us at the convent-gates; my course of action had been decided ere I reached the portal, and was followed up on the instant. Deception it was; but if deception may ever be forgiven, surely, surely the preservation of an angel, such as she I had rescued, might palliate, might justify the offence. I bore a parchment,—a military commission from the dreaded cardinal who swayed the destinies of France. It had been darkly framed, that, in case of its falling into other hands than those for which it was intended, it might neither criminate the bearer nor profit the gainers. Its object being to confer on me the chief command of a large body of troops, at quarters in a section of the country almost surrounded by open or secret enemies, it ran simply thus:— “On your allegiance, we charge ye, in all things, to obey and pleasure the bearer. Signed, “Mazarin.” What would be the final consequences of my misapplication of this powerful missive I knew not, and I recked yet less. But I did know that I had passed the most disaffected districts, and that here it would meet implicit obedience. Nor was I mistaken. Had I been the sovereign himself, I could not have been greeted with more prompt and affectionate loyalty. But for this I cared not. I had learned from the porter, that for many leagues there was not another bridge across the turbulent Marne. I was assured by the chirurgeon that Isabel, though feeble and exhausted, was in perfect safety; and had a thousand hardships borne me down—a thousand perils threatened—I should have been—as I then was—supremely happy.

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. “Why did she love him? Curious fool! be still— Is human love the growth of human will? To her he might be gentleness—the stern Have deeper thoughts than your dull eyes discern; And when they love, your smilers guess not how Beats the strong heart, though less the lips avow.” Lara. The flight was over—the struggle was at an end—the haven was gained; but with present safety there came an almost intolerable dread of future evil. A thousand doubts and fears, unthought of amid the stormy occurrences of the last few hours, crowded, like busy fiends, upon my brain. I said that I was happy; and so in truth I was,—exquisitely, supremely happy! Never, in the whole course of my life, have I experienced sensations so thrilling, and so nearly approaching to the delirium of joy, as were those with which I learned that there was hardly a possibility of recapture to be apprehended; and that, after a brief repose, my lovely charge would be so completely restored as to render a renewal of exertions, if such should be required, not only free from risk, but easy of accomplishment. While the brother who officiated as chirurgeon in the convent which had afforded us shelter was yet speaking to me, a full sense of my condition flashed, for the first time, upon my mind. All had before been dreamy, indistinct, and obscure; all was now definite and terrible in its distinctness. That moment of lightning-thought was to my spirit what the sulphureous glare of the tempest is to the midnight ocean,—revealing, to the unconscious mariner, terrors of which he had not even dreamed, till they were dragged from darkness into horrible reality by that brief illumination. I saw at once the pinnacle on which I was tottering, and the abyss that yawned below; but the light which showed the perils that environed me, showed no path by which to escape them. So suddenly did this consciousness of my embarrassment gleam upon my senses, and so overpowering were the feelings to which that consciousness gave birth, that I broke off abruptly in my reply to the worthy Benedictine, with symptoms of confusion so evident, that they must have excited suspicion, had they not, luckily for me, been attributed to the effects of over-exertion alike of mind and body. I was aware that I turned deadly pale for an instant, and then again I felt that every drop of blood in my veins was rushing in torrents to my brow; my eye was vacant, and my tongue faltered; my mind was utterly unstrung. To the entreaties of the good friar, that I would suffer myself to be conducted to a cell wherein I might take a few hours of refreshment after the fatigues and perils I had undergone, I returned at first a brief refusal. “Nay,” said the kind-hearted old man, “but you are to blame, my son, for suffering the things of this world to hold so tyrannous a dominion over your spirit. To an active mind like yours, I well know that inactivity is the worst of evils! Yet, bethink you, further speed, how much soever you may deem it necessary, is impossible. Your good horse can do no further service till rest shall have repaired his faculties; you, too, my son, are not yourself. Your spirit, like a bow too tightly strung, has lost its elasticity. Listen, then, to the voice of reason: an hour or two of quiet will have restored you to yourself; your charger is in the hands of our lay-brothers, and shall be cared for. Let me, I pray you, lead you to a chamber.” Urged so warmly, and at the same time so reasonably, I could not refuse; and, after a moment's consideration, I was averse no longer. I was in want of absolute quiet, not, indeed, to reinvigorate my mind,—for had its energies been called for, they would have answered, as it were, to a trumpet's note,—but to collect my thoughts—to deliberate on what I had done already—and, yet more difficult, on what I was about to do hereafter. In a few moments I was ushered into a little turret-chamber, narrow indeed, and somewhat scanty in its furniture, but neat and cheerful in its aspect. Used apparently for the accommodation of visiters, its window, unobscured by the accustomed convent-grates, looked over the rich meadows stretching away, with many a clump of shadowy trees and many an orchard intervening, to the wide river, which had lately seemed so terrible an obstacle; though now, in truth, it was the only barrier that saved us from our foes. A bright log, glowing and sputtering on the hearth, diffused a warmth rendered doubly grateful by the rigour of the season and by the state of my benumbed and dripping limbs; the pallet-bed was decked with linen of unblemished whiteness, and the board was spread with dainties, and with a flask of burgundy, whose bouquet alone was sufficient to prove that the brothers of St. Benedictaux-Layes were not likely to impair the reputation of monastic institutions, the world through, for hospitality and sumptuous cheer. Promising to summon me whenever the lady should be restored sufficiently to endure the excitement of my presence, the monk, declining my invitation to pledge me in the vintage of his convent, departed, and left me to my meditations. And, in good sooth, they were sufficiently gloomy; nor, when I had disposed my doublet and upper garments before the cheerful hearth, and tasted a single goblet of the old Auxerre, could I find any pleasure, or even consolation, in the aspect of affairs. I had fallen, as I was fully conscious, over head and ears in love with an errant damsel, whom I had found, like a Bevis or an Ascapart, in a forest,—and of whose name, history, and lineage I was profoundly ignorant. This, in itself sufficiently embarrassing, would not have been perhaps wholly untinged with the ridiculous, had there not been sundry most grave realities mixed up with the romance, which rendered it no laughing matter. First and foremost, I was myself no loving character—little used to the society of ladies,—for the fierce civil wars which had convulsed my own country from my boyhood upward, and, still more than actual warfare, the party-hatred, the heart-burnings, and political suspicions of the times, had greatly circumscribed all social intercourse,—I had ever scoffed at the idea of pure, poetical, all-engrossing passion. And if the caprice of the moment, or the fashion of the day, had at times induced me to play the part of inamorato, I had never found the cruelty of any fair one to be severely oppressive, or the continuance of any passion to endure much longer than to the next change of the modes. Such, however, I too surely felt, was not the case now. I was fairly caught—passionately in love with an unknown girl, to whom, indeed, I had rendered such services as might be deemed a furtherance of my suit; but who, for aught I knew to the contrary, might have been the mistress or the wife of either cavalier whom I had seen perish fighting, as I judged, for the possession of—perhaps a second Helen. It was in vain that I repelled such thoughts. For the moment, indeed, they were overmastered and fled; but they fled only to return, bringing with them too deeper and far more weighty considerations; though to my excited feelings they then seemed as things of little moment, compared to the one engrossing subject of my thoughts. I was yet many leagues distant from the detachment I had been despatched to command. Even were it at hand, I had a hundred urgent duties to perform—wild feats of irregular and partisan warfare, the least of which was the cutting my way with three or four regiments of cavalry through a wide and hostile district, forcing the lines of the Frondeurs, and bringing in my command to join the Duke of Orleans and the Prince of Condé, who were then beleaguering the generals of the parliament within the walls of the capital. I had already, in one important point, violated the spirit, if not the letter, of my instructions, in displaying the mandate of the cardinal before arriving at my destination. Nor was this all; I had, it was evident, caused much disturbance in the country by my late adventure; for, from my turret-window, as I paced and repaced the floor, in the agitation of my thoughts, I could perceive the country people gathering around the banks which had been the theatre of my fearful exploit, wondering, as it would seem, and speculating on the motives which could have prompted any man, not frantic, to so desperate a measure. This excitement, even if it should not lead to my capture or forcible detention at present, must, of necessity, prove highly unfavourable to my intention of conducting a heavy division of horse with any secrecy by the same route; and would, in all probability, if not defeat, at least delay the execution of this project, and give rise to a progress won by hard fighting, and at the sword's point, as it were, instead of a succession of rapid and forced marches. All this to a man of the cardinal's rigid and stern severity would be matter of high offence, and might, perhaps, be deemed worthy of a procession to the Place de Grêve. This reflection, while it added nothing to my comfort, was to be utterly cast aside for the present; highly as I might regard, in other circumstances, military obligations and the approbation of a superior, in a case like the present, where honour and humanity pointed the one path, while discipline called to the other, I felt that I could not pause; no, not for an instant. Inwardly I swore that, be the shame or the peril what it might, before I stirred a foot on my mission I would place Isabel in perfect safety; learn, if it might be so, the state of her affections; plight her a soldier's troth; perform the duties that lay before me; and return to cast my trophies and redeem my pledges at her feet. An hour or two had already elapsed in these meditations, and I began to wax impatient at the delay of the friar. My blood was in a perfect fever; I sat down,—I rose, but to seat myself again; I kicked the blazing log in nervous excitement, till the toe of my ponderous jack-boot was wellnigh red hot; I hurled myself on the low pallet; I strode the floor with still increasing vehemence. VOL. I.—G Suddenly, as I passed the window, I caught a glimpse of a female figure standing at a corresponding opening in a second turret, which projected, like that wherein I stood, beyond the level of the wall. My first impulse was to turn away; as I imagined, from the position, and from a something monastical in the shape of her garments, which had caught my attention even in that momentary glance, that the figure I had seen was one of the sisters of the establishment,—for I had already learned that there was a female institution with its abbess annexed to and adjoining the Benedictine monastery. My second was to turn and gaze again,—for reflection instantly suggested that none of the sisterhood could be thus free from restraint, and in a part of the building evidently under the control of the other sex. I checked my impetuous strides, returned gently to the lattice,—it was Isabel! Her forehead was bound by the simple yet not ungraceful head-gear of a Benedictine nun, but with a single long tress of fair hair that had escaped from its unwonted confinement, wantoning down her long and swan-like neck; which was but partially obscured by the veil and flowing garments in which she was enveloped, until such time as her own dress could be dried and purified from the stains of clay and human gore contracted during the affray and subsequent flight. Her eyes were directed towards the window from which I had just turned away, and there was something like an expression of impatience in those soft and beautiful orbs that had evidently followed my departing figure. A deep carnation glow rushed over her brow and cheeks as my eye met hers; nay, her neck, and the brief glimpse of a snowy bosom that was afforded by the envious veil, were flushed with the same delicate hue: she dropped her eyes to the ground, and her long, long lashes were pencilled in beautiful relief against the bright complexion of her lovely features. Slowly she raised them again to mine; and, as if she had conquered the momentary confusion that had overpowered her, smiled sweetly, and, waving her hand, moved gracefully from the embrasure. My heart, that had throbbed so wildly while she was before me in all the radiance of loveliness and feminine delicacy, stood still. It was as though a cloud had fallen on my mental vision; all had been bright and sun-like,— all was now obscure; still, as I sank slowly into my seat, my thoughts were not so wild, nor my hopes so desperate, as they had been before my passing glance at her, whose slightest wish would have been a command more weighty than the proudest monarch's mandate. I felt that she had blushed—that she had blushed for me! Was I then loved? “Away!” I muttered to myself— “away! It is not possible!” But it would not away! Fixed, fixed as the earth's centre that question sat upon my heart. A step sounded through the corridor; I leaped to my feet— paused not to note the features of him whom I addressed—for what to me were persons in that hour of strange anxiety?—requested him to lead me to the lady Isabel; and, ere I knew my purpose, found myself alone in the parlour of the convent—alone,—but with one other! With a smile of ineffable sweetness, yet faint withal and melancholy, she arose to greet me— she had been weeping; and the smile, like that of an April sun, gleamed through fast-falling tear-drops. Her hand extended in all the lovely confidence of young, enthusiastic, fearless purity—she sprang towards me. “How,” she said, in tones that melted into my very soul like spiritual music, “oh! how can I thank you sufficiently, my noble, —noble rescuer!” The light touch of her fingers shot, as it were, a stream of lava through my frame. I had not power to close my hand on that which she so frankly offered. With embarrassed mien and faltering accents, I murmured something—I know not what—of hopes, of happiness, and of the slightness of my services. Words—empty words—the meaning of which I could hardly be said to comprehend, even while I uttered them. None can know— none dream—save those of stern and passionless natures, and they but rarely—with what fierce and flame-like dominion love seizes—subdues— and becomes the very essence of a soul like mine. Stamp characters upon the soft and sunny sands, and the first tide effaces them; engrave them in the cold and unimpressive flint, and they endure for ever! She looked into my eyes, as I replied, with a singular and almost painful expression of disappointment; and, as she spoke again, her words came forth hurriedly, and with a feverish impetuosity wildly different from the sweet calmness of her former tones. “You are offended; you regret that you have saved me; you deem me cold, ungrateful, heartless! You have rescued me from misery,— deeper, a thousand times deeper than death! From agony—pollution—heart-break—shame;— from all that is most loathsome! most appalling! All this you have done, and you reject my thanks —you spurn my gratitude! Oh! no, no, no! Miserable I am,—most miserable—wellnigh mad with misery; but not—not thankless!” G 2 “Dearest lady!” I interrupted her the instant her vehemence permitted; “dearest lady, think not so hardly of one whose greatest bliss would be the thought that he had served you; and, more than all, think not so humbly of yourself as to deem that aught of human mould could look on the emotion, or listen to the thanks, of such as you, without deeming himself the most supremely blest of men! My object in this intrusion is to learn whether in aught my feeble efforts can avail you; to implore you to command me; to trust in me,—to use me! And if there be naught in which I can assist you, to pray that you will favour me with your name; that I may store it in my heart of hearts—that I may look back to it from the storms of sin and strife, as to a bright and blessed guardian—that I may write, amid the record of my wild and wilful deeds, one act of virtue—which may balance all the evil—in the service I have done to you. Thrice happy, if, when afar, I may not be forgotten—if sometimes,” and here I believe the firmness I had assumed deserted me, and my voice was hoarse and husky, “if sometimes you will permit the name of Harry Mornington to mingle with your prayers! Tell me, then, ere we part—” “Part!” she said, “part!”—in one of those clear low whispers which pierce the ear more keenly than the trumpet-notes of passion. “And do you too forsake me? Have you but saved me that I may be dragged again—oh God!”—A shudder of almost convulsive violence ran through her frame at the recurrence of what seemed some half-maddening thought: but ere I could have counted ten, she had o'ermastered it; she wiped away a single tear with that long sunny ringlet, and moved yet closer to my side; cold, indeed, and colourless, but firm and unmoved as the sculptured marble. “You know me not,” she said slowly, and weighing her words, as it were, with desperate calmness—“you know me not; nor do I wish you should: but I know this—that you have rescued me from horrors of which I dare not even think. Leave not, then, I beseech you, leave not your work unfinished! As you are a man—a gentleman—a soldier—by the soul of the mother who bore you—of the father who taught you to be brave, and generous, and good,—I do conjure you. Swear that you will grant to me one last request —swear it—before we part for ever!” “There needs not, sweet lady,” I replied, in tones not untinctured by her own vehemence, “there needs not an oath to bind me to your service. Speak, and were life, liberty, honour itself at stake, to the very letter you should be obeyed.” “Draw then your sword, and strike me to the heart! Better to die by the hand of a friend than to live deserted and dishonoured!” “Now, by the living light of heaven,” I cried, moved beyond all self-control, “I am no slave to Mazarin, that I should tear my heart-strings to fulfil his bidding. Here will I tarry. He can but take my life, and that is worthless! Lady—I leave you not—while head can plan, heart feel, or hand perform. While you have friends to be righted, or foes to be put down, hence will I depart living never! Command me; I am your soldier; yours to the death,—yours only!” “I accept your pledge!—most willingly, most gratefully do I accept your proffered aid. I am an orphan,” she continued, speaking more calmly, and as if reassured by my promise of protection, “a hapless, helpless orphan. If the gifts of fortune have been lavished upon me, they have been lavished but to render me more wretched. Death and misery have dogged my footsteps from my very cradle. Those who should have been my dearest friends have been my direst foes. All whom I have loved have perished; all whom I have trusted have betrayed, have persecuted, and—had it not been for you—would have destroyed me! On your protection do I cast myself; to your honour, to your courage, do I confide my all.— But wherefore tarry here, if duty calls you elsewhere? Fly from these hateful scenes; to the world's end will I follow you, confidently believing that he who once has saved will never harm an orphan's sole possession,—her yet unblemished honour!” At a single glance I read her character. I saw she was no common woman, to flaunt in the sunshine of prosperity, and shrink, like the withered flower, in the time of trouble. On the instant I resolved to open to her my whole soul. I am not one to crouch before a lady's feet,—to play the sighing, sentimental lover. Gently I led her to a seat; I told her of my exile from my native land; of my present duties; of my all-engrossing passion; of my hopes, my doubts, my fears, and my embarrassment. Rapidly I spoke, and fluently. Mastering the passion that was boiling in my blood, I made no wild protestations, poured forth no boyish rhapsodies; but calmly and deliberately, as though I were speaking of another, I showed her the nakedness of my heart; I told her how lightly I had thought of love; how I had striven against its first approaches; how deeply convinced I was of the truth, the singleness, the fervour of my unselfish, ignorant affection. Several times, while I was speaking, she had attempted to interrupt me; but as often, seeing my determination to speak to an end, she had desisted. I understood her purpose; but I saw, by the deep blush that crimsoned her countenance, by the quick heaving of her bosom, and the suffusion of her downcast eye, that if my suit should be rejected, her heart would have no share in the rejection. In conclusion, I entreated her to suffer me to procure for her a temporary abode in our present place of refuge, where she might dwell, as it were in sanctuary, till I could fulfil my present mission, return at the head of my troops, and conduct her openly, and in the face of man and Heaven, to St. Germains, where I again conjured her to become my bride. When I had fully concluded, she raised her clear blue eye confidently to meet my gaze; there was no tremulousness, no flutter, no affectation of distress or sentiment,—all was purity and unsuspecting innocence. “You know not what you ask,” she said, deeply moved, but completely conquering her emotion; “you know not what you ask,—nor of whom. Noble, generous-hearted man, think you that I could brook, that I could stoop, even for mine own sake, to practise on devotion such as yours? Never— never! There is a mystery, a deep and fearful mystery, around me; and think you that I would cast a shadow, even for an instant, on the name and fortunes of my preserver? There is a cloud of misery, and guilt, and madness upon our fated house; and I, the wretched, guiltless sacrifice, shall I drag down another glorious victim to the abyss from which he fain would rescue me? Let me but follow you—your slave—your sister— what you will—let me but follow you, till I can find some quiet grave wherein to lay my aching head. I cannot—dare not tell you all; but of this be certain,—ere you could reach your place of destination, they would drag me from these walls, as they have dragged me from many a more sure asylum!” “Ha!” I replied, “is it so? Then is there but one course left; I fear not—doubt not—seek not to know your mystery; say but that you love me, —that you will be mine—and I can save you. Thus, and thus only! Become my bride this night. Start not—this night, I say. The prior hath the power to protect you, give to me but the right to compel, if needs be, his protection. Speak but the word, one hour will make you mine, the next shall find me in the saddle; and ere a third sun set a thousand trusty swords shall guard my bride. Refuse me—and, though I cannot save, I still can die for you!” Twenty times, as I pleaded my cause with all the earnest vehemence of a resolved and honest heart, did the shadows sink darkly down upon her speaking brow; and as often did they vanish thence in gleams of transient hope. Twenty times did her lips unclose as if to speak; and as often did her words die on her tongue in low and faltering murmurs. I arose slowly to my feet as I concluded, and stretched my open arms towards her, as to the arbitress of my doom. With a quick cry, she rushed into my embrace, wound her arms convulsively about my neck— “Harry!” she murmured, “you have prevailed; you take me to your heart in doubt, in darkness, and in mystery; but never, never shall you rue this day. Many a fairer, many a nobler bride might you have won; but never one more fond, more faithful, nor—thanks be to thee, adored Harry, to thee and ONE besides—more pure than Isabel de Coucy.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. “Fri. So smile the heavens upon this holy act, That after-hours with sorrow chide us not! Rom. Amen, Amen! But, come what sorrow can, It cannot countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight.” Romeo and Juliet. With a heart filled almost to bursting, I hurried forth to seek the superior of the convent; and never, perhaps, did I feel a mightier conflict of principles and impulses, of doubts and hopes, than in the agitating moments which preceded that strange wedding. Anticipating the unwillingness of the worthy Benedictine to give his sanction to the solemn union of two persons to whose characters so much of mystery and suspicion must naturally attach, and that too under circumstances which might call down upon himself the resentment of powerful enemies, and possibly bring upon his community the more deeply-dreaded censure of their common superior, I had tasked my spirit to the utmost to find some plausible solution of the difficulties VOL. I.—H of my situation, some satisfactory reasons for a marriage so clandestine, so sudden, and, above all, so authorized as that which it was my object now to solemnize. And, strange to say, the very search for a justification of my conduct to the understanding of another, tended to render me dissatisfied, and doubtful of myself. Is it possible, I thought, or rather is it not probable, that I have been the slave of impulse, the toy of sudden passion—that I have surrendered my discretion to my feelings, that I have suffered my soul to be lapped in Elysium by the mere beauty and fascinations of an artful woman, and that I shall awake from my dream of paradise to find myself the inmate of a moral Tartarus? And yet her refusal to become my bride suggested my passion, or, as I now am fain to believe, my better genius—her manifest reluctance to owe that to compassion, or to the intensity of sudden feeling, which she might have accepted freely, if offered under different circumstances. And might not this be the result of artifice—deep-laid and hitherto successful artifice? I felt that I had acted rashly—madly, if you will. I doubted the wisdom, I wellnigh trembled at the risk, of the step I had already taken; yet—so strangely are our minds made up of opposite and counteracting principles—I had not, for a single instant, the slightest wish, the most remote idea, of withdrawing my foot from the verge, how perilous soever I might deem it, whereon it had been planted by my own unbiased will. There were, in my inmost soul, two concurring sensations, which would probably have urged me onward in the teeth of obstacles even greater than those which seemed to bar my progress. The first was one of those wild fancies, those superstitions, if you will, which have been common in all times and countries to intellects more powerful than my own—to minds, indeed, of the highest order; one of those creeds—not of the head, but of the heart; one of those beliefs which, for ever disowned by reason, for ever keep their place in our bosoms, and exert an influence, not the less potent that it is unconfessed, over our actions,—it was the conviction of my own good-fortune. Yes!—wild, absurd as such an idea may appear—my own inborn good-fortune! The partisan of a fallen cause— the soldier of a conquered army—the adherent of a dethroned and a slaughtered monarch—an exile from the land of my birth—the last outcast scion of an attainted title—landless, friendless, and alone, I still believed in my own good-fortune; not, perhaps, as relating to connected consequences, not to a series of events, but confidently as pertaining to single isolated accidents. A thousand times, during my stormy and eventful career, had I rushed headlong, as it would seem, upon destruction; and the very madness of the proceeding had as often worked out its ultimate success. To the metaphysician and philosopher be it to analyze the belief, and to search out its secret causes. They would, perhaps, tell you that my mind had, in truth, by some unconscious operation, balanced the chances and calculated the bearings of every successive step; till that which in every instance appeared the result of fortuitous combinations was, in reality, the consequence of plans matured, as it were, instinctively, and forgotten, though still operating, during the whirl of action and excitement. Be it to them, I say, to reason, to qualify,—and, if they can, to explain. I am a soldier, and I know not, and care yet less, whether my thoughts be comprehensible or no. The belief which I then held, which I still hold, was, that, rush into whatever dilemma I might, my own good-luck would bear me out, not scathless only, but victorious. This, then, was the first and leading principle which hurried me onward in despite of my own judgment; the second, scarcely, perhaps, less influential than that which I have just described, was a conviction of the purity, the faith, the excellence of Isabel. It was my cavilling and suspicious mind alone that doubted; my heart was confident, and on that confidence I acted; after-events will tell if wisely,—or, at least, if fortunately. Pondering thus—doubting, and debating with myself—I strode along the gloomy cloisters; till I found myself already in the presence of him I sought, before I had determined what should be my arguments, or what my inducements to the holy man to minister to my wishes. I had not hitherto seen the father, to whom my application was to be made. Hospitality had been furnished, as a matter of course, and without inquiry; though I subsequently discovered that every circumstance of my coming had been made known to him, who was to be the arbiter of my present destinies. On the first glance at the person to whom I was about to prefer my request, I was resolved. I saw before me a tall, pale, and emaciated man—not surely past the prime of the intellectual man—but worn, as it struck me at once, rather by the workings of a spirit too subtile and energetic for its clay companion, than by ascetic self-inflictions. His cowl had fallen back from his nobly-formed head; and as he sat facing the narrow casement, the last faint rays of the wintry H 2 sunshine streamed down upon his high brow, and almost superhuman features. His temples, perfectly bald and unwrinkled, were not disfigured by the formal tonsure, though a beard of the most intense blackness flowed in long and silky waves far down his bosom. There was a something of severity in the general expression, but a bland and beautiful smile played upon the chiselled lips; while his soft dark eyes looked out from their deep sockets with a mingled brilliancy and benignity, that rendered his countenance altogether the most remarkable that I had ever witnessed. He looked the imbodiment of a spirit; as I gazed upon his lustrous eyes, and wonderfully intellectual features, I forgot that I was looking on a mortal like myself. There was a purity, a truth, a beauty in that face, that seemed to indicate the absence of every earthly passion, accompanied by a divine sympathy for the very feelings which he had himself been permitted to eradicate or subdue, when existing in the breasts of others. I felt as though he had already perused my inmost soul, as though he knew my object, my aims, my motives. I could no more have attempted to deceive or to diplomatize with such a man than I could have lied before the throne of the Eternal. So complete was the fascination of this strange being upon my senses, that I almost started when, in a voice that fitly harmonized with the frame from which it was breathed, deep, melodious, and passionless, he inquired the purport of my visit. At once, and without hesitation, I told him all,—the duel in the forest—the rescue—the pursuit—the mystery. I probed my own heart, and told him of my fears, my doubts, my determination. I told him distinctly, and without disguise, who and whence I was; showed him the missive of Mazarin, and explained its real object; and concluded by entreating him to perform a deed of the utmost benevolence in uniting me to Isabel. As I began to speak, he listened to me calmly, and with attention, though, as it struck me, with a slightly incredulous expression. As I proceeded, that expression vanished into one of intense scrutiny and interest; and as I spoke of my affection for Isabel, of my deep passionate conviction of her purity, and of my certainty that the only chance of rescuing her lay in our instant union, that benignant smile irradiated his whole countenance, and I thought I saw a big tear roll down his pale cheek; but, as I paused an instant from my narrative to mark his features, he observed my glance, and drawing his cowl forward, shadowed himself completely from my further scrutiny. When I had done speaking, he remained silent for some moments, as if buried in the deepest reflection, ere he replied:— “The truth is in your words, my son, and well for you it is so. Had you swerved from the straight path but for the breadth of a single hair, I could not, and I would not, have served you. Well have you acted thus far, and nobly. That in your further views you are actuated by high and honourable motives, I well believe, though it might, perhaps, be rash to term them wise ones. It is singular that you should have thus been led to apply yourself to me; for I—and I, perhaps, alone of all men—can, and will assist you. You have, it seems, yourself well weighed the risks you run in wedding this young person; and are yet willing, if I understand you rightly, to run these risks, not for your own advancement, but for her preservation. Is it not so?” I signified my assent. “It is a mighty sacrifice,” he muttered to himself, and then repeated it again aloud—“it is a mighty sacrifice, my son, and many an ecclesiastic would deem it his bounden duty to prevent it. But I—I love the sacrifice of self to honour—I love the buoyant, ardent, and unselfish aspirations of youth; enough—I will believe, will hope your prospects of felicity less doubtful than they would appear. Something, too, I can gather from your narrative, of whom and what the lady is, and what the oppression from which you would preserve her—you know it not?” “Father, I know it not!” “It is wonderful—” he again spoke aside; and ere he again addressed me, I saw his fingers pass over his beads, and his lips move in silent prayer. “Then from me you should know it not, even had I the power to explain! Yet, thus much will I tell you; and if, knowing this, you choose to persevere—I will—I will unite you. If it be as well I am assured it is,—this Isabel de Coucy is the child of misery—may be the child of shame and guilt. A dark and fearful mystery dwells over her; one which, if it were divulged, would make her an object of aversion and of dread to all who heed the world's opinion more than their own souls' judgment. Misery there is—misery of her own; guilt—I say not of her own—but of all those whose name she bears—misery, and guilt, and shame, such as may never be cleared up; and which, if not cleared up, must make her shunned of men. If, knowing thus much, you dread, as it well may be, the contempt or censure of the world, forget that you have ever seen, and leave her—to the protection of Him who, if innocent, never will desert her. But if, knowing this, you dare abide by the dictates of your own conscience, or of your own heart,—and be sure, ere you decide, you know which it be that prompts you,—meet me an hour hence in the chapel, and I will further your desires. Peril it will bring upon me, and, it may be, destruction; but I see my path of duty,—and” —he looked upward—“fiat voluntas tua!” “Father,” I replied, “I had resolved upon my line of action before I sought your presence. I am no more a man to blench from what I deem the path of honour, for the scorn of men, than you to shrink from the road of Christian virtue, though it should lead to martyrdom! Say but that you will make her mine, that you will keep her from violence till my return, and you shall have the prayers of one who, though his trade be violence and blood, hath not forgotten in his prime the lessons of his childhood, and whose sins have been the sins of weakness—not of wilfulness!” “That I will make her yours, my son, I have already promised; that I will protect her to the utmost of my power, you are now assured! How far I may be enabled to guard her, as your wife, I know not; as a maiden, she would be ravished hence before to-morrow's dawn. We are but men—and we can but endeavour. There is One above who may accomplish or annul, and to Him we will submit ourselves in confidence, and in the fear that yet is love!” The hour passed away like a dream. I had acquainted Isabel with my success, and at her own request had left her alone with her sorrows and her hopes. The hour passed away like a dream, and I was still pacing the floor of my turret-chamber, when a brother summoned me with the information that his superior awaited me in the chapel. I entered the apartment of my chosen one. I found her prostrate on her knees, with lifted hands and streaming eyes, and my name trembling on her lips, mingled with the awful titles of Him to whom she, for the last time, offered up the aspirations of her virgin heart! “Come,” I whispered, “come, my beloved,— the holy father waits us. Banish your tears, sweet Isabel; henceforth you shall shed none,—or shed but tears of happiness!” “O Harry,” she murmured; “dearest Harry, there is a cloud of dread and doubt around me, and I more than half repent the promise you wrung from me. You take me to your arms, to your heart—your glorious and confiding heart. And what have I to give you in return,—a broken spirit, a frail body, a creature rejected and despised of the world,—a thing whose very name will be a reproach to you! O Harry! Harry! spare me; release me from my fatal vows. If you knew all, you would release me—release me, did I say?—would spurn me!” “Isabel,” I interrupted her calmly and gravely— “Isabel de Coucy—if you repent your promise on your own account, you are at liberty; if not, do me, at least, the justice to believe that I am a man of truth and honour. If you cannot believe this, better, better it were, indeed, for me and you to perish where we stand, than to go forward in this matter. I have in you all confidence—all faith. In you I repose my honour as freely and as fully as I trust one day to repose my soul in my Creator's mercy. You have told me that you are innocent of wrong; and had you told me otherwise, I had deemed you still innocent of all—but slander on yourself. Did I not believe you pure, and taintless, and single-hearted, sooner would I take to my arms deformity, ay, death herself, than you with all your charms, were they to last for ever! If you believe me—if you believe that I shall love you ever as I love you now—that I should but cherish you more fervently, esteem you more thoroughly, if you were rejected, scorned, and hated of the world—here is my heart and hand. If you cannot believe this—we will part, even at the altar's foot! It is for you to determine. Speak, Isabel! speak for me as for yourself! and bethink you that an error now is an error that must endure for ever—that love, devoid of confidence, is but a summer's flower; and that the union of a man and wife must brave the wintry storm as freely as it hails the summer sunshine!” Without another word, without an instant's hesitation, she grasped my proffered hand, pressed it to her heart, to her lips. “No! no!” she cried, “no, Harry! not for a moment have I doubted aught but my own unworthiness—” Before she could conclude her sentence, I folded her in my arms, parted the sunny tresses from her fair brow to press on it one chaste and passionless kiss, drew her hand under my arm, and led her towards the chapel. Conducted by the monk, we threaded the long corridors within the pile; thence through a low-browed arch we gained the outer cloisters,—dark, damp, and cheerless. I felt the frame of my companion shiver as we passed along the gloomy cavernous range, and I knew intuitively the thoughts that were working in her guileless heart. In moments such as these, the strongest heart is prone to superstitious terrors; the VOL. I.—I most skeptical look for omens in the merest occurrences of chance, and pin their faith, as it were, upon a falling leaf or fading flower. I was about to speak cheerfully, when our conductor unlatched a door leading into an inner garden, beyond which lay the chapel, with its tall pointed windows glancing in the moonlight. The contrast between the gloom within and the heavenly brilliancy without was not required to impress the mind with the beauty of the scene. The quiet garden, with its clustering evergreens, its imbowered walks, and its dark foliage, gemmed with the night-dew, and sleeping in the placid moonshine—the crystal pool in the centre, with its tall fountain shooting upward towards the clear blue sky, its summit bathed in silvery light, and a thousand prismatic colours playing on its dancing rain-drops, while its base lay steeped in shadow—the light clustered columns and pointed arches rich with the florid traceries of the later Norman style—the rustle of the gentle west wind among the shrubs—for the night was as calm and spring-like as the morning had been wintry and severe—combined to form one of the most lovely pictures of tranquillity and happiness I had ever witnessed. Isabel raised her liquid eyes to mine, sparkling through their tears; and I felt that I but echoed the words which they were uttering, as I whispered, “Such has been our course, sweet Isabel—through gloom and sorrow; and so to end—in light, and peace, and bliss!” We entered the chapel, and the same tranquillity was there. A single lamp, by the high altar, streamed over the magnificent painting that adorned the sacred spot, glanced upon the massive chalices and candlesticks of gold that stood around the shrine; and showed, nobler than all those works of art and beauty, the high pale form of the Benedictine prior. Beyond the circle of light that emanated from the single lamp, the long nave lay in mellowed gloom, save where the pure moonlight streamed through the open doorway in its natural hues, or slept upon the marble floor in variegated tints, derived from the stained glass of the lancet-shaped windows. The banners, which decorated the walls, hung silent and unshaken, and here and there some monument of whiter marble, or the panoply which hung in monumental mockery over the bones of some knight of other days, touched by a stray beam, stood out from the shadows in ghostly relief. There was no chanted mass, no pealing of the organ, or streaming of high anthems down the aisle; no plumed spectators, no gay and congratulating friends, no smiling bridemaids, no clamorous crowd without, to hail the happy couple; no witnesses to that most important ceremony in the life of man, but two of the eldest brethren of the order and the superior, who performed the solemn rite. No witness, did I say? There was a witness felt, if not seen, by two, at least, of that small company—the One Eternal Witness of every human thought as well as deed; the One who hears and registers, not only every vow, but every word that falls from the thoughtless lip; and who never, perhaps, registered the union of two hearts more single and devoted than those which were joined in that solitary chapel on that eventful night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. “The health this night must be my bed, The bracken curtain for my head, My lullaby the warder's tread; Far, far from love and thee, Mary! To-morrow eve, more stilly laid, My couch may be my bloody plaid, My vesper song thy wail, sweet maid! It will not waken me, Mary!” Lady of the Lake. The echoes of the convent clock were still ringing through the vaulted cloisters of the ancient building, when the flash of torches, and the impatient neigh and stamp of my charger in the courtyard, announced too surely that the hour appointed for my departure had arrived. At ten o'clock I had resolved, however hard the effort, to tear myself away; and, while in the newness of my feelings I imagined that it lacked at least an hour of the time, the night had worn onwards; and the hateful bells had noted the lapse of minutes, which to me and my young bride had passed unnumbered I 2 and unregarded, though never to be forgotten. To one who has gone through the regular gradations of acquaintance, intimacy, affection, love, and wedlock,—who has known, perhaps, for years, and courted for months, her who is to be the partner of his weal and wo through time at least, if not eternity,—there may, there must be rapture indescribable in the hours of intercourse, for the first time, free and unrestrained,—in the interchange of thoughts which could not well be interchanged before,—in the mutual remembrances of the first dawning of that passion which now is every thing,—and, above all, in the sense, the security, of possession. But, perfectly as I can comprehend the intense delight of such sensations, I, at the same time, feel, that being entirely different in their nature, they must also be vastly inferior in their degree, to those which I experienced during this first stolen interview of my wedded life. I had, in the brief space of a single day, gone through all those successive stages which, in the ordinary lives of men, occupy the course of many months thus combined into a single epoch: I had passed at once from utter insensibility to the opposite extreme of passion; I had become enamoured of a few strong points of character, which, as I fain to believe, no less clearly proved the existence of other excellences yet unseen, than do the towering spires that loom above the ill-defined and hazy outlines of a great city denote the position of a hundred happy homes, which will emerge from their obscurity as we draw near. I had set my all upon a single cast. If my presentiment of character were true, I had won that, in comparison of which all other treasures might indeed be counted dross; if I had erred, the happiness of a life must atone for the error. It was not therefore merely the gloating rapture of a lover blessed by a fruition of all his hopes, but the keen and thrilling scrutiny of a miser, weighing the ducats for which he has exchanged his precious wares,— the agonizing doubt of a magician, lest the pleasure or the power for which he has trafficked his immortal soul be found wanting in the balance. It was not only the actual bliss that prompted me to hang upon the silvery voice, to gaze on my own features reflected in the clear blue eyes—those mirrors of the ingenuous mind; not merely the sense that she was irrevocably and eternally my own—but the far loftier happiness of hearing in every tone, of reading in every glance, the intelligence, the brilliancy, the power, the sterling metal of a soul now linked to mine by bonds of more endurance than the adamant of old. So oppressively painful was the idea of tearing myself away from converse fit for the ears of angels,—of leaving a bride, and such a bride, in the very hour of marriage,—of leaving her never perhaps to return —for my route lay through danger, such as at another moment I should probably have courted for its own sake alone—that the glance of anger and vexation which I cast towards the casement was not wholly unmingled with hesitation. I was more than half-inclined to stay—to dare, to defy, to endure all things, save the risk of losing her. One look towards Isabel—her liquid eye was fixed, dwelling with an unutterable expression of solicitude, upon my features. “Never!” I muttered, “never!” And rising hastily, I made two strides towards the door, determined to countermand my steed; but, ere I could make a third, the soft pressure of her hand upon my shoulder, and her yet softer voice, recalled me. So thoroughly congenial were our spirits, so perfectly attuned our hearts, that she had already learned to read even a motion or a look. “No, Harry!” she said; “dearest Harry, no! Think you not that it is as hard to me, this cruel parting? Yet, though it were to anticipate the joys of heaven, I would not you should tarry. Too much have you done, too much have you risked already, and for me! It is honour that now calls—your honour, Harry; and can you think so meanly of her whom you have intrusted with your all, as that she would set that in jeopardy, and for the vile price of present pleasure? Go!— go where duty and your honour call you. Go! and may all good angels guard you!” To an appeal like this there could be no reply. To be reminded of my duty by a girl,—to be urged to the sacrifice of all—of present bliss, perhaps of future happiness—rather than to the loss of honour! If I had loved her before, I adored her now! She was, she was the very being I had conceived her from the beginning,—fair, and fond, and feminine, yet fraught with a spirit that could writhe up against the pressure of evil, and show itself in all the majesty of heroism—heroism not framed on the brute impulses of active courage, but on the rarer and far more noble principles of patient, fearless, and unmoved endurance. I caught her— strained her to my bosom—“Had all men such a counsellor, earth would have to boast a thousand heroes where now she numbers ten. Heaven— Heaven itself hath given thee to me, Isabel, to be my guardian genius, my good angel; to repress each ill desire, to confirm each nobler purpose; and Heaven will preserve to me its gift. Farewell —farewell, beloved one. What though my body leave thee—my soul remains behind. For the first, for the last time, fare thee well—my own—my only Isabel!” Many a bitter pang, many a chilling separation had I endured. I had parted from a father, a murdered corpse beneath a blazing roof-tree; from a noble brother, gored by the roundhead pikes and trampled beneath the hoofs of his own charging squadrons, which he still cheered on to glory; from a mother—the mother who had soothed my froward infancy, and taught me to bear up against the oppression of manhood's wo—perishing, slowly and miserably, by that worst of human ailments, a broken heart; from a country, for which I had lost all but life, and for which I would have lost that also, and how gladly! From all these had I been severally rent asunder; and, at each several parting, though I bore it as a man should bear, I had felt as though the very strings of my existence were strained to breaking! But now—and I shame not to write it—tears, hot tears stood in my burning eyes, and my throat swelled till it had wellnigh choked me. It was over! I pulled the hat upon my brows, strode slowly, and without daring to look back, through the echoing cloisters. Again and again I charged the prior, as he valued the approval or dreaded the rebukes of his own conscience, to protect the bride whom he himself had tied to me, in that most hallowed bond which death alone may sever. I paused not for his reply; his benedicite was uttered, perhaps for the first time, to regardless ears. I cast myself into the saddle, struck the spurs deep into the charger's side, as if distrustful of my own resolution, and dashed at once into that fierce and rapid motion by which, despite the ancient adage, men fancy they can outstrip the pursuit of care. All night long I journeyed onward; not, indeed, at the furious pace which must have soon exhausted both horse and rider, but at the steady measured trot, which, though to the eye it seem a laggard's gait, accomplishes a distant course with the greatest speed and certainty. For a brief space, my feelings were, I know not how, benumbed by the shock of parting; then, gradually, as this insensibility wore away, my spirits were depressed, beyond all that my experience had ever felt of despair: I dreamed—for my state of mind was more similar to sleep than waking—a thousand fearful things, among which, perhaps, eternal separation was the least tremendous. After a time, however, the free and somewhat chilly currents of the night air, the inspiriting sensation of quick motion, and the increasing necessity for care and vigilance, overpowered such gloomy fantasies. I fixed my thoughts steadfastly upon the work before me, and I soon perceived, that, when they did revert to all which I had left, their train became less gloomy, and tended, with an easy and gradual transition, to confidence and hope. Before the night had passed away, and while the stars were still shining in the wintry sky, I found myself humming the burden of some lively song, and guiding my horse, if not with the thoughtless buoyancy of former times, with cheerfulness at least, and even gayety of heart. The east grew pale, the morning broke brightly, and, like a harbinger of happy tidings, the great sun heaved his rim above the horizon, shooting his slant rays over field and forest, which glittered, in their frosty garb, as if they had been sprinkled with diamonds. It was a season and a scene to cheer the most despondent, and to wake reflection in the most worldly mind. At this instant, however—although their influence was not without its effect in still further dispelling the gloom which had a little while before so completely veiled my mental horizon—I was called upon to give my attention to things of a more important, if less exalted, nature, than mere reflection on the beauties of nature, or the mercies of its Great Architect. I had already completed twelve leagues of my route, and, although my own mind was too deeply interested to permit my feeling sensibly the wants of the body, I was not one to neglect the necessities of the faithful brute that bore me, and that lately had acquired so heavy a claim on my gratitude. A small hamlet, lying at a short distance from the main road, imbosomed in a wide tract of woodland, afforded me, in its snug hostelry, all the appliances of simple comfort, with the additional advantage of that secrecy which was so all-important to the success of my mission. At this place, wherein I rested till the sun was fast declining, I gained, for the first time, certain information of the troops I was hastening to command. They lay in garrison, I was told, at the town of Pont à Mousson, about ten leagues distant, consisting of three full regiments of well-appointed cavalry. With these good tidings, however, there were mingled rumours of a nature far less agreeable. The troops, it was whispered, were in a state of ill-discipline approaching to the very verge of license, unchecked by the officers, who were, for the most part, gay youths, fitter for the salons of the metropolis than for the austerities of a winter's campaign. VOL. I.—K Nor was this all: disaffection, it seems, had been creeping darkly, but not therefore the less certainly, among the population of this remote district; and the party of the Fronde had gained many partisans, though not yet avowed, among the surrounding peasantry—nay, it was even hinted that secret levies were now in progress, and that the position of the troops might, ere long, be critical enough. Such was the intelligence which I easily elicited from the garrulity of mine host; and which availed, yet more than the alteration of my state of mind, to render me alert and self-possessed. The shadows were already cast in lengthened lines from every object that intercepted the light of the setting sun, when I departed from my resting-place; and it was not long before my path lay through the total obscurity of a moonless wintry night. I did not, however, as before, pass all the hours of darkness on the road, but paused, when two-thirds of the distance were accomplished, to prepare myself for the first interview with my new followers. Nor, in truth, did I feel by any means over-confident of the result. The character I had lately heard of the men and officers whom I was about to meet, and the rude and weather-beaten state of my own person and accoutrements, would, I apprehended, be too little in unison to harmonize on a very brief acquaintance; while I felt, at the same time, that the ordeal, to which we should in all probability be exposed together, was one that would require the utmost energy and vigour in the commander, and the most implicit obedience and unity of action in the subordinates. Of myself I have hitherto said little; but a brief sketch of the person with whose inmost thoughts he is becoming acquainted, may aid the reader to form a better judgment of the position into which I was now thrown. I was, at this eventful period of my fortunes, somewhat past my thirtieth year, although—from long exposure to war and weather, and from having been cast very early upon the world under circumstances such as form the character and ripen the mind—I looked several years older. Not unusually tall, or bulky, in my person, I was both strongly and actively framed; and constant exercise and hardship had indurated my muscles to a degree that would have rendered me more than a match for many a heavier antagonist than myself. My features were irregular; not so much so, however, as to amount to ugliness, much less to vulgarity. My eye, though sunken, or, to speak more properly, deepset, was quick and clear; and my brow—now surrounded by a black fillet—broad and fully developed. My lip was shaded by a thick mustache, and, as I have elsewhere observed, I wore my hair in the long flowing curls at this time peculiar to the cavaliers. If, in addition to these, I mention, that the lower part of my face was bronzed to almost Indian redness, while my forehead retained its natural fairness,—that my arms, though not so long as to appear unsightly, or deformed, were of unusual reach,—and that, from long practice, my motions were easier, and my general appearance far more graceful, on horseback than when on foot, —no description can be more accurate. On my departure from St. Germains, my dress had been carefully selected, for other qualities than richness or display; properties which, however admirable in the court, would have been of no small disadvantage under existing circumstances. A strong, but plain, buff coat, with none of the rich silken loops or fringes of Flanders lace with which it was then the mode to deck the sternest habiliments of war; a gorget and cuirass of steel, which, although highly polished, and of the choicest metal, were neither chased nor inlaid with gold or silver; heavy jack-boots, extending far above the knee, and equipped with a pair of massive spurs; gauntlets of buff, protected on the outside by iron scales; and a slouched hat, provided with jointed cheek-pieces, and an inner lining of the same material,—such were the accoutrements of a well-appointed trooper, and with such, for the support of that character, I had furnished myself. Plain, however, and unadorned as they had appeared, when I sallied, some three weeks before, from my head-quarters, they were then at least in the highest state of order; which was more than could be said of them when I halted for the night at Beaumont. The leather of my doublet was sorely chafed, and splashed with specimens of every different soil through which my road had lain; the steel of my breastplate was curiously ingrained with rust of every hue, from the deep black of a fortnight's growth to the red stain of yesterday; my boots, guiltless of the brush, were gray and mildewed; while my castor, that Corinthian capital of a gentleman's architecture, had been shorn of its feather, and knocked into every various shape of which a Spanish beaver is susceptible. It was in vain that, during my last halt, I stuck a new feather of the loyal colours into my weather-beaten hat, and flung a bright scarf of the same die across my shoulders: I could not cheat even myself into the belief that I bore the slightest resemblance to a chef d'escadron—for such was the rank I bore— K 2 in the service of the most Christian king. The result was—as, indeed, it mostly is—that all my labour and anxiety were utterly thrown away; accident providing me with a far better introduction than the most martinet-like appearance, or the most ample letters of credence, could have afforded. It was on the second morning after my parting from Isabel, that I rode through the humble suburbs of Beaumont, into the open country which lies between that place and Pont à Mousson, now but a few miles distant. I had already journeyed, it might be for an hour, through a rich and fertile country—when a distant shout riveted my attention. It was not the deep and regular hurrah of charging troops, nor yet was it such as could be raised in any of the ordinary chances of rural labour or pastime, but a hoarse savage roar, as of an angry multitude. Immediately afterward I heard, though very remote, the blast of trumpets, and the booming of a kettle-drum. I paused, and, listening in breathless eagerness, fancied I could distinguish the heavy onward tramp of charging troops. My suspicions were confirmed by the roll of a volley of musketry, and the varied sounds of a battle-field, distinctly audible in every lull, but again lost in every freshening of the breeze. Loosening my weapon in its scabbard, I rode hastily forward, and, on clearing the brow of a small eminence, perceived below me the scene of the disturbance. A small body of cavalry, not apparently exceeding a single regiment, with royal colours displayed and music sounding, was on the point of charging for the second time, as it would seem,—since the ground was strewed with dead, and chargers were running masterless,—a large concourse—for it merited no other name—of men, whose motley costumes and irregular array betokened any thing rather than soldiers. These rustics were, however, posted with considerable skill, their front being protected by a ditch, and their right wing covered by a marshy wood, while their extreme left occupied a churchyard abutting on the high-road, and surrounded by a lofty wall. The insurgents were destitute of cavalry, and, as far as I could see, entirely unprovided with fire-arms. I had scarcely time to observe the relative position of the hostile parties, before the trumpets of the horse again sounded a charge, and they rushed headlong against the centre of the line, through ground which I now discovered, by the hampered movements of their chargers, to be little better than a morass. On arriving at the verge of the trench, which they did, not with the regular front of a well-ordered regiment, but in a broken and scattered mass, the cuirassiers poured in a heavy volley from their petronels,[2] [2] The petronel was not a pistol, but a short heavy musketoon, often with a match, or wheel-lock, and used much as the carabine of modern cavalry. throwing their adversaries into some confusion; but, on their attempting to improve this slight advantage, and cross the ditch at a deep and miry ford, the peasants broke down upon them with pike and sword, while entangled in the broken ground; mingled with the horsemen, meeting them resolutely, hand to hand; and finally beat them off in total disarray, spearing many, both officers and privates, ere they could gain the firm ground; on reaching which they were with some difficulty rallied, while the victorious countrymen retired slowly and sullenly to their main host. Such was the crisis at which it was my fortune to fall in with the outposts of my command. They were collected, when I came up to them, on a small knoll, or rocky hillock, on the very edge of the marsh, and were engaged in loud and wordy argument concerning the propriety of another attack upon the Frondeurs; which counsel was strenuously advocated by some, while others as violently demanded that they should wait the arrival of a reinforcement, which had been already summoned from Pont à Mousson. To all the evils arising from want of discipline and insubordination I had been well inured during the miserable civil wars which had, during so long a period, rent the bosom of my own fair island; but never, in all my experience of camps, had I beheld so wild and tumultuous a council as that which now met my eyes. So completely were they engrossed in their stormy debate, that I actually rode up to within ten paces of the party unchallenged, and might probably have mingled with them unnoticed; but such was not my present intention. I called out, therefore, in a clear loud voice, demanding to be conducted instantly to their commanding officer. Strange and scrutinizing glances were cast upon my dress and accoutrements as I approached, but my request was unhesitatingly complied with, and, in another moment, I was presented to a very young officer, in a splendid uniform, with a burnished casque and corslet, whose bloody brow, and arm suspended in a scarf, proved his gallantry as clearly as did his ruffled mien and angry exclamations his inability to command. “If, sir,” I said, so loudly that all might hear my words,—“if, sir, as I presume, you be the commander of the garrison of Pont à Mousson, I have the honour to present to you a mandate from his highness Cardinal Mazarin, requiring your immediate march, with all the forces at your disposal, upon the capital, whither I am authorized to conduct you. At the same time, that you may not remain ignorant of him who now addresses you, I shall—although it be not absolutely called for—display to you my commission, from the same hand, as major-general and chef d'escadron, during the pleasure of our glorious monarch Louis le Grand.” As I concluded my harangue with a well-known claptrap, which, as I had fully expected, called forth a loud shout of approbation from the licentious troopers, I perceived that the missives were considered satisfactory, and that the officer was slightly embarrassed. Determined, therefore, to anticipate his inquiries—“And now, sir,” I cried, “why do I find you here, with so small a command, and—I regret to say it—in so great disarray before a peasant foe? Why, too, this evil discipline? Fy! sir, fy!—let your subalterns get the men into array at once—this matter must be amended. St. George! but ye resemble more a band of robbers than the gallant cavaliers I trust I soon shall prove ye! Methinks I heard ye speak of reinforcements—send out videttes to reconnoitre their advance—push forward a picket of cavalry in front, to mark the motions of that canaille, with whom, God aid us, I will soon take order! And now, sir—I await your answer!” Briefly, yet not without manifest embarrassment, the Comte de Charmi—for such, he informed me, was his title—explained that he had been detached by the officer in command, with orders to disperse a body of malecontents assembled in the marshes of Beaumont; that on his arrival he had found the enemy vastly his superior in numbers, and had immediately despatched an aide for reinforcements; but that, unwilling to dishonour the corps by a palpable retreat, he had made two efforts to dislodge them, and had been repulsed in either attack with considerable loss. Scarcely had he finished his report, before the vidette returned with the intelligence that no reinforcements were in sight, although he had galloped to a height which commanded the whole line of route up to the very walls, and that consequently none were shortly to be expected. I perceived at once my opportunity—it would not do to retreat before the Frondeurs, or our march to Paris could never be accomplished—it would not do to risk my own character, either for courage or decision. The greatest hold a leader can possess over his troops is in their estimate of his abilities; and I saw at once that I could gain the confidence of mine. On even ground the enemy must prove mere chaff before the mettled horses and perfect arms of our cavalry. Their position was their only safety— my practised eye had already found its key, and I was resolved myself to carry it by a coup de main! “Accompany me to the front, Monsieur de Charml;” and, turning my horse's head, I rode slowly along the line. If there was much to blame, there was yet more to admire, in the detachment. The men were for the most part active hardy-looking youths, admirably mounted and equipped—discipline alone was wanting—and discipline, I well knew, beneath the eye of a strict and intelligent officer is soon acquired. “Gentlemen,” I cried, in high but courteous tones—“it is the pleasure of your king that I should lead you. I have found you in retreat—but I never retreat, by St. George, never! We must beat these fellows, and that too on the instant! Monsieur de Charmi, call volunteers to the front—I have need of two score men for desperate service, and—I myself shall lead them!” The young officer rode forward, and addressed a few spirited and well-chosen words to the soldiers, who were already on fire to retrieve their reputation, and then fell back a pistol-shot from the front; the bugles flourished, and, to my utter astonishment, the whole corps rode out three paces, like a single man. Highly delighted, I dashed the rowels into Bayard's flanks, and wheeled, hat in hand, to the front of their files at a gallop. “Gentlemen, and gallant comrades,” I cried, checking my horse from the top of his career so suddenly that he stood at once still as a lifeless sculpture—“words cannot tell how deeply I appreciate your confidence—nor is your confidence misplaced! Often and again, I trust, I shall experience the courage and prompt devotion of all!—at present I have but need of forty—and where all are brave, a leader can have no choice—let every tenth man leave the ranks!” The movement was executed; I dismounted, and passed on foot from man to man, examining, with my own hand and eye, the state of their arms and the condition of their steeds, and, this done, gave the word to mount. “My object, Monsieur de Charmi,” I continued, “is to carry, sword in hand, you churchyard, which forms the point d'appui of their left wing. This will I execute myself. You, with the main body, will advance in column upon their centre, slowly, VOL. I.—L and keeping your men well together. When you shall reach the dike, let your first and second troops deploy, covering your passage with the fire of their petronels, till you shall hear my bugle. Then charge! Cut your way to the rear! Wheel to the right, and you shall find me near you. Be steady, and success is certain! Forward, and let your shout be—Glory!” Without another word, I rode to the head of my volunteers, and, putting them in motion, proceeded along the highway, while De Charmi was moving on a parallel line across the marshy meadows to my left; the force of the enemy lying, as I have before described it, at right angles to the public road. As I advanced I lost sight of De Charmi's division, behind some clumps of timber-trees which lined the causeway; and, I confess, I was not a little anxious during the interval; for I shrewdly doubted the prudence of the leader, and the steadiness of his command. At this moment the sharp report of a petronel rang from the left, and was followed by the continuous rattle of a well-sustained fire. “On! on!” I shouted, and at a rapid pace we reached the angle of the churchyard, protected by walls of solid masonry at least four feet in height. The trees became thinner, and then broke off entirely. I caught a glimpse of the affair in the meadows. De Charmi's leading troops were spread out to the right and left of his main body, keeping up a beautiful and most destructive volley upon the enemy's centre, while files after files were passing the trench under the cover of the cross fire, and taking up their position with all the steadiness of veterans. “Forward!” and we dashed on, till the head of my little column was parallel with the extreme rear of the enemy's lines —“Halt, Gentlemen of France!—Left face!”— and on the instant our heads were turned against his flank. The churchyard had been occupied by those of the peasantry who were the least perfect in their equipments, and who were destitute of musketry. They were already wavering at the mere sight of our front. Still the mode of attack to which I had determined to resort was perilous in the extreme. It was to leap my whole detachment, boot and thigh, into the enclosure! With the well-trained hunters of my native island would it have been a matter of everyday occurrence; but with the comparatively ill-trained horses and unpractised riders of France it was a desperate risk. Before giving the word to charge, I cast one last glance to the centre. De Charmi's corps had passed the ford, but, strange to say, his fire was slackening, and the enemy was bearing down on him in overwhelming force. In ten words, I explained my object to my men; a loud shout was the reply. The bugler was already handling his instrument. I took my post three horses' lengths in front. I looked to my troopers—every face was grim and resolute, every sword levelled to the charge; with tightened rein and ready spur, they waited for the signal.— “Charge!”—the bugle flourished, and I dashed my good horse fearlessly against the wall. Steadily, with a long and swinging leap, he cleared the obstacle. I pulled upon the curb; he reared erect, and, ere his fore-feet touched the earth, was motionless. Towards the craven foe I never turned an eye—a thought; my whole soul was in the attack. With the rush of a whirlwind they came on; as if it were with a single motion they rose; they swept over the high masonry; they landed safely in the area; a single bullet might have grazed the bosom of every rider, so beautifully even was their advance! Unity of spirit had effected, in a single instant, that which it is the pride of the disciplinarian to bring about in the course of years. Not a horse stumbled; not a rider swerved in his seat.—“Halt! Ho!”—they were a line of statues.—“Charge again! charge!”—but the victory was bloodless. Not a single second had they paused; sauve qui peut was the word, before a single trooper stood beside me. Ten minutes more, and we had joined De Charmi—the peasant foe scattered, cut down, broken, dispersed, without a hope of rallying. An hour before, I had been a stranger, doubtful of my reception, and the men whom I commanded a mere armed mob. Now I was adored; exalted to the skies; a leader, like Bayard, sans peur et sans reprôche; and the meanest trooper of the regiment confident in his own prowess and in his general's skill. It was indeed a victory in its results. Ere the sun set, we were in Pont à Mousson. Rumour had played her part. I was the idol of my division. The regiment I had seen in action was a fair sample of the whole; well-armed, well-mounted, fearless, and full of that belief in their own valour which renders men invincible. All this was well; and, above all, we were to march TO-MORROW. L 2</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. “Sab. Herding with the other females, Like frightened antelopes. Sar. No: like the dam Of the young lion, femininely raging— And femininely meaneth furiously, Because all passions in excess are female— Against the hunter flying with her cub, She urged on with her voice and gesture, and Her floating hair and flashing eyes, the soldiers In the pursuit.” Sardanapalus. The morning was as dark as midnight; the moon had set two hours before, and not a star was twinkling in the firmament, when our bugles sounded the reveillé. Yet, unaccustomed as they were to early risings or forced marches, so perfect was the influence I had gained over the spirits both of men and officers, during the occurrences of the preceding day, that they mustered on that torch-light parade, not only without complaint or murmur, but with alacrity and glee. It was with a degree of pleasurable excitement which I cannot well describe, that I listened to their reckless exclamations, mingled with the clash of spur and scabbard, as they fell into their ranks beneath my casement; and as I descended the creaking stairs of the rude hostelry, I felt that I was no longer a homeless, helpless fugitive, but a leader well prepared to do battle—if that battle were for a crown. A more brilliant spectacle has rarely met my eyes than that which presented itself as I passed through the low doorway, and stood upon the village-green: the skies black as a funeral canopy above—the massive architectural front of the Gothic abbey on the right, its salient angles splendidly touched by the red light of the torches; and, in the foreground of the picture, three thousand gallant horsemen marshalled in one long line— their casques and corslets throwing back the glare of the flambeaux borne by their orderlies—the subalterns wheeling rapidly through their files, the restless chargers stamping and tossing their proud heads, and the banners waving in the night-wind. Scarcely, however, had my foot pressed the threshold, ere the scene was altered. As I first beheld them, all save a dozen figures were motionless as steel-clad statues; not a sound was heard but the occasional clash of armour, or the kick and scream of some vicious steed: but when I stood before my followers, not, as on the previous evening, in the rough garb of a mere mercenary trooper, but wearing, in addition to a bright helmet and breastplate, the full uniform of the corps—furnished for the occasion by the officer next in command—a shout, that might have been heard at a mile's distance, broke the silence—again and again it pealed—louder and louder yet, till the affrighted martins, fluttering down from their nests on the minster-towers, circled, with startled wing and short shrill cry, above our heads in the lurid torch-light. Words cannot depict the sensations of that moment—independent of all the gratified feelings of the man, all the military pride of the soldier, a load of care was lifted from my heart by the sincere expression of that clamour. Till I had heard “all hearts and tongues uniting in that cry,” I had been plunged in a sea of doubts, almost of fears. I had, it is true, introduced myself, and successfully, to troops bearing a character of the wildest license; I had found them, in the main, orderly and well affectioned, and had gained, in an incredibly short period, their good opinion at least, if not their love. But I had yet a harder task before me. Whether my credentials would have been deemed satisfactory, had they not been backed by a fortunate display of the bearer's prowess, was far from being a settled point; and—although it had become evident to me, in the course of the preceding evening, that the men were willing, and perhaps eager, to follow a leader who was likely to afford them a fair chance of gaining both repute and plunder in the regular routine of duty—I was, till that moment, doubtful how far they might be trusted in a matter of such delicacy as the escort and protection of a lady, whose presence might, moreover, impose a check upon the celerity of their movements and the license of their manners. But with that honest shout my hesitation vanished. Tell me not of the expression of countenance, of the flash of the eye, or the wreathing of the lip: the stoic can freeze their living language into icy indifference—the man of the world can mould them into the semblance of a smile—but let me hear the voice—the human voice—I care not whether in the familiar sounds of my childhood, or in the unknown accents of a foreign tongue—and I can read the feelings which give birth and being to those tones, as clearly as though they were written in the pages of a book. In the softest whisper or the deepest roar, I can detect—I have a hundred times detected—the lurking devil; but in that shout, although I listened as the criminal listens for the footsteps which may bear to him his reprieve, I could not catch a single note but of unanimous and heartfelt greeting. In a brief speech, pointed, and eloquent of thought, if not of words, I tendered them my thanks—spoke cheerily of success, and confidently of danger—hinted that I might, perchance, have occasion ere long to prove that loyalty which they so freely proffered—leaped on my good charger, wheeled the long line into column—gave the word to quench the torches, and to march— and in an instant all was gloom and silence, except the heavy onward tramp of the squadrons, and the lights of the town, which soon vanished behind us as we rode briskly forward. Before the morning dawned, we had already passed the scene of the preceding day's engagement; and as we filed along the causeway, I could hear the stifled merriment and whispered conversation of the soldiers, recounting to their comrades the various incidents of that brief conflict. It was evident that they were all in the highest spirits, full of emulation between themselves, and of ardour against the foe—the men who had already fleshed their swords, eager to maintain their place in my opinion, and those whom fortune had not yet favoured, burning to achieve an equal reputation. At noon we halted to refresh our horses, and to dine the men, in the hamlet at which I had paused during my upward march; and great was the surprise of mine host at recognising, in the leader of a gallant squadron, the weather-beaten and neglected trooper whom, two short days before, he had treated with scant courtesy. Here it was that an event occurred which, although in itself of little moment, had the effect of bringing down my spirits from the pitch to which they had towered, and of rendering me miserably anxious during the remainder of our march. On going out, after a brief repast, into the inn-yard, for the purpose of inspecting the horses of the troopers, and seeing with my own eyes that no means were left untried for maintaining their condition, I was struck by observing a fresh horse-track, which certainly had not been there when we filed an hour before through the arched gateway. I know not why it was, but at the instant of my discovering that some one had left the inn since our arrival, a deep presentiment of coming evil crossed my mind. I actually shuddered at the idea which, with the rapidity and nearly the force of lightning, flashed upon my soul. “Sergeant le Vasseur,” I cried, to a fine young orderly busily employed in rubbing dry the fet-locks of a vicious charger—“Sergeant le Vasseur, has any one gone hence on horseback since the troops marched in, or whence this hoof-track?” Two or three voices were raised at once in reply, that a servitor, apparently of a noble family, who had been in the hostelry when we entered, had immediately proceeded to the stables, saddled a fine and highly-blooded jennet, with marks of extreme haste, and ridden away on a hard gallop. “Ha!” I exclaimed, more deeply annoyed than I was willing to admit; “ha!—but it matters not! Let the men get to horse—we have yet a long day's march before us, and the sun has already passed the meridian. To horse—sound trumpets!” and, for a space, all was confusion, noise, and bustle. During the tumult, I returned to the hostelry, and, calling for a measure of the best, took the opportunity of inquiring concerning the stranger. What I learned was far from quieting my apprehensions. It was, to the best of his recollection, the landlord said, on the afternoon of the day which I had passed beneath his roof, that the servant had arrived. He had questioned him closely concerning the travellers who had passed that way lately; and I could easily judge from the speaker's manner, that he had acquired all the information concerning me which could be derived from the limited knowledge and unlimited garrulity of mine host. Here he had remained, living of the best, and paying with lavish liberality, until our approach had scared him from his roost. When, in addition to this, I learned that his liveries were tawny, guarded with blue lace, my fears wanted no further confirmation: that I had been tracked was evident; and I was painfully apprehensive that some deadly evil was meditated, in the only quarter where evil would be intolerable. Still there was no remedy; I was pressing on as quickly as was consistent with certainty, and a few hours must bring about a solution of my terrors. “Monsieur de Charmi,” I cried to my second in command—“it was my original purpose to have halted for the night at Bar le Duc, but we must on to St. Dizier, though we trespass on the hours of darkness. Our route is noted, and I have fearful reason to press forward. Think you the horses of the third regiment can hold out? they are somewhat jaded even now.” “I doubt it not, sir; they are well-blooded and in good condition, though somewhat under-sized; but should the worst occur, Colonel le Chaumont's VOL. I.—M regiment is fresh, and, if you deem it good, can march with ease to St. Dizier, and accomplish the distance in two hours less time than the division;”— he paused for a moment; but, seeing that I offered no reply, continued, though not without some hesitation—“and if a single regiment might serve your turn to-night, I dare be sworn to join you with the rest ere daybreak.” “It shall be so, sir,” I replied, eagerly grasping at the idea—“see Chaumont's regiment equipped at once, and in their lightest marching order: let St. Agreve's regiment bring their baggage up to-morrow; and, hark ye, sir—I trust all to your prudence, and a heavy trust it is.—On no account delay. There must be no fighting that can by any means—by any means I say, sir—be avoided. If you must fight, tarry not for pursuit or victory— cut your way through whatever shall oppose your advance, though it be ten times your force. Join me, if possible, to-night; but I leave it to your discretion to halt, if so it must be, at Bar le Duc, or even at Villotte; but, at the latest, I shall look for you before to-morrow's noon! Farewell, sir, fare ye well; be prudent, and be fortunate!” And, clapping spurs to Bayard, I led the freshest regiment of my division, at a pace which I should hardly have ventured to adopt, had I not been fully aware that night was fast approaching. It was nearly four o'clock in the afternoon when we reached Bar le Duc; but my horses were so fresh, that, after a brief halt, I hurried on towards St. Dizier, about three miles to the right of which lay the convent of St. Benedict aux Layes. In this manner we continued to advance, as fast as prudence and the state of the roads would permit; still, however, the shades of evening were closing fast around us, as we entered the woody country which lies on all sides of the little village of Saudrupt, on the river Saulx. The road, for the most part, ran between high banks of reddish sand, clothed on either hand with a stunted undergrowth of ash and hazel, mingled with a few still verdant hollies, and with dark patches of the prickly furze; it was, in parts, overflowed with water, which by the rigour of the season had been converted into broad sheets of ice. Wherever these occurred, I had continually observed the horse-track which had caused me so much uneasiness, deeply dinted into the smooth surface. The horse had been shod with a bar-shoe on the near foot before, so that I had not the least difficulty in distinguishing the prints from those of the country garrons which had occasionally crossed or followed the highway. We were just entering one of the deepest of those sandy gorges which I have described, when the report of a musket rang, with its oft-repeated echoes, through the woodland; and after a moment's pause, the horse of the vidette who had preceded us galloped madly back upon our main body, with the rein dangling loose from his head, and the carcass of the unfortunate trooper, who had bestridden him a few seconds before in all the pride of vigorous manhood, dragged by the stirrup, and leaving a long trace of gore upon the frozen road. My resolution was taken on the instant. Shrewdly suspecting an ambuscade, and perfectly convinced of the importance of forcing the obstacle, I dismounted three or four files, spreading them out as skirmishers on either flank, to clear the woods by the fire of their petronels. I then put myself at the head of my best troop; and pressed steadily forward, keeping my front, however, a few paces in the rear of the skirmishers, who performed their duty with intelligence and activity, darting from tree to tree as they advanced, and beating every covert that could conceal a lurking foeman. In a few moments the flash of the right-hand flanker's petronel, sending its bright stream of flame through the increasing darkness of the coppice, announced that the enemy was discovered. A more beautiful effect I never witnessed than the brilliant running fire that ensued: but little time had I at that moment to think of sights or sounds; for, the object of their advance having been effected, the skirmishers were already retiring to their horses, while the troopers whom they had dislodged, dashing into the open path, and discharging their pistols at the head of our column, fled furiously along the road. At a glance I recognised the liveries of the hindmost rider, and the figure of the Andalusian jennet—on the instant I comprehended the object of the attack. The small number of the assailants proved at once that no check upon the column could have been intended—murder—my murder was contemplated. The villain had observed, on the entrance of our squadrons into the courtyard of the inn, that I had ridden foremost. His aim had been unerring, although the gloom of the evening had prevented his discovering the features, or even the accoutrements, of his victim with sufficient accuracy. My blood in my veins, as I whirled my good rapier from its sheath, and, dashing the spurs into my charger's flank, charged with a fierce shout full on the retreating ruffians. Ere I had overtaken the little group, which I did, as it appeared to me, in a dozen bounds, the servant, M 2 whose capture was my principal inducement to pursue, had outstripped the whole of his party. The first man I reached, seeing that he had no hope of safety in flight, attempted to wheel his horse and face me; but the attempt was his destruction. I was too close to his haunches when he commenced the manœuvre, and, before he could complete it, I was upon him. In full career, the broad chest of Bayard struck the flank of his charger, as he turned; over he went, and over, regaining his feet only to be cut down by the troopers who followed me, while I, unmoved by the slight shock, held onward. One other, as I passed him standing in my stirrups, I struck full on the head-piece with my rapier's point; and the heavy clang of his armour, as he fell, alone told me the consequences of the blow. Scattering to the right and left, as I drove through them, the rest avoided me, to perish by the weapons of my men; for, unwilling to waste time upon the mere accomplices, I spurred hard upon the traces of the principal. Fiercely, however, as I rode, I soon perceived that I gained nothing on the fugitive; and that there was no option but to suffer him to escape, or to desert my troops with scarcely a possibility of again effecting a junction. I was therefore compelled to pull up, and to gaze upon the wretch, to secure whose capture I would have sacrificed willingly the sum of all my earthly goods, carrying off the news of his frustrated effort, and of my approach, to those who, I too well knew, would profit by the intelligence. Words cannot express the misery I endured, as I was compelled to creep along at the slow pace of the troops; while my mind, darting over the well-remembered road, had already arrived at the place of my destination. Miles appeared to my excited fancy leagues, minutes dragged along like hours: the attempt to describe the images of evil that crossed the horizon of my excited mind would be a mere absurdity; words cannot describe them. By my honour, I shook in my steel-bound saddle at every shadow that fell across my path; I started at every howl of the wolves from the near forest; I grasped my ready weapon a hundred times at the sight of some gray pollard-tree, decked with the glitter of the rising moonbeams, and converted, to my heated fancy, into the guise of an armed foeman. At length we reached the brow of the last hill, from which the land slopes, in a gradual and park-like sweep, down to the banks of the Marne. About midway of the declivity stood a small hamlet, bosomed in its orchards, and at its foot the well-known convent of St. Benedict aux Layes. The moon had risen brilliantly, the firmament was cloudless, and every object lay for miles bathed in a radiance as pervading as the glare of daylight, though far less gorgeous in its hues. The population of the district, quiet and happy rustics, had long since sunk upon their careless pillows. Not a light glanced from the windows, as we passed the cabins on the outskirts of the village; not a sound was heard throughout the wide expanse of country that lay before us, buried, as it were, in dreamless slumbers, save the long howl of a mastiff swelling upon the gale, as he bayed the queen of night, or the wailing cry of the night-owl from his ivyed tower. So calm was the scene beneath my eyes, so free from every sound or sight of danger, and so nearly had I reached the haven of all my hopes, that I had already begun to deem my previous terrors the mere wanderings of an excited fancy. We reached the little green before the village inn, and, in ten words, I gave the orders for the night to the officer next in command. The convent was but a bare mile distant. Outposts were to be detailed upon our flanks and rear, a picket to be pushed forward to the river's brink, and connected, by a chain of sentries, to the convent, and thence to the corps de garde. Subalterns were selected for the various duties of the night; the freshest men and horses were drafted for service; and then, accompanied by the files which were to guard our front, I bade a cheery adieu to my bold lieutenant, and cantered on my way with a heart almost at ease. So completely had I recovered from the temporary depression of spirits into which I had been thrown, that I was occupied as I rode along, not merely in looking forward to the delight of clasping in my arms the form of her whom I as yet could hardly call my own, but in building up gay edifices in the dark futurity,—edifices soon to fade into sorrow and desolation. I did not, however, in the exhilaration of the moment, forget to apply the means necessary to the maintenance of my happiness. At regular intervals I posted my sentries, exercising to the utmost the military fore-sight which, acquired by long and hard experience, had at length become almost intuitive. On the crest of every hillock, in the slack of every valley, did I dispose one of my trusty followers; so that eye might answer to eye, and voice to voice, along the entire chain. The last guard I left at the fork of the road leading from the highway, through two deep meadows, to the conventgate. The non-commissioned officer and dozen men who had been detailed to perform the duty of videttes saluted, and rode forward. All was at last accomplished. I stood within a stone's throw of my bride; friends were around me on every side, watchful, well-armed, and trusty; the silence of security and peace brooded upon those holy walls. I breathed a heartfelt prayer of gratitude to the Giver of all good; dismounted from the noble beast, which had in truth suffered all and won all for his master, flung his rein to the orderly who had accompanied me, and strode with light steps and a happy spirit towards the temporary dwelling of my Isabel. I could hear, as I pursued my way, the receding clatter of the hoofs, and the successive challenges of sentry after sentry, as my servant hurried to rejoin his comrades; and so still was the night, that the guargling of the river sounded distinct and near. It was already long past midnight; and the lamp which burned before the patron saint above the gateway was already waning in its socket: just as I raised my hand to strike the wicket, it leaped brightly upwards, fluttered for a moment, flashed up again yet higher than before, and expired. Was it an omen? My heart, at least, acknowledged it as such; and the hot streams that had been hurrying thither in the fierce eagerness of expectation, ebbed coldly. I shrunk back, dismayed, I knew not wherefore! It was—by heaven! I believe it, firmly, faithfully, as I believe the Gospel—that sudden chill was ominous! Ere I had rallied from the momentary start, a voice, a shrieking voice—that I had heard once, only once before, and never can forget— rang, like the blast of the eternal trumpet which all must hear and answer, in my trembling ears. I sprang backward from the untouched gate, firm and collected; for not from that direction came the fatal clamour. Again—again—from the rear of the building—again it pealed, clearer and nearer than before; harrowing up my nerves, and driving my blood, now boiling with tenfold heat, through every vein and artery. “Harry!” it cried, “Harry! Save—save me—now or never!” A wall was on either side, some five feet high, but ivy-grown and time-worn. With a single effort of hand, foot, and eye, I reached the summit of the right-hand boundary; for that way was the voice. There was a ditch below me—a wide, yawning ditch. I saw it not—heeded it not—for, scarce thirty yards distant, I beheld a ladder propped against a turret window; at its foot there was a busy, silent group; and half-way from its summit, two armed figures—their corslets glittered in the rays of light that streamed from out the open casement—bearing with forcible yet careful grasp a struggling, shrieking female. Tottering, as I stood on that frail summit, I discharged my pistol, aimlessly, as I thought—for my object was but the recall of my soldiers; yet— as I saw even in that instant of dread anxiety —it took effect. At one bound I cleared the trench, alighted firmly on my feet, and, sword in hand, rushed to the rescue. My signal had reached wakeful ears: I heard shout answering to shout along the line; and then the gallop of the nearest picket came thickly up the tremulous wind. “Isabel!” I shouted, “Isabel! fear nothing— it is I!” I was within a spear's length of the spot whereon she stood, struggling in the sacrilegious grasp of the same cavelier who had so closely pressed our flight three days before. My muscles were braced, my weapon raised for the death-blow, when a bright glare was shot into my very eyes. I felt two sharp quick strokes, on my sword-arm and my left side; a deadly sickness—a swimming of the brain—and all was darkness. Faintly, and as it were in a dream, I heard a cry, a struggle, and a shot—no more! I had no note of time. I half-unclosed my eyes; I turned them upward, and, bestriding me, I saw—her blue eyes flashing, her lip curling, and her nostril dilated—that tall fair girl. Her light brown hair—the fillets which had restrained it rent asunder—streamed on the night-wind. Erect she stood and fearless, as a Judith or a Jael, braving the armed oppressor. In her hand, her delicate white hand, a pistol— my own pistol—shone to the clear moonshine. I gazed upon her, wonderingly, in my delirium, and I knew her not—yet it was SHE. For a moment the dark figures shrunk from before her, cowed like base and carrion vultures in the presence of a royal eagle. There was a rush, a shouting, and a tumult; yet my eyes were fixed, fascinated, as it were, upon that form of superhuman beauty. Another flash—and my eyes closed, my brain reeled, sicker and more dizzy than before. I strove to rise, fell, and—to all knowledge of myself or consciousness of things around me—was dead for many days. VOL. I.—N</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. “Adam. Master, go on; and I will follow thee To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty. From seventeen years till now almost fourscore Here lived I, but now live here no more. At seventeen years many their fortunes seek; But at fourscore it is too late a week: Yet fortune cannot recompense me better, Than to die well, and not my master's debtor.” As You Like It. It was long before I again awoke to any distinct consciousness of my situation, or even of my personal identity. Senseless, indeed, I was not— if by that word is meant the utter oblivion of all external things, the total absence of thought, even in its most dreamy form, the entire suspension of every mental faculty, such as we occasionally experience in that deep and unrefreshing slumber which follows extreme exertion and consequent lassitude both of mind and body. Widely different from this was the state in which I lay, as I have been since informed, for the space of seven days and as many nights. During this time I was tormented by an unskilful chirurgeon, who nevertheless succeeded in extracting two bullets which had lodged in different parts of my frame—was transported from St. Benedict aux Layes to St. Germains, a distance of many leagues, over rough and perilous roads, in such rude vehicles as could be pressed into service— was nearly captured in several instances by Guerilla bands of the Frondeurs—and was at length, after much danger and actual suffering, deposited in my own quiet lodgings, at the pretty town which was at that period the abode of the court. During the whole of this time, although entirely incapable of recognising individuals, or even of comprehending what had befallen me, I was keenly sensible of pain,and,even worse than pain—if such a seeming paradox can be understood—of my own insensibility. There was a dizzy swimming consciousness in my mind, a knowledge that all was not right with me, and a constant struggle, as it were, to arouse myself from the unnatural stupor which I could perceive to have fallen upon me. At times I would catch a glance of unforgotten faces, and hear the sounds of familiar voices—at times the words would reach my understanding, and I could discover myself to be the subject of discourse; but ere I could concentrate my thoughts, or fix the floating fancies, the impressions themselves would pass away. At times it seemed as though I were communing with persons whom, even in my mental aberration, I knew to be no longer dwellers on earth; yet, whenever I would endeavour to reflect, to argue my senses into reason, or to deduce effects from causes, all became at once a whirling chaos, a deep unfathomable void. Then would events which had occurred long years before mingle in strange and horrible confusion with the scenes and deeds of yesterday: —yet was there a method in my madness—a connecting link between each terrible delusion—a continuous thread in every delirious dream. Now I was fighting hand to hand in that last charge on the red field of Marston, when Cromwell's iron-sides retrieved the half-lost fight—now was I gazing on the slaughtered body of my father, out-stretched, as when I saw it last, upon his own extinguished hearth, the thin gray hairs clotted with blood, and the sword, faithless in his utmost need, shivered in his lifeless grasp—now I was struggling in the eddies of the wintry Marne, the sullen waters gurgling above my head; yet still in every scene one form was present, one countenance for ever stamped upon my soul—now pale as death, with eyelids closed, and with dishevelled hair, as when I bore her in my arms on the morning of our eventful meeting—now smiling sadly through her tears— now radiant with the happiness of hope—now cold, distorted, sprinkled with gouts of blood! Rather, a thousand times rather, would I brave the most abhorred realities, than again pass through that fearful twilight of the mind, that dark struggle between reason and madness, those “doubts more dreadful than despair.” Fever and delirium were at work with my enfeebled body and shattered spirit; while, through all, and over all, the consciousness of real misery, remembered when its cause was all forgotten—waking or sleeping, night or day—hag-rode my senses, a companion as inseparable as the dark avengers of Orestes. Never shall I forget the morning on which the clouds were rolled away from my eyes—on which reason began to dawn faintly at first, but with a gradual and increasing light—on which I became aware, first of the visible objects around me, then of my own existence, of my own desolation. The earliest sensations of the change were exquisite: a freedom from pain—a calm voluptuous languor—an absence of all excitement—a perception of sweet sounds, and of the blessed daylight. It was, I believe, a casual strain of music beneath N 2 my windows, the chance melody of some wandering Switzer, an exile, like myself, from his far father-land, that aroused me from the lethargic sleep in which I had been plunged. I unclosed my eyes, aimlessly and unconscious of myself; and the mild radiance of the early morning fell, tempered by a veil of sea-green silk that had been drawn across the casements, full upon their dazzled balls. I shrunk back and closed them for an instant, dizzied and drunk with the excess of light, although in truth it was hardly more than a summer's evening twilight that found its way into that shaded chamber; cautiously I opened them again, and, avoiding the quarter from which the unusual brightness had before annoyed me, suffered them to wander carelessly around the well-known room. They had not, however, roved far or for a long time over their little circle, before they rested upon objects which, had they been presented to me at a time when I had less reason to doubt the accuracy of my senses, would have tempted me to question their reality at the least, if not my own sanity. It was, indeed, my own humble home—my limbs were stretched on the same lowly couch— the same carved rafters were above my head— around me the same well-remembered hangings of Cordovan leather, quaintly embossed and gilded— the same narrow casements, with their diamond panes and heavy freestone transoms—the same grotesquely sculptured arch of oak yawning above the ample hearth. There hung my Milan corslet, an honorary gift of the unhappy Charles!—there my plumed morion and trusty petronel!—there the good sword which I had wielded to no purpose against the iron veterans of the Parliament, never to be unsheathed again, or wielded in a less noble cause!—there stood the brass-bound chest, which had conveyed the relics of my shipwrecked fortunes from the land of my fathers—above it the tattered standard I had rescued in the last skirmish of the cavaliers from a stern fanatic, who lost his trophy and his life together!—and there, upon the oaken trivet, with its crimson velvet binding and its clasps of massive silver—there lay my mother's Bible! Dreamily, and as yet but half-awakened, I surveyed these familiar objects with that indefinite sense of pleasure which attaches to the humblest abode we have hallowed with the name of home; when suddenly a brighter gleam shot through an opening of the ill-adjusted curtain, and fell in a line of rich lustre on the opposite wall; my eye, as it became accustomed to the increase of light, followed the moving beam. It rested on a picture—a bright, glorious, almost breathing portrait—it was the portrait of my mother. Oh, what a charm there dwells about that holiest of names—a mother! The pale and somewhat melancholy face, the dark and liquid eye, the braided hair, the faded flowers in the hand, —it was the same dear picture which I had compared a thousand times with the still more dear original, rendered, as it were, immortal by the rich pencil and unfading colours of Antonio Vandyke. Before I had found time to wonder at its being there, fresh cause for wonderment flashed on me; for, below the picture, there lay extended on the oaken floor a superb English bloodhound—of enormous size and muscle, jet-black, except a tawny spot on either side his brow, and a broad patch of the same hue upon his chest; his head was couched between his lion-like paws, which themselves were half-concealed by the long sweeping ears that marked his breed. Faint as I was and feeble, I recognised the noble brute at once—old Hector, the choicest leader of my father's staghounds. I made an effort to arise, still doubtful whether the objects before me were not the coinage of my distempered fancy; but hardly had I set my foot on the uncarpeted floor, before a strange sense of sickness seized me—my head grew dizzy—my eyes swam round, and were obscured. I had misjudged my own powers, and the weakness still remaining upon me, after the fever which had given it birth had departed, conquered both mind and body—I had fainted. I did not, however, on this occasion continue senseless for any length of time; the last sound which caught my ears, ere my mind was utterly bewildered, was a slight rustle, as of a person rising, from a more distant corner of the chamber, to which my attention had not as yet been called; and although my subsequent dizziness prevented me from discovering the figure of him who had caused the noise, I did not on that account the less profit by his exertions in my behalf. It was but a moment ere I became sensible of a grateful coolness on my brow, and of a strong aromatic perfume; then I felt the pressure of a hand, which, though hard in its texture, yet moved tenderly over me, trembling as it were with the exertions it made to be more delicate and gentle than nature had intended, as it chafed my hands and bathed my burning temples. Just as I was becoming fully master of myself, though my eyes were still closed, a long low whine rose upon my ear, accompanied by the peculiar sound of a dog's tail striking the floor as it is wagged heavily to and fro in some strong emotion of the animal. At once I raised my head, and saw—although I could not for a while believe my senses—the face of one whom I had long considered as numbered with the dead—whom I had seen borne out of his saddle and trodden down, as I imagined, beneath the hoofs of a routed army—an old and faithful, though an humble friend—my father's foster-brother, and my own most trusty follower—old Martin Lydford! Years have now passed away since that hour of recognition—years have passed away since I laid his bones beneath the very yew-tree which he himself had designated—in the remote and rural churchyard of his English birthplace; yet never have I ceased to bear the old man's countenance engraved on the very tablets of my heart, as when it met my bewildered gaze on that unforgotten morning. He was an aged man even then, though many years younger than his patrician foster-brother: his hair and heavy eyebrows, as well as the thick short mustache upon his upper-lip, were white as the driven snow; though his strong decided features were still richly coloured with the hale and healthful tints that might have well beseemed a man some dozen years his junior. Pleasure and anxiety were struggling for the mastery in his lineaments; but when he perceived that I had recognised him, the more powerful emotion conquered; the firm muscles about his mouth worked convulsively. I could see his bare neck swell and choke, as it were, with the violence of his struggles to repress the exhibition of feelings which his habitual self-restraint had taught him to hold womanish and trifling: but it would not do; the big tears gushed thick and scalding from his aged eyelids, he threw his arms about my neck, and as his gray head sunk upon my shoulder, he lifted up his voice—to use the simple and affecting words of Holy Writ—he lifted up his voice, and wept! “My master,” he sobbed out at length, “my dear, dear master—have I then found you once again? Never—oh never will I quit you more! Promise me—promise your old faithful follower, that he shall never quit you. Old I am, indeed, and wellnigh worthless; yet well, I wot, can love and prompt devotion supply the place of strength— ay, and of youth itself. Let me but be about your person, and I will bear your banner in the field, where greener limbs and hotter hearts would flinch from charging. Never did vassal follow lord as I will follow thee; never did woman wait upon her lover's eye as I will wait on thine, my master and my son!” Weak as I was from the effects of my long confinement, the old man's vehemence, and the violent excitement it produced on my shattered nerves, were almost overpowering. I sunk back upon my pillow exhausted for the moment, but with a calm and painless exhaustion. “Fool, fool that I am!” he cried, “I have slain him with my madness.” “Fear not, Good Martin—fear not,” I faltered forth—“I shall be well anon—'tis nothing.” But the sudden revulsion had been, in truth, too much for me, and, despite the utmost attentions of the old man, I again relapsed into insensibility; nor did I awaken from it till the blood was flowing freely from a vein which had been opened in my unwounded arm. As I was gradually returning to my senses, I saw, through my half-closed eyelids, a tall figure standing beside my pallet, supporting in one hand my arm, while with the other he replaced the lancet he had just been using in a small case at his belt. His features were strange to me, but, by his dress and accountrements, exhibiting a ludicrous blending of the mediciner and martialist—the boots, cuirass, and long rapier dangling from his thigh belonging as clearly to the latter, as did the dark uncurled periwig, broad linen band, and chirurgical apparatus to the former, character —I knew him at once for the surgeon of the regiment. Around him were collected a group of noble-looking men, all clad in the half-armour of the day, and wearing the scarfs of white and gold which had been assumed by the court-faction, in opposition to the blue colours of the Frondeurs. In several of these I recognised familiar faces; but it was with absolute astonishment that I discovered in the principal personage no less a character than our general-in-chief—the gallant Prince of Condé. “Good, good!” were the first words I heard uttered by the strange figure at my side—“he revives; the danger is past, and in another week, your highness, we will set this gallant in the saddle.” “Pray God you may—pray God you may,” replied the prince, “for we are short of men and officers already; and if this news be true, that Turenne has declared against us—and if he march to aid these cursed Frondeurs, as they say he will, with twenty thousand Switzers from the Rhine— ay, or with half the number—we shall be hardly set to hold our own. Besides, De Charmi tells us wonders of this Mornington—a pupil of hot-headed Rupert, and better than his tutor in a charge. Tête gris, we have no such overstock of leaders that we can spare a good one; but, silence!—he VOL. I.—0 awakes! How fare you, sir?” he continued, perceiving that I looked about me; “how fare you now? We thank you for your gallantry, young sir, and shall rejoice to see you once again at the head of those brave fellows you have brought up to us so happily.” “I hear your highness's words,” I answered, “but hardly catch their meaning. Am I then at St. Germains—and are the troops come up? Methinks I led them not—I pray your pardon—but I am somewhat forgetful!” “You are, sir, at St. Germains—for which we thank your valour and your skill. What you had so successfully begun, De Charmi as successfully accomplished—your division is attached to our command. You must recover quickly—once more on foot, and we shall find you work enough to warm you! And now, sir, we shall leave you—Monsieur le Médecin here frowns on us even now for trespassing so long on his dominion. To horse, fair sirs, to horse—and let us see if Noirmoutier will drive us, as he boasts to have done yesterday. Allons! to horse!” And with his glittering cortège the gay prince passed onward, equally prepared to fight or to intrigue, in that strange spirit of levity which was no less the characteristic of these civil wars of France than stern fanaticism had been that of the more sanguinary struggles in my native land. The surgeon lingered behind for a moment to whisper some directions to old Martin, who, with affectionate pertinacity, had constituted himself at once my squire of the body and sick-nurse—poured some dark-coloured fluid into a goblet of tisanne which stood beside my pillow—pressed my hand with an assurance that I should be a new man on the morrow, and left the chamber. I could hear the scabbard of his rapier rattling on every step as he descended, and the clatter of his horse's hoofs as he galloped away to join the general and his mercurial train, probably with the avowed intention of balancing the cure of one wounded man by putting a dozen others hors de combat. After they had all departed, my head at once became more clear—my memory of events returned in nearly its accustomed power, and with my memory an all-engrossing desire to learn my fate—the fate of Isabel. “Martin,” I whispered, in a low hoarse note, “come hither! I know that they have charged you to keep me in ignorance and in quiet; but I—I charge you, by the love you bear me—as you would wish to see brighter and better days in company with me—I charge you, tell me all! How came I hither?—how long since?—where is the Lady Isabel?” “God be merciful to him!” I heard the old man mutter to himself; “the fit is on him again; the fever has settled on his brain.” I saw at once that he knew nothing of what had passed—I saw at once that Isabel was lost to me. Yet, sudden as was the shock, I was calm—I was determined to be calm—I was determined to live— to recover speedily, that speedily I might devote myself to the rescue of her for whom alone I cared to live at all. “You think me mad,” I continued, after a moment's pause, and in more composed and natural tones; “but it is not so. Listen to my words attentively, and fulfil my bidding! Nay,” I cried, with a raised voice, as I saw him about to interrupt me with some trite caution—“nay, I will speak! I have been ill!—I know it—desperately ill, and wellnigh frantic!—but now my pulse is steady, my head cool, my senses perfect. I see my mother's picture, which you, I know not how, must have brought hither—I see old Hector, who has likewise followed you; lastly, I see and know yourself, whom I have long thought dead—my oldest, my truest, and my only friend! Judge now if I be mad, or fever-stricken. You know that I am neither. Then choose whether to obey my bidding, and to be, what I have ever deemed you, my second father, or to give up the man whom you have followed from his childhood upward—to betray me, at my utmost need, to utter misery— hopeless despair!” “Say not—oh, say not,” he cried, “such heart-rending words! Obey? I will obey you to the death! To your death and mine own I will obey you—doubt me not, only doubt me not, and I will obey you ever—ever!” “Then hear me—I am wedded—wedded, though none know it but the priests who made us one— and He from whom naught can be hidden. I was compelled to leave her, while I went on this accursed mission—I returned—I found them tearing her from the asylum to which she was committed. I fell, pierced with these fatal wounds—I know no more! Whether she be lost to me for ever—immured from my love in that dark prison-house, from which no mortal arm can win her; or severed from me by the violence of ruffians, from whose power my own good blade may rescue her— I know not—but I will know—though all the leeches —all the monarchs upon earth forbid it! I must know, and shortly; or madness will relieve my misery! Speak out, old man, and truly: hast thou O 2 heard aught, or canst conjecture aught of this? I charge thee speak!” “Nothing—be Heaven my witness—nothing!” “Thou knowest De Charmi—him who, I doubt not, bore me hither—hath he said naught—nor hinted?—what, nothing?—Go, then, and speedily —tell him that I would speak with him this night— this very night—let him not say thee nay!—tell him, an he refuse, that he shall pay the penalty of his refusal, on the same hour that Harry Mornington shall leave the bed of sickness! And, hark thee— seek out the subaltern who was about my person on that accursed night—do this—speedily do this, and secretly—so wilt thou perform more to further my well-being than all the leeches in the universe. Away!—but hold—give me to drink—I will lie down and try to sleep—so shall my mind be keener and my body stronger, when they have room for action!” He handed the goblet to my grasp—and, with the thirst of lingering fever and of strong excitement, I drained it to the very dregs. It must have contained some powerful and soothing opiate; for scarcely had I removed it from my lips, before a strange voluptuous dizziness seemed to steep all my senses in forgetfulness. First I lost my sorrows and my fierce anxiety; then I sunk into a sweet dreamy state of happiness—a rich confusion of luxurious thoughts and blissful fantasies—my ears were filled, as it seemed, even to intoxication, with angelic harmonies; my nostrils with super-human perfumes; my vision was bathed in a flood of lustrous but undazzling radiance: one by one these delicious sensations seemed to glide away from me, yet left no void behind—all vanished, and I was buried, for the first time in many days, in the deep repose of unconscious and oblivious slumber.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. “In this trust, I bear, I strive, I bow not to the dust; That I may bring thee back no faded form, No bosom chilled and blighted by the storm; But all my youth's first treasures when we meet, Making past sorrows, by communion, sweet.” Records of Woman. So powerful had been the soporific contained in the beverage I had quaffed so eagerly, that, far from being able to receive and interrogate the persons I had summoned to attend my bedside on the same evening, I did not awake from my heavy repose till the sun of the succeeding day was high in the heavens. The promise of the chirurgeon had, moreover, been fully borne out by the improvement I already experienced; for scarcely had I raised my head from the pillow, before I was sensible that the fever had entirely departed. My pulse was cool and regular; the burning heat of my limbs had been replaced by a healthful moisture; and, above all, that fearful dizziness of the brain which had come upon me on the preceding day, after every exertion, whether of mind or body, how much soever I struggled against it, had yielded to the unruffled calm which has ever been the character of my mental habit, when undisturbed by powerful excitement. I was not now, as when I had awakened from my stupor on the past morning, entirely alone; for one of the first objects which caught my eye was a tall casque of highly-burnished steel, with a nodding plume, standing upon the oaken table; an embroidered glove and sheathed sword lay beside it. The next instant showed me that they belonged to the Count de Charmi, who was sitting by the hearth, playing with the long ears of my bloodhound, as he waited till my protracted slumbers should draw to an end. The slight rustle I caused in changing my position had already attracted his attention; and his eyes were turned upon my countenance with an expression of sincere pleasure, such as I could hardly expect to see manifested by one who had so lately been a stranger. “By my faith!” he cried, “I am right glad to see you look thus cheerily again, De Mornington! You will be yet in the saddle time enough to share the honours of this most ennobling war.” And the young man laughed with an air of reckless contempt, as though the very idea that citizens and burghers should presume to wield the weapons of a soldier were in itself absurd. “How fare you now?” he continued; “your wounds are healing, as old Martin tells us, and your eye, this morning, looks almost as brightly as its wont; yet is your brow grave—your countenance downcast. Your good old servant told me, too, last night, that you would speak with me on matters of great import. Say, is there aught in which I can assist you? If it be so, I do beseech you to command me. I am not—I assure you, sir, I am not one to proffer services to every new acquaintance, nor to make vaunts which I intend not to perform; but you, I know not how it is, have won our hearts. Nor is there in our ranks a common trooper but would support your honour with his life. Contrary to my allegiance or my good fame I know you never will require me to act; and bating these, there is nothing that man can do but I will do it.” “There is no need,” I replied, more cheerfully than I had spoken before, for sympathy is ever a sure key to the affections—“there is no need of such a pledge, Monsieur de Charmi; nor am I about to ask aught at your hands, save some slight information concerning subjects the nearest to my heart. I do beseech you to deal with me plainly and freely in this matter, as you would yourself be dealt with by another. And, firstly, saw you aught of a lady, or heard you aught from the soldiers, on the night when I received my wounds at St. Benedict aux Layes?” “You forget, sir, I imagine,” was the prompt reply, “that I was left in command of the rear-guard on that unlucky evening, and halted, according to orders, at Bar le Duc. When I arrived the next forenoon, I found you senseless in the hostelry, under the hands of the leech; and the regiment which had marched with you, in arms to avenge your injury on all and sundry. But to reply directly to your query, I have seen nothing of any lady, nor, I fear me much, have the troops heard any thing concerning her. I have, however, brought with me the orderly who accompanied you to the convent; he, perhaps, may give you some satisfaction.” “By all means let him enter,” I replied; “at the worst, it will relieve me of a fierce and gnawing anxiety: but I foresee already that all is lost.” He quitted the chamber for an instant; and, before I should have deemed it possible, returned with a young non-commissioned officer, whom I at once recollected for him to whose hand I had flung Bayard's rein at the convent-gate, some ten minutes before my accident. I addressed him at once by name, well aware that nothing is more flattering to an inferior than to be remembered by one placed far above him; thanked him for the ready aid he had afforded me, as I had since learned; and desired him to recite briefly all that had occurred, from the moment of my leaving him at the avenue to the period of De Charmi's arrival with the remainder of the troops. I had, it is true, little expectation of discovering any thing satisfactory; it was already nearly certain that the villains had succeeded in their purpose: yet I listened as he spoke; I weighed his words, and watched his features with the keenest scrutiny—to the double intent of detecting him, should he attempt the slightest equivocation, and of learning more surely from his manner than from his language his own impressions on the subject. “I had,” he said, “ridden off very sharply on leaving you, being somewhat weary, and anxious to rejoin my comrades. I had already passed the brow of the little hillock whereon you had posted the third sentinel, and was descending with more caution into the deep woody glen beyond it, when methought I heard a cry, as if of a female. I paused, and, listening attentively, distinctly caught the sounds again; for the night was, as you will recollect, unusually calm and silent. I turned my horse's head at once, with the intention of returning to ascertain the cause, as I more than suspected that it might arise from some license of our men; but I had barely time to draw the reins, before a shout —your shout I fancied it to be, monsieur—came up the wind, followed by a pistol-shot. I did not pause or hesitate for a moment; I fastened your horse to a tree, and galloped fiercely back to the convent, calling on every sentry, as I passed his station, to follow; so that, by the time of my reaching the turn of the road at which I had left you, we were four armed men. Three minutes could not have elapsed from the first alarm ere we had reached the avenue; yet in that brief space we had heard at least a dozen shots; some, as we imagined, of petronel or musket, rather than of a smaller caliber, accompanied by all the tumult of a fierce and sudden fray. As we halted, to be sure of our direction, the front of the convent was all in shadow and in silence, but in the windows of the northern wing lights were glancing to and fro, and voices sounding in uproar. We easily cleared the low wall, galloped furiously across the meadow, and as we wheeled around a turret, beheld several bodies—three they were in number, as we found afterward, and yours, monsieur, one of the VOL. I.—P three—stretched motionless on the trampled and bloody grass; while a superior body of horse was galloping from the southward to meet us. Our petronels were levelled on the moment, and I had barely time to beat them up again, on recognising in the new comers the picket which had been detailed in front upon the river-bank. Two or three of our men immediately dismounted, while the rest—I led them myself—made a wide sweep round the north-western side of the meadows, quite down to the river, hoping to cut off the perpetrators of the crime—but in vain! The night had suddenly become cluded, and we could discover nothing. Ere our return a heavy detachment had been sent down from head-quarters, under Captain Villeroy; you had been already conveyed to the hamlet where the troops were posted; and four files of men slept on their arms before the convent, with orders to seek out the traces which must have been left by the marauders, as soon as there should be light enough to distinguish a hoof-track. At my own request I was allowed to remain with the scouting-party; and, as soon as day began to dawn, we proceeded in open files to survey the ground. It was not long before we found the deeply-dinted tracks, running directly westward, of six horses. One, I remember well, was smaller than the rest, and had a barshoe on one foot before. After following them a short distance, they entered a small open grove, or rather a large clump of trees, in which, to our surprise, we found two horses tied to the branches. These I at once conjectured to have belonged to the men who had fallen, and to have been led thus far by their comrades, lest, running loose, they should cause their discovery and capture. From the grove, the traces of the four remaining riders were plainly visible, running north-westerly down to the river-bank, which they struck at a point at least two miles beyond the limits of the circuit made by us on the preceding night. I do not, however, doubt but that we must have been within a hundred yards of the party when they were concealed among the trees, I mentioned— so that, had there been light enough, we must have taken them. We could plainly see that two boats had been secured to the roots of the trees at this spot; one of them a light sharp-keeled skiff, the other, as we judged from the marks on the sand, a large flat, for the conveyance of the horses. They had evidently been short-handed, and fearful of pursuit; for they had left a cloak, a petronel, a glove, and some other trifles on the bank. Further pursuit of course could not be made, as the river was unfordable; nor, had it been otherwise, should I have ventured to advance without orders from my superior. On our return to head-quarters, the regiment was got under arms by Colonel le Chaumont; and we were about to march, with the intent of crossing the river, when Monsieur de Charmi came up with the main body, and the marching orders were at once countermanded. This, sir, is all I know. Ihave, however, brought with me the glove I told you of; it is, I think, a lady's.” And as he spoke, he handed to me a delicate white glove of chamois leather, curiously wrought with silver arabesques. I knew it at a glance for Isabel's. The die was cast, and I could have no further doubts; all were sunk in dark and, as it would seem, irremediable despair. Keenly and calmly as I had listened up to this time to his least details, my strength of mind—my coolness, whether assumed or real—at once deserted me; I bowed my head between my hands, too proud, even in my mortal misery, that the eyes of man should witness that affliction which I had not the power to control. I could not for a moment hesitate to give my credence to the soldier's tale; it was too connected in its details, too probable, and, above all, too consistent with what I knew to be truth. There was, moreover, no faltering of the voice, no embarrassment of eye or manner, as he went straight-forward to the point, although I was reading his every motion all the time, with a fixed eagle glance that might have well confused a speaker even conscious of his own veracity. Had I been one prone to deceive myself with the lingering flatteries of hope, I could not have done so in this instance; but such was never the habit of my mind. Once certain of any calamity, whether impending or already fallen, I never strove, as some men do, to disbelieve it; on the contrary, I nerved my soul at once to avert, to remedy, or, at worst, to bear it bravely. The first thing that recalled me from my gloomy meditations was a whisper of De Charmi to the subaltern. “You had better leave us now; Monsieur de Mornington is as yet weak—both mind and body. You had better leave us, but wait below for orders.” “Not so,” I broke in suddenly; “I would ask him a few more questions—but no,” I again interrupted myself, “it matters not: and you are right, De Charmi. You, sir, shall leave us for the present: but you shall not leave my mind, I promise you; nor shall your gallantry and quickness fail to procure for you speedy promotion—somewhat in the hand the while.” P 2 The gratified orderly received the gratuity I tendered him, and with a bright smile and deferential salute quitted the chamber. “All is over, De Charmi,” I continued—“as bright a dream as ever gladdened the heart of man has vanished from mine with his recital. Yet would I learn from you what are our chances of discovering the perpetrators of this infernal villany; for I will not deny to you that I am interested in their recapture, almost beyond the powers of expression. Of this will I speak to you anon. But satisfy me now. Saw you these horses of which he told me? Saw you the corpses? For, God be merciful, it is most marvellous! I slew but one before I was myself stricken to the earth; and it would seem that no one else had reached the scene of action ere they left it. Were there no marks upon the housings—naught in the liveries of the troopers by which they might be traced?” “We have the horses with us—two heavy Norman blacks. They were accoutred in plain demipiques and dark serge housings; there was no crest or bearing on any portion of their trappings; nor did the men wear liveries. They seemed to me banditti, or, at best, countrymen recently pressed into service. One wore, methinks, a leathern cassock, the other a blue cloth jerkin, with a corslet and buff gauntlets; both had fallen by pistol-shots. I fear there is no clew by which you can discover the wretches, unless it be that you have private cause for suspicion.” “Cause enough,” I replied, “cause enough; but little prospect of succeeding. One question more, and I will explain to you this mystery, on promise of strict silence. Had neither you nor any of the officers an interview with the Benedictine prior?” “Doubtless we had. He showed more sorrow at your accident than we could well comprehend; for though the hurts were painful, and your convalescence—owing to your high state of fever— slow and tedious, we have never apprehended danger. Yet did he seem most anxious. I remember well one expression of that most singular and noble-looking man—`Better it would have been for him had he lost the best limb of his body at another time, than to have been thus crippled now!' The remark at the time struck me as somewhat unusual, and I earnestly pressed him for his meaning. Once I thought he was about to tell me, but he checked himself; questioned me of the duration of my friendship or acquaintance with yourself; and, when he learned that it was but of some two days' standing, broke off abruptly. We left with him your titles and address, and he assured us he would write: to what intent, or when, he said not. And now, De Mornington, believe me, I entreat, to be as it were your second self. I f I can assist you, I will do so; if not, it is ever a relief to disburden your mind to one who will not betray you. Something, I well suppose, I have already gathered from the incoherent ravings of your fever. You are married—is it not so?—and lately?” “To an angel, De Charmi; to an angel, whom I never may see more. Never see more!”—I broke forth, as if challenging the bold assertion of a third person. “By Heaven I will see—will rescue her—and that, too, shortly; or I will lose that which is but dross—vile rubbish in the scale when weighed against her recovery!” I then, as shortly as the subject would allow, related to him my encounter with the brothers in the wood; my rescue of the lady; my flight, escape, and marriage. “And now,” I said, “yourself have seen the rest. Speak, have I acted in aught wrongly or unworthily of the name I bear, or see you aught that we may do to further her recovery?” “By Heaven, Mornington!” he cried, in high tones, which yet quivered with excitement—“by Heaven, when I first heard your trumpet-voice, and marked your bearing in the saddle, I knew you for a cavalier, despite your rude disguise. When I beheld your prompt celerity of eye, and hand, and mandate in the field, I knew you for a general of God's own making; but now—now—and truly do I thank you for the knowledge—I know you for the best and noblest gentleman your own brave country hath to boast of. You had my good-will from the first; lately you have possessed my sympathy and friendship; but now you hold my veneration and my heart. Lead on, whither or when you will; unquestioning, undoubting, I will follow you. Follow you, were it possible, even to disgrace.” “Calm yourself, my friend, calm yourself,” I replied, grasping his proffered hand; “I were base, indeed, to doubt you, and unthankful. But there needs not this. Naught have I done in this unhappy matter, but what the commonest gentleman must at once have executed; but now, what can I do? what must be our plan of operations? I ask not, wholly, that I would learn myself, not being over-wont to seek advice from any save my own heart —but that I would gladly learn how our ideas jump.” “If it were peace,” he replied, shortly enough— “if it were not for this cursed Fronde, which after all is the most frivolous rebellion the world ever witnessed, it were easy enough. But now, Turenne, they say, is moving from the Rhine, and probably hath ere this overrun the districts about Bar le Duc and St. Dizier with his Swiss rabble; besides, there is hot fighting here; no chance of obtaining leave of absence—” “No chance!” I almost shouted—“no chance, say you? I will have leave of absence ere a month be flown, or I will at once resign my sword and my commission!” “To achieve your wife's deliverance by a brief sojourn in the dungeons of Marcoussi; or, if we take Paris, as I think we shall, perchance in the Bastile. No, no, sir—that plan is naught. You must win Condé's friendship—another week will see you in the saddle. You will of course acquire renown in every skirmish; yours is the only cavalry we have—and you its sole commander. We have work enough here daily—win Condé's friendship—and when these silly jars are ended, I doubt not we shall win her back as lightly as you lost her: and, hear me, sir, say naught to Mazarin about this marriage. If she be noble and an heiress—as I hold it probable she will prove to be— you have committed high offence in wedding her without the monarch's signature—you will lose at least the lands. “Perish the trash!” I exclaimed; “what should I do with lands?—But you mean well, and, I believe, judge rightly. Nothing will I do rashly—but, hark! what mean those trumpets?” He listened for a moment—“I deemed not it had been so late,” he said, looking towards the window; “yet is the sun fast verging towards the west. It is the evening parade, and I must leave you. Adieu!” he continued, pressing my hand warmly—“adieu, my friend; I shall be with you early on the morrow; keep a good heart—adieu!” And the gay young officer left the room evidently under strong excitement. Yet such is the buoyancy of the national constitution, that he had not descended five of the creaking steps ere I could hear the burthen of some merry air which he was humming to himself, and which, as he reached the outer door, broke into a snatch of song. Scarcely had the sounds of his departure died into stillness, ere I was again disturbed by a heavy step without, immediately followed by a short quick stroke upon the door; I had to raise my voice a second time before the new-comer entered,—it was the orderly officer of the day, bearing in his hand a large packet, addressed “à Mons. Harry Mornington, chef d'escardron, et commandant des chevaux légers.” It had been delivered to the soldier on duty at the gates, on the preceding evening, by a muffled horseman, who had ridden off at a gallop the moment after he had disburdened himself of the despatch, regardless of the threatening summons of the sentries, and even of a shot or two which were sent after him, though without effect. The direction of the cover was in bold and somewhat dashing manuscript; evidently the writing of a man, and one not literary in his habits. I gazed on it in mute curiosity, while the subaltern was delivering some complimentary message from the troopers, unwilling to open it in the presence of a witness, yet to the last degree anxious to know the contents. I thought the man would never have finished his preamble; and then, when that was ended, he had a long story to tell—illustrative of his own attention and activity—of my good horse Bayard, who, it seems, had been committed to his keeping since my illness—and of a charger which had been sent by the equerry of the king, as a token of the royal approbation, to my somewhat scanty stables. At last, with a profusion of hopes, and fears, and wishes, he withdrew. I crawled out of my pallet-bed—secured the door, by drawing one and another massive bolt across it—severed the band of floss silk which secured the packet with the edge of my dagger—a weapon never far distant from my hand—tore off a blank wrapper—and within it, to my almost terrified astonishment, beheld a letter beautifully superscribed, in a small and delicate female hand, with the one word “Harry.” It was bound, not with flax or silk, but with a long tress of lovely light-brown hair—I could have sworn to the sunny gloss that played upon it amid ten thousand—fastened in a slightly artificial knot by a small drop of virgin wax; and on that wax was stamped the impress of my own signet— the ancient crest and heir-loom of my family— with which, in default of a more fitting ring, I had wedded my matchless Isabel. Besides the letter, which I clutched with an eagerness hardly inferior to that of the condemned felon snatching at his reprieve, there was a large enclosure, endorsed on the outside covering “Isabel—le bon temps viendra.” This, however, for the moment, fell unnoticed from my hand—for eye and heart alike were riveted upon the smaller letter. With trembling fingers I broke the wax, and read as follows:— “Harry—my beloved Harry— “They have prevailed, and we are torn asunder —when, oh when to meet? They dragged me from your bleeding body—they bound me on a horse— they bore me—Oh God! Oh God!—that I should VOL. I.—Q not dare to tell you whither!—No, my beloved, I dare not—such is the sole condition on which the miserable satisfaction of writing these few lines is granted. They tell me that your wounds are slight—that you will have regained your strength ere this shall reach you; they tell me that you will again be in the field of glory: but they tell me that I shall never see you more—they tell me that death—your death, Harry, shall follow on the slightest effort at my rescue—and they tell me truly! You know not— oh! may you never know—the boundless wickedness, the wellnigh boundless power of my persecutor. Never have I done aught, planned aught, for my deliverance, but it has been revealed to him, and blighted in the very bud, almost before I had conceived it. And he—this fearful and malignant being—he has sworn an oath, which I have never heard him break, or bend from, that you shall not have well put foot in stirrup to search out my prison, ere the assassin's knife shall reach your heart! Oh, my beloved, mine is a hard, a miserable duty—my heart overflowing with deep unutterable love, I am compelled to hide myself from him whom to see were the very acme of imagined happiness. I am compelled—I am compelled to pray you, as you value—not life, for what noble spirit ever thinks of life save as of a loan that must be one day repaid— but as you value all that is more dear than life—all that ennobles it, and makes it holy—as you value your ancestral name—your own untarnished fame —ay! and—I will write it, though it chokeme—as you value me, I do beseech you to forget—Oh never! never! think not I meant to say forget me!— but to forego me—to be patient—to bear, as I now bear, in silence—and in hope! Were there a chance—a possibility, however slight or desperate, of your success—I would write, Gird yourself up for the task like a warrior for the battle-field—and follow me to the very ends of the earth; but now I know that so to do could not in aught aid our hopes —aid them, did I say!—aid!—them!it would sever them for ever by the pitiless steel—it would bury them in the darkness of an untimely tomb. “You will blame me—I know that you will blame and scorn my cautions, as vain and woman-fears— that you will not comprehend my feelings—that you will doubt—oh never doubt—your Isabel; but if it must be so, blame—doubt—desert—despise me— but oh, in this obey my bidding. Spies are about your table and your bed—spies who note your every action, hear perhaps your every word—spies as unscrupulous as they are crafty. It is not that I fear your safety in the open field—my brave and beautiful—it is not that I doubt your prowess. No, God is my judge and witness—dearly as I regard your safety—wildly as my heart might throb and tremble—even now, in the open field, I would commit my fortunes and your life to your own keeping; I would send you forth, if it were a contest hand to hand and sword to sword with mine oppressor, I would send you forth—anxious, indeed, and spirit-shaken—yet in all hope, all confidence, all joy! But now no contest will be offered, no open weapon brandished at your head: poison will lurk around your cup—knives will be at your throat when you the least expect them. Promise me then—promise me, beloved Harry, that you will make no vain and frantic effort; that you will not, like the silly fly, entangle yourself yet deeper in the maze by your own useless efforts—that you will not madly dash away the single barrier that parts you from destruction! Think—reflect one moment, what it must cost a girl, an ardent and warmhearted girl—ay, Harry, and a wife, a newly-wedded wife, to write these maddening words! Reflect on this, and will you not believe that I possess some deep and certain cause for my dark warnings? I do—I do! Certain is the fate to you— certain the misery—the heart-break—and worse, oh worse, a thousand times, the foul pollution— which, you alive, they dare not heap upon me—from which the name of wife—the name, if not the hand, of Mornington can yet protect me. All this will follow if you stir but one pace's length to aid me. “I know it has been said, `Who would win greatly must venture greatly;' but so it is not now. Oh! by the love that you bear me, by the friends whom you have lost--nearer, perhaps, yet not more dear than she who weeps as she addresses you”—and the paper, blistered and soiled with the big drops, spoke volumes for her truth—“by all your hopes on earth or after the dark separation, I do conjure you, be prudent and be patient; and, above all things, neglect not nor scorn my caution. “Think you that I have any deeper wish, any more cherished feeling in the tabernacle of my inmost heart, than the one desire to be yours— wholly, inseparably, eternally yours? And think you, that if action, enterprise, peril however deadly, agonies however terrible, could bring us once more together—think you that I would shun to expose myself—think you that I would shrink from exposing even you, my better and more valued self, to the risk of these? But I will say no more. Harry, you will grant my sad, my wretched boon; you will—must grant it. “And now will I tell you of myself. I am well in the body—ay, and I force myself even to be Q 2 cheerful. I suffer nothing but confinement, in a situation not of itself devoid of charms—but, oh! what matters it to the poor bird whose bleeding bosom throbs against the bars, whether those bars be gilded or of a meaner metal?—nothing but confinement and absence from you,—not even the presence of my persecutor. I said, I force myself to be cheerful; and I am cheerful—cheerful and happy in a high and holy hope, a certainty that the motto of our family will be fulfilled— `Merci, O merci Dieu—le bon temps viendra.' It will come—oh, believe it, Harry, believe it as I do, and pray for it, and be happy—the good time will come, when we shall meet again, never, I trust, to be grieved or parted more. The good time will come, when you shall fold to your heart your own unchanged, unchangeable. It is in this hope that I am cheerful; in this hope, and in the fixed resolve—if it be the will of Him that I shall be restored in his good day to your affections, —that I will be restored to them, not a pale, care-worn, prison-broken wretch, but still rich in whatever little I may have of youth or beauty; not a timid, aguish, and disappointed spirit, sick with the hope deferred, but a full and buoyant soul— buoyant with love and rapture. In this hope I tune my long-neglected harp; I sing the old home-melodies of my fresh girlhood; I pore over the poets and the philosophers of your green island, and I love them, not that they are rich and beautiful—and how pathetic!—but that they derived their being from that same spot of earth in which my Harry first saw light,—but that they speak the same heart-language, and breathe the same proud sentiments of chivalric piety and love, which I have heard him utter. I have found a little song, a simple song—written, they say, by one, like me, imprisoned, and afar from the object of her soul's worship. Is it not sweet,—and is it not prophetic? I will--I will believe it:— ` 'Tis past! I wake A captive, and alone, and far from thee, My love and friend! yet fostering for thy sake A quenchless hope of happiness to be; And feeling still my woman's spirit strong In the deep faith, which lifts from earthly wrong A heavenward glance. I know, I know our love Shall yet call gentle angels from above, By its undying fervour; and prevail, Sending a breath, as of the spring's first gale, Through hearts now cold; and, raising its bright face, With a free gush of sunny tears erase The characters of anguish; in this trust I bear, I strive, I bow not to the dust; That I may bring thee back no faded form, No bosom chilled, and blighted by the storm, But all my youth's first treasurres when we meet, Making past sorrow, by communion, sweet.'[3] [3] Arabella Stuart to William Seymour. Preserved to our days by Felicia Hemans. “And now, Harry, I must say farewell,--farewell, my own, my all-beloved. I send you that long ringlet you admired when first we met. I have bathed it in many tears, and kissed it, and envied it, Harry—envied the senseless, lifeless hair; for well I know that it will be pressed to your lips, and worn where I should be—worn in your bosom. And now, may all the blessings that I can devise, or pray for, fall upon you,—so shall you be rich indeed! May the great glorious Comforter be with you; may He take from your heart the bitterness, from your soul the sting; may He fill your thoughts with patience and with hope; and, oh! above all, may he in his own good time—when we are weighed and found not wholly wanting—may he bring about the accomplishment of all our hopes in one delicious meeting. Harry, farewell; Harry, beloved Harry! farewell; and remember— `Merci, O Merci Dieu—le bon temps viendra.' “Ever, ever—for ever your own “Isabel.”</field>

I.—Q not dare to tell you whither!—No, my beloved, I dare not—such is the sole condition on which the miserable satisfaction of writing these few lines is granted. They tell me that your wounds are slight—that you will have regained your strength ere this shall reach you; they tell me that you will again be in the field of glory: but they tell me that I shall never see you more—they tell me that death—your death, Harry, shall follow on the slightest effort at my rescue—and they tell me truly! You know not— oh! may you never know—the boundless wickedness, the wellnigh boundless power of my persecutor. Never have I done aught, planned aught, for my deliverance, but it has been revealed to him, and blighted in the very bud, almost before I had conceived it. And he—this fearful and malignant being—he has sworn an oath, which I have never heard him break, or bend from, that you shall not have well put foot in stirrup to search out my prison, ere the assassin's knife shall reach your heart! Oh, my beloved, mine is a hard, a miserable duty—my heart overflowing with deep unutterable love, I am compelled to hide myself from him whom to see were the very acme of imagined happiness. I am compelled—I am compelled to pray you, as you value—not life, for what noble spirit ever thinks of life save as of a loan that must be one day repaid— but as you value all that is more dear than life—all that ennobles it, and makes it holy—as you value your ancestral name—your own untarnished fame —ay! and—I will write it, though it chokeme—as you value me, I do beseech you to forget—Oh never! never! think not I meant to say forget me!— but to forego me—to be patient—to bear, as I now bear, in silence—and in hope! Were there a chance—a possibility, however slight or desperate, of your success—I would write, Gird yourself up for the task like a warrior for the battle-field—and follow me to the very ends of the earth; but now I know that so to do could not in aught aid our hopes —aid them, did I say!—aid!—them!it would sever them for ever by the pitiless steel—it would bury them in the darkness of an untimely tomb. “You will blame me—I know that you will blame and scorn my cautions, as vain and woman-fears— that you will not comprehend my feelings—that you will doubt—oh never doubt—your Isabel; but if it must be so, blame—doubt—desert—despise me— but oh, in this obey my bidding. Spies are about your table and your bed—spies who note your every action, hear perhaps your every word—spies as unscrupulous as they are crafty. It is not that I fear your safety in the open field—my brave and beautiful—it is not that I doubt your prowess. No, God is my judge and witness—dearly as I regard your safety—wildly as my heart might throb and tremble—even now, in the open field, I would commit my fortunes and your life to your own keeping; I would send you forth, if it were a contest hand to hand and sword to sword with mine oppressor, I would send you forth—anxious, indeed, and spirit-shaken—yet in all hope, all confidence, all joy! But now no contest will be offered, no open weapon brandished at your head: poison will lurk around your cup—knives will be at your throat when you the least expect them. Promise me then—promise me, beloved Harry, that you will make no vain and frantic effort; that you will not, like the silly fly, entangle yourself yet deeper in the maze by your own useless efforts—that you will not madly dash away the single barrier that parts you from destruction! Think—reflect one moment, what it must cost a girl, an ardent and warmhearted girl—ay, Harry, and a wife, a newly-wedded wife, to write these maddening words! Reflect on this, and will you not believe that I possess some deep and certain cause for my dark warnings? I do—I do! Certain is the fate to you— certain the misery—the heart-break—and worse, oh worse, a thousand times, the foul pollution— which, you alive, they dare not heap upon me—from which the name of wife—the name, if not the hand, of Mornington can yet protect me. All this will follow if you stir but one pace's length to aid me. “I know it has been said, `Who would win greatly must venture greatly;' but so it is not now. Oh! by the love that you bear me, by the friends whom you have lost--nearer, perhaps, yet not more dear than she who weeps as she addresses you”—and the paper, blistered and soiled with the big drops, spoke volumes for her truth—“by all your hopes on earth or after the dark separation, I do conjure you, be prudent and be patient; and, above all things, neglect not nor scorn my caution. “Think you that I have any deeper wish, any more cherished feeling in the tabernacle of my inmost heart, than the one desire to be yours— wholly, inseparably, eternally yours? And think you, that if action, enterprise, peril however deadly, agonies however terrible, could bring us once more together—think you that I would shun to expose myself—think you that I would shrink from exposing even you, my better and more valued self, to the risk of these? But I will say no more. Harry, you will grant my sad, my wretched boon; you will—must grant it. “And now will I tell you of myself. I am well in the body—ay, and I force myself even to be Q 2 cheerful. I suffer nothing but confinement, in a situation not of itself devoid of charms—but, oh! what matters it to the poor bird whose bleeding bosom throbs against the bars, whether those bars be gilded or of a meaner metal?—nothing but confinement and absence from you,—not even the presence of my persecutor. I said, I force myself to be cheerful; and I am cheerful—cheerful and happy in a high and holy hope, a certainty that the motto of our family will be fulfilled— `Merci, O merci Dieu—le bon temps viendra.' It will come—oh, believe it, Harry, believe it as I do, and pray for it, and be happy—the good time will come, when we shall meet again, never, I trust, to be grieved or parted more. The good time will come, when you shall fold to your heart your own unchanged, unchangeable. It is in this hope that I am cheerful; in this hope, and in the fixed resolve—if it be the will of Him that I shall be restored in his good day to your affections, —that I will be restored to them, not a pale, care-worn, prison-broken wretch, but still rich in whatever little I may have of youth or beauty; not a timid, aguish, and disappointed spirit, sick with the hope deferred, but a full and buoyant soul— buoyant with love and rapture. In this hope I tune my long-neglected harp; I sing the old home-melodies of my fresh girlhood; I pore over the poets and the philosophers of your green island, and I love them, not that they are rich and beautiful—and how pathetic!—but that they derived their being from that same spot of earth in which my Harry first saw light,—but that they speak the same heart-language, and breathe the same proud sentiments of chivalric piety and love, which I have heard him utter. I have found a little song, a simple song—written, they say, by one, like me, imprisoned, and afar from the object of her soul's worship. Is it not sweet,—and is it not prophetic? I will--I will believe it:— ` 'Tis past! I wake A captive, and alone, and far from thee, My love and friend! yet fostering for thy sake A quenchless hope of happiness to be; And feeling still my woman's spirit strong In the deep faith, which lifts from earthly wrong A heavenward glance. I know, I know our love Shall yet call gentle angels from above, By its undying fervour; and prevail, Sending a breath, as of the spring's first gale, Through hearts now cold; and, raising its bright face, With a free gush of sunny tears erase The characters of anguish; in this trust I bear, I strive, I bow not to the dust; That I may bring thee back no faded form, No bosom chilled, and blighted by the storm, But all my youth's first treasurres when we meet, Making past sorrow, by communion, sweet.'[3] [3] Arabella Stuart to William Seymour. Preserved to our days by Felicia Hemans. “And now, Harry, I must say farewell,--farewell, my own, my all-beloved. I send you that long ringlet you admired when first we met. I have bathed it in many tears, and kissed it, and envied it, Harry—envied the senseless, lifeless hair; for well I know that it will be pressed to your lips, and worn where I should be—worn in your bosom. And now, may all the blessings that I can devise, or pray for, fall upon you,—so shall you be rich indeed! May the great glorious Comforter be with you; may He take from your heart the bitterness, from your soul the sting; may He fill your thoughts with patience and with hope; and, oh! above all, may he in his own good time—when we are weighed and found not wholly wanting—may he bring about the accomplishment of all our hopes in one delicious meeting. Harry, farewell; Harry, beloved Harry! farewell; and remember— `Merci, O Merci Dieu—le bon temps viendra.' “Ever, ever—for ever your own “Isabel.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. “Guilt is its own avenger! Ancient sin Is but the parent to a younger crime, That must be born, in fulness of its hour, Itself to be prolific—and its seed Is evermore the dark unholy fiend, Insatiate of insolence and wrong— The single fury with a thousand names— Phrensy, or fate, or vengeful wrath divine.” The Agamemnon. It would be madness to attempt the portraiture of my feelings, as I read the fatal intelligence contained in that wild but powerful letter,—love— admiration—impatience—anguish—I know not which was strongest. At first I felt inclined to rebel against the prohibition it contained; to doubt the justice of her conclusions; to ascribe the whole —as she herself had written it—to her woman-fears. Then, again, when I thought of her, as I had seen her the last time, fearlessly protecting with the mortal weapon my own forfeit life; when I considered the fearful accuracy with which my motions had thus far been tracked out— the unrelenting and unscrupulous malice with which my death had been meditated, and all but executed; when I looked upon the frequency of opportunities for the commission of this or any other crime, in the present confusion of parties, and in the distracted turbulence of the whole realm, I began to feel that I had no right to ascribe a weak and womanish vacillation to one whom I had seen so nobly displaying qualities the very reverse of these, under circumstances the most trying! I began to feel that I was, indeed, standing on a precipice's verge, and that my only hope of safety or success did lie in caution. At once, therefore, I resolved that I would not for a moment be wanting to myself; that I would not for a moment be wanting to her who had so wonderfully manifested the depth of her devotion to me, by the self-denying control with which she had bound up her feelings, and compelled herself to silence, when a word, a syllable might have wrought deliverance or utter desolation! I saw, as it were intuitively, that the only game which could be crowned with good results was one of deep, thoughtful, and well-executed artifice. I saw that I must both deceive and divide, ere I could hope to conquer. The first step to such a result must clearly be a thorough concealment of my own thoughts, motives, character! I would shake off all the semblance at least, if not all the reality, of care! I would be foremost in the feast as in the fray! I would no longer shun the deep carousal—for, of a surety, there is truth in wine! I would be all things with all men! I would wind through thorns and flowers alike—carefully, noiselessly, stealthily as the snake; that, like the snake, I might, when certain of my distance and of my prey, strike once and fatally! As I revolved these things in my mind, a doubt —a terrible doubt crossed me!—De Charmi! Had I not rashly, like an idiot, given full confidence, and on the merest impulse? “De Charmi”—I repeated his name musingly—“can it be that he is treacherous—base—leagued with the enemy? Fool, fool!” I cried aloud, “henceforth will I speak nothing; no, not even to myself. Henceforth will I watch every motion of his eye, every quiver of his lip, every light and every shadow that plays upon his face; henceforth will I read his very soul. If he be false—He that knows all things, knows that I will stab him to his lying heart—at the court of his king; in the arms of his mistress; at the altar of his God!” As I moved, vehemently, on the bed, in the violence of my excitement, I disarranged its draperies, and something fell to the ground with a slight but distinct sound—it was the larger packet; which, in the warmth of the feelings conjured up by what I had already seen, I had forgotten. It was not an instant before I had dragged its contents to daylight. “It is but fitting,” thus ran the superscription— “it is but fitting that Harry Mornington should learn somewhat of her early fortunes whom he has taken to his heart. Read these, my beloved, and you will know that, if most miserable, I am most innocent! You will see and judge, better than from any words of mine, how desperate is the hope of succour from violence or rashness. Read these, and, oh! remember!— `Merci, O merci Dièu—le bon temps viendra.' Will it—will it indeed come? Heretofore has my life been one long term of sorrow. A friendless, homeless, persecuted orphan! Oh, that the good time would indeed come, before my spirit shall be broken, and my body worn away by the very weariness of wo!” “I said that my life had been one long term of sorrow. I—I alone, have no sweet recollections, no hallowed memories of old home-faces—of happy childish hours, when tears are but as April showers, smiling even while they fall. I have none such. My childhood is a blank, a starless night, with here and there a dream! There is a vision of a mother in my soul; of a soft, beautiful, but ever melancholy mother—of one short summer day of love and fearless confidence. Of one whom I called father. I say wrongly; not of himself, but of his eyes--deep, dark, unfathomably tender. I can see those eyes looking down upon my infant sports with a calm and chastened affection. I can sometimes fancy that I see them, even now, gazing down from the far firmament, when the hush of night is heavy over the multitudinous world. Yet are these but vague and, perchance, false imaginings, scarcely more distinct than the reflections on a midnight lake. They may be real—they may be, and probably are, but the blind yearnings of a fanciful and affectionate spirit pining for sympathy and love, and finding none! “At the furthest period to which I can recur with certainty, I was the inmate of a noble castle— a little wretched child; the orphan niece, as I was told, of the dark lord of that demesne. But never did I meet even the passing attention, the slight affectionate notice, which the coldest heart must lavish at moments on the sole remaining image of VOL. I.—R a departed sister. Never was I permitted to lisp the name of uncle. I was abandoned to the care of menials; and even by them was rebuked, slighted, chidden, taunted!—ay, taunted with base blood and infamy of origin. My heartless kinsman had three sons; one but a few months my senior; and him—I saw him daily; not as an equal, not as a cousin, but as a lord. The others were absent from their father's mansion—pages in some proud family. I will not write a name; for my object in writing at all is to deter you from pursuit, not to afford a clew. When I was a girl, perhaps of thirteen years, I was sent to a convent, not as a novice, but to receive a finished education. Though stinted in all things else, even to miserly closeness, in this respect money was profusely lavished. Embroidery, painting, music, languages, dancing— every trivial grace was to be cultivated, every accomplishment to be acquired. Yet, with all this, the same insults pursued me—the same harsh coldness. My superior frowned me into silence; my teachers instructed me in chilling, heartless negligence; my young companions shunned me, as a creature under the ban of infamy. I have sometimes imagined, since, that all this was done with a view to breaking down my spirit, to rendering me pliable, soulless, and passionless. If so, how strangely have they erred who so misjudged my character. Tenderness—kindness—could have moulded me to aught; oppression and severity, and the strong sense of bitter wrong, of cruelty unmerited, have made me what I am—resolute and firm to resist—immoveable of purpose, unless my heart be touched, and then all softness! I grew up a child of poetry: the secret places of my mind were my sole storehouses of bliss; and in them I was happy—I created, I dreamed—I became a solitary creature of impulses and imagination. “Time fled—and I grew in years, and in stature, and, they said, in beauty. My companions, who had wronged me from the first, now hated—for they envied me; and I, whose whole soul was a desire for affection—who had but one wish—to love some living being who should love me in return—grew to maturity without a friend! “They led me back to that old mansion—and all were altered: I was courted, flattered, cringed to in humble admiration. I was to be the heiress of that wide demesne—of those rich woodlands, in which I had run almost savage as a little child; of those fair lawns, which I had from a distance witnessed thronged with the noble and the gay; of those superb galleries, which I had never been allowed to enter. I was to be the bride of my uncle's first-born: a dispensation had been obtained from the pope; and, as is usual in such cases, my will had not been consulted. “I was called to an interview with my dark kinsman, and positively informed of the honour that awaited me—which I as positively declined. My uncle was furious. He reviled me as the child of infamy—the child, almost, of incest—his sister's daughter, born without the sanction of the holy church—my father a wretch, a villain, a seducer of his own kinswoman within the prohibited degrees. At once, shortly and impetuously, I cast the falsehood in his teeth! Harry—it must be—it is a falsehood. No man, however base, however grasping, could wish to bind a child of infamy like this to his own son! I offered to take the veil—to submit myself to an eternal dungeon; but never—I swore--never would I call husband the son of him who had slandered my parents, and robbed their child of her good name! I was remanded to my chamber, imprisoned, half starved, scourged. Yes, Harry--by the holy heavens that are above us!—I, a woman, a helpless woman, was bound and beaten like a dog, by orders of my own mother's brother. It was their pretext that I was mad! I was intrusted to the charge of hags—of fiends—fiends in the shape of women. Chance gave me to overhear a conversation—and the secret of my fate is here. My mother was the eldest of her family; and by a settlement—a deed of entail so ancient that the Salique law of France affects it not—the descent is vested in the female line. She was sole heiress to all the titles, lands, and privileges of an old and noble race. My mother wedded young, and contrary to her father's and to her brother's consent. Her father's was withheld from mere caprice; her brother's, from foul unnatural avarice—for, failing that one sister and her race, the fair inheritance would fall to him. He forged the lie; he brought false papers—perjured witnesses to prove their consanguinity; he broke his sister's heart—slaying her with the sword of her own outraged feelings, of her own murdered reputation. My father was seen no more. Whether he fell beneath the murderer's knife; whether he fled beyond the sea; whether he languishes in eternal chains—none know. I was dragged to my uncle's dwelling; there was no security but in my death, or in my union with his first-born. “The brothers returned to their father's hall well-nurtured, courtly, beautiful, and brave! And me—wretch that I am—they both loved me. The elder was dark-haired, dark-eyed—but why should R 2 I describe them? You have seen, you have witnessed—you well know the horrible reality. He was grave, but passionate, and full of devoted sentiment and rich romance, even in his gravity: he was a man whom any girl might worship! I know not but I—with all my resolutions, all my vows against it—might have been wrought upon to yield him my affections; for he was gentle— full of the melancholy vein of poetry I loved, yet not without its brilliancy—attentive even to devotion! Thanks be to the Eternal, the misery of loving him was spared me; for I learned—no matter how—I learned, in time to save me, that another, a gentle being buried in a living grave, could claim him for her own. I charged him with it—face to face, eye to eye—I charged him with his atrocious villany! And, by that holy strength that dwells in innocence, he quailed before me! His swarthy cheek reddened, and his features writhed as if with agony—yet still he persevered. The younger—I loathed him from the first, for he had dared to whisper guilt to me—to tempt me— me, whom he considered as the unwilling bride of his own brother—to tempt me to illicit love. “When first I saw them on the lawn, methought two nobler or more gallant gentlemen ne'er walked the world in company. Their tones were low and pleasant, their eyes looked mildly on each other. With all their faults, they were as yet brothers— brothers in heart, as in their birthright. A brief month had elapsed, and they were deadliest foemen. Heart-burnings, envyings, and secret malice had blazed out into fierce, open, and uncompromising hate: all knew it, and all knew the miserable but most guiltless cause. “Again and again I implored permission to retire to a convent, to surrender all my earthly rights, to go forth on the wide world an outcast and a beggar! Again and again I was denied this meed of mercy. Had I received the veil, the convent would have claimed my fortunes as an appanage: had I gone forth alone, however friendless, and however humbled, I might yet marry; I might yet be the mother of wretches like myself, who would in turn be claimants of their mother's heirdom. “At length I was told in human words—by kindred lips I was told—`To one of these my sons must you be wedded, or you must die.'—`Then will I die,' was my unalterable answer; and, I doubt not, ere long the poison or the oubliette would have brought a close to my afflictions, had not the guilt of those most abhorred, yet most miserable, brethren precipitated a catastrophe, fatal alike to us and to themselves. “One dark and silent midnight—the midnight of that morning on which we for the first time met— my solitary chamber was violently entered by the emissaries of my elder lover—foul profanation of the word!—my elder persecutor. That wretched girl whose end—whose terrible, but surely not unmerited, end—you witnessed, was the foremost. Ere I was well awakened, I was blindfolded, bound, gagged! With the silent expedition of guilt they arrayed me—hurried me by private ways into a coach—two persons entered with me, and we were whirled away as fast as the speed of horses could move the ponderous vehicle—whither I knew not. “In an agony of horror and dismay I listened to catch whatever word might fall from my companions, whose identity I could well conjecture; but for many miles they uttered not a syllable: only by the thick breathing of one did I know him to be a man! On—on we went—now over smooth and level roads, now across country—over banks and ruts—sometimes the branches sweeping the roof and panels— and anon the wheels imbedded in the tenacious clay, where, as I judged, we crossed the beds of streamlets which had resisted the severe and biting frost. The day was already breaking—as I could discover even through the bandage, which pressed tightly on my eyes—when we stopped for a few seconds: the weary horses which had conveyed us thus far on our frightful journey were removed; a fresh relay was at hand, and in a few instants we set off again, and with redoubled fury. We had not driven far at this fierce rate, before my hands were unfettered—my eyes and lips unbandaged! It was as I conjectured—it was the elder who sat beside me, with a fierce smile of triumph on his swarthy features—and she, the tool and minister of his atrocities! I spoke not—I moved not—I looked not to the right or left—a stupid, dull insensibility had fallen on me. “I could judge from the words of that guilty pair, for they now spoke freely and without concealment, that they deemed all danger of pursuit to be over. A party of armed servants, commanded by the third and youngest of the brethren, had escorted our flight till we had taken our relays, and then had left us. I could see that there was now but one armed horseman riding beside the window. “Suddenly we stopped with a shock and heavy jerk—one of the horses had fallen; and ere the motion of his fall was ended, the loud report of fire-arms announced the cause. From a pathway, source ten yards in front, that light-haired youth rushed forth; he hurled the musket he had just discharged full at the heads of the terrified horses, which had made a motion to dash onward; they fell to plunging, and in an instant the carriage was overturned. He snatched a pistol from his belt with either hand, discharged one at the outrider, who instantly fled into the dense forest, and escaped; then, as his brother dashed the door of the carriage to atoms with his foot, and sprang out, sword in hand, he levelled the second full at his head, with a smile of devilish exultation—`Die,' he shouted—`die, dog, in the moment of your triumph!' The flash was so close that I involuntarily closed my eyes; I heard a whistling sound rush by me, and, with a succession of the wildest yells, that miserable girl fell forward, and dragged me to the bottom of the coach. She clasped me with her convulsed arms—she tore my very garments with her teeth—her hot blood streamed over me! Oh Heaven! Heaven!—I know not how I held my reason—yet I did hold it; and all the time I heard the shivering clash of their swords, and the stamping of their feet upon the frozen soil. I heard the quick clang of a horse's hoof as you drew nigh— and struggled violently to get loose, but I could not. Though speechless, and convulsed, and evidently in her last agony, she still held me with a gripe of steel. Suddenly her grasp relaxed—she was stone dead. I extricated myself, tottered out of the fatal carriage—beheld the kindred corpses, and a stranger gazing on those corpses—a stranger now no longer—I fainted—Harry, you only know the rest! “It was on the third night from your departure —I had not yet retired to my couch, though it was already two hours past midnight, for you had promised me—and well I knew you would perform that promise, cost you what it might—you had promised to return on the third night. I sat by the window, gazing out upon the moonlight scenery; the air was beautifully calm and clear, and the night wonderfully silent; I could hear the rushing of the distant Marne in every lull of the light breeze. Suddenly methought I heard a stealthy footstep beneath the window—I listened—it was not repeated. For a moment, I thought of flight, or of calling for assistance, but an instant's reflection reasoned me into security—fatal security! At this moment the shrill note of a trumpet came to my ear from a distance—I gazed steadily to the road by which I knew you must return —I saw your squadron reach the summit of the hill—their steel caps glancing one by one as they crossed the brow, and sinking into obscurity as they entered the shadow of the orchards; I could even mark the heavy onward trampling of the march; I missed them amid the low roofs of the hamlet; I lost the sound of their advance!—my breath came thick—my eyes were filled with tears—my heart was too full for my bosom. I was then safe, indeed safe!—I had scarcely nurtured such a hope; I had felt throughout the day a deep oppression on my spirits—an overshadowing presentiment of evil had weighed me down—yet now all, all was forgotten! I breathed a prayer of thankfulness to Him that is above; I looked forth again upon the night, and I saw a little company of horsemen emerge from the village, and ride briskly down the moonlit slope. Filled, almost to choking, with gratitude and love, I flung the casement open, and leaned out to mark your coming; I saw you reach the avenue—I lost you as you entered it—I leaned yet farther out—at that moment—that very moment of intense pleasure—the tall frame-work of a ladder rose suddenly between me and the light, and, ere I could spring back into the apartment, fell with a jarring sound against the sculptured window-sill. Rapidly as I darted towards the lamp, with the hope of extinguishing it, and so escaping in the gloom—more rapidly had three ruffians scaled the ladder; they seized me ere I could reach the door, and—though I screamed and struggled with almost superhuman power—forced me through the narrow aperture, and bore me down the steps. One of the party was left watching the door within, to prevent rescue from that way ere his comrades could descend. I knew that aid was close at hand—I shrieked your name, and, not to my astonishment, you came; your shot struck down one of the party—they were taken by surprise— the ladder fell, leaving the ruffian within entrapped in his own snare. I saw you rush forward—oh God! I saw you fall—I saw that foul assassin rear his coward blade to pierce you—then—all glory be to Him who gave me power!—I snatched the pistol that had dropped from your hand—I stood over you—and he—dastardly no less than cruel—he cowered before me. It was but a second ere they tore me from my station, and the weapon was discharged in vain; but that second was your safety, for, on either hand, the clash of stirrups and the shouts of your followers came loud and near. At this critical moment, the wretch within called to his master to rear up the ladder for his escape—he was answered by a short and sullen oath. As he saw them mount to fly, he fired—first his musket, and then both his pistols—in the despair of vengeance, at his own treacherous companions; the ball from the last weapon grazed the face of my VOL. I.—S persecutor, who had bound me before him on his horse; with a savage execration he turned in his saddle, levelled his own carabine with deliberate aim—called on his men to fire! I saw the miserable victim plunge headlong from the window!—I heard the soft, dull sound of his fall!—and the whole party dashed away, bearing me with them, at the top of their horses' speed. We paused for a moment or two in a clump of trees, I know not wherefore, for the night had become gloomy and overcast—yet I heard the jingling of armour, and the tread of managed chargers sweeping around our hiding-place. I raised my voice to cry aloud for succour; but in a moment, ere one tone had found its way to the air of heaven, a scarf was forced into my mouth, and folded over my head, close— almost to suffocation. My tale of wo is ended—I cannot, dare not write another word. Seek me not, Harry— seek me not now—I do beseech you, even if you shrink not aghast from the idea of reclaiming one who would be but a reproach to your good name!—Of all things, seek me not where first we met—that, that, indeed, were sure destruction! I am not there—I am not in that horrible vicinity. Would, oh would that I dared reveal to you my dwelling-place!—would that I dared reveal to you the means by which you will receive this letter! But I am bound—bound by a fearful oath, never, by word or deed, by sign or letter, to reveal or hint the place of my concealment—the names of my tormentors. I swore it, Harry, with a bursting heart and burning brain—I swore it by the bones of my mother—by my love for you—by my hopes of heaven hereafter—by the life of Him who died that we might live! I swore it—and wherefore?—that you might be safe, my beloved, from the dagger or the bowl. They dare not break their faith with me in this—I know they dare not —but how, I may not tell you. Be you prudent and cautious; seem to the world—seem—but oh, let it be but seeming—seem to have forgotten, even while you most remember, your own Isabel. Gird yourself up with the armour of cautiousness and craft—so, and so only, may we meet again! Oh that I could see you, my beloved,—oh that I could look upon your lordly brow, and hear your blessed voice—oh that I could hold you in my arms, were it but for one short hour, though death itself should follow! Would, oh would we were together—together even in the tomb—for the tomb knows no further separation!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. “Bacchus, ever fair and young, Drinking joys did first ordain; Bacchus' blessings are a treasure, Drinking is the soldier's pleasure. Rich the treasure— Sweet the pleasure— Sweet is pleasure after pain.” Alexander's Feast. It was about a fortnight after the receipt of these letters--a fortnight during which, although nothing of import had occurred, I had completely regained my strength, and had so far, at least, matured my plans of future action as to be thoroughly master of my mind and conduct—that I was summoned late in the evening to a council of war at the quarters of the commander-in-chief. I had on the preceding day resumed the command of my troops, who were quartered somewhat in advance of our lines, in such places of shelter as could be found between St. Germains and the bridge of Charenton. They had been almost incessantly engaged since the formation of the blockade, being the only corps of cavalry attached to the royal army, in covering the advances of the infantry, in patrolling the ground, and, above all, in cutting off convoys of cattle and provision, to introduce which to the beleaguered city was the continual aim of the Frondeurs. The men were nevertheless in high spirits, and were gradually acquiring a very respectable degree of discipline; while the horses, considering the harassing nature of the service, were in good condition, and fit for action. I had just returned from visiting the outposts, and had in the afternoon repelled, in a brilliant charge, a sally intended to cover the entrance of a considerable number of wagons laden with stores of all kinds, when the summons was delivered to me, with a further injunction to make no long tarrying, as the council was already assembled. I did not, therefore, even dismount from my horse, much less pause to make any alteration in my dress, but rode directly to the quarters of the prince. It was already quite dark, but there were collected about the door a score or two of grooms and lackeys, besides the sentinels on duty, with lanterns and flambeaux, by the light of which they were leading to and fro about a dozen chargers fully caparisoned for war. Throwing my rein to one of S 2 these fellows, I entered at once the chamber wherein the council was debating. It must be observed that the court had quitted Paris at a most inclement season, and at so short a notice that not only the army, but the leaders, and even the royal family itself, were in want of all the common conveniences of life. The palace of St. Germains was not half large enough to accommodate those who had a claim to quarters in the royal residence, in right of birth or station. Notwithstanding this, however, the Prince of Condé was undoubtedly one to whom, under any circumstances, the best apartments must have been tendered; but he was too old a soldier, and too good a general, not to be aware that a leader, in order to share the affections, must also share the hardships of his soldiery. He had, in the present instance, taken up his residence in an old rambling métairie, which might have originally belonged to some small proprietor, but which had long been used only as the abode of the bailiff, who continued to manage the demesnes. This rude dwelling had been hastily and imperfectly put in order for the reception of the prince and his suite. The large kitchen had been converted into a hall of entrance; the walls were hung with splendid arms, and rich mantles of fur and velvet; in the corners stood several stands of regimental colours; and on a slab against the wall lay, in splendid confusion, plumed caps and glittering helmets, riding-cloaks, spurs, and swords, as they had been laid aside by the officers who composed the council. Several esquires of the body, and gentlemen—some in civil attire, but more in undress uniforms or armour— lounged round the ample chimney, in which was blazing a tremendous fire, rendered not a little acceptable by the unwonted severity of the season. Opposite to this glowing pile, and in the full glare of its red light, two halberdiers of the Swiss guard stalked to and fro, their bright head-pieces, massive partisans, and long beards offering a strange contrast to the superb freshness of the silk and embroidery which adorned their habits. I passed without hesitation or delay through this apartment, receiving the whispered greetings of several among the officers, and the silent salute of the guards, into the inner chamber, which had been originally the saloon of the building. A dozen lights of common tallow were flaring and streaming from candlesticks of massive silver; and a covering of Genoa velvet had been spread over a table of unpolished deal, supported by rough trivets. Throughout the whole room a similar mixture of regal display and abject poverty was visible. The floor, of plain red bricks, was partially covered by a three-piled Persian carpet; the chairs, of country manufacture, were decked with damask cushions; and, to crown the whole, the mantling wines of Auvergnât and Sillery, which stood upon the board among maps of the adjacent country, plans of fortifications, muster-rolls, commissariat accounts, and unsigned commissions, were poured from flasks of gold and silver into old-fashioned Flemish glasses, or mugs of the vilest earthenware. The debate, as it would seem—if there had indeed been one—was at an end when I entered. The prince was seated at the upper end of the table, in close but apparently trivial conversation with the dukes of Châtillon and Orleans, who were placed on his right-hand and on his left. Below these sat a dozen gentlemen holding commissions in the royal army, among whom I at once discovered the maréchals de Meilleraye, de Grammont, and de Duplessis-Praslin, who had come together from their various posts of Lagny, Corbeil, and St. Cloud, for the purpose of deciding on the mode of attack for the morrow. “You come somewhat late, Monsieur de Mornington,” cried the prince, gayly, as I entered; “late, too, for our council as well as for our supper! Seat yourself, sir,” he continued—“room there for our gallant comrade! We are told, sir, that we are again indebted to your activity. Gentlemen cavaliers, a health to Monsieur Mornington—we are his debtors; if not for our suppers to-night, at least for to-morrow's breakfast! Ma foi, it would be cold comfort to break one's fast on naught save gunpowder and pike-heads. Fill up —fill up.” The health was drunk by acclamation; and in five minutes all was mirth and revelry. Amid the clang of beakers and the fun, that soon waxed furious, I made out, however, to learn that the movement of the Parisian army, on the preceding day—the Marquis de Chanleu having occupied the hamlet and bridge of Charenton with a strong force of infantry and a tolerably well-ordered park of artillery—had determined the commander-in-chief on carrying the post by storm on the next morning; as it was, in itself, a station of great importance, commanding the junction of the Seine and Marne. The troops destined for the assault were Chatillon's division of veterans, the best men in the army; Condé himself intending to occupy the heights of St. Mandé with a strong reserve, for the purpose of intercepting any reinforcements which might be sent out from Paris, or preventing any diversion which might be attempted on the attacking party. “You have heard, doubtless, sir,” cried Grammont, turning suddenly to me, “that Rochefoucauld has joined the Frondeurs?” “Doubtless he has; but not, perhaps, the cause. The couplet, I confess, might almost palliate the treason,” cried Condé: “have you heard his last, sir?— `To gain one smile from Longueville's lovely eyes, I war against my king—would war against the skies.'[4] [4] These lines were actually written by the celebrated La Rochefoucauld on the back of a portrait of the beautiful duchess:— Pour captiver son cœur, pour plaire à ses beaux yeux, J'ai fait la guerre aux rois, je l'aurais faite aux dieux. The game is worth the candle, I confess.” “C'est selon,” laughed out De Grammont—“I am rather for D'Hocquincourt. `Peronne to the fairest of the fair!' Oh, Montbazon for me!” “Nay, but they say there is a nameless beauty, —brighter than all or any,” chimed in De Meilleraye—“a captive beauty of young De Chateaufort. He entered Paris some three days since with five hundred musketeers, two hundred head of cattle, and a devilish pretty girl in a close-curtained litter!” “How!—What, saw you her, De Meilleraye? What like was she?—Tête Dieu! why seized you not the convoy?” “De Chateaufort,” said I; “is it that I am myself unknown, or is it permitted to be ignorant of this De Chateaufort.” “It is not permitted, sir,” replied De Grammont, with infinite gravity, “to be ignorant of any man who hath a pretty damsel in a close-curtained litter—hey, De Meilleraye?” “Nevertheless,” cried Condé, “I fear that, in this instance, we must pardon the young man his crime. Yes, sir, crime,” he continued, in a tone of affected indignation, as he saw me stare— “what, know you not that it has been decided, long since, in our high Parliament of wits, `That a mistake is worse than a crime?' But, crime or blunder, I fear, gentlemen, that we must overlook it, as I well believe we all are guilty in the same degree! How say you, Grammont, Duplessis—who is De Chateaufort?” “He is, so please your highness,” answered Grammont, so gravely that Condé looked for a reply—“he is a young man, with five hundred soldiers, two hundred swine. Is it not so, De Meilleraye?—two hundred swine and one fair lady?” “A truce to jesting,” began De Meilleraye— “Treason, monseigneur, treason,” shouted the other; “I do beseech you call a guard for the maréchal: we shall next have him crying, `Peace with the Frondeurs!' ” “In the mean time let us drink—a health to Chateaufort's fair lady!” After a mighty pledge had been quaffed to this most sapient toast, the maréchal, not a little vain of his supposed discovery, recommenced, before any of those present had recovered their breath,— “Monsieur de Chateaufort is third son of the Marquis de Penthiêvre. Though why he should have sent his youngest with his regiment I cannot conceive, when he has two sons who have seen service.” “Let them go hang,” cried Condé, growing weary of the subject—“let them go hang, the marquis and his sons, be they three or thirty! One cup more, and to bed: we have work for to-morrow, gentlemen, sharp work; pray God it be successful. Monsieur de Mornington, you will have your men under arms one hour before the daybreak; occupy the heights of St. Mandé with your three regiments, and hold them till we can bring up our infantry. Hold them, despite the devil! De Châtillon, no bed for you to-night; you must march at midnight—en avant—sweep all before you, but do not charge till daybreak; and then we shall be there, God willing, to cover or support you! Fill up! fill up! and then good-night!” Excusing myself from further potations on the score of health, and of the necessity of seeing immediately to the movements of the cavalry, I bowed and withdrew. In the outer hall, most of the officers, worn out by the continual and harassing service on which they were employed, were sleeping, some in their chairs, some wrapped in their mantles on the floor; and the Swiss guards themselves were nodding as they leaned upon their rested halberds. Without the doors a watch-fire was blazing, and in its ruddy light the horses of the officers were picketed, while the grooms were slumbering or carousing by their sides, mingled with pedlers, courtesans, and countrymen, and all the rabble whose presence was connived at, if not permitted, in the quarters of the royal army. As I drew near, which I did silently and unannounced, I thought I caught the sound of my own name; it was repeated, and, despite of the old adage, I stood still. “That is a gallant horse of his, that bay,” cried the first speaker; “will he ride him to-morrow in the field?” VOL. I.—T “I judge not,” replied a second voice—it was that of the groom to whose charge I had committed Bayard—“this charger has had hard work to-day.” “And hath he others, then? Methought he owned but one, this English officer.” “He had but one till his return from Pont à Mousson, when his majesty's equery sent him another, as a reward of honour. Ventre St. Gris! A charger of ten thousand; white as the winter's snow, with jet-black mane and tail.” “And he will back the white to-morrow?” “Saint Dieu! how should I know—or if I did, what matters it?” returned the groom. “Drink up your eau-de-vie; and let the horses look to themselves.” Finding that I should hear no further, and marvelling somewhat with myself what these inquiries could mean, I hurried up to the fire,— “My horse, sirrah!” I exclaimed rather shortly, as if ignorant of all that had passed, “my horse! why dally you?” It was not a moment before the animal was brought to me; but in that moment's space I cast my eye over the circle, which had for the most part risen to their feet at my approach, to see if I could not detect the inquirer. It was not long before I found him, or at least one whom I concluded to be the same. He was a dark, sallow-complexioned man, broad-shouldered and strong made, though somewhat undersized. He wore a suit of common blue homespun, with a thick riding-coat of shaggy felt thrown loosely over it, and a huge bonnet of uncut plush pulled forward over his eyes. There was, indeed, little or nothing peculiar about the man, unless it were a slightly military bearing, which was but partially disguised by what seemed to me an affected boorishness of manner. Yet there was something about him which excited my attention; a sort of undefinable resemblance to some person I had seen before, and that, too, at no very remote period. I looked at him steadily, and he met my fixed gaze as firmly, and with an air of utter unconsciousness. I could not recall time or place, yet I felt certain that I had caught his eye before; it was a feeling, too, that gave me some disquiet, as though I had some lurking cause of apprehension. Nothing, however, was to be done. I mounted my horse and rode slowly to my private quarters, pondering as I went on the conversation I had heard that evening. There was indeed much food for meditation:—the mysterious lady; the youngest son of three leading his father's vassals; and, above all, the unaccountable absence of the elder brethren! To say the least of it, there was a strange coincidence; and I was hard set, as I rode homeward, to discover some mode of gaining, without appearing to desire it, more certain information on the subject. Still, notwithstanding all this, the countenance of the stranger was uppermost in my mind; and the more I considered it, the more singular did the pertinacity of his inquiries appear. I determined, at length, though perhaps I could not easily have explained the cause of my determination, that I would on no account ride White Majestic—for so my grooms had named him—on the morrow. “Martin,” I cried, as I entered my little dwelling, “we shall have work to do right early! Go find the orderlies of my three regiments forthwith, and let them come to me at once for orders; and, hark you! bear Monsieur Mornington's good wishes to Colonel St. Agrêve, and ask the loan of his black charger for to-morrow. Bayard is overdone, and it lists me not to ride Majestic. I await not his reply to-night; but see that a horse —be it the black or no—be fully harnessed for the field three hours before the daybreak. You, Martin, if you will, shall bear my private ensign; I hold a warrant from the prince of your appointment, and here I have an order on the colonel of the first regiment for a troop-horse and housings. See that you be well accountred, and on foot before the hour. Perform this speedily, and then get thee to bed at once; 'tis late already.” In half an hour's space I had despatched the subalterns of every regiment with marching orders; for half an hour more I mused till my head grew dizzy with the fruitless toil; then threw myself upon my lowly bed, and, over-fatigued alike in body and in spirit, slept heavily, till I was aroused by the wild flourish of our trumpets as they sounded the reveillé.
