      <field name="fulltext">History and Introduction Few things are taught in our high schools today that will be of greater service to the men and women of the next generation, especially those who are to become leaders in their communities, than a course in public speaking. Yet in past years training along this line has been minimized in our secondary schools. In fact the vast majority of them have given their pupils practically no such training. The members of the Jefferson and Washington Literary Societies of the University of Virginia, realizing the importance of establishing such courses, determined to inaugurate some plan by which debating and public speaking could be encouraged in the secondary schools. Consequently the Virginia High School Literary League was organized by the societies in November of 1913. A bulletin was published containing a question for debate and sufficient material to write an intelligent argument thereon. Before the first of February eighty schools had enrolled in the league and each was paired with another in its neighborhood for a preliminary debate. The winners of these preliminary debates were entitled to come to the University of Virginia to participate in the final contest. The question for the debate was, "Resolved: That a law be passed in Virginia compelling all children more than seven and less than fifteen years of age, who are not physically unable, to attend school at least sixteen weeks each year (waiving all question of constitutionality)." On the morning of April 30th twenty high schools, each of which had already defeated some other school in its community, reported at the University of Virginia ready to debate. Each school was paired by lot with another school for the first preliminary debate which began promptly at 3 o'clock. By Thursday night all but nine of the debating teams had been eliminated. These nine were again paired among themselves and finally on Friday morning there were only five successful teams still in the race. These were Brookneal, Buena Vista, Charlottesville, John Marshall and Manassas. After a series of semi-final debates the contest rested between Buena Vista and Charlottesville. At the final debate Friday night Buena Vista won over Charlottesville by a two to one vote of the judges. The faculty and students of the University of Virginia put forth every effort to entertain the debaters while in Charlottesville. The visiting teachers were the guests of the Colonnade Club whereas the debaters were entertained by the girls and boys of the Charlottesville High School and the students of the University. Meals were served at the Tea Room to all the visitors without cost. Free tickets were given them to the moving picture theatres, and on Friday afternoon the Chamber of Commerce gave the debaters an excursion to Monticello. After the final contest on Friday night a reception was given to the visiting teams. The Tea Room recently built at the corner was beautifully decorated for the occasion. During the course of the evening many of the faculty of the University and also representatives from the various schools were called upon to speak. Altogether the reception was quite a success and all went home feeling that they had spent a most pleasant evening. Thus the Virginia High School Literary League was inaugurated and already the results prove that the work of the league was not in vain. No less than one hundred schools reported that in one way or another they had begun to prepare their pupils to speak in public and that they would be ready to join the league this fall. The work of the league will be extended this session so as to include a contest in public reading. For some time there has been great need in the Virginia high schools of a more thorough training in reading aloud. In order to stimulate work along this line, Dr. Chas. W. Kent, Linden Kent Memorial Professor of English Literature in the University of Virginia, is offering a twenty-five-dollar gold medal to the winner of the public reading contest. This medal is to be presented in the name of the Linden Kent Memorial School of English Literature. In addition to the debating and public reading the league will also hold several athletic contests. These will be under the direction of the General Athletic Association of the University and will include a state contest in baseball, a state contest in basketball, as well as a track meet. The purpose of such contests is not only to encourage training in athletics but also to standardize the athletic requirements of secondary schools throughout the state. It is earnestly hoped that every secondary school in Virginia, whether public or private, will become a member of the league and give us its hearty support in its work. We require no dues. We merely ask you coöperation. Whereas the committee is very anxious to have every high school in the state enter all these contests, it realizes that many of them are not at present prepared to do so. Therefore each school is invited to take part in any one or as many of the contests as it sees fit. Upon receipt of this bulletin send the name of your school to the Secretary of the Virginia High School Literary and Athletic League, University, Virginia, and designate in which contests you would have your school participate, also ask for any information you desire in regard to them. The Jefferson and Washington Literary Societies and The General Athletic Association.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">State Contest in Public Reading. (Under the direction of the Jefferson and Washington Literary Societies.) REGULATIONS. 1914-1915. I. This contest is open to all secondary schools in Virginia whether public or private. II. Each school shall select from among its pupils one boy or one girl to represent the school in the contest. III. The contest shall consist in the reading by each contestant of two selections of not more than five minutes duration each. The first selection shall be chosen by the contestant and prepared beforehand. The second selection shall be chosen by the judges and not put in the hands of the contestant until five minutes before the time to read it, during which interval the contestant may study the selection if he so desires. In the selection which is chosen by the judges it is suggested that both contestants be allowed to read the same piece but not in each other's presence. IV. If a school desires to take part in this contest the principal shall give the secretary notice of the same prior to the first of December. Upon receipt of such notice the secretary will pair this school with another school that they may hold a preliminary contest in public reading. The status and standards of the schools, their proximity, accessibility, and convenience of location will be considered in making the pairs. The secretary will be very glad if each principal will send a list of other schools with which he thinks such a contest desirable, and as far as possible the secretary will try to arrange a contest for him with one of the schools on this list. V. All preliminary contests in public reading must be held prior to the fifteenth of February. Otherwise the details of the preliminary contests are to be decided by the principals of the two contesting schools. VI. The school that wins in the preliminary contest is entitled to send its representative to the University to compete in the final contests in Public Reading. VII. The final contests will be held at the University on April the first and second. VIII. All competitors will be met at Union Station, Charlottesville, between 7 a. m. and 1 p. m. on Thursday, April, the first, and will be entertained as the guests of the Literary Societies while at the University. IX. The winner of the final contest will be presented with a gold medal by the Linden Kent Memorial School of English Literature. X. It is suggested that those schools, which expect to participate in the debating contest as well as the public reading contest, should hold the contest in public reading with the same school with which their debate is held, and that both contests take place on the same occasion. However this is merely suggested. XI. No pupil who represents his school in the public reading contest will be allowed also to represent his school in the debating contest. XII.

      <field name="fulltext">State Contest in Debating. (Under the direction of the Jefferson and Washington Literary Societies.) REGULATIONS. 1914-1915. I. This contest is open to all secondary schools of Virginia whether public or private. II. Each school shall furnish a debating team of two members. III. The contests are open to boys and girls. IV. The question for debate, including suggested arguments and material, will be found in this bulletin immediately following these regulations. V. If any school desires to take part in this contest, the principal shall notify the secretary of the same prior to the first of December. Upon receipt of such notice the secretary will pair this school with another school for the purpose of holding a preliminary debate. The status and standards of the schools, their proximity, accessibility, and convenience of location will be considered in making the pairs. The secretary will be very glad if each principal will send a list of the other schools with which he thinks such a contest desirable, and as far as possible the secretary will try to arrange a contest for him with one of the schools on this list. VI. All preliminary debates between the schools must be held prior to the fifteenth of February. VII. Each debater shall be given fifteen minutes, no more than five of which may be used for rebuttal. Debates can not be read in toto, but reference may be made to notes. VIII. The details of the preliminary debates are to be decided by the principals of the two schools debating. It is suggested, however, that one school shall have choice of sides, the other choice of place, and lots shall be cast as to which of the two options a school shall take. IX. The school that wins the preliminary debate is entitled to send its team to the University to compete in the final debates. X. The final debates will be held at the University on the first and second of April. XI. The teams coming to the University for the final debates must be prepared to take either side of the question. XII. To the school that wins the final debates a silver cup will be presented by the Board of Visitors of the University. XIII. All debaters coming to the University will be met at Union Station, Charlottesville, Virginia, between 7 a. m. and 1 p. m. on Thursday, April, the first, and will be entertained as guests of the Literary Societies while at the University. This entertainment will be extended also to any principal or teacher who desires to accompany his team. XIV. It is suggested that those schools who expect to participate in the debating contest as well as the public reading contest should hold the contest in public reading with the same school with which their debate is held, and that both contests take place on the same occasion. However this is merely suggested. XV. No pupil who represents his school in the public reading contest will be allowed also to represent his school in the debating contest. XVI. All correspondence should be addressed to the Secretary of the Virginia High School Literary and Athletic League, University, Virginia. Committee on High School Debates, Prof. Chas. G. Maphis, Chairman. D. D. Payne. THE QUESTION FOR DEBATE. Resolved: That women should be given the right to vote on the same basis as men. The question as stated above will be debated in the preliminary contests between the schools, and also in the final contests which will be held at the University on the first and second of April. SUGGESTED ARGUMENTS. The arguments which are suggested below are not intended to be exhaustive but merely to intimate certain broad issues involved in the question. FOR THE AFFIRMATIVE. I. Women are physically able to vote. II. To give women the ballot will effect much needed legislation in regard to child labor, schools, etc. III. The average man knows little of the business of government and must rely on the testimony of experts, and so it would be with women. IV. Every good reform begins with only a few followers and gradually grows thereafter. So it is with woman suffrage. V. Fighting is not essential to voting as a large proportion of the men who vote are physically unable to fight. VI. There are far more girls who graduate from high schools than boys, hence suffrage would increase the educated vote. VII. Although women may exercise an indirect influence on their husbands, fathers, and brothers to have them vote for needed reforms, yet to allow the women themselves to vote would be a much quicker and more effective method. VIII. Women are no busier than men and therefore haye sufficient time to exercise the privilege of the ballot. IX. A certain amount of sentiment and emotion is essential to good government. X. Women are different from men and the introduction of their ballot would add a new and better element to politics. FOR THE NEGATIVE. I. Women may exert an indirect influence on their husbands, fathers, and brothers and thus be represented. II. To the vote of every uneducated man you would add the vote of an uneducated woman. III. Men know more about the business of government. IV. The majority of the women of today do not want suffrage. V. Fighting is necessary to voting. Hence women should be able to fight if they are to vote. VI. Women are too emotional and sentimental to be entrusted with the ballot. VII. If the privilege of voting is given to women they will not exercise it. VIII. If women did exercise the right of voting, it would only increase the expense of elections without changing the results. IX. Suffrage is not a natural right, for all men are not permitted to vote. X. Woman's function in life does not lie in the sphere of politics. MATERIAL ON THE AFFIRMATIVE. WOMAN AND THE COMMONWEALTH: OR A QUESTION OF EXPEDIENCY. By George Pellew. Extract from a pamphlet published by Houghton, Mifflin and Company. Do a Woman's Physical Qualities Disqualify Her for Voting? It is said that women ought not to vote because they are unable to fight, to enforce laws, or to endure the fatigue and burden of voting and of learning how to vote. The first argument is answered by the fact that the tie between voting and fighting ceased so soon as nations became civilized and hired or raised armies to do their fighting for them; since that time, indeed, it may be said that the only connection between bullets and ballots has been the alliteration. As a general rule, in civilized countries, the soldiers in the field are, practically, disqualified for voting, and the local government of their country is, in time of war, of necessity intrusted to those who are left at home as disabled or as not needed for active service. In time of peace, on the other hand, the soldier has, as a rule, no political privileges superior to those of any other citizen, however much crippled or decrepit. The argument is readily reduced to an absurdity, for it would, if logically carried out, disfranchise the great mass of the most intellectual and the best educated men in the community, since, according to the statistics of the medical department during the civil war, over ninety-five per cent of lawyers were found to be unfit for military service. A suggestion, often made, that if all the women were to vote one way, and all the men another, the women, if they should pass a law, would be unable to enforce it, and so would bring the law itself into contempt, is an ingenious effort of imagination, but of no weight as a practical argument. When it is remembered how great are the divergencies of opinion among men, and that unanimity is no less rare among women; how seldom a question involves only one consideration; and how inextricably intermingled, although not identical always, are the interest of men and women, it becomes obvious that the contingency so alarming to many persons could never occur. In case, however, such an improbable, if not impossible thing, should happen, the government and the law would yet survive. The American people is a law-abiding people. When a law has once been enacted, or an officer lawfully elected, those who opposed the bill enforce the law, those who reviled the candidate obey the officer. Unless a majority of the voters of today are at heart law-breakers, a law will never be disregarded simply because it was passed to be enacted by the votes of persons inferior in physical strength to their opponents. The third argument is no less fallacious. Women, it is said, suffer from ill-health more frequently than men, they are also more nervous, and more subject to general debility. Married women are often for long periods disabled, and not infrequently break down, in consequence of the natural consequences of maternity and special household cares that in any condition of society are inevitable. Such being the case, says Mr. Francis Parkman, woman suffrage would be a cruelty. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to suggest that the argument would logically lead to establishing a health qualification for voters generally, and that such a qualification would be ridiculous. Necessity and self-preservation are laws sufficiently imperative to control conduct without being counter-signed by the governor and the council. A woman too sick to vote will not vote for the same reason that a man too sick to vote does not vote. Some women may go to church when they ought to stay at home, and may injure themselves or neglect their children by so doing, but it is not desirable, therefore, that the law should allow men only to go to church. From the point of view of health, no rational distinction can be made between going to church to pray and going to the ballot box to vote, except that the churches are open every Sunday and the polls but once a year, and that a woman can go to church two or three times on one day, but is forbidden by law to vote more than once. The objection is not only absurd, but has the additional misfortune of being probably the reverse of the truth. The exercise of the suffrage would presumably tend to improve, rather than to impair, the health of the average women. There is nothing dangerous to health in reading political articles in the daily papers, in discussing political questions with relations or friends, or in walking the distance of a few hundred yards and depositing a piece of paper in a box. Many women now do all these things without any suffering in consequence. On the contrary, the reasonable exercise of any faculty, and of all the faculties, of mind and body, is positively beneficial to man or woman. "Nervous energy run to waste" is the secret of so much of the lassitude and sickness prevalent among American women. "For my own part," says Sir Spencer Wells, one of the greatest living physicians, "I think women capable of a great deal more than they have been accustomed to in times past. If overwork sometimes leads to disease, it is morally more wholesome to work into it than to lounge into it, and if some medical practitioners have observed cases where mental overstrain has led to disease, I cannot deny that I also have at long intervals seen some such cases. But for every such example I feel sure that I have seen at least twenty where evils equally to be deplored are caused in young women by want of mental occupation, by deficient exercise, too luxurious living, and too much amusement." This is true of the unmarried and the young, but it is no less true of the married and the middle-aged. Nervous diseases of every kind are most often caused by confinement to a narrow circle of thoughts and duties. A brisk conversation about politics is stimulating and healthy in itself, but is especially valuable in distracting the attention from the petty, harassing details of daily life. There is no more certain cure for nervousness and its baleful attendants, hypochondria and dyspepsia, than the excitement of interests broader and more impersonal than the interests of the kitchen and the nursery, than the brooking over one's own or one's husband's emotions, ill temper, or wrong-doing. To enable women to be efficiently interested in as many things as possible, is to give them a tonic better than any medicine; to compel them to be interested in a few things only, is to poison the whole atmosphere of their intellectual life. Finally it must be observed that weakness, at least physical weakness, so far from being a disqualification for voting, in a civilized community is the greatest possible qualification for voting, since representative governments have become established mainly for the protection of the weak. Do a Woman's Mental Qualities Disqualify Her for Voting? That women's minds differ from men's minds is a theory it would be difficult to establish. Whenever women have had the same opportunity and inducement as men for study and investigation, in astronomy, medicine, political economy, history, journalism, fiction, ethics, they have shown no special inferiority to men. Queens and princesses, when called to govern, have been no less successful than the kings and princes of their family. Even in this Commonwealth women on the school boards, in public societies, or in government offices, as students of the condition of the poor, conductors of philanthropic enterprises, or managers of a business or a fortune, after suitable training for such work, have not generally been found deficient in enterprise or sagacity. It is not usually from the lips of the wisest men that sneers at women's intelligence are apt to fall, but from the lips of boys unacquainted with the world, or of men whose lack of wisdom has been a fruitful source of amusement or profit to women or wiser men. It is true that women are generally supposed to be impatient of argument, to make a personal application of impersonal principles, and to judge by a narrow standard of preference, prejudice, or morality; but women, like men, adapt their conversation to their hearers, and, while they are personal, or conventional with men, they are often logical enough with other women, and the element of truth that remains in the criticism may be accounted for by the influence of the arbitrary restrictions which the opponents of woman suffrage would perpetuate. If a man were proscribed by custom from the free exercise of his faculties, if his duties were limited to managing a household, engaging and discharging servants, ordering meals, and bearing and tending children, he would infallibly become tightly bound by narrow and conventional prejudices, and if he were able to gain any practical ends, only by appeals to the emotions rather than to the intelligence of women, and usually a single woman and that his wife, he would be unable to argue long impersonally and soon lose what freedom of thought and speech he once possessed. The intellectual peculiarities of women may be caused by the narrowness of the sphere within which their interests are habitually restricted; it is then unscientific to suppose them to be inherent in the sex. This conclusion is confirmed by the facts that similar peculiarities are characteristic of races and classes living in servile or menial conditions, that they are perceptible even in men anywhere of limited experience or dependent on others, and that they are not in the least characteristic of women who have had varied business or professional experience, who have been educated without reference to marriage, or who have been married to liberal-minded men. The typical New England school-teacher is neither illogical nor absurdly sentimental, and over eighty per cent of New England school teachers are women. The average married woman, even, in questions that she has studied, is not illogical; she is usually ingeniously economical, prudent in selecting servants, far-seeing in advice to her husband. With such qualities, women could not fail to exercise the suffrage in the main with intelligence. Again, mental operations of the same kind are involved in all actions that require thought. Economy at home predisposes to public economy: practical common sense is as necessary in politics as in housekeeping, insight into character is as useful in choosing public as domestic servants. In Massachusetts, indeed, the intellectual inferiority of women to men cannot be seriously suggested or consistently maintained. The welfare of this Commonwealth is truly admitted to be based on the excellence of its public school system, and women who are held to be sufficiently intelligent to vote for members of school committees cannot be said to lack the intelligence requisite to vote wisely for the mayor of a city or for the selectmen of a town. Instead of women being intellectually inferior to men, it would, probably, be more nearly true in this Commonwealth that the women are as a rule intellectually superior to the men of the same class in society. Such, at least, is the reason commonly assigned for the often noticed disinclination to marriage among the most carefully educated women; and among our laboring, farming, manufacturing and mercantile population it is the women rather than the men who have the time and the inclination to attend lectures and concerts, to read, study, and discuss questions not purely personal and sordid, in a word, who strive the most zealously to maintain and broaden their intellectual life. So much is admitted even by many of the most vigorous opponents of woman suffrage. "The ballot," says the President of Oberlin College, "cannot be denied to woman on the ground that she has not the intelligence and discernment to use it well. Many women unquestionably have such intelligence, and there is scarcely room for doubt that women as a body would vote as wisely as men." If women are not disqualified for voting by the nature of their intelligence, it is no objection to giving them the suffrage that at the present time but few of them have studied political questions. So long as women are unable to vote they cannot be expected to inform themselves carefully about matters of politics, for the same reason that a person who cannot be a shoemaker is not expected to study the process of making shoes. It is a proof of common sense, rather than an indication of folly, to confine one's efforts to subjects in which one can do practical work. Few women studied law before they were granted admission to the bar, now many women have written law books; few women studied medicine before they were allowed to practice it, now excellent essays on medical subjects are written by women. If women have brains like those of men, they will inform themselves about political questions as rapidly and as correctly as men, so soon as those questions are presented to them. Such questions, indeed, as usually arise in municipal elections possess no special complexity, and after a few hours' talk, and by a little attention, can be solved by any normally constituted person. Finally, it may be said that the objection to women's intelligence has been answered with far more completeness than was in any way necessary. "What is wanted in politics is the suffrage of the great mass of society, rather than that of exceptional genius, which can always make its influence felt, that this great mass may be able, by means of the suffrage, to make known its sufferings and its wants." From this point of view, a voter need not be qualified by considerable intelligence, but only by intelligence sufficient to understand her individual wants and requirements and the probable effect of her vote, if successful, upon herself and her neighbors. In the case of city or town elections, very ordinary intelligence is sufficient for this purpose. Whether taxes should be increased or lessened, whether the sale of intoxicating liquors should be licensed or not, whether the roads have been neglected, whether the poor-house is managed economically, whether a new park is desirable, whether the conduct of local officers has been efficient or the reverse, whether the candidates are honest or dishonest, energetic or idle, able or incompetent,— these are questions that need seriously confuse only persons unusually unobservant or thickheaded, and that women in general far exceed this minimum of intelligence can surely be denied by no one who is qualified by the same standard. OBJECTIONS ANSWERED. By Alice Stone Blackwell. Pamphlet published by National American Woman Suffrage Association. Why Should Women Vote? The reasons why women should vote are the same as the reasons why men should vote—the same as the reasons for having a republic rather than a monarchy. It is fair and right that the people who must obey the laws should have a choice in choosing the law-makers, and that those who must pay the taxes should have a voice as to the amount of the tax, and the way in which the money shall be spent. Roughly stated, the fundamental principle of a republic is this: In deciding what is to be done, we take everybody's opinion, and then go according to the wish of the majority. As we cannot suit everybody, we do what will suit the greatest number. That seems to be, on the whole, the fairest way. A vote is simply a written expression of opinion. In thus taking a vote to get at the wish of the majority, certain classes of persons are passed over, whose opinions for one reason or another are thought not to be worth counting. In most of our states, these classes are children, aliens, idiots, lunatics, criminals and women. There are good and obvious reasons for making all these exceptions but the last. Of course no account ought to be taken of the opinions of children, insane persons, or criminals. Is there any equally good reason why no account should be taken of the opinions of women? Let us consider the reasons commonly given, and see if they are sound. Are Women Represented? This so-called representation bears no proportion to numbers. Here is a man who has a wife, a widowed mother, four or five unmarried sisters, and half a dozen unmarried daughters. His vote represents himself and all these women, and it counts one; while the vote of his bachelor neighbor next door, without a female relative in the world, counts for just as much. Since the object of taking a vote is to get at the wish of the majority it is clear that the only fair and accurate way is for each grown person to have one vote, and cast it to represent himself or herself. Men and Women Different. American men are the best in the world, and if it were possible for any men to represent women, through kindness and good will to them, American men would do it. But man is by nature too different from a woman to be able to represent her. The two creatures are unlike. Whatever his good will, he cannot fully put himself in a woman's place, and look at things exactly, from her point of view. To say this is no more a reflection upon his mental or moral ability than it would be a reflection upon his musical ability to say that he cannot sing both soprano and bass. Unless men and women should ever become just alike (which would be regrettable and monotonous), women must either go unrepresented or represent themselves. Women Not Represented in the Laws. Another proof that women's opinions are not now fully represented is the lack in many states of humane and protective legislation, and the poor enforcement of such legislation where it exists; the inadequate appropriations for schools; the permission of child labor in factories; and in general the imperfect legal safe-guarding of the moral, educational and humanitarian interests that women have most at heart. In many of our states, the property laws are more or less unequal as between men and women. A hundred years ago, before the equal rights movement began, they were almost incredibly unequal. Yet our grandfathers loved their wives and daughters as much as men do today. Is "Influence" Enough? Yes, but the indirect method is needlessly long and hard. If women were forbidden to use the direct route by rail across the continent and complained of the injustice, it would be no answer to tell them that it is possible to get from New York to San Francisco by going around Cape Horn. Mother and Child. The slowness with which some of the worst inequalities in the laws are corrected shows the unsatisfactoriness of the indirect way. In most states, a married mother has literally no legal rights over her own children, so long as she and her husband live together. Here is a case which actually happened, and which might happen today, in 31 out of the 48 states of the Union: A Chinaman had married a respectable Irishwoman. When their first baby was three days old, the husband gave it to his brother to be taken to China and brought up there. The mother, through the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, appealed to the courts. But the Judge promptly decided that the husband was within his rights. He was the sole legal owner of the baby he had the sole legal right to say what should be done with it. For more than half a century, the suffragists of the United States have been trying to secure legislation making the father and mother joint guardians of their children by law, as they are by nature; but thus far the equal guardianship law has been obtained in only 16 states and the District of Columbia. Massachusetts got it in 1902, after 55 years of effort by Massachusetts women. In Colorado, after women were given the right to vote, the very next Legislature passed an equal guardianship law. Massachusetts, the State Federation of Women's Clubs, the Woman's Relief Corps, the State W. C. T. U., the Children's Friend Society and 65 other associations united in asking for the bill. The only society of women that has ever ranged itself definitely on the wrong side of this question is the "Massachusetts Association Opposed to the Further Extension of Suffrage to Women." It circulated for years, under its official imprint, a leaflet in defense of the old law which gave the husband the sole control of the children. In Massachusetts, in 1902, the laws of inheritance between husband and wife were made equal; but it had taken more than half a century of work to secure this self-evidently just measure. The experience in many other states has been similar. The roundabout way is almost always long and slow. The Ignorant Vote. Statistics published by the National Bureau of Education show that the high schools of every state in the Union are graduating more girls than boys—some of them twice or three times as many. Because of the growing tendency to take boys out of school early in order to put them into business, girls are getting more schooling than boys. Equal suffrage would increase the proportion of voters who have received more than a merely elementary education. The Foreign Vote. Less than one-third of the immigrants coming to this country are women. According to the census of 1910, there are in the United States nearly three times as many native-born women (38,674,693) as all the foreign-born men and foreign-born women put together (13,343,583). The foreign vote is objectionable only so far as it is an ignorant vote. Intelligent foreigners, both men and women, are often very valuable citizens. On the other hand, the ignorant foreign immigrants who come here are fully imbued, both men and women, with all the Old World ideas as to the inferiority and subjection of women. It is not until they have become pretty thoroughly Americanized that they can tolerate the idea of women's voting. The husbands are not willing that their wives should vote, and the wives ridicule the suggestion. Experience shows that until they have become Americanized, the foreign women will not vote. And, after they have become Americanized, why should they not vote, as well as any one else? The Criminal Vote. The vicious and criminal class is comparatively small among women. In the prisons of the United States as a whole, including those for all kinds of offenses, women constitute only five and one-half per cent of the prisoners, and the proportion is growing smaller. Equal suffrage would increase the moral and law-abiding vote very largely, while increasing the vicious and criminal vote very little. This is a matter not of conjecture but of statistics. The Bad Women's Vote. In America the bad women are so few, compared with the good ones, that their votes could have little influence. Mrs. Helen Gilbert Ecob, wife of a prominent clergyman who was for some years a pastor in Denver, writes: "The bad women represent, in any city of the United States, but an infinitesimal proportion of its population, and the vote of that class in Denver is confined practically to three precincts out of 120." Mrs. Sarah Platt Decker, of Denver, ex-president of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, and also for some years president of the Colorado State Board of Charities and Correction, writes: "Does not the vote of the disreputable class of women overbalance the better element? No; the women of the half-world are not willing to vote. They are constantly changing their residence and their names. They do not wish to give any data concerning themselves, their age, name or number and street; they prefer to remain unidentified." Ex-Gov. Warren, of Wyoming, sums it all up when he says, in a letter to Horace G. Wadlin, of Massachusetts: "Our women nearly all vote; and since, in Wyoming as elsewhere, the majority of women are good and not bad, the result is good and not evil." Don't Understand Business. Women have a vote in every other corporation in which they are shareholders. George William Curtis said: "A woman may vote as a stockholder upon a railroad from one end of the country to the other; but, if he sells her stock and buys a house with the money, she has no voice in the laying out of the road before her door, which her house is taxed to keep and pay for." Moreover, it is not true that a man's experience in his own business teaches him how to carry on the business of a city. Some years ago, a fashionable caterer was elected to the Massachusetts Legislature, and was appointed a member of the committee on filling up the South Boston flats. Another member said to him scornfully, "What do you know about filling up flats, anyway?" The caterer answered quietly, "That has been my business for twenty years." The answer was good, as a joke; but, as a matter of fact, what had his experience of planning dinners taught him about the way to turn tide-mud into solid ground? What does the butcher learn from his business about the best way to pave a street, or the baker about the best way to build a sewer, or the candle-stick maker about the best way to lay out a park, or to choose school teachers or policemen, or to run a city hospital? Does a minister learn from his profession how to keep the streets clean, or a lawyer how to conduct a public school, or a doctor how to put out a fire? A man's business, at best, gives him special knowledge only in regard to one or two departments of city affairs. Women's business, as mothers and housekeepers, also gives them special knowledge in regard to some important departments of public work, those relating to children, schools, playgrounds, the protection of the weak and young, morals, the care of the poor, etc. For what lies outside the scope of their own experience, men and women alike must rely upon experts. All they need, as voters, is sense enough and conscience enough to elect honest and capable persons to have charge of these things. Division of Labor. The growth of civilization increases the division of labor as between individuals, but lessens it as between the sexes. One woman no longer spins and weaves, and manufactures the clothing for the men of her family, at the same time carrying on all the housework and in addition making butter, cheese and candles, as our great-grandmothers did. This work is now sub-divided among a number of specialists. On the other hand, in the old times women were excluded from almost all the occupations of men. Housework and sewing were practically the only ways open to them to earn a living. Today, oue of more than 300 trades and professions followed by men, women are found in all but three or four. But this objection about the sub-division of labor is really irrelevant, voting is not labor, in the sense of a trade or profession. The tendency of civilization has been to a greater and greater specilization of labor, but not to a closer and closer restriction of the suffrage. On the contrary, that has been steadily extended. The best results are found not where public affairs are left in the hands of a small class of "professional politicians," but where the largest proportion of the people take a keen interest and an active part in their own government. Would Lose Their Influence. What gives a woman influence? Beauty, goodness, tact, talent, pleasant manners, money, social position, etc. A woman who has any of these means of influence now would still have them if she had a vote, and she would have this other potent means of influence besides. There is a story of a prisoner who had been shut up for many years in a dungeon, getting sunlight only through a chink in the wall. He grew much attached to that chink. At last his friends came and offered to tear down the wall. His mind had become weakened and he begged them not to do it. If they destroyed the wall, he said, they would also destroy the chink through which he got all his sunlight, and he would be left in total darkness. If he had had his wits, he would have seen that he would have all the sunlight he had before, and a great deal more besides. A woman after enfranchisement would have all the personal influence she has now, and political influence in addition. One thing is certain: Every vicious interest in this country, to which women are hostile, would rather continue to contend with women's "indirect influence" than to try to cope with women's vote. Jane Addams and other prominent Chicago women testify to the marked increase of respect that came to the women of Illinois with the granting of the ballot. Dr. Margaret Long of Denver, daughter of the former Secretary of the Navy, writes: "It seems to me impossible that anyone can live in Colorado long enough to get into touch with the life here, and not realize that women count for more in all the affairs of this state than they do where they have not the power the suffrage gives. More attention is paid to their wishes, and much greater weight given to their opinions and judgments." Mrs. Sarah Platt Decker, of Denver, writes: "Under equal suffrage there is a much more chivalrous devotion and respect on the part of men, who look upon their sisters not as playthings or as property, but as equals and fellow-citizens." Mrs. K. A. Sheppard, president of the New Zealand Council of Women says: "Since women have become electors, their views have become important and command respect. Men listen to and are influenced by the opinions of women to a far greater degree than formerly. A young New Zealander in his teens no longer regards his mother as belonging to a sex that may be kept within a prescribed sphere, but as a human being, clothed with the dignity of all those rights and powers which he hopes to enjoy within a few years. That the lads and young men of a democracy should have their whole conception of the rights of humanity broadened and measured by truer standards is in itself an incalculable benefit." Mrs. A. Watson Lister, secretary of the Woman's National Council of Australia, says: "One striking result of equal suffrage is that members of Parliament now consult us as to their bills, when these bear upon the interests of women. The author of the new divorce bill asked all the women's organizations to come together and hear him read it, and to make criticisms and suggestions. I do not remember any such thing happening before, in all my years in Australia. When a naturalization bill was pending, one clause of which deprived Australian women of citizenship if they married aliens, a few women went privately to the Prime Minister and protested, and that clause was altered immediately. After we had worked for years with members of Parliament for various reforms, without avail, because we had not votes, you cannot imagine the difference it makes." —(Woman's Journal, Feb. 13, 1904.) Would Make Women Partisans. Women continue to be non-partisan after they have the ballot, and it gives them more power to secure the good things which the women of all parties want. Prof. Henry E. Kelly, formerly of the Iowa State University, now practicing law in Denver, says in an open letter to State Senator A. H. Gale, of Iowa that he went to Colorado opposed to equal suffrage, but has been controverted by what he has seen of it. Prof. Kelly adds: "Experience clearly shows that women's interest cannot be aroused in mere partisan strife. Their interests center around questions affecting education, public cleanliness, public morality, civic beauty, charities and correction, public health, public libraries—and such subjects as more intimately affect home life, and conduce to the prosperity of the family. Men lose sight of these important considerations in the scramble of partisan warfare for office, but women will not see them obscured by anything." Ellis Meredith of Denver writes: "There has never been a party measure espoused by women in the Colorado Legislature. The women of all parties want the same things, and have worked for them together, in perfect harmony. They wanted a pure-food law, and secured one from the last Legislature, in line with the national legislation. They wanted civil service reform, and have obtained that, so far as the officers of the State institutions are concerned. During the last Legislature, an attempt was made to take the control of the State Bureau of Child and Animal Protection away from the Colorado Humane Society, and to create a political board. Every federated woman's club in the State besieged its senators and representatives to vote against the bill, and the vice chairmen of the state central committees of the two chief political parties (both of them women) went together to different members of the Legislature to enter their protest. Men understood that in legislative matters, when they oppose the women, they are opposing practically all the women, and the great independent vote of the State."—(Woman's Journal, Aug. 31, 1907.) Opposition of Women. "The organized opposition among women to suffrage is very small compared with the organized movement of women in its favor. Out of our 48 states only 17 have anti-suffrage organizations of any kind. There are Suffrage Associations in 46. In New York at the time of the last constitutional convvention, the suffragists secured more than 300,000 signatures to their petitions; the anti-suffragists, only 15,000. In Chicago, 104 organizations, with an aggregate membership of more than 10,000 women, petitioned for a woman suffrage clause in the city charter, while only one small organization of women petitioned against it. In Maine, in Iowa, in short, in every state where petitions for suffrage and remonstrances against it have been sent to the Legislature, the petitioners have always outnumbered the remonstrants, and have generally outnumbered them 50 or 100 to one. On the only occasion when the government took an official referendum among women on the subject (in Massachusetts, 1895), the women's vote was in favor of suffrage more than 25 to one. Less than one-sixth of one per cent of the women in the State voted against it. Julia Ward Howe said: "Most women are as yet indifferent on the suffrage question; but, of those who take any lively interest in it either way, the great majority are in favor. This has been demonstrated wherever the matter has been brought to a test." (Woman's Journal, Aug. 1, 1908.) Every constitutional amendment that has ever been carried in New York or Massachusetts would have been set down as defeated if all the men too indifferent to vote upon it either way had been counted as opposed. In New York, a successful amendment seldom gets more than 25 per cent of the popular vote. The remaining 75 per cent are "either indifferent or opposed," but, if less than 25 per cent are actually opposed, the amendment is carried. In Massachusetts the Anti-Suffrage Association has been collecting signatures of women against suffrage since 1895, and in 18 years it has not succeeded in getting the names of 4 per cent of the women of the State. In the country, at large, despite urgent and widely published appeals from the Antid, not one per cent of the women have ever expresed any objection to suffrage. Why should the less than one per cent who protest claim to carry any more weight than the 99 per cent who either want the ballot or do not object to it? Already Overburdened. Mrs. Alice Freeman Palmer wrote: "How much time must she spend on her political duties? If she belongs to the well-to-do class, and hires others to do her work, she has time for whatever interests her most—only let these interests be noble! If she does her own housework, she can take ten minutes to stop on her way to market and vote once or twice a year. She can find half an hour a day for the newspapers and other means of information. She can talk with family and friends about what she reads. She does this now; she will then do it more intelligently, and will give and receive more from what she says and hears. If she does this reading and talking, she will be better informed than the majority of voters are now. "The duties of motherhood and the making of a home are the most sacred work of women, and the dearest to them, of every class. If casting an intelligent vote would interfere with what only women can do—and what, failed in, undermines society and government— no one can question which a woman must choose. But it cannot be shown that there are any large number of women in this country who have not the necessary time to vote intelligently, and it can be argued that study of the vital questions of our government would make them better comrades to their husbands and friends, better guides to their sons, and more interesting and valuable members of society. Women of every class have more leisure than men, are less tied to hours of routine; they have had more years of school training than men. All this makes simple the combination of public and higher duties." Women and Office-Holding. When we say that women would be eligible to hold office, what do we mean? Simply that if a majority in any place would rather have a woman to hold a certain position than any one else, and if she is willing to serve, they shall be allowed to elect her. Women are serving as officials already; some of the women most prominent in opposing equal suffrage have been holders of public office. The late president of the "Massachusetts Association Opposed to the Further Extension of Suffrage to Women" (Mrs. J. Elliott Cabot) was for years a member of the school board of Brookline, and also Overseer of the Poor. Yet that Association, in its published documents, objects to equal suffrage on the ground that "suffrage involves the holding of office, and office-holding is incompatible with the duties of most women." Suffrage does not involve office-holding by the majority of women, but only by a few; and there are always some women of character and ability who could give the necessary time. Women as a class have more leisure than men. In the enfranchised states there has been no rush of women into office, and the offices that women do hold are mainly educational and charitable. Ballots and Bullets. If no men were allowed to vote except those who were able and willing to do military and police duty, women might consistently be debarred for that reason. But so long as the old, the infirm, the halt, the lame and the blind are freely admitted to the ballot box, some better reason must be found for excluding women than the fact that they do not fight. All men over 45 are exempt from military service, yet they vote. Col. T. W. Higginson says: "It appears by the record of the United States Military Statistics that out of the men examined for military duty during the civil war, of journalists 740 in every 1,000 were found unfit; of preachers, 974; of physicians, 680, of lawyers, 544. "Grave divines are horrified at the thought of admitting women to vote when they cannot fight, though not one in twenty of their own number is fit for military duty, if he volunteered. Of the editors who denounce woman suffrage, only about one in four could himself carry a musket; while, of the lawyers who fill Congress, the majority could not be defenders of their country, but could only be defended." Again, it must be remembered that some woman risks her life whenever a soldier is born into the world. Later she does picket duty over his cradle, and for years she is his quartermaster, and gathers his rations. And when that boy grows to a man, shall he say to his mother, "If you want to vote, you must first go and kill somebody? It is a coward's argument!" Mrs. Z. G. Wallace of Indiana, from whom Gen. Lew Wallace drew the portrait of the mother in "Ben Hur," said: "If women do not fight, they give to the state all its soldiers." This ought in all fairness to be taken as an offset for the military service that women do not render. As Lady Henry Somerset says, "She who bears soldiers does not need to bear arms." Can Laws Be Enforced? But thousands of male non-combatants are already admitted to the ballot box, and there is no certainty at any election that the majority of voters represent a majority of possible fighters. No trouble of this kind has resulted from equal suffrage in practice. The laws are as well enforced in the enfranchised states as in adjoining states where women have no vote. Where women have school suffrage their votes occasionally turn the scale, but there is never any attempt to install the defeated candidates by force. Where women have the full ballot, they have often defeated bad candidates for higher offices, but no riotous uprising has ever followed. This particular objection is a libel on American manhood. Will It Increase Divorce? Full suffrage was granted to the women of Wyoming in 1869. During the twenty years from 1870 to 1890, divorce in the United States at large increased about three times as fast as the population. In the group of Western States, omitting Wyoming, it increased nearly four times as fast as the population. In Wyoming it increased only about half as fast as the population. "An ounce of experiment is worth a ton of theory." Rev. Francis Miner Moody, Secretary of the California Commission working to secure a uniform divorce law throughout the United States, published in the Woman Voter of February, 1913, an article showing by actual statistics that every state which has had equal suffrage for a considerable number of years has declined markedly in its divorce rate as compared with the rest of the country. He points out that in Colorado the drop was so great as to be "astonishing." Just before Colorado granted equal suffrage, in 1891 and 1892, its average number of divorces per year was 937. For the three years immediately following the bestowal of equal suffrage—1894, 1895, and 1896—the average number of divorces per year was only 517. A father sometimes turns his son out of doors for voting the wrong ticket, but among American men this is rare. Where such a case does arise, it is to be met by educating the domestic despot, not by disfranchising all the members of the family but one. A couple who are sensible and good-tempered will not quarrel if they are once in a while unable to think alike about politics. A couple who are not sensible and good-tempered are sure to quarrel anyway—if not about politics, then about something else. The Question of Chivalry. Justice would be worth more to women than chivalry, if they could not have both. A working girl put the case in a nutshell when she said: "I would gladly stand for twenty minutes in the street car going home, if by doing so I could get the same pay that a man would have had for doing my day's work." But women do not have to stand in the street cars half as often in Denver as in Boston or in New York. Justice and chivalry are not in the least incompatible. Women have more freedom and equality in America than in Europe, yet American men are the most chivalrous in the world. Known by Its Enemies. Those who thrive upon the corruption of politics do not think so. The ignorant, vicious and criminal vote is always cast solidly against equal rights for women. Too Emotional. Mrs. E. T. Brown, at a meeting of the Georgia State Federation of Women's Clubs, read a paper in which she said: "You tell us that women are not fitted for dealing with the problems of government, being too visionary and too much controlled by sentiment. "Now it is very true of women that they are largely controlled by sentiment, and, as a matter of fact, men are largely controlled by sentiment also, in spite of their protesting blushes. Was it logic that swept like a wave over this country and sent our army to protect the Cubans when their suffering grew too intense to be endured even in the hearing? Is it shrewd business calculation that sends thousands of dollars out of this country to feed a starving people during the ever-recurring famines in unhappy India? Was it hard common sense that sent thousands of American soldiers into what looked like a death-trap of China in the almost baseless hope of rescuing a few hundred American citizens? Do not men like Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson and Lee live in the hearts of American men, not alone for what they did, but still more for what they dreamed of? The man who is not controlled by sentiment betrays his friends, sells his vote, is a traitor to his country, or wrecks himself, body and soul, with immoralities; for nothing but sentiment prevents any of these things. The sense of honor is pure sentiment. The sentiment of loyalty is the only thing that makes truth and honesty desirable, or a vote a non-salable commodity. "Government would be a poor affair without sentiment, and is not likely to be damaged by a slightly increased supply." What Is the Unit? The childless widower, the unmarried boy of 21, and the confirmed old bachelor of 90 have votes; the widow with minor children has none. Under our laws the political unit is not the family, but the male individual. The unequal number of grown persons in different families would make it impossible to treat the family as the political unit. Women's Small School Vote. The size of men's vote is just in proportion to the size of the election. At presidential elections it is very large, at state elections much smaller, at a municipal election smaller still, and at school elections, wherever these are held separately, only a fraction of the men turn out to vote. The smallness of the woman's school vote is regrettable, but it is only a new proof of the truth of Mrs. Poyser's immortal saying: "I am not denying that women are foolish; God Almighty made them to match the men!" In Kansas women were given school suffrage in 1861. Their vote was small. In 1887 they were given full municipal suffrage. Their vote at once became much larger, and has increased at successive elections. In 1912, they were given the full ballot, and their vote increased much more. In Colorado women were given school suffrage in 1876. Their vote was small. In 1893 they were given the full ballot, and on January 31, 1899, the Colorado Legislature declared, by a practically unanimous vote of both Houses, that "during this time (the preceding five years) women have exercised the privilege as generally as men." In the states of Oregon and Washington, women had the school ballot for many years, and their vote was small. Now that they have gained full suffrage it has become large. The women's school vote has completely disproved the fear that the bad women would be the first to rush to the polls. In answer to the prediction that the best women will not vote, Col. Higginson says: "In Massachusetts, under school suffrage, the complaint has been that only the best women vote." Will Women Vote? In Wyoming women have had full suffrage since 1869. The Wyoming Secretary of State, in a letter to Miss Alice Stone Blackwell, of Boston, says that 90 per cent of them vote. (Woman's Journal, May 6, 1905.) The Colorado Secretary of State, in a letter to Mrs. Charles Park, of Boston, says that 80 per cent of Colorado women register, and about 72 per cent vote. (Woman's Journal, Aug. 20, 1908.) The Chief Justice of Idaho and all the Justices of the State Supreme Court have signed a published statement that "the large vote cast by the women establishes the fact that they take a lively interest." (Woman's Journal, Aug. 20, 1908.) In Australia, in the first elections after the women were enfranchised, which took place in 1903, 359,315 women voted; in 1906, 431,033; and in 1910, 601,946. When woman suffrage was granted in New Zealand in 1893, the estimated number of women in the country was 139,915. Of these, 109,461 registered to vote; and the number of women voting has increased at each triennial Parliamentary election since. In 1893, 90,290 women voted; in 1896, 108,783; in 1899, 119,550; in 1902, 138,565; in 1905, 175,046; in 1908, 190,114. (New Zealand Year Book.) Mrs. K. A. Shepard, president of the New Zealand Council of Women, writes that in the elections of 1911, 221,858 women voted. The majority of the women had never asked for suffrage in any of these places. A Growing Cause. In Colorado, when woman suffrage was submitted the first time, it was defeated; the second time, it was carried by a majority of 6,387. In 1901, after the women had been voting for eight years, the matter was virtually resubmitted to the people and passed by a majority of 17,000. In Kansas, the first time it was submitted it got only 9,100 votes; the second time it got 95,302; the third time it got 175,376, and carried. In the State of Washington, the first time, the majority against it was 19,386; the second time it was only 9,882, and it was finally carried in 1910 by a majority of 22,623. In California, in 1895, the vote stood 110,355, for and 137,099 against —an adverse majority of 26,744. In 1911, the amendment carried by a majority of 3,587. In 1912, three states of the Union gave suffrage to women, a larger number than ever did so in one year before. In 1913, Illinois and Alaska have followed suit, and in addition nine State Legislatures have given a majority vote of both houses in favor of submitting the question to the voters—almost three times as many as ever did so in a single year before. The Test of Experiment. Women in this country now have the full ballot in Wyoming, Colorado, Idaho, Utah, Washington, California, Kansas, Oregon, Arizona and in the territory of Alaska, while in Illinois they can vote for all municipal officers and Presidential electors. Abroad, they have full Parliamentary suffrage in New Zealand, Australia, Finland, Iceland, and Norway; while in the Isle of Man and in Bosnia, women property owners can vote for members of the local Parliament. They have municipal suffrage throughout England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, nine of the provinces of Canada, Sweden and Denmark, and even in Burma and some parts of India. In some of these countries they have had it for generations. In all these places put together, the opponents thus far have not found a dozen respectable men who assert over their own names and addresses that it has had any bad results. This is the more remarkable in view of the fact that active antisuffrage associations in New York and Massachusetts have been for years diligently gathering all the adverse testimony they could find. On the other hand, scores of the most highly esteemed men and women in the equal suffrage states testify that the results are good. In Wyoming, women have had the full ballot for nearly half a century. For the last 25 years, the advocates of equal suffrage have had a standing challenge, inviting its opponents to find, in all Wyoming, two respectable men who will assert over their own names and addresses that it has had any bad results whatever. The opponents have thus far failed to respond. Doubling the Vote. If letting women sing in church merely doubled the volume of sound, it would still be a good thing, because it would double the number of persons who had the lung exercise and the inspiration of joining in a good hymn and it would make the chorus stronger. If equal suffrage merely doubled the number of voters, it would still do good, because to take an interest in public affairs would give women mental stimulus and greater breadth of view; and it would also bring to bear on public problems the minds of an increased number of intelligent and patriotic citizens. But the great advantage of women in music is that they add the soprano and alto to the tenor and bass. If women were exactly like men, equal suffrage would merely double the vote. But women are different from men; and women's voices in the state, like women's voices in the choir, would be the introduction of a new element. This is recognized even by opponents, when they express the fear that equal suffrage would lead to "sentimental legislation." Men are superior to women along certain lines, and women superior to men along certain others. The points of weakness in American politics at present are precisely the points where women are strong. There is no lack in our politics of business ability, executive ability, executive talent, or "smartness" of any kind. There is a dangerous lack of conscience and humanity. The business interests, which appeal more especially to men, are well and shrewdly looked after; the moral and humanitarian interests, which appeal more especially to women, are apt to be neglected. Not a Natural Right. It is hard to define just what a "natural right" is. Dr. James Freeman Clarke said: "If all women were forbidden to use the sidewalk, and they complained of the injustice, it would be no answer to tell them that it was not natural or inherent right, but one given by society, and which society might therefore control as it saw fit. A great many rights are given by society, of which, however, it would be manifestly unjust to deprive either sex." Too Many Voters. This only means that we have too many voters of the wrong kind. If to increase the number of voters were an evil in itself, every woman who becomes the mother of half a dozen sons would have done harm to her country. But if all six grew up to be good voters she has conferred a benefit on her country. So she has if five of them become good voters, and only one a bad voter. Woman suffrage would bring in at least five good voters to one bad one. It is often said that we have too many immigrants. We mean too many immigrants of an undesirable kind. We all rejoice when we hear of a large influx from Finland or some other country whose people are considered especially desirable immigrants. We want them to offset those of less virtuous and lawabiding races. The Governor of one of the enfranchised states writes of woman suffrage: "The effect of this increase in the vote is the same as if a large and eminently respectable class of citizens had immigrated here." Would Unsex Women. The difference between men and women are natural; they are not the result of disfranchisement. The fact that all men have equal rights before the law does not wipe out natural differences of character and temperament between man and man. Why should it wipe out the natural differences between men and women? The women of England, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, the Scandinavian countries and our own equal suffrage states are not perceptible in looks or manners from women elsewhere, although they have been voting for years. Women Do Not Want It. Every improvement in the condition of women thus far has been secured not by a general demand from the majority of women, but by the arguments, entreaties and "continual coming" of a persistent few. In each case the advocates of progress have had to contend not merely with the conservatism of men, but with the indifference of women, and often with active opposition from some of them. When a man in Saco, Me., first employed a saleswoman, the men boycotted his store, and the women remonstrated with him on the sin of placing a young woman in a position of such "publicity." When Lucy Stone began to try to secure for married women the right to their own property, women asked with scorn, "Do you think I would give myself where I would not give my property?" When Elizabeth Blackwell began to study medicine, the women at her boarding house refused to speak to her, and women passing her on the street held their skirts aside. It is a matter of history with what ridicule and opposition Mary Lyon's first efforts for the education of women were received, not only by the mass of men, but by the mass of women as well. In eastern countries, where women are shut up in zenanas and forbidden to walk the streets unveiled, the women themselves are often the strongest upholders of these traditional restrictions, which they have been taught to think add to their dignity. The Chinese lady is proud of her small feet as any American anti-suffragist is of her political disabilities. Pundita Ramabai tells us that the idea of education for girls is so unpopular with the majority of Hindoo women that when a progressive Hindoo proposes to educate his little daughter, it is not uncommon for the women of his family to threaten to drown themselves. All this merely shows that human nature is conservative, and that it is fully as conservative in women as in men. The persons who take a strong interest in any reform are generally few, whether among men or women, and they are habitually regarded with disfavor, even by those whom the proposed reform is to benefit. Many changes for the better have been made during the last half century in the laws, written and unwritten, relating to women. Everybody approves of these now, because they have become accomplished facts. But not one of them would have been made to this day, if it had been necessary to wait till the majority of women asked for it. The change now under discussion is to be judged on its merits. In the light of history, the indifference of most women and the opposition of a few must be taken as a matter of course. It has no more rational significance now than it has had in regard to each previous step of women's progress. MATERIAL ON THE NEGATIVE. WHY I OPPOSE WOMAN SUFFRAGE. Extract from a Pamphlet by George R. Lockwood. My Objections to Woman Suffrage. I classify my objections under these four heads: 1. Where there is substantially universal manhood suffrage, as there is in this country, all persons including women and children, are practically represented by the voters. 2. Substantially universal womanhood suffrage, (and that is what is demanded) would add nothing to the voting wisdom of the present electorate of this country. 3. The legal discriminations against women in this country, and especially in Missouri, are but few in number and unimportant in character, and the enfranchisement of women is not necessary for the correction of these discriminations. 4. Because giving women the right to vote will have an injurious effect on the relation of sexes, and be to the detriment of the best interests of women. Argument. First Objection. The first of the foregoing objections to giving the ballot to women is based on the ground that they are substantially, and so far as justice requires, already represented through the practically universal manhood suffrage which exists in Missouri and other states. It should be understood that ours is not a pure Democracy, but a government by representation, and that one may be represented in every substantial and important sense, though he may take no part or have no effect, in the government, or in the choice of the representatives who conduct the affairs of state. For instance, I am a Democrat, but live in a Republican ward and in a Republican Representative, Senatorial and Congressional district. My vote for a member of the Municipal Assembly, or for a State Representative, or Senator, or for a Congressman, is futile, and I have no more influence in the selection of those officials than if I were disfranchised. And yet none of my rights are jeopardized by this condition. I would not move across the street to get into a Democratic ward or district. Unless I am seeking office I have all the rights of any Republican in my ward, or in the Representative, Senatorial or Congressional district in which I reside. And many Republicans live safely, and prosper, in hopelessly Democratic communities, where they are practically disfranchised. Why are the rights of the minority so secure? Because not one of them can be wronged under the law without inflicting a like injury on a member of the majority in like situation. Where such manhood suffrage as we enjoy prevails, every interest and class has an effective voice at the polls, though the votes of certain individuals are futile and might as well, for all practical purposes, remain uncast. Do children, or foreigners before being naturalized, suffer because denied the right to vote? Why then should women suffer because of their disfranchisement? They are the mothers, sisters or wives of voters; or if here and there one of them is without near kin amongst the enfranchised, her community of interest with the women with near kin amongst the voters protects her. Of course, I could, in support of by present contention, also point to the concrete fact that the women of this state, though without votes, do not suffer from any material legal discrimination against them. But I speak of that phase of the question when I discuss the third of the above objections to giving votes to women. This much, however, I will now say: I am quite certain that every one who has followed me is so far convinced of the truth of my present contention that neither he or she would be surprised to learn that there is practically no discrimination against women in the laws of Missouri, and that such discrimination as there may be is found in provisions of the law, which though proper enough, it may be, at one time in the history of civilization, have become derelicts in the march of progress. As I have just said, in effect, if not in so many words, the voters of Missouri cannot legislate against any woman or class of women in the State, however lonely and unprotected, without legislating against their own mothers, sisters and wives; and in this fact lies the sufficient protection of all women against governmental injustice. Most people think that the elective franchise is a right; but such is not the case. No man has any more natural right to vote than he has to exercise any other political function. Qualifications for voting are just as necessary as qualifications for holding office; otherwise the boy, to say nothing of the girl, who has reached the age of discretion, which at common law was not more then fourteen, would have a natural right to vote. But there are and always have been in this country, qualifications to the right to vote, though they are few and more or less trivial; while in all the countries of Europe the right of suffrage is far more limited. When the American Colonies arraigned England in the Declaration of Independence, and denounced taxation without representation, they did not mean to declare against the injustice of taxing a person who was not entitled to vote, for not one of them but had a restricted manhood suffrage, and taxed many who had no vote. What the Colonies did mean to complain of was that they in their public capacities as members of the British Empire were taxed, but not represented. And if England had granted to them a right to seats in Parliament, those seats would have been filled through a restricted suffrage, just as the English seats in Parliament were filled at that time, through the votes of a minority of English men, because of a great restriction in the franchise. It is a mistake to look on the elective franchise as a right. It should be considered as a privilege, subject to expediency, and in the nature of an office, which should be forfeited for many causes not now deemed worthy of more than passing condemnation. Second Objection. The second of my objections to giving votes to women is that substantially universal womanhood suffrage would add nothing to the voting wisdom of the present electorate of this country. A Mrs. Brown once met a Mrs. Jones and inquired: "How is Lawyer Smith?" "Oh," replied Mrs. Jones, "he is lying at death's door." "How like a lawyer," said Mrs. Brown. When I heard Miss Pankhurst tell of the utterly silly rioting and misconduct of so many London Suffragettes, I said to myself: "How like women," some women, and too many, I fear, to justify entrusting them generally with the ballot. If young men had acted after the manner of these London women, would it not be said with one voice they were unfit for the privilege they were demanding? I may remark in passing that there seemed such a reciprocating connection between the Pankhurst London riots and the Pankhurst American lecture tours, that I concluded to contribute my mite to the peace of the English capital by not attending the third, and, let us hope, last Pankhurst lecture in this city. Another, "how like a woman" thought occurred to me when I read of that young heiress in an eastern state who married a man considerably her senior, a widower, with children, and her social and otherwise inferior, whom she left in a few years because, it was said, of his treatment of her, taking her two or three children with her, and then returned in a year or so to her husband after he had become paralyzed. All honor to the love, devotion and unmanlike conduct of this young woman, but nevertheless do you not feel that while she would carry to the polls any amount of sentiment that is worshipful in itself, she would not add to the aggregate practical wisdom of the voters? We cannot get away from the fact that woman is hysterical, and for that reason unsuited for some things, one of which I conceive to be the wise exercise of the privilege of voting. How often have we been shocked and distressed at the utterly unaccountable exhibitions of sympathy which women frequently give by sending flowers and delicacies to criminals, and even to brutal, and often black and utterly lothsome, murderers. Exhibitions of this kind have occurred so often through such long periods, beginning historically as far back at least as the days of Claude Duvall, the chivalrous highwayman of England, in the seventeenth century, and over such a wide area, that we cannot but feel that it evidences an unbalanced and weak emotionalism that is characteristic of the sex. The latest exhibition of the kind referred to concerns that doctor in Illinois, a confessed bigamist and wife murderer, who has lately been the object of these maudlin attentions while in jail awaiting trial. No doubt men who are not murderers, that is, men generally, profit by the emotionalism which displays itself to our distress in the manner referred to; but we can better afford to be distressed by these exhibitions than to so change women as to make these exhibitions impossible. George Eliot, herself so full of sympathy, says in Middlemarch: "To have in general but little feeling seems to be the only security against feeling too much on any particular occasion." For my part, therefore, I prefer that women should have on some particular occasions too much feeling, for fear that in general they otherwise would have but little—too little, it may be, for the happiness of life, and consequently the well being of the race. If there is any place in the world where you would expect to find well balanced women, it is in the smaller Massachusetts towns, where they have had for some time, I believe, the right to vote at school elections, and possibly on some other questions; and yet, at an election of five school trustees in one of those towns not long since, it is said that twenty-four women voted for nineteen different persons. How whimsical these women must have been in their voting? I should judge that neither platform nor policy of any kind governed them; for each of these considerations implies something in the nature of a union, or common purpose, while the votes of these women seems to indicate that nothing was further from their intention than a common purpose. Third Objection. My third objection to giving women the ballot is that the legal discriminations against women in this country, generally, and especially in Missouri, are but few in number and unimportant in character; and the enfranchisement of women is unnecessary for their correction. The only discrimination against women that I recall in the laws of Missouri are a few which relate to the administration of estates, or to wills, and none of which are of much practical importance. If the women of this state or city, or any respectable number of them, would like these distinctions, slight and immaterial as they are, to be abolished—and I see no reason why they should not be— I am quite sure a number of members of our General Assembly will take pleasure in introducing a bill to that effect. One of our State Senators lives within a few hundred feet of the president of the St. Louis Woman's Equal Suffrage League, and I believe that he will be delighted to lend his aid in amending these sections so as to remove all cause of complaint against them by the suffragists. I have been told that the St. Louis Equal Suffrage League has not gotten out a pamphlet reciting the wrongs of women in Missouri because there were not enough wrongs to make a respectable catalogue. But nevertheless at the Suffrage meetings you hear much complaint about under-paid women, equal pay for equal work, minimum wage boards, and other panaceas for poverty that we are to secure through the votes of women. I attended a meeting of the kind I refer to—it was called a "Symposium"—with a young woman who was much impressed with the plea for "Equal pay for equal work." "All right," I said to her, "go and tell your cook that you will raise her wages from $20 to $40, because you know you could not get a man to do her work for less than $40 a month." "Oh!" she replied, "this gives the matter a personal interest that I had not realized before." The advocates of equal pay for equal work think of a boost of pay in this connection, and not of a reduction, and they are generally people who pay but little, if anything, in wages. But suppose a minimum wage board should effect this equality by averaging the pay of the men and women, and direct that $30 only should be paid a man cook, and no less to a woman cook. What could the man have to say to this, and what would a woman have to say if willing to work for $20 when told she would not be permitted to do so, though unable to obtain work at $30 a month? This minimum wage board proposition violates what is now regarded as a sacred constitutional right, namely, the right of private contract. Of course, you can regulate by law the wages of public servants, such as state, county or city officers, or employees, and school teachers; and in Missouri I believe there is equal pay for equal work in public employment. In the St. Louis public schools, at least, that rule prevails. The principal of an 18-room school gets the same pay, whether a man or a woman; and the same is true of the other positions. A salary is fixed for the position, and paid whether filled by a man or a woman. At this "Symposium" one of the speakers exclaimed: "I will not stand for the chivalry of the sweatshop. A pedestal is all right for a statue, but a poor place to put a person on." This was nothing more than clever oratorical clap-trap, and received its due applause from those in the audience who did not understand that the speaker, who is one of the best read publicists in the city, immediately repudiated the only meaning his declaration had, by adding: "I do not, however, advocate the elimination of sentiment between the sexes, for that would give us a foretaste of hell." The sweatshop and chivalry have nothing to do with each other. The sweatshop is the result of the laws of demand and supply, and competition which it is the present fashion to so much laud. If the St. Louis Manufacturer of Women's shirt waists should pay 35 cents for a waist that only cost his Chicago and New York competitors 25 cents, the St. Louis factory would soon close its doors; and the last condition of the women employed in the St. Louis factory would be worse than their first. Neither chivalry nor minimum wage boards can eliminate the sweatshop, until both have almost a world-wide sway; and the sooner the advocates of women suffrage realize this, and stop claiming what they can do for wages by their votes the better it will be for their cause. If the women by their votes can regulate wages, and do all the things they started out to claim, or some people claimed for them, they should not only be enfranchised, but the men should be disfranchised for monumental stupidity in not doing these things before, and stopping the bloody murders that are so often resorted to for the purpose of maintaining or increasing wages. The law of supply and demand and competition is, for practical purposes, almost as inexorable as the law of gravity on which the gallows depends for its efficacy, and which at the same time may dash to death an innocent baby from an open window. Fourth Objection. A few years since I was unexpectedly called on to make a few remarks to some two hundred women, teachers in our public schools. I began by quoting the lines: "God be thanked the meanest of his creatures Boasts two soul sides, one to face the world with, One to show a woman when he loves her." I added: "You observe that Browning calls man the meanest of God's creatures." Immediately one of my auditors, in a stage whisper that was heard all over the room, snapped out: "That's true; that's just what he is." Now I admit that a man without a soul side to show a woman when he loves her is a powerfully mean creature; and to preserve this soul side I would deny women the right to vote, for the soul side which a man shows a woman when he loves her makes him more Godlike than any other faculty he possesses; and the greater his resemblance to his maker the better for women. To give women votes will mar this soul side, and tend to destroy sentiment between the sexes; and you will remember that even the equal suffrage advocate who would not "stand for the chivalry of the sweatshop," declared that to eliminate sentiment between the sexes would give us a "foretaste of hell." I would save my countrymen and countrywomen from this foretaste in the hope, amongst other things, that thereby they may escape the full draught. Am I urging an ideal? I am and I should; for conditions are the outgrowth of ideals, and the higher the one the better the other. This is a materialistic age. The world and his wife are shop keepers, and the many inevitable tendencies of the times are against the higher ideals! and there is therefore so much the more need to guard those ideals in every possible way. I have always advocated enlarging woman's bread and butter sphere, for often a woman's needs may require her to engage in work not most suitable for women; and by engaging in such work she should not suffer in the esteem of any, for most women so employed can, and do, retain in great, if not always in perfect, degree those qualities which pleasantly distinguish them from men. Unfortunately, however, these occupations, for one reason or another, too often cause men to display to women the soul side with which the men face the world; and to inject women into politics will intensify this disposition and multiply the opportunities for its exhibition. A father and his sons are more apt to agree as to matters political than a father and his daughters; the occasions for differences as to politics are perennial, and the whole atmosphere during a political campaign is so full of charges and countercharges of all kinds of bad faith, selfishness, and wrong purposes, to say nothing of the wisdom or unwisdom of the policies at issue, that every one taking part in the campaign, or especially interested in it, is likely to be affected by its spirit; and many political battles will resolve themselves into contests between the sexes. The influences of a political contest will more intensely affect the women than the men of a community because of the greater emotionalism of women. We should not forget that women, even those of normal health and strength, are often subject to hysteria, a condition that men are seldom subject to, except when on the verge of madness. A man of wealth who had spent years in travel and visited all parts of Europe and other portions of the world once said to me that the women of our country should thank God daily that they are Americans. Undoubtedly the American women are the most fortunate women in the world; then why destroy, or endanger even, a condition for which daily thanks should be given? WHY WOMEN DO NOT WISH THE SUFFRAGE. By Rev. Lyman Abbott, D. D. Extract from article in Atlantic Monthly for October, 1903. Historically, the family is the first organization; biologically it is the origin of all other organizations. Abraham arms and organizes his servants, pursues the robber bands, conquers and disperses them, and recovers the captive: the family is the first army. Moreover, it is out of the family that society grows. As the cell duplicates itself, and by reduplication the living organism grows, so the family duplicates itself, and by the reduplication of the family the social organism grows. The children of the family come to manhood, and marry the children of other families. Blood unites them; the necessities of warfare, offensive and defensive, unite them; and so the tribe comes into existence. For the united action of this tribe some rule, some authority is necessary; thus tribal, state, national government comes into existence. These families find it for their mutual advantage to engage in separate industries, and exchange the product of their labor: thus barter and trade and the whole industrial organization come into existence. These families thus united by marriage into one tribe, cemented by war in one army, bound together by the necessity of united action in one government, cooperating in one varied industry, find in themselves a common faith and common aspirations, in a word, a common religion, and so the church comes into existence. Such, very briefly stated, is the development of society as we read it in the complicated history of the past. The first and most patent fact in the family is the difference in the sexes. Out of this difference the family is created; in this difference the family finds its sweet and sacred bond. This difference is not merely physical and incidental. It is also psychical and essential. It inheres in the temperament; it is inbred in the very fibre of the soul; it differentiates the functions; it determines the relation between man and woman; it fixes their mutual service and their mutual obligations. Man is not woman in a different case. Woman is not man inhabiting temporarily a different kind of body. Man is not a roughand-tumble woman. Woman is not a feeble and pliable man. This difference in the sexes is the first and fundamental fact in the family; it is therefore the first and fundamental fact in society, which is but a large family, growing out of and produced by the duplication and interrelationship of innumerable families. For it must ever be remembered that as the nature of the cell determines the nature of the organism which grows out of the cell, so the nature of the family determines the nature of society which grows out of the family. And the fundamental fact, without which there could be no family, is the temperamental, inherent, and therefore functional difference between the sexes. Speaking broadly, it may be said that the work of battle in all its forms, and all the work that is cognate thereto, belongs to man. Physically and psychically his is the sterner and the stronger sex. His muscles are more steel-like; his heart and his flesh are alike harder; he can give knocks without compunction and receive them without shrinking. In the family, therefore, his it is to go forth and fight the battle with Nature; to compel the reluctant ground to give her riches to his use. It is not for woman to hold the plough, or handle the hoe, or dig in the mine, or fell the forest. The war with Nature is not for her to wage. It is true that savage tribes impose this unfeminine task upon her; true that modern nations which have not yet fully emerged from barbarism continue to do so; true, also, that in the cruel industrial competition of modern times there is, in some communities, a relapse into this barbarism. But whether it is the Indian squaw digging in the corn patch, or the German Frau holding the plough, or the American wife working the loom in her husband's place,—wherever man puts the toil that is battle and the battle that is toil upon the woman, the law of Nature, that is, the law of God, written in her constitution and in the constitution of the family, is set at naught. This is not to say that her toil is less than man's but it is different. It may be easier to be the man with the hoe than the woman with the needle; it may be easier to handle the plough than to broil over the cook stove; but these tasks are not the same. The careless toil of the field requires exhaustless energy; the continuous toil of the household requires exhaustless patience. Being a man, the exhaustless patience seems to me at once more difficult and more admirable than the exhaustless energy. But they are not the same. For like reason it is not woman's function to fight against human foes who threaten the home. She is not called to be a soldier. She is not to be welcomed with the volunteers nor coerced into the military service by the draft. It is in vain to recite the story of Joan of Arc; it is in vain to narrate the efforts of the Amazons. The instinct of humanity revolts against the employment of woman as a soldier on the battlefield. No civilized man would wish to lay this duty upon her; no civilized woman would wish to assume it. This is not to say that her courage is not as great as his. Greater is it in some sense,—but it is different. For the Spartan mother to arm her son and send him forth with the injunction to come home bringing his shield or body borne upon it, and then wait during the long and weary days to know which way he is to come,—this requires, surely, a heroism not less than his: but it is not the same heroism; higher in some sense it is—but it is not the same. In his courage are pride and combativeness and animal passion, sometimes wellnigh devilish passion; a strange joy in giving and receiving wounds, a music that grows inspiring in the singing of the bullets, an almost brutal indifference to the wounded and the dying all about him, which she could never get and remain woman. True to her woman's nature is Lady Macbeth's prayer,— "Come, you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here." For until she had been unsexed, until she had ceased to be woman, she could not play the part which her destiny and her ambition assigned to her. For like reason society exempts woman from police functions. She is not called to be sheriff or constable or night watchman. She bears no truncheon and wears no revolver. She answers not to the summons when peace officers call for the posse comitatus. She is not received into the National Guard when bloody riot fills the city with peril and alarms. Why not? Is she not the equal of man? Is she not as loyal? as law abiding? as patriotic? as brave? Surely. All of these is she. But it is not her function to protect the state when foreign foes attack it; it is the function of the state to protect her. It is not her function to protect the persons and property of the community against riot; it is man's function to protect her. Here at least the functional difference between the sexes is too plain to be denied, doubted, or ignored. Here at least no man or woman from the claim of equality of character jumps to the illogical conclusion that there is an identity of function. This much then seems clear to me, and I hope it is clear to the reader also:— First, that the family is the basis of society, from which it grows. Second, that the basis of the family, and therefore of society, is the difference between the sexes,—a difference which is inherent, temperamental, functional. Third, that the military function, in all its forms and phases, belongs to man; that he has no right to thrust it upon woman or to ask her to share it with him; that it is his duty, and his exclusively, to do that battling with the elements which wrests livelihood from a reluctant or resisting Nature, and which is therefore the pre-requisite to all productive industry; and that battling with the enemies of society which compels them to respect its rights, and which is therefore the primary conditions of government. For the object of government is the protection of person, property, and reputation from the foes which assail them. Government may do other things: it may carry the mails, run the express, own and operate the railroads; but its fundamental function is to furnish protection from open violence or secret fraud. If it adequately protects person, property, and reputation, it is a just government, though it do nothing else; if it fails to protect these primary rights, if the person is left to defend himself, his property, his reputation by his own strong arm, there is no government. The question, "Shall woman vote?" is really, in the last analysis, the question, "Ought woman to assume the responsibility for protecting person and property which has in the past been assumed by man as his duty alone?" It is because women see, what some so-called reformers have not seen, that the first and fundamental function of government is the protection of person and property, and because women do not think that they ought to assume this duty any more than they ought to assume that police and militia service which is involved in every act of legislature, that they do not wish to have the ballot thrust upon them. Let us not here make any mistake. Nothing is law which has not authority behind it; and there is no real authority where there is not power to compel obedience. It is this power to compel which distinguishes law from advice. Behind every law stands the sheriff, and behind the sheriff the militia, and behind the militia the whole military power of the Federal government. No legislature ever ought to enact a statute unless it is ready to pledge all the power of government—local, state, and Federal—to its enforcement, if the statute is disregarded. A ballot is not a mere expression of opinion; it is an act of the will; and behind this act of the will must be power to compel obedience. Women do not wish authority to compel the obedience of their husbands, sons, and brothers to their will. And yet this is just what suffrage always may and sometimes must involve. The question, Shall woman vote, if translated into actual and practical form, reads thus: Shall woman decide what are the rights of the citizen to be protected and what are the duties of the citizen to be enforced, and then are her son and her brother and her husband to go forth, armed, if need be, to enforce her decision? Are women to decree, and men to execute? Is woman never to act as a private, but only as a commander-in-chief? Is this right? Is it right that one sex shall alone enforce authority, but the other sex determine when and how it shall be exercised? Is this expedient? Will it promote peace, order, prosperity? Is it practicable? Will it in fact be done? Suppose that in New York City the women should vote for prohibition and the men should vote against it; is it to be expected that the men would arm themselves to enforce against their fellow men a law which they themselves condemned as neither wise nor just? To ask these questions is to answer them. The functions of government cannot be thus divided. In a democratic community the duty of enforcing the law must devolve on those who determine what the law shall be that is to be enforced. It cannot be decreed by one class and enforced by another. It is inconceivable that it should be decreed by one sex and enforced by the other. EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. J. THOMAS HEFLIN, In the House of Representatives. Extract. Mr. Heflin. Mr. Speaker, upon the request of Mrs. George B. Puller, of Washington, I wish to print in the Record the following article on woman suffrage, by Miss Mary B. Smith: Woman Suffrage. (By Miss Mary B. Smith.) I desire to present some facts as to the pernicious effects of woman suffrage in States where it now exists. There have been many theories upon this subject presented by the suffragists. It is my purpose to present facts and figures showing that woman suffrage, where it has been tried, not only does not better conditions but tends to have actually the reverse effect from a practical standpoint. Senator Thomas, of Colorado, has said that he concedes that woman suffrage has not, and maintains that it will not, change conditions. I agree with the distinguished Senator up to a certain point, but I believe that I can show positively that woman suffrage will, in many instances, change conditions for the worse. The Los Angeles Times of June 5, 1913, gives the total vote as 84,055; nearly 100,000 under registration. The Times further says that, in spite of the excellent organization of Mrs. John S. Myers and her corps of assistants, the women did not turn out in any large numbers, and of those who did a considerable percentage appeared to favor the election of Rose. As there were 222,877 men and women over 21 years of age in Los Angeles (census of 1910), only 38.2 per cent of the men and women of voting age voted. The Los Angeles Express, June 4, 1913, had an editorial on the disgrace of electing Rose. At an election in Chicago, April 7, 1914, with the strenuous efforts of the suffragists to get out the female vote, only 158,686 women voted. Chicago had in 1910, 626,629 women over 21 years of age (letter from Director of Census February 28, 1914). About 25 per cent of the women of Chicago over 21 years of age voted. More than double that number of men did vote at the same election. Complaint has been made that it is not just to tax women when they have no vote. Only one-tenth of the taxes are paid by women, so if women had the ballot the women who pay taxes would not be as fairly and justly treated as they now are, for then nine-tenths of the women who vote the tax would pay no taxes, while now nine-tenths of the taxes paid are paid by the men who vote the taxation. No injustice is possible when the taxes are laid by the voters who pay nine-tenths of the amount. So many of our people are being misled on the liquor question subject. In no State in which women have voted on the question has State-wide prohibition even been adopted. Nine States where men alone vote have State-wide prohibition. November 5, 1912, Colorado voted on State-wide prohibition; 75,877 votes were cast for the measure and 116,774 against. (See p. 159, Abstract of Votes, compiled from official returns by James B. Pearce, secretary of state, Denver, Colo.) If 58 per cent of the women over 21 years of age in Colorado had voted for prohibition, the measure would have become a law by 6,012 majority without a single male vote being cast for prohibition, there being 213,425 women over 21 years of age in Colorado. (P. 118, Abstract of Census, 1910.) Wyoming legalized gambling for about 40 years after women had the ballot, and had neither State-wide prohibition nor local-option laws. About six years prior to the adoption of woman suffrage in California Los Angeles voted on local option, and the measure was defeated nearly 2 to 1. About a month after women had the ballot in Los Angeles the question was again voted on and the saloons won by nearly 3 to 1. At an election in California April 13, 1914, out of 13 cities and towns voting on the liquor question, 9 voted "wet" and 4 small towns "dry." Hanford, population 4,829, and Merced, population 3,102, both of which had been dry, returned to the wet column. See Los Angeles Times, April 14, 1914. Only 1 small county—Lake County— in California is dry, and 10 counties out of 62 in Colorado are dry. In Colorado Springs, Colo., where the sale of liquor was prohibited for many years, women voted on the question about two years ago, and liquor selling was legalized. Colorado Springs had 819 more women than men over 21 years of age in 1910. (Letter of Director of Census, Feb. 28, 1914.) On pages 202 and 203, Annual Report of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, you will find that in the 6 States that had woman suffrage January 1, 1912—California, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, and Washington—there were 26,295 liquor dealers paying license to the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1913. From page 24, Abstract of United States Census, 1910, you will find the 6 suffrage States above mentioned had a population of 5,163,473, 1 liquor dealer for every 196 people of the 6 States. For the remaining 42 States and District of Columbia there were 226,247 liquor dealers paying license for the same period. The 42 States and District of Columbia had a population of 86,808,793, or 1 liquor dealer for every 383 people, or about one-half the number of dealers per capita than the woman suffrage States require, and then we are told by the suffragists that they are not favorable to the liquor interests. Kansas, Oregon, and Arizona only adopted woman suffrage November 5, 1912. Kansas has been a prohibition State for more than 25 years. At local-option elections in Illinois April 7, 1914, about eleven hundred saloons out of 3,000, where elections were held, were abolished, 12 dry counties were added to the 30 already dry, making 42 dry counties out of the 100 counties in Illinois. Kentucky, where men alone vote, has 99 dry counties out of 120 in the State, and Missouri has 65 no-license counties out of 114 in that State. Iowa has 77 dry counties out of 99 counties in the State; and in Minnesota, at election April 7, 1914, two-thirds of the counties where local-option elections were held voted dry; and towns that had licensed saloons for 60 years voted dry by men's votes. Eight out of twelve counties in Michigan that voted on the liquor question April 6, 1914, voted dry, including Lansing, the capital of the State, by men's votes; while Springfield, the capital of Illinois, where there are 205 more women than men over 21 years of age, voted to retain the saloons. California, where women have voted for more than two and one-half years, legalizes prize fighting and is one of the few States that has no pure-milk law. The suffragists tell us on all occasions that if women had the ballot much better laws for the education and welfare of the child and youth of our country will be enacted. Let me cite a few instances to disprove such a theory: At Berkeley, Cal., April 12, 1913, for the issuance of bonds for playgrounds, only about 1,500 of the 8,000 women of the city voted. The mayor, who has been a zealous worker for woman suffrage reprimands the women for their negligence of this particular issue, which of all others should interest them. In a newspaper article he asks "Where were the mothers?" Berkeley has 1,301 more women than men over 21 years of age. (Letter, Feb. 28, 1914, Director of United States Census.) At Pasadena, Cal., where there are 2,688 more women than men of voting age, the playgrounds that were the pride of Pasadena, and were established before women had the ballot, were discontinued last July on account of the failure of voters to vote money for the purchase of the grounds. (See Los Angeles Times. July 27, 1913.) No other playgrounds have been purchased or been provided for the children. At an election November 12, 1913, Pasadena, Cal., failed to vote bonds to repair leaky roofs and make sanitary repairs on schoolhouses, to complete new schoolhouses under construction, and to make it possible to provide schools for the entire school year. The superintendent of schools said the school year would have to be cut a month or two, and some schools will have to close when rains begin. (See Los Angeles Times. Nov. 13, 1913.) It happened to rain November 12 in Pasadena, and some thought the bonds might have carried had the vote been taken on a fair day when the ladies could more conveniently get to the polls; so it was decided to have another election to vote for bonds in a less amount than was voted on November 12. So on January 16, 1914—a fair day—another election was held and the bonds again defeated. So the voters of Pasadena have decided at two elections that the repair of leaky roofs and sanitary improvements, and so forth, of schoolhouses, as well playgrounds for the children, are to be indefinitely postponed. A letter dated January 12, 1914. from the Director of the United States Census, states there were, in 1910, 9,262 males and 11,950 females over 21 years of age. The total vote for and against the bonds was 4,832. Only 22.7 per cent of the voters of Pasadena—population, 30,291—was interested enough to go to the polls at election of January 16. We are told that the men of the country can not be trusted to make laws for the women and children; yet an average of four-fifths of the earnings of the men, over and above the necessities of the family, is spent on the women and children. The suffragists continually tell us that if women had the ballot wars and internal strife would be a thing of the past, yet Colorado, which has had woman suffrage for a generation, is in the throes of civil war and has been for many months. The State has become so weakened in its fabric that it can not keep order and protect life and property within its borders, but has been compelled through the State authorities to call upon the President of the United States to send Government troops to administer affairs and bring order out of chaos. This is another proof of the failure of woman suffrage in the model suffrage State of Colorado, and refutes beyond any possibility of controversy the suffragists' claims. If women could ever vote as generally as men, there would be little or no change in our laws, for even if a wife once in a while voted in opposition to her husband and canceled his vote—in which event the family would have no voice in the laws at all—the final result of the whole vote would rarely be changed, and we would have the absurd spectacle of having two people doing what one alone could accomplish as well and save all the effort expended in the study of politics by women and the enormous expense of doubling the election cost. EXTRACT FROM ADDRESS OF THE RT. REV. WM. CROSWELL DOANE, D. D. There must be individuality; the distinct character which differentiates man from man, or machine from machine. For each is "after its kind." And there is no waste of power so great, as when one loses sight of this and sets the day laborer to adjust the niceties of the chronometer, or puts the poet behind the plough. This is the critical question of all. The power of a "Reaper" to tie up sheaves with their own straw, with a delicacy of machinery alive almost to its finger ends, would not be proven, if it were set to break stones on the road. Nor would the capacity of the trip hammer be tested, if it were used to drive the needle of the sewing machine. What is it for; "What wilt thou have me do?" Purpose as the test of power; object, intention, place and kind of work; this is what I mean by individuality. "What she could;" "what she had;" "what I can." I am sure that there never was a more important time in all the world, to emphasize, and drive home into the minds and consciences of women, this most important lesson. We are living in a period of reaction, and reaction always means a tendency to violent extremes. The slowly working leaven of Christianity for eighteen hundred years, has been lifting women up from the low level into which they fell in Eve, to the higher lines of life and service to which they rose in Mary. One by one, openings and opportunities for congenial and convenient service have been opened up to her. One by one, the bars of the cage have been let down, and the barriers of foolish custom have been taken away, which hindered and held her back from openings and opportunities of usefulness. And one by one, the false restraints and unwise discriminations have been done away; until today, by the common consent, by the Christianized instinct, by the chivalrous endeavor, of men, womanhood—and nowhere more than in America—stands fairly out upon that position of correlation and coequality with men, which really was the purpose of Almighty God in the double creation; which in no sense contradicts the divine intention of the primacy of the first created, and the subordination of the second; but which utterly destroys, and does away with, the false theory of superiority and sovereignty on the one side, as meaning inferiority and subjection on the other. And now the world is full of agitations, which would destroy, if they could be carried out, that exquisite balance which the revealed purpose of God, and the implanted and inherent differences between men and women, indicate as the wise and true relation between the two. Coequality, side-by-sideness, divided sovereignty, the mutual superiority and subordination of influence and control, the interdependence of the "man who is by the woman" and "the woman who is of the man;" these are not only truths and theories, but facts and realities; which can not be forgotten or disregarded without serious injury and loss. Nobody who reads the record of the Revelation rightly, or studies history or examines the experience of his own life, can fail to feel that whatever distinctions and differences there may be between the kind of mind, of capacity, of character between the two sexes, there are no differences whatever in the degree. But it is the falsest kind of logic which argues, that, because the two sexes are equal in the sight of God, therefore, they are interchangeable. All that the man can do, the woman can not do. And, therefore, the talk today of "woman's rights," apart from the falseness of the application of the word—for the rights of either man or woman are fewer and far less important than their duties—has this inherent fallacy; that it presupposes that because their rights are equal, therefore they are the same. Surely, if one takes the other and the better word, it is plain to the blindest, that the duties of men and women are not the same; that the trend of their tastes and capabilities is different; and that if the women are to do the men's duties, their own duties must be left undone, or done by those who are unfitted for and incapable of their discharge. Nothing is wilder or stranger, than the misconception and disproportionateness of all this theory. It is contradicted by the whole material world in which we live; and in which, its own functions are given and its own duties assigned to every separate plant and tree and animal. Nor could a wilder confusion be produced than if, by some blind force, these unthinking and unreasoning things should set themselves to tasks, which have not been assigned them; and for which they are not intended by their creation. And why, the highest order of created things, to whom Almighty God has given not only the consciousness of their peculiar different capacities, but the plain and evident ability of recognizing the fact and reasoning just why these lines of differences are drawn, should prove itself duller and more stupid than the inanimate creation, is difficult to see. Earnestly I beg that this lesson of the personal pronoun "I"—which never in any language changes sex because of the equal individuality of both sexes must be acknowledged as the fundamental principle of character—may plant itself deeply in your conscience. You may turn into the feminine gender that great sentence, "I can do all that may become a woman; who dares do more is none." You can realize all this by the divinely implanted instincts of your nature, by the limitations or the enlargements of your capacity, by the opportunities and occasions of your providential place in life. And that will be the clue, which you may safely follow, as indicating the lines along which every faculty of your nature is to be set, with utmost intensity and directness of aim, to do "your duty in the state of life into which it shall please God to call you." I am urging the recognition of such limitations as God has set, first in your sex, which are written in laws so plain and facts so irresistible that only the blindest can fail to read and see them. The utter misconception of equality of position, as though it meant sameness of duty, between men and women, is among the facile follies some instances by high motives, women who used to be quiet and content to stand in their lot, are joining in the wretched unrest of the effort, which, until recently, was in the hands of wild and unwomanly fanatics, to unsex themselves and unsettle the peace of the household, and prosperity of the world. I have a general dislike and distrust of the term woman in the abstract. And in the manner of its use it is most confusing. There are women and women, as there are men and men. And the fond imagination that the evils of unqualified suffrage given to men, which are the most dangerous element in our American political world today, can be cured by extending the evil to unqualified women, is the strangest delusion that ever possessed the human mind. If it should be permitted, which God forefend, the abstract woman may rejoice, but it will be in the spirit of the maniac, who has laid waste the homes and marred the happiness and murdered the hopes of women. Privilege, courtesy, chivalry, respect, deference, consideration, will have melted away. And there will come instead unseemly contests, selfishness, the bitterness of partisanship, the dregs of stride and corruption, incrimination and the demoralization of the deepest and highest and dearest relations of society, while in its political effect it will only multiply corrupt and irresponsible ballots, not to equal, but to outweigh the intelligent suffrage of reputable women. Nothing will be altered in results. Nothing will be gained in the issues. And the irreclaimable mischief will have left its blight and scar on our social life. Two-handed humanity (that is the figure of the man and the woman in the body politic) has a right hand and a left hand, each equal to the other, each needful to the other. But the hand that is nearest the heart, the woman, is not used, and is not meant to be used, to grasp the sword, the pen, the reins; not to seize the rough difficulties and wring out of them the stern successes, of the strife. They are both hands. They are equally hands. Each is imperfect without the other, but their functions are apart and different. Learn the divine, the human, the instinctive, the evident limitations of your sex. And when you have filled out with "all you can" the sphere of your allotted service, you will have not time, nor strength, nor desire to reach out for other work to do. EXTRACT FROM ADDRESS OF MRS. W. WINSLOW CRANNELL. What Are the Reasons Given For Asking You to Help the Cause of Woman Suffrage? First: That women who pay taxes should have a ballot. In answer we assert that the women who pay taxes do not want the ballot. That taxes are not conditioned upon the right to vote. That there is no discrimination against women in taxation. That taxation is the price the citizens pay for the protection of their property, their life, their liberty. That many men are taxed who have no vote,—the wealthy minor, and the man who living in one town owns property in another. That the woman who pays taxes will receive no benefit from the ballot which will not be an hundred times counteracted by the ballot of the women who do not pay taxes. That what is needed for the benefit of the tax-paying women is not an increased but a restricted ballot. That while there are in New York State 144,000 women who pay taxes, there are at least 1,500,000 women who do not pay taxes; and the granting of suffrage to these women would more than duplicate the evils from which the tax-payer now suffers. Second: That when women have the ballot they will be employed constantly and at higher wages. The answer is shown in the fact that men vote and are yet unemployed. That no employer is going to pay an increased wage because the employee has the franchise. That while there are, as in the factories everywhere, long lists of girls waiting to be employed at nominal figures, no employer is going to raise the pay of his employees because they ask an hour off to vote on election day. Third: That the cause of temperance will be helped when women vote. I admire the women who are working for temperance, and wish them God speed, but feel perfectly sure that they are mistaken if they expect to be helped by the granting of suffrage to all women North, South, East and West. Statistics tell us that while the population of the United States has increased but 20 per cent in the last two decades, the dram drinking and drug taking women have increased 500 per cent. The Christian Advocate is my authority for the statement that before the high license law in Philadelphia, Penn., out of 8,034 saloon licenses 3,696 were granted to women. In Boston, Mass., last Spring, out of 1,100 liquor licenses 491 were applied for by women. The same condition of things prevails nearly all over our country. Would these women work for prohibition? Let us look carefully at what is asked for: "Equal pay for equal work." That sounds equitable and consequently reasonable. But if the question of wages were to become a matter of legislation, would you be willing to say to the already overburdened and unemployed workman that you believe that his wages should be cut down to those received by women? For it is a fact beyond dispute that the wages paid is always a question of demand and supply; and women have entered nearly every field of labor once a man's sole province; and, by being willing and able to work for lower wages than men, who have families to support, have crowded them out. Now if equal wages for equal work means anything at all, it means that no man shall be paid more for his work than the women are begging to receive. For instance, if that law could be passed and enforced, the merchant could say to his male employee that he could fill his shop with girls at half the price he was paying him, and while he preferred keeping the man at the higher rate, he must either discharge him or lower his wages to that which women were asking to receive. But the whole thing is a farce. You do not ask, in fact, I doubt if any of you care, how much the workman is paid who makes your clothes. I know that women do not; otherwise they would not haggle over prices, and gloat over bargains. This is hard common sense. It isn't poetic nor imaginative. It is more, it is truth, and you are here to deal with truths and not with fallacies. The facts for the suffragists to prove are that suffrage is necessary for the protection of women, and that it would be beneficial to the State. They have not and cannot prove either. Today in New York State, and in many of the other States, a woman is protected better by the laws that men have made, than by any she could make herself. A husband cannot sell his real estate unless the wife joins in the deed. He cannot deprive her by will of right of dower. The wife can by deed or will dispose of her entire estate, real or personal, whether the husband consents or not. A father cannot now apprentice his child or make a valid appointment of a testamentary guardian without the consent of the mother, if she be living. The wife can carry on business on her own account, and is entitled to all the profits and earnings in that business, and may contract as if she were unmarried. Every profession is open to women, and every occupation also. Then what do they want, what will they gain by having the ballot? If men are not capable of managing the affairs of the State and the Nation according to the highest and best ideas of the race, that is of both men and women, will you permit me to respectfully inquire what proper and adequate share of this world's work you can perform? What is your natural place in the order of society? Are you mere hewers of wood and drawers of water? You cannot bear citizens; you cannot care for them in infancy and rear them to manhood. If you cannot govern them with wisdom and justice when they are given into your hands, what is your reason for being? It strikes me that these women who want to retain all the privileges of their sex, and secure besides all those that they think a man has; who want to be men and yet remain women; have much hardihood in coming to you and saying: "You do not know how to make laws; how to govern the people; you are corrupt and misrule the nation. Give us the suffrage that we may supplant you." And they say this not for themselves alone, but for all the women in this great nation, North, South, East and West, without regard to education or morality! They are to purify politics! MUNICIPAL SUFFRAGE FOR WOMEN—WHY? Frank Foxcroft. I put the question in this form, because it is clear that, when so revolutionary a change is proposed as that of doubling the electorate in municipal affairs by giving the ballot to women, the burden of proof rests with those who advocate the change. They must be prepared to show that great advantages would accrue, either to women or to the cummunity at large, from the change proposed. I am inclined to think that either would be sufficient. If they can show that women derive great benefit from the use of the municipal ballot, the community would be willing to take some risk to bring about that result. If they can show that the community at large would gain greatly, the great mass of women, who now shrink from the responsibilities of the suffrage, would overcome their reluctance. But I submit that one or the other of these propositions must be clearly proved, before any legislature can be justified in enacting a law giving municipal suffrage to women. Touching the first proposition, what evidence is forthcoming? There is declamation in plenty; vague generalizations about the rights of women; a tedious reiteration of the misapplied principle that "taxation without representation is tyranny;" even, now and then, a faint echo of the generally abandoned claim that the suffrage is a natural right. But when it is asked precisely what are some of the wrongs under which women suffer in town and city government as at present conducted, at precisely what points the by-laws or the ordinances of cities bear unjustly upon women as women, and in precisely what ways women are to gain from being permitted to vote at town and city elections, there is silence all along the line. No one yet, to my knowledge, has ever formulated a definite, concrete, reasonable statement of this kind. Until such a statement is made, and adequately supported by argument, the question why municipal suffrage should be extended to women—so far as the interests of women themselves are concerned—remains unanswered. But how about the interests of the community? In what particulars would cities and towns be benefited by the bestowal of the ballot on women? The question cannot be answered by contrasting the best and most intelligent women with the worst or least intelligent men. The ballot, if it is given to women, will be used by all sorts of women, just as it is now by all sorts of men; and if, as must be confessed with shame it is usually more difficult to bring out and concentrate the votes of the best sort of men than those of the baser sort, somewhat the same difficulty may be anticipated with regard to women. The practical question is: Will the average woman vote more steadily, more intelligently, with a clearer knowledge of men and affairs, and with a wiser adaptation of means to ends than the average man? It will not serve to say that she will vote almost as steadily, intelligently, and wisely as the average man; or that, in course of time, after she has freed herself from the handicap of inexperience, and has so readjusted her other duties as to give herself ample time for this, she will vote as steadily, intelligently, and wisely. If the community is to gain from her use of the ballot, the average women must vote more steadily, intelligently, and wisely than the average man. Otherwise, at the best, the general average will be only what it was before. Here again what is needed is a definite and a concrete statement. In precisely what particulars—with reference to precisely what problems of municipal government—are women likely to act more wisely than men? Here, for example, is a list of the standing committees of the Boston Board of Aldermen: Armories and military affairs, county accounts, electric wires. Faneuil Hall and county buildings, lamps, licenses, markets, railroads. Public improvements, with subcommittees upon paving, sewers, bridges, ferries, sanitary regulations, street cleaning, and street watering. The list might be extended to include the special committee and joint standing committees, but, as given, it fairly represents the practical matters which engage the attention of city governments. Will any advocate of municipal suffrage for women run his finger down the list and place it on those items regarding which the votes of women aldermen would be likely to be more intelligently and wisely given than those of men! If this cannot be done, then the question as to the second proposition goes unanswered, just as the question relating to the first proposition did. References. In view of the fact that a debater should get as much material as possible on the subject, it is suggested that additional literature be obtained from the National American Woman's Suffrage Association, 505 Fifth Avenue, New York, and from the Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage, 29 W. 39th St., New York. Possibly some of the references below may be gotten from the Virginia State Library at Richmond or Library of Congress at Washington. The H. W. Wilson Co., White Plains, N.
