      <field name="fulltext">Foreword It is rare when time and circumstances cooperate in the production of significant work and rarer still when these occur with a capable spokesman to give expression to this cooperation. Such a happy event is witnessed in these pages. This book celebrates the sesquicentennial of the founding of the University of Virginia. Those who treasure this place as their alma mater and those who treasure it as the supreme example of collegiate buildings in this country can only applaud the bringing together for the first time of a pictorial record consisting of nineteenth-century prints, compiled with wit, wisdom, and imagination. Fortunate is the coincidence of time, circumstance, and personality. Many will find familiar scenes in the pages which follow. Many will see Mr. Jefferson's "Academical Village" for the first time or from new viewpoints. Certainly all will be the beneficiaries of a much more comprehensive view of the University. The diversity of impression these buildings have had on those who have seen them is good to record. It is especially fitting that this record is put into form now as the University looks ahead to the next one hundred and fifty years. For recording the past with candor can provide a basis for new accomplishment. I see this collection not so much as a historic document and a catalogue, but as a point of departure for the new environment the University seeks to help create. Formidable tasks face us all in creating an environment for society today and the lessons to be learned from Mr. Jefferson's creation at the University—both tangible and intangible—are worthy of study. This volume is important because it defines some of these tangible qualities. J. Norwood Bosserman Dean, School of Architecture University of Virginia</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Introduction No more appropriate tribute to Mr. Jefferson could be paid on the occasion of the sesquicentennial of the Charter of the University of Virginia than to issue a bibliography about him as an architect. Certainly the United States had never before had an architect who had so great a respect for the authority of books, and it is doubtful if there have been many since who were so scholarly. His reliance on books is seen especially well in a letter from Colonel Isaac Coles of Enniscorthy to General John H. Cocke of Bremo. Colonel Coles was reporting a conversation with Jefferson concerning a request from General Cocke: With Mr. Jefferson I conversed at length on the subject of architecture. Palladio, he said, "was the Bible." You should get it and stick to it. He had sent all his Books &amp;c. to Washington, or he would have drawn yr. House for you—it would have been a pleasure to him—but now he could not undertake to do it before the fall, when he expected other Books from Paris.1 1 Feb. 23, 1816, in Fiske Kimball, "The Building of Bremo," Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, LVII (Jan., 1949), 3-13. This respect for books is also reflected in the architectural scholarship which has produced those publications comprising the present bibliography. Statistics are not very interesting in large doses, but they are sometimes useful as indicators of importance. There are articles in the citations here from 88 journals published in seven different countries; and the journals range from Indoors and Out to the Magazine of the Daughters of the American Revolution, from the Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society to the Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, from the Gazette des Beaux Arts to Apollo, and from the Saturday Evening Post to the Art Bulletin. They have been selected, together with the citations from books, not as part of a comprehensive bibliography (which, in any case, is almost impossible when Jefferson is the subject), but as a group to illustrate the widespread interest in Jefferson as an architect, the best sources for an insight into his practice of architecture, and the very broad associations which have been worked out between Jefferson and other figures by subsequent writers. In the annotations attached to this bibliography one finds his name coupled with an amazingly wide range of names—the brothers Adam, Bulfinch, Le Corbusier, Downing, L'Enfant, Goethe, Peter Harrison, Philip Johnson, Inigo Jones, Latrobe, Ledoux, McKim, Mills, Olmsted, Ramée, Richardson, Schinkel, Strickland, Stuart and Revett, Sullivan, Town, Upjohn, and Frank Lloyd Wright. In the same annotations he is called "father of our national architecture," "father of landscape gardening in America," "first great American architect," "first important American to have an intelligent interest in architecure," and a "genius-architect." It is also said that he wished to be at once "novel and correct," that he "was a keen observer of natural form and proportion," and that he "had the true architectural mind." It only remains to point out that he was spoken of quite seriously as an architect as early as 1786, and then by a cultivated European. Books and articles have yet another use in the study of Jefferson and the buildings he created. Through the printed word it is possible to have firsthand accounts of the man, his habits, his home, and his masterpiece, the University of Virginia. One of the few references to Jefferson drawing is contained in an account of his daily schedule during J. E. Caldwell's visit to Monticello in 1808: Mr. Jefferson is very regular and temperate in his mode of living; he retires to his chamber about nine o'clock and rises before the sun both in summer and winter. . . . Until breakfast (which is early) he is employed in writing, after he generally visits his work-shops, labourers, etc. and then, until 12 o'clock, he is engaged in his study, either in drawing, writing or reading; he then rides over his plantation, returns at two, dresses for dinner and joins his company; he retires from table soon after the cloth is removed, and spends the evening in walking about, reading the papers and in conversation with such guests as may be with him.2 2 Caldwell, A Tour through Part of Virginia in the Summer of 1808 (New York: The Author, 1809), pp. 26-27. While the University was being built, Jefferson was described as he appeared on the road on August 23, 1822, by a traveler who had missed him at Monticello: His costume was very singular—his coat was checked gingham, manufactured in Virginia I suppose. The buttons on it were of white metal and nearly the size of a dollar. His pantaloons were of the same fabric. He was mounted on an elegant bay horse going with speed—and he had no hat on but a lady's parasol, stuck in his coat behind, spread its canopy over his head, which was very white—his hair is quite thick—his complexion sandy—and his eye, the eye of an eagle.3 3 "A Description of Jefferson," Va. Mag. of His. and Biog., XXIV (June, 1916), 310. Although the author says Jefferson was in his eighty-fourth year that summer, he was, in actuality eighty on the date of the letter. Monticello, which has gone through many transformations, is described in its first version by the Marquis de Chastellux. Although the Marquis's last phrase is one of the most quoted about Jefferson and architecture, the earlier sentences of this passage cast considerable light on the late eighteenth-century romanticism with which the Marquis was judging Jefferson's achievement: It was a debt Nature owed to a philosopher and a man of taste, that in Jefferson's own possessions he should find a spot, where he might best study and enjoy her. He calls his house Monticello. . . . This house, of which Mr. Jefferson was the architect, and often one of the workmen, is rather elegant and in the Italian taste, though not without fault; it consists of one large square pavilion, the entrance of which is by two porticoes ornamented with pillars. The ground floor consists chiefly of a very large lofty saloon, which is to be decorated entirely in the antique style: above it is a library of the same form; two small wings, with only a ground floor and attic story, are joined to this pavilion, and communicate with the kitchen, offices, &amp;c. which will form a kind of basement story over which runs a terrace. My object in this short description is only to shew the difference between this and the other houses of the country; for we may safely aver, that Mr. Jefferson is the first American who has consulted the fine arts to know how he should shelter himself from the weather.4 4 François Jean, Marquis de Chastellux, Travels in North-America (London: G. G. J. and J. Robinson, 1787), II, 41-42. In 1809, after Monticello was put into essentially the condition in which we see it today, the dome room, unfurnished then as now, especially impressed a visitor: [Mr. Jefferson] afterwards took us to the drawing room, 26 or 7 feet diameter, in the dome. It is a noble and beautiful apartment, with 8 circular windows and a sky-light. It was not furnished and being in the attic story is not used, which I thought a great pity. . . . When we descended into the Hall he asked us to pass into the Library. . . . This suit of apartments opens from the Hall to the south. It consists of 3 rooms for the library, one for his cabinet, one for his chamber, and a green house divided from the others by glass compartments and doors; so that the view of the plants it contains is unobstructed. He has not yet made his collection, having just finished the room, which opens on one of the terraces.5 5 Margaret (Bayard) Smith, The First Forty Years of Washington Society (New York: Scribner, 1906), p. 71. Jefferson, in addition to his work in architecture, had another aspect, too, and that was his delight in the use of tools, a pleasure which he could and did enjoy even in the White House: When he took up his residence in the President's House, he found it scantily furnished. . . . In the centre of his cabinet was a long table with drawers on each side, in which were deposited not only articles appropriate to the place, but a set of carpenter's tools in one and small garden implements in another from the use of which he derived much amusement.6 6 Ibid., pp. 384-85. When it was time to lay out the University, Captain Edmund Bacon, then overseer at Monticello, remembered that the site was a poor old turned-out field, though it was finely situated. . . . Afterwards Mr. Jefferson bought a large tract near it. . . . It had a great deal of fine timber and rock on it, which was used in building the University. My next instruction was to get ten able bodied hands to commence the work [on the University]. I soon got them, and Mr. Jefferson started from Monticello to lay off the foundation, and see the work commenced. An Irishman named Dinsmore, and I, went along with him. As we passed through Charlottesville, I went to old Davy Isaac's store and got a ball of twine, and Dinsmore found some shingles and made some pegs, and we all went on to the old field together. Mr. Jefferson looked over the ground some time, and then stuck down a peg. He struck the very first peg in that building, and then directed me where to carry the line, and I stuck the second. He carried one end of the line, and I the other in laying off the foundation of the University. He had a little rule in his pocket that he always carried with him, and with this he measured off the ground, and laid off the entire foundation, and then set the men at work. . . . after the foundation was nearly completed, they had a great time laying the corner-stone. The old field was covered with carriages and people. . . . Mr. Monroe laid the corner stone. . . . He held the instruments and pronounced it square.7 7 The Rev. Hamilton W. Pierson, Jefferson at Monticello: The Private Life of Thomas Jefferson from Entirely New Materials (New York: Charles Scribner, 1862), pp. 21-22. By 1822 Jefferson was putting his love of tools into the service of the University by instructing his workmen. There is a charming picture of this sort of scene by Daniel P. Thompson, who was told by the superintendent of works: "That is Mr. Jefferson . . . whom you see yonder, taking the chisel from the hand of an Italian sculptor and showing him how to turn a volute of the capital on which he is engaged." "Why, does Mr. Jefferson go into sculpture in so practical a manner as that?" I asked in some surprise. "Yes," was the reply; "yes, often, when he detects faulty work. Indeed we consider him the best workman on the grounds."8 8 Green Mountain Boy at Monticello: A Talk with Jefferson in 1822, ed. Howard C. Rice, Jr. (Brattleboro, Vt.: Book Cellar, 1962), pp. 19-20. There are three early descriptions of the University, two of which are uncomplimentary and one which has more to do with living conditions than architecture. Today, when the original Jeffersonian group of buildings is an acknowledged masterpiece, it is well to remember that at one time the universality of these unique buildings was not yet established. The first of these quotations is an 1820 report on the University's scheme. It is, presumably, a criticism based on literary rather than firsthand knowledge, since the buildings were as yet far from complete. It appears to us that a provision of from two to four rooms is inadequate for a professor and family. One room must needs be a study, one a parlour, and one a kitchen; leaving but one lodging room for the professor and his family. Moreover, though the college discipline would certainly gain, and that in a high degree, by thus stationing the tents of the professors, at proper intervals, among the camp of the students, yet the comfort of a family would suffer in an equal degree; nor can a more unpleasant residence for its inmates be imagined, than a pavilion thus surrounded and exposed. This is a matter of more consequence than any circumstance which might tend to make it an ineligible family abode, and thus throw it into the hands of young literary adventures, who would regard it merely as a temporary resort, for a few preparatory years. With respect to the one-story dormitories for the students, we are unacquainted with those circumstances in the climate of Virginia, which may make such edifices comfortable. With us they would be likely to be cold in winter and hot in summer. . . . We are also decidedly of opinion that, except in peculiar cases, apartments for a single student, are far more favourable to "morals, order, and uninterrupted study," than the common plan of putting two tenants into one room.9 9 [Edward Everett], "Art. VII—Proceedings and Report of the Commissioners for the University of Virginia, Presented the 8th of December 1818," North American Review and Miscellaneous Journal, XXVI (Jan., 1822), 117-18. The second unfavorable report is contained in a letter written by John H. B. Latrobe during a visit to Charlottesville in August, 1832: Mr. Jefferson was certainly not a man of taste and [the University of Virginia], which was built under his direction proves it. He has adopted the Roman order, the system of Palladio, the style of the age of Louis XIV [sic], and has studiously kept out of view the very idea of Grecian proportion or form. His Doric is the worst Tuscan, his Ionic is from the worst models, his Corinthian is tolerable only, and the composite pillars of the library complete a mélange which has nothing to recommend it but its general effect, which is striking and singular. The whole has a shabby genteel look, and is already showing marks left by time on its frail materials. The columns are of stucco . . . the mortar is peeling off in many places, showing the red bricks underneath. The wood is yawning, with wide long splits. . . . Here is a wooden terrace, which is fast taking rank among the "has-beens."10 10 John E. Semmes, John H. B. Latrobe and His Times, 1803-1891 (Baltimore: Norman, Remington, 1917), p. 246. Latrobe's editor adds that in his own student days thirty-six years after Latrobe's visit the University still had "an air of neglect and incompleteness, like a half-finished building, abandoned for want of funds."11 11 Ibid., p. 246. Two years later Harriet Martineau spent a few days in Charlottesville, enough for her to gain a feeling for the University and for its academic society: The singular ranges of college buildings are visible from a considerable distance, as they advantageously crown an eminence, presenting an appearance of a piazza surrounding an oblong square, with the professors' houses rising at regular intervals. We found that the low buildings connecting these large dwellings were the dormitories of the students; ground-floor apartments, opening into the piazza, and designed to serve as places of study as well as sleep. The professors' houses are inconveniently small. . . . At one end of the quadrangle is the Rotunda, containing the lecture rooms, library, and other apartments; and outside the other end, a gothic chapel was about to be erected. Well-kept grass-plats and gravel walks fill up the quadrangle. . . . The students wear a uniform, which is very becoming . . . being merely a coat of particularly simple fashion, and dark color. The frankness of the whole society was particularly winning; and so was the cordiality among themselves; a degree of mutual good understanding which is seldom found in the small society of a college, village-like in its seclusion and leisure, with added temptations to jealousy and censoriousness.12 12 Retrospect of Western Travel (London: Saunders and Otley, 1838), II, 21-23, 32. The Jefferson complex still "advantageously crowns an eminence," though it is difficult to see it from a distance because the city and the University itself have clustered around it. The rural character of the original University is seen, however, in the prints which form the second part of this volume. The assemblage of this iconography could not have been accomplished without the pioneer work of the late Edwin M. Betts, whose collection and whose notes were so generously put at my disposal by his widow, Mary Hall Betts. They have never been published together before, but they are the ideal visual material for this book. William B. O'Neal Charlottesville, Virginia 1969</field>

Peter Maverick, N.A., 1780-1831, was the son of Peter Rushton Maverick, an etcher and engraver in New York who had originally been a silversmith. He trained his son and several other painters of the day, including William Dunlap, the portraitist and early art historian. Peter Maverick far excelled his father. His first work was published at the age of nine. He also did banknote engraving. In 1802 he established himself in New York City, where he worked until 1809. He then worked in Newark, N.J., but retained a New York office to which he returned in 1820. One of Peter Maverick's apprentices was Asher B. Durand, who was also his partner from 1817 to 1820. Maverick was quite prosperous from early in his career but "some misfortunes connected with a partnership business, left him late in life to commence anew."1 1 William Dunlap, History of the Rise and Progress of the Arts of Design in the United States (2 vols.; New York: George P. Scott, 1834), II, 217. John Neilson, d. 1827, was born in Ireland. A carpenter by trade, he worked both as a master carpenter and as a contractor on the buildings of the University of Virginia, where he prospered. He bought property in Charlottesville which was left to his family in Ireland at his death.2 2 The Rev. Edgar Woods, Albemarle County in Virginia (Charlottesville, Va.: Michie, 1901), pp. 144, 288. There are, in the Virginia State Library, two drawings of the ground plan of the University of Virginia. One of these was, presumably, sent to New York for Maverick to engrave, or they were studies for the drawing which was sent. They have, in the past, been provisionally attributed to Jefferson,3 3 Frederick D. Nichols, Thomas Jefferson's Architectural Drawings (Boston and Charlottesville, Va.: Massachusetts Historical Society, Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, and University of Virginia Press, 1961), pp. 40, 41. but it is possible, since their technique does not resemble that of the undoubted Jefferson drawings for the University, that they were drawn by Neilson, who was acknowledged as the draftsman on the Maverick revised plate of 1825.

Engraving Unsigned Labeled: Universitaet von Virginia Coll.: University of Virginia At the top of the plate on either side of the Rotunda, and at the bottom above the title a description of the University is given as follows: Top left: I-X Wohnungen der Professoren, je mit einem Hörsale, Hof und Garten 1-55 Schlafgemächer jedes für zwey Studirende, Ausgänge in einem Colonnade, das Dach platt, zur Promenade und Communication zwichen den Wohnungen der Professoren.

The plate, a reduced version of the Maverick plan, appeared in a book whose title page read: Reise Sr. Hoheit des Herzogs Bernhard zu Sachsen-Weimar-Eisinach durch Nord-Amerika in den Jahren 1825 und 1826. Herausgegeben von Heinrich Luden. Erster Theil. Mit 16 Vignetten, 4 Kupfern, 3 planen. (opp. p. 296) Betts also says in his article, in speaking of the Duke of Saxe-Weimar's visit to Charlottesville and Monticello, that the Maverick "plan was probably given him by Jefferson." II. The Tanner Print II University of Virginia from the south, 1826 13 1/16″ × 26 3/8″. Vignette. Engraving Signed, lower right: B. Tanner, Sc. Labeled: University of Virginia Coll.: University of Virginia Jefferson, in a letter to William J. Coffee dated September 19, 1824, now in the Massachusetts Historical Society, said that a view of the University "has been made by a mr Williams 12. by 3. I. which will be engraved, as a vignette, on the map of Virga. now preparing for impression." Betts says this is the drawing from which No. II was made.4 4 Betts, "Groundplans and Prints of the University of Virginia, 1822-1826," Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, XC, No. 2 (1946), 90. Nothing further is known of "mr Williams." The map, usually known as the Böÿe map, is labeled Map of the State of Virginia. Constructed in Conformity to Law, from the late Surveys authorized by the Legislature and other original and authentic Documents by Herman Böÿe. Engraved by H. S. Tanner. Its copyright reads Entered according to Act of Congress, the 14th day of April 1826, by John Tyler, Governor of the State of Virginia. Several engravers were employed on this large and splendid map—James W. Steel, Joseph Perkins, and the two Tanners are acknowledged. Benjamin Tanner, 1775-1848, the engraver for the view of the University, was born in New York City, apprenticed to Peter C. Verger, and worked in New York until 1799. He then moved to Philadelphia where he established two engraving firms, into which he took his brother, whom he had taught, as one of his partners. Tanner, Kearney, and Thiebout were banknote engravers from 1817 to 1824. Tanner, Vallance, Kearney, and Co. were general engravers and the firm seems to have been in existence at about the same time. In 1835 Benjamin Tanner used stereographing for producing checks and banknotes. Retiring in 1845, he went to Baltimore where he died in 1848. His brother, Henry Schenck Tanner, 1786-1858, was best known as a cartographer. He worked in Philadelphia from 1811 to 1850. Since his name appears as the engraver of the map on its principal label he is often mistakenly given as the engraver of this view. This earliest of the views of the University is not only one of the most beautiful but also the best, John H. B. Latrobe, who saw the University in 1832, said the engraving was "a very accurate one."5 5 John E. Semmes, John H. B. Latrobe and His Times, 1803-1819 (Baltimore: Norman, Remington, 1917), p. 247. The presence of an arcade across the north end of the Lawn cannot have been quite accurate. III. The Hinton Group IIIa University of Virginia from the south, 1831 3 3/4″ × 5 5/8″. Steel engraving Signed, lower left: Drawn by W. Goodacre N.Y. Signed, lower right: Engraved and Printed by Fenner Sears &amp; Co. Labeled: University of Virginia, Charlottesville Coll.: Edwin M. Betts This print is further identified by the publisher's acknowledgment: "London Published Dec. 1, 1831 by H. L. Hinton &amp; Simpkin &amp; Marshall." It also has the engraved number "81" at the top right corner. Note that the Lawn is shown without terracing, a device which considerably simplified the draftsman's task, and that the colonnade is incorrectly continued across the north end of the Lawn. In Jefferson's letter of September 19, 1824, to William J. Coffee, he says that another view has been made of the University "of 18. by 12. I. by mr. Goodacre, son of the gentleman of that name who lectures on astron[omy] and is now probably in N.Y. This I understood he would engrave on his return to England." It was from this 1824 view that the print of 1831 was derived. No. IIIa was published in Hinton's History, which was first issued in a series of monthly parts completed in 1832, although the title page of the book gives 1830 as its date. The full title of the work was The History and Topography of the United States: Edited by John Howard Hinton, A.M. Assisted by several literary Gentlemen in America and England. Illustrated with a Series of Views, Drawn on the Spot, and Engraved on Steel, Expressly for this Work, London, Published by Jennings and Chaplin and I. T. Hinton, Thomas Wardle, Philadelphia, G. C. and H. Carvill, New York and Gray and Owen, Boston. August 2, 1830. Engraved and Printed by Fenner Sears and Co. Its first volume was concerned with the first fifty years of the United States while the second covered the country's geography and topography. The plates bound in seem to have differed from copy to copy and edition to edition. That for the University of Virginia does not seem to have been in this first edition, but appears in the later ones for 1842, 1846, and 1854. The description of the University given in all editions is as follows: This edifice, in which all the orders of architecture are introduced, has been reared up under the parental care of Mr. Jefferson. Combining the effect of the scenery presented by the surrounding country with the plan and execution of the buildings, the University of Virginia is pronounced by competent judges to be equal, if not superior, to anything of the kind in Europe. The print seems to have been issued separately, also, and with some variations as in Nos. IIIb and IIIc. It has, in addition, been popular as the source for prints issued by others as in the remaining examples in this section. It has also been issued in many reproductions, having been used not only as a picture but also on various decorative objects such as trays. John Howard Hinton, A.M., was a Baptist minister who died at Bristol, aged 83, in 1873. William Goodacre accompanied his astronomer father on a lecture tour which brought him to Charlottesville during May, 1824. He was a painter of landscapes and still lifes and taught drawing in New York from 1829 to 1835. He executed many of the views from Boston to Augusta, Ga., for Hinton.

Tallis, London &amp; New York Coll.: Edwin M. Betts Although the plate for No. IIIc is the same as that for No. IIIa, it now has a different publisher and has been given an engraved, decorative frame. The circular medallions to the left and right at the bottom are entitled, respectively, "Storming the Redoubts at Yorktown," and "Surrender of Cornwallis." The vignette at the top shows Columbia holding a staff supporting a Phrygian (Liberty) cap and bearing a shield inscribed "George Washington." IIId University of Virginia from the south, 1835-37 4 1/8″ × 6 1/4″. Steel engraving Signed, lower right: G. Poppel, Kp. Labeled: Die Virginia-Universitaet (Verien, Staaten v. Nord-Amerika) Publisher's Inscription: Aus d' Kunstanst. d. Bibliogr. Instit. in Hildbh. Eigenthum d. Verleger Coll.: Edwin M. Betts There is a colored state of No. IIId as well as an uncolored one. It is clearly derived from No. IIIa, as a comparison of the figures on the flat Lawn shows. The derivation is reinforced by the colonnade across the north end of the Lawn. The differences include the introduction of the tree on its knoll, the statues atop the balustrades of the Rotunda terraces, the lantern and statue surmounting the dome of the Rotunda, the extension of Pavilion IX far beyond its actual length with three chimneys instead of one, and the addition of two chimneys to Pavilion VII. The print appeared in a work entitled Meyer's Universum oder Abbildung und Beschreibung des Schenswerthesten und Merkwürdigsten der Natur und Kunst auf der ganzen Erde. Hildburghausen, Amsterdam und New-York. Druck und Verlag vom Bibliographischen Institut. 1837. The book was in four volumes, the dates varying in the volumes, the title pages being marked 1835, 1836, and 1837. There are both an engraved and a printed title page in each volume. The work was issued again in 1850 and 1859. There were also American editions in which the parts were issued without a date (1837?), and later in bound volumes in 1852 and 1859. In the American edition of parts it is called Our Globe, a universal picturesque album, edited by J. Meyer. In weekly numbers, each number illustrated by two superb steel-engravings from the burins of celebrated artists. Published by the North American Bibliographic Institution in Philadelphia (E. Littell and Co., 212 Chesnut St.) The print of the University appeared in Volume IV, p. 52, of the 1837 German edition accompanied by an article numbered CLIX and with the title "Die Virginia-Universität in den vereinigten Staaten von Nordamerika." In the American edition issued in parts, the title of the work changes to Our Globe Illustrated with Part IV, and the publisher changes to C. F. Hausman and Co., 279 Chesnut St. above Ninth, Philadelphia. The article, which appears in Volume I, Part V, No. 18, says The University of Virginia, situated at Charlottesville in that State, is one of those monuments which draw down upon the memory of a truly great man the blessings of all future generations. Thomas Jefferson, . . . sacrificed to the establishment of this University the greater part of his fortune [sic]. . . . The exterior of this University, which has been thought by European connoisseurs to be a model for such buildings, bears the stamp of the highly cultivated and noble mind by which it was created. The 1852 edition in this country had both an engraved and a printed title page. The engraved title was Meyer's Universum in Halfmonthly Parts Illustrated with Engravings from Drawings by the First Artists. Vol. I. Containing 48 Plates. The Literary Department J. Meyer. English-American Edition. New York: Hermann J. Meyer, 164 William Street. 1852. The printed title was Meyer's Universum or Views of the Most Remarkable Places and Objects of All Countries in Steel Engravings by Distinguished Artists, with Descriptive and Historical Text by Eminent Writers in Europe and America. Edited by Charles A. Dana. Vol. I. New York: Hermann J. Meyer, 164 William Street. 1852. Accounts of Joseph Meyer differ. One source says he was born in 1796 and died in 1856, while another gives the date 1859 for his death. A Joseph Meyer is listed as having been employed in New York as an engraver, but whether he was this Joseph Meyer or not is uncertain. Johann Gabriel Friedrich Poppell was born near Nurenberg in 1807 and died at Ammerland in 1882. He was a draftsman, a painter of landscapes, and an engraver of genre subjects and landscapes, being known particularly for his views of Munich.

Labeled: Université de Virginie Labeled, at top center: Etats-Unis Labeled, upper right: 87 Coll.: Edwin M. Betts Although the figures introduced in No. IIIe differ from those in No. IIIa, the similarities, especially the flat Lawn and the colonnade across the north, are overwhelming evidence of a clear derivation. This plate was published in Roux de Rochelle, Jean Baptiste Gaspard, Etats-Unis d'Amérique (Paris: Firmin Didot, frères, 1837 [85 pls., 4 ports., 3 maps, 4 plans]; 2nd ed., 1838 [86 pls., 4 ports., 3 maps, 4 plans]). It was part of an immense work called L'univers: Histoire et description de tous les peuples (Paris, 1835-63). L'univers was planned in seventy octavo volumes, divided into five portions: Europe in forty volumes and three additional ones of plates of France; Africa in seven volumes; Asia in twelve volumes; America in five volumes; and Oceania in three volumes. The volume (volumes?) on the United States was published in Italian, Spanish, and German. Jean Baptiste Gaspard Roux de Rochelle lived between 1762 and 1849. There are two Arnouts who might have been the delineator of this plate. Jean Baptiste Arnout was born in Dijon in 1788 and flourished as a painter and lithographer between 1819 and 1865. His son, Louis-Jules Arnout, born in Paris in 1814, was also a painter and lithographer who worked in Paris until 1867. The signature for the engraver is not clear. It might, however, be Hyacinthe Travesier, who worked in Paris until 1860. IIIf University of Virginia from the south, 1839 (?) 3 3/8″ × 5″. Engraving Unsigned Labeled: Universita de Virginia Labeled at top: Stati Uniti Coll.: Edwin M. Betts Either a reworked version of No. IIIe or a new plate, this view differs from No. IIIe in the treatment of the sky and in the clarity of the incorrect colonnade across the north end of the Lawn. It, too, is derived from No. IIIa. The plate was published in the Italian translation of Roux de Rochelle's book, the new title being Stati Uniti d'America, 1839.6 6 Neither the Spanish nor the German translations were available for examination or reproduction during this study. The German publication is titled Vereinigte Staaten von Nord-Amerika, trans. by C. A. Mebold (Stuttgart: E. Schweizerhart, 1838). The Spanish translation is Historia de los Estados Unidos de América, 1841. IIIg University of Virginia from the south, 1835 3 3/8″ × 5 7/16″. Wood engraving Unsigned Labeled: College in Charlottesville Coll.: Edwin M. Betts The figures, the flat Lawn, the colonnade across the north, and even the arrangement of clouds attest to this plate's derivation from No. IIIa. It was published in the April, 1835, issue of The American Magazine of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge, which was described as "embellished with numerous engravings," and was issued at Boston by the Boston Bewick Co., 47 Court Street. On page 367 it said of the University that in 1834 it has nine instructors, one hundred and thirty pupils, a library of eight thousand volumes; and an adequate philosophical apparatus. . . . The University of Virginia is situated near the seat of the late President Jefferson, and was a favorite object of his care. The American Magazine of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge was issued monthly from September, 1834, to September, 1837. It was illustrated with many plates, numbers of which were vulgarizations of the engravings in Hinton. IIIh University of Virginia from the south, 1835 2 1/16″ × 3 3/16″. Wood engraving Unsigned Labeled: University of Virginia Coll.: Edwin M. Betts Also derived from No. IIIa—compare the figures, the flat Lawn, and the general composition—this print was first published in 1835 in a book by Grenville Mellen. It was A Book of the United States, Exhibiting Its Geography, Divisions, Constitution, and Government . . . and Presenting a View of the Republic Generally and of the Individual States; together with a Condensed History of the Land . . . a Description of the principal Cities and Towns; with Statistical Tables, Relating to the Religion, Commerce, Manufactures, and Various Other Topics. Hartford, Conn. 1835. The print of the University is on page 479. The book was reissued many times, changed publishers twice, and grew thicker in the process. The 1836, 1837, and 1838 imprints were all issued at Hartford and contained 804 pages. The 1839 and 1841 issues contained 824 pages and were published in New York by Smith. The 1842 issue containing 847 pages was published at Hartford, while the 1852 issue was also published at Hartford under the imprint of Goodman and contained 852 pages. The University is described as owing its origin and peculiar organization chiefly to Mr. Jefferson. It has a fine collection of buildings, consisting of four parallel ranges about six hundred feet in length and two hundred feet apart, suited to the accommodation of nine professors, and upwards of two hundred students. Grenville Mellen, 1799-1841, was born at Biddeford, Maine, the son of Prentiss and Sarah Hudson Mellen. He was educated at Portsmouth Academy and at Harvard and began to practice law with his father. Married in 1824, his health broke after the death of his daughter in 1828 and that of his wife in 1829. He then devoted himself to writing, publishing a book of poetry, The Martyr's Triumph, in 1833. After 1836 he lived in New York working chiefly on history and statistical compilations. During 1839 his health became so bad that a voyage to Cuba during the winter of 1839-40 did no good and he died the next year. IIIi University of Virginia from the south, 1842 1 3/4″ × 4″. Vignette engraving Unsigned Labeled: Universität von Virginia, Charlottesville. Labeled, top right: 30 Coll.: Edwin M. Betts Yet another print derived from No. IIIa, No. IIIi has both similarities and differences. The figures, while not identical with those in No. IIIa, are placed in approximately the same positions, the Lawn is flat, there is a colonnade on the north, and the disposal of the buildings is very similar. The lighting in this little print is quite different, however, being very dramatic with its brilliant spot on the Lawn itself, while the central columns of the Rotunda portico have been given a wider spacing than those flanking them. Neither of these features appears in No. IIIa, and, of course, the spacing of the columns is incorrect. The print appears on the upper third of a page which also includes an engraving of the Natural Bridge. It is found in the second volume of a book whose title page reads as follows: Gemälde von Nord-Amerika in allen Beziehungen vonder Entdeckung an bis auf die neueste zeit. Eine Pittoreske Geographie für alle, Welche unterhaltende Belehrung suchen und ein Umfassendes Reise-Handbuch für jine, welche in diesem Lande wandern wollen. Von Traugott Bromme. In zwei Bänden, Zweiten Band. Stuttgart, J. Scheible's Buchhandlung, 1842.7 7 The title page translates as "Descriptions of North-America in All Regards from Its Discovery to Most Recent Times. A Picturesque Geography for All Who Seek Entertaining Instruction and a Comprehensive Travel-Handbook for Those Who Intend to Travel in That Country. By Traugott Bromme. In two volumes. Second Volume. Stuttgart, J. Scheible's Bookstore. 1842." The description of the University on page 544 of the second volume is translated as The erection of the buildings, which consist of four parallel rows that have a front of about 600 feet and are in a distance of 200 feet from each other, cost $333,966. IIIj University of Virginia from the south, n.d. 3 5/8″ × 5 5/8″. Wood engraving Unsigned Labeled: University of Virginia, Charlottesville Coll.: University of Virginia This last, undated print must also be an adaptation of No. IIIa. The incorrect colonnade at the north, the flat Lawn, the reversing of such figures as are used, and the arrangement of the clouds as well as the general composition point to No. IIIa as the source of the artist's information. No further data is available about this final view of the Hinton group. IV. The Outline Drawing IV University of Virginia from the south, n.d. Original not available for examination. Woodcut? Labeled: Outline View of the University of Virginia Coll. (in reproduction): Edwin M. Betts This rather mysterious photograph can be identified only from a letter from the L. C. Handy Studios, Washington, D.C., to Edwin M. Betts, U. Va., October 24, 1934. It states "we have found in our old files . . . a simple line drawing made in 1819 showing a view somewhat similar to the one sent you today [the Hinton]." Since the title on the photograph is in type, it seems unlikely that the object photographed was a drawing. The date of 1819 is surely too early, since Jefferson may not have made the drawings for the Rotunda until 1821, soon before estimates of its costs were made and shortly before they were approved by the Board of Visitors on April 2, 1821. Could this be the third view of the University mentioned by Jefferson in his letter to William J. Coffee of September 19, 1824? In it he says "a 3d [view] of about the same size [18 × 12] has been done by a mr. Cook, a drawer by profession, with a view also to engraving it for sale?"8 8 Jefferson Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society. Or could this view be taken from the 12 × 3 drawing of Mr. Williams9 9 See No. II. mentioned in the same letter? V. The Duval Group Va University of Virginia from the south, 1844-45 3 1/4″ × 6 7/8″.

The principal difference between No. Vb and No. Vc is, of course, the signature, and it is possible that Steel may have worked on the other two versions of this print. Nos. Va, Vb, and Vc were used principally as the frontispiece of the catalogues for the University from that for the session for 1844-45 to that for the session for 1854-55. There was no print used in the catalogues before the session of 1844-45, and none after 1855-56, while that for the 1855-56 session was No. Xa. Since these prints were produced by a firm of lithographers (see below), it is possible that they are lithographic reproductions of engravings, but the classification of engraving has been given them here since one of them is so signed by James Steel. The catalogue titles, the printers, and the exact print used for each are given below: 1844-45: Catalogue of the Officers and Students of the University of Virginia. Session of 1844-45. Philadelphia: C. Sherman, Printer. 1845. No. Va. 1845-46: The same. 1846-47: Catalogue of the Officers and Students of the University of Virginia. Session 1846-47. J.

S. Duval for 2,000 views of University for catalogue. [May 11, 1841] P. S. Duval, 1800 vignette views of the University for catalogues. [April 21, 1846] No. Vc was used on the University's diploma, an example of which survives from 1835. No. Vb appears as the frontispiece of an autograph album issued by Duval, an album which is otherwise the same as No. Vd. It is not dated, but the signatures bear the date of 1851.10 10 Willoughby Tebb was the owner of the album in the manuscript room of the Library of the University of Virginia. James W. Steel, 1799-1879, was a native of Philadelphia. He was a pupil of Benjamin Tanner and George Murray. He worked for a time with Tanner, Vallance, Kearney and Co., engraved the vignette of Richmond on the Böÿe-Tanner map of Virginia, and did many engravings of portraits, landscapes, and historical scenes. He later became a banknote engraver. Dunlap said he "is an Irishman, and engraves well in the line manner,"11 11 Dunlap, History of the Arts of Design, II, 379. but whether he meant Steel was born in Ireland as opposed to his having been born in Philadelphia is uncertain. Peter S. Duval, a Frenchman, was hired as a young man to come to Philadelphia to work for Childs and Inman as a lithographer. A few years later Duval with George Lehman established Lehman and Duval (1835-37) as successors to Childs and Inman. The firm became, with William W. Huddy, Huddy and Duval (1839-43), and in 1843 Duval established his own shop in Philadelphia. His son, Stephen Orr Duval, b. 1832, was taken into the business in 1858 when the firm became P. S. Duval and Son, Lithographers. Duval's firm was one of the leading lithographic companies in the country until 1879 when he retired. Vd The Rotunda from the south, 1846-51 3 3/8″ × 5 1/8″. Vignette. Lithograph Unsigned Labeled: Rotunda Publisher's inscription, bottom right: Lith. of P. S. Duval. Philada. Coll.: University of Virginia Note the proper delineation of the lunettes in the wall of the Rotunda terraces, the hip roof over those "terraces," the lantern capping the dome of the Rotunda, and weather vane capping the lantern. The dome has also lost its steps at its base. They were usually shown in some form in the earlier prints. This print appeared in the autograph album which is commonly called the Duval album, although it has no publisher acknowledged. There are two versions of it, one containing Nos. Vb and Vd and the other containing Nos. Vd and Ve. One should point out that there is considerable discrepancy in the Rotunda between Nos. Vb and Vd, No. Vd clearly being drawn by someone who had seen the building recently and had marked its changes. The album itself is not dated, but the autographs within it are dated 1851. The lantern had been added by General John H. Cocke in 1840, while the weather vane was put up somewhat later. This seems to be the earliest print in which either feature appeared. The form of the weather vane is not certain. It appears to be an arrow in No. Vd, but an alumnus remembered it as a quill pen. Captain John M. Payne's letter of January 27, 1933, to Edwin M. Betts at the University follows: According to my promise I will write my recollection of the Vane on top of the Rotunda which was there when I came to the University in 1858. The Vane was in the form of a Qwill [sic] Pen some 8 or 10 feet long— gilded. The point of the pen would point to the letter N. E. S. W. as the wind blew. This was evidently the invention of Mr. Jefferson. And, in my opinion, and as far as one hears, added a finish to the appearance of the building. Mr. Pratt took this down in 1859 or 1860. Some years ago, I wrote to Mr. Alderman about this Vane. He replied at once thanking me for this information and said that he would have the original searched for, but I have heard nothing more about it. There may be someone in Charlottesville who may remember this Vane, for it was quite apparent to one seeing the Rotunda. Captain Payne was wrong about the weather vane being an intention of or an invention by Jefferson. He had given the Rotunda a flat skylight at the oculus rather than a lantern on which a weather vane could be fixed. Captain Payne (1840-1934), whose home was at Lynchburg during his student days, had registered at the University during 1858-59 and in 1860.

The field in the foreground is the location of the present hospital. The second version of Duval's autograph album used No. Ve as a frontispiece. It is sometimes thought to be as early as 1849, but the copy at the University has signatures dated 1851.12 12 Col.

The Rotunda is still in its original state, without a lantern and with the steps at the base of its dome.

Charleston, S.C. Published by Babcock and Co., 1845. In it Howe describes the University as having a fine collection of buildings, consisting of four parallel ranges about 600 feet in length, and 200 feet apart, suited to the accommodation of 9 professorships, and upwards of 200 students; which, together with the real estate, cost over $300,000. It possesses valuable libraries amounting to 16,000 vols., and is amply provided with philosophical and chemical apparatus, together with a fine cabinet of minerals and fossils, and an anatomical and miscellaneous museum. The observatory, a short distance from the university, is furnished with the requisite astronomical instruments. . . . "This university is, in every respect, organized and justly regarded as an university of the first class." This note appears on page 165 of all three editions of the Historical Collections of Virginia, 1845, 1849, and 1852. Henry Howe, 1816-93, was born in New Haven, Conn., the son of a bookseller and publisher. Just as he was about to enter Yale University, his father's business had severe reverses. He eventually worked in Wall Street and, inspired in 1838 by a copy of John Warner Barber's Historical Collections of Connecticut, formed a partnership with Barber, introduced door-to-door selling, and published a series of books.13 13 Historical Collections of the State of New York, 1841; Historical Collections of the State of New Jersey, 1844; Historical Collections of Virginia, 1845; and Historical Collections of Ohio, 1847. The material for the book on Virginia was gathered by Howe himself in 1843. He began his tour on horseback but he once said his horse "took 50 miles of riding to get here, 25 miles by road and 25 miles up and down in the air." His budget "usually limited the illustrations to whatever he could produce himself, though he was sometimes able to buy engraved views."14 14 "Henry Howe, Connecticut Yankee," Virginia Cavalcade, XV (Winter, 1966), 36-47. The manuscript room of the Library of the University of Virginia has recently begun to use this print for its letterhead. VIb University of Virginia from the south, n.d. 2 1/2″ × 4 5/8″. Wood engraving Signed, lower right: W. Roberts Not labeled Coll.: New York Public Library Though without figures and mountains, No. VIb is a presumed derivative of No. VIa. It has the same treatment of the dome of the Rotunda, the same arcade at the north end of the Lawn, which is given the same single change in elevation, and it shows the same number of chimneys on the buildings bordering West Lawn. There was a William Roberts who flourished at Philadelphia between 1839 and 1860 who may have been the author of this print. The census of 1850 said he was born in England, ca. 1809, while that of 1860 said he was born in Germany, ca. 1811. Another William Roberts who also may have been the artist for No. VIb was a wood engraver in New York. He worked between 1846 and 1876 with Butler and Roberts. He exhibited at the American Institution from 1846 to 1851 and appears to have been rather more able than the Philadelphia William Roberts. The elaborate light effects of No. VIb might indicate that the New York William Roberts was its engraver. This latter Roberts also executed the frontispiece of Robert Sears's A New and Popular Pictorial Description of the United States, 1848. VII.

Wood engraving Unsigned Labeled: University of Virginia Coll.: University of Virginia Although No. VIII shows Pavilion VIII and two changes of level on the Lawn, it does not seem to be a derivative of No. VII. Note its incorrectly ribbed dome on the Rotunda. It does, however, give a good idea of the original roof scheme of the University, both those which were flat and those which were parapeted. Not much is known about No. VIII. It exists as a page (111) torn from a small geography. The surviving text about Virginia does not mention the University. Nevertheless a great deal of information is packed into a small space in the wood engraving, in which the neoclassic character of the University is seen to great advantage for the last time. IX. The Porte Crayon Group IXa University of Virginia from the east, 1853-56 2 3/16″ × 6 1/4″. Vignette. Wood engraving Unsigned: [By Porte Crayon] Labeled: The University of Virginia Coll.: Edwin M. Betts The first of the prints of the University to depict the addition to the Rotunda, familiarly called the Annex, No. IXa is also of interest as being the first to include the "carrs," as a train was usually called then. This particular train is the Central Railroad, the forerunner of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. The Rotunda dome does not have its steps at the base, but does have the lantern and weather vane as seen also in Nos. Vd and Ve. Pavilion X still has its parapet. The serpentine walls also appear quite clearly. Porte Crayon's view of the University first appeared in an article called "Virginia Illustrated: Adventures of Porte Crayon and His Cousins," in Harper's New Monthly Magazine, XIII (Aug., 1856), 303-23, the print being on page 304. It had been sketched during a journey around Virginia beginning October 8 and ending November 20, 1853. Porte Crayon included in this article three other illustrations of student life,15 15 "Virginia Student," p. 303; "To Shave or Dye," p. 305; and "Shaving," p. 305. none, however, of particular architectural interest. This print was subsequently reprinted in book form in Porte Crayon's collected essays about Virginia; on a map; in Sarah N. Randolph's memoirs of Thomas Jefferson;16 16 Porte Crayon, Virginia Illustrated: Containing a Visit to the Virginian Canaan, and the Adventures of Porte Crayon and His Cousins (New York: Harper and Bros., 1857), p. 242; "Map of Virginia, Delaware, Maryland and West Virginia" (n.p.: Johnson and Ward, 1864); and Sarah N. Randolph, Domestic Life of Thomas Jefferson (New York: Harper and Bros., 1871), p. 386. and as a letterhead illustrated here as No. IXb. Porte Crayon was a pseudonym of David Hunter Strother, 1816-88. Born in Martinsburg, Virginia, he was educated at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, with S. F. B. Morse in New York, and in Paris, and Florence. He later had great success with his illustrated travel articles, having published approximately a hundred before his popularity began to wane.17 17 Cecil D. Ely, Jr., "Porte Crayon": The Life of David Hunter Strother (Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 1960). As for the University of Virginia, he thought "the architecture wants finish."18 18 Virginia Illustrated, p. 242. IXb University of Virginia from the east, ca. 1858 2 3/8″ × 7″. Vignette.

IXa and IXb, it is very difficult to discern any difference between the two. The example shown here serves as the letterhead for a letter from H. M. Heath to Dr. George C. Tyler, October 14, 1858, now in the manuscript room of the Library of the University of Virginia. There is another letter in the Betts Collection using the same letterhead dated March 11, 1861. Marcellus McKennie was the son of Clement P. and Henrietta Rodes McKennie. The elder McKennie had established Charlottesville's first newspaper in 1820 and later purchased land adjoining the University and set up a bookstore there in 1834. He took his son Marcellus into the business, and Marcellus in turn ran the store with his son.19 19 Woods, Albemarle County in Virginia, p. 260. X.

In 1856 the last issue of the University's Catalogue bearing a print of No. Xa as a frontispiece was issued.20 20 Catalogue of the University of Virginia. Session of 1855-56 (Richmond: H. K. Ellyson's Steam Presses, 147 Main Street, 1856). The next year the printer was changed and the custom of using a print with the catalogue was discontinued. In 1859 Casimir Bohn issued an autograph album which also contained No. Xa. It had an elaborately designed title page of which a transcription follows: Bohn's Album and Autographs of the University of Virginia, with a Short History, and Beautifully Illustrated with Twenty Steel Engravings and Portraits of the Professors and Officers. Washington: Published by Casimir Bohn, 568 Pennsylvania Avenue, Richmond: J. W. Randolph, Main Street. Sold by Dr. M. McKennie and G. T. Jones, University of Virginia. 1859. John Murphy and Co. Printers, Publishers, Booksellers and Stationers, Marble Building, 182 Baltimore Street, Baltimore. No. Xa was also used as a letterhead at least as early as 1858. Casimir Bohn seems to have been primarily an entrepreneur working out of Washington and Richmond. In addition to his prints of the University, he is also associated with the iconography of Richmond. One source states that he was an artist, but this does not seem to be established. John Murphy, 1812-80, born in Omagh, Co. Tyrone, was brought to New Castle, Delaware, at the age of ten. Educated at the New Castle Academy, he went to Philadelphia at sixteen to learn the printing trade. By 1835 he had established a printing and stationery business in Baltimore and added the publication of books to his activities in 1837. Of H. Weber nothing is known. See page 111 for M. McKennie.

Trees are shown on the Lawn which is enclosed at the south end by a wall. No. Xb was the second view of the University to appear in Bohn's autograph album, all the other engravings being portraits. It is familiarly known as the "double row of trees" print. There was a J. Serz, d. ca. 1878, who was born in Saxony. He established himself in Philadelphia ca. 1850 and engraved historical and genre scenes. A Johann Georg Serz, who was born in Nuremberg in 1808, worked in this country from ca. 1840.

This large, colored, and slightly romanticized view shows us the crowded gardens on West Lawn with their outbuildings, the Anatomical Theater, the road ringing the University, the exercise field to the south, and a splendid view of the Annex and Rotunda. The relationship of the University to the village of Charlottesville is plainly set forth, while the print is animated by the train in the distance and the carriages and Saratoga wagon on the road to the west of West Range. This print seems to have been very popular for it not only has its derivative copy in No. Xe, but it was photographically reproduced by Tyson and Perry of Charlottesville and mounted on a card slightly larger than a postcard, ca. 1867.21 21 Collection of the University of Virginia. It was also reproduced in the 1880's on the University's checks. Edward Sachse, 1804-73, was a painter and lithographer born at Gorlitz near Breslau. He came to this country during the late 1840's, exhibiting at the Maryland Historical Society. He formed the firm of E. Sachse and Co. with his two brothers, Theodore, a lithographer, born in Germany ca. 1815, who settled in Baltimore after 1847, and William, who seems to have come to Baltimore about 1860.

Its presence here, together with No. Xd1, is pertinent as a footnote to the group of Bohn prints. Xf University of Virginia from the east, 1875 2 1/2″ × 5 5/8″. Vignette. Lithograph Unsigned Not labeled Publisher's inscription: Lith. by A. Hoen &amp; Co. Baltimore Coll.: Edwin M. Betts No. Xf is a lithographic copy of No. Xa, an engraving, the chief difference being rather more spirited draftsmanship in No. Xf. We may suppose that its depiction of the University is about twenty years out of date when it was issued in 1875. No. Xf appeared on a mortgage bond issued by the University in 1875, the printed date on the document. The example in the Betts Collection was for $500 and was made out to William Lamb on July 2, 1883, Mr. Lamb assigning it back to the University at once. August Hoen, born ca. 1825 in Germany, was brought to Baltimore to work as a lithographer with his uncle Edward Weber. About midcentury August Hoen took over the business and introduced his brothers, Ernest and Henry, into the firm. The business was still in existence as late as 1943 in both Baltimore and Richmond. One would like to find a connection between Edward Weber and H. Weber, the printer of No. Xa, the prototype for No. Xf, but no certain link can be traced at present. XI.

Wood engraving Unsigned Labeled: Western Aspect of the University of Virginia Coll.: University of Virginia It is difficult to determine whether this print was drawn from life or derived from another print. Charlottesville does not seem quite as large as in No. XI, and the foreground and the road across the south end of the Lawn differ from previous prints. Nos. XIIa, XIIb, XIIc, and XIId all appeared as illustrations for Schele de Vere's article "Mr. Jefferson's Pet" in Harper's New Monthly Magazine, XLIV (May, 1872), 815-26.

Wood engraving Unsigned Labeled: Southern View of the Lawn Coll.: University of Virginia In No. XIIb the treatment of the crown of the dome of the Rotunda differs considerably from that of No. XIIa. There the lantern and weather vane (another weather vane and lantern, since the earlier ones had been taken down in 1860) are well represented, while here in No. XIIb a vestigial lantern ending in an amorphous point sits atop the dome. The enclosing wall at the north end of the Lawn is properly represented as being pierced by semicircular openings instead of either an arcade or a colonnade. No. XIIb is from the same source as No. XIIa, and is printed on page 820. XIIc The Rotunda, 1872 4 7/16″ × 4 1/2″. Wood engraving Signed, lower right: S. Fox (?) Labeled: The Rotunda Coll.: University of Virginia Once more the dome of the Rotunda differs from Nos. XIIa and XIIb, so that we have three variations in one article. Here the steps at its base are gone, and both the lantern and the weather vane have disappeared. The class bell does show, just to the right of the apex of the pediment, and to the right of the Rotunda wall itself one has a glimpse of the Annex. No. XIIc was printed on page 821 of the same article as Nos. XIIa and XIIb. XIId The Library Room, the Rotunda, 1872 4 1/2″ × 3 3/8″. Wood engraving Unsigned Labeled: Statue of Mr. Jefferson, by Galt Coll.: University of Virginia No. XIId is of considerable interest since it is the only print of an interior at the University of which there is a record. It is remarkable, too, in that it was made just about the same time as the oldest surviving photographs of the same room. The Library was then on the second, and now nonexistent, floor of the Rotunda. The Legislature had commissioned Alexander Galt to execute the statue of Jefferson as a gift for the University of Virginia. It was completed in 1860, but because of the Civil War it was not dedicated until 1868. No. XIId is on page 816 of the same article as Nos. XIIa, XIIb, and XIIc. XIII.

Minton Labeled: University of Virginia Publisher's Inscription: M. McKennie &amp; Son, Booksellers Coll.: Edwin M.

Charlottesville has almost entirely disappeared, while the dome of the Rotunda has had the steps at the base, the lantern, and the weather vane restored to it. It is doubtful if the Lawn, the gardens, and the Ranges were ever as heavily forested as in XIII. The print appears as a letterhead, the photostat in the Betts Collection being on a letter from Paul B. Barringer to his father dated January 15, 1875. John Minton was an engraver who flourished in New York after the middle of the nineteenth century. See page 111 for Marcellus McKennie and Son. XIV.

As close as No. XIV may be to No. XIIc, it is not derived from it, as a comparison of the perspective viewpoints in the two prints will show at once. Notice the balustrade on the Rotunda terraces, the gas-lamp post (more accurately observed than in No. XIIc), and the change in fashion since the earlier print.

The encircling roads still exist in this map, the Victorian buildings appear on it, and the additions made after the Annex and Rotunda were burned in 1895 at both the north and south ends of the Lawn are shown. The buildings marked X were never built, nor were the connections between M.L. (Cocke Hall) and P.L. (Rouss Hall) and the south end of the original Lawn. M.L., P.L., and A.B. (Cabell Hall) had been begun when this map appeared, but B.H. (the boiler house) was located to the south of Cabell Hall where it was subsequently built. The map appeared in the University's Catalogue, this particular example being taken from that for 1896-97.</field>
