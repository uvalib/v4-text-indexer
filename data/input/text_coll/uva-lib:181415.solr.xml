      <field name="fulltext">Sixth Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library, for the Year 1935-36 IT IS a commonplace observation that we are living in an age of rapid change. The statement needs no further confirmation; we meet with countless examples of it in our highly integrated society which in itself is an accelerating force. We are not surprised to find that intellectual as well as material movements, however local their beginnings, quickly become national in interest and scope, and common problems are solved through regional and national associations. Despite forebodings in certain quarters, the trend of the times has led us rather to expect that the state, whether the individual commonwealth or the federal government, will play an important part in financing or at least in administering these problems. While it may be asserted that with archival work the state has always been directly concerned, economic and social changes in recent years have broadened our conception of archival functions and given new emphasis to the problems of collecting, allocating, arranging and listing historical materials.1 1. Fifth Annual Report of the Archivist, 1934-35 (University, Va., 1935), page 1. These critical years of socio-economic discussion and experiment have so intensified our appreciation of the source materials of our civilization that an active program along these lines by the state university, the state historical society, or the state library is taken for granted. Privately financed institutions, some of which were pioneers in historical work, have likewise advanced with the tide; indeed, in their function and service they are seldom differentiated from state institutions. In the South where ten years ago archival activity beyond the narrow definition of the word was almost nonexistent in any organized form, there are few states today without some program of this kind under way.2 2. This work, beyond the care of official archives, has been expanding for some years in North Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Florida, and Kentucky. More recent developments have occurred in Louisiana, South Carolina, and West Virginia. It has grown rapidly at Louisiana State University during the past two years, and at West Virginia University, where interested faculty members by first promoting the work on their own initiative were able later to enlist state support.3 3. First Report of the Archivist of the Division of Documents of the West Virginia University for the Year 1935-1936 (Morgantown, W. Va., July 1936), pages 4-8. The problems of manuscript collections are now discussed regularly at the meetings of the Association of Research Libraries, and the program of the National Archives, now well under way in the new building, is of significance to all the states.4 4. First Annual Report of the Archivist of the United States for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1935 (Washington, D. C., 1936). While historians and archivists have discussed their common problems and sponsored national programs for listing documentary materials though the American Historical Association, and more recently through the American Library Association, it was the Federal Government that made possible a truly nation-wide archival project financed by relief funds under the Works Progress Administration. This is the Historical Records Survey, headed by Dr. Luther H. Evans and organized in every state to make a detailed inventory of local archives, manuscript collections, church records, lodge records, labor union materials, etc. One can readily appreciate the significance of this project in Virginia where the University's archival work, then in its sixth year, was identical in many respects. Whereas previous attempts to set up such a project on a small scale with relief funds in Virginia had failed5 5. Fourth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1933-34 (University, Va., 1934), page 2. and the progress of the work was retarded for want of even a small staff of assistants, the Historical Records Survey allocated enough funds to conduct the inventory in almost every county and city of Tidewater Virginia and in the Piedmont north of the James with an average of about seventy workers under three non-relief district supervisors and the general supervision of the University archivist. Work in the various localities began early in March; an office was provided in the state WPA Building in Richmond; and by the empirical method the project gradually gained momentum after some weeks of discouragement over government regulations and the shortcomings of relief workers. A manual of instructions and a series of form-sheets,6 6. To provide data not only on bound and unbound records in the clerks' offices, but also on the housing of the records, on paintings and statuary, maps and individual manuscripts of special interest, and official printed records. supplemented by periodic checking and advice from the supervisors, aided in establishing a routine procedure for the workers and in assuring generally satisfactory results. By concentrating on local archives, church records, and labor materials, the inventory of these was completed in thirty-four counties and nine cities in the area mentioned by the end of the summer, and steps were taken to transfer the project to the Valley, Southside, and southwestern Virginia. In a number of counties access could not be gained to the records because of crowded conditions caused by other WPA projects. While it was inevitable that some of the workers would be incapable, especially since those with higher education were at a premium, the net results will undoubtedly demonstrate the intrinsic worth of the survey. Editorial work has begun to prepare the inventory for publication, in Virginia under the direction of the archivist co-operating with the Washington office. Newspapers were also included in the Historical Records Survey, but this phase of the inventory had already been completed in Virginia. The archivist's Virginia Newspapers, 1821-1935: A Bibliography with Historical Introduction and Notes was published in 1936 as Monograph 22 of the University's Institute for Research in the Social Sciences (Appleton-Century). This study, together with Dr. Clarence S. Brigham's Bibliography of American Newspapers, 1690-1820 (Part XVIII: Virginia-West Virginia), published by the American Antiquarian Society,7 7. In its Proceedings, April, 1927, pages 63-162. affords a virtually complete guide to the papers of this state and to files and scattered issues in all Virginia libraries and in leading research libraries throughout the United States.8 8. In this connection it is appropriate to call attention to the revised edition of A Check-List of American Eighteenth Century Newspapers in the Library of Congress, compiled under the direction of Henry S. Parsons (Washington, 1936). The archivist's volume is published as Part I of the Guide to Virginia Historical Materials which was projected during the early stages of the Virginia program.9 9. First Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1930-31 (University, Va., 1931), page 5. During the past year the University's newspaper collection has been augmented by additional volumes of the New Market Shenandoah Valley, making this file complete for 1886-87, 1892-1928; by the Richmond Christian Advocate, 1881-84; by the Remington News, 1932-33; by additions to the file of the tri-weekly National Intelligencer, Washington, D. C., 1820-60, and the daily edition for January-June 1828; by a bound photostatic set of the Williamsburg Virginia Gazette, 173680, produced by the Massachusetts Historical Society; and by a number of rare issues of Richmond papers through the kindness of Mr. F. Earle Lutz of the Richmond News Leader. The fact that many of these last named are twentieth century papers demonstrates the ephemeral nature of a large percentage of journalistic records and reinforces the argument for photographic reproduction of current as well as older newspapers. The University has also acquired a large mass of leading dailies of the United States covering the first quarter of the present century. When these are sorted and certain files selected for preservation, they will strengthen the potentialities for research in recent American history. Among the manuscript accessions by gift or purchase during the past year, the most important single item is doubtless an original map of the Virginia-North Carolina boundary showing the extension of the Byrd survey of 1728 from Peter's Creek to Steep Rock Creek by Joshua Fry and Peter Jefferson in 1749. The legend on the map10 10. The legend: "This is a Plan of the Line between Virginia and North Carolina which was run in the Year 1728 in the Spring and Fall from the Sea to Peter's Creek by the Honourable William Byrd, William Dandridge and Richard Fitzwilliams, Esquires, Commissioners, and Mr. Alexander Irvine and Mr. William Mayo, Surveyors; and from Peter's Creek to Steep Rock Creek was continued in the Fall of the Year 1749 by Joshua Fry and Peter Jefferson." The measurements of the map are 6â² 2Â½â³ Ã 11â³; scale of miles 1â³: 5 mi. The Library of Congress was permitted to make a photostatic copy for its Division of Maps. Congress was permitted to make a photostatic copy for its Division of Maps. is very probably in the handwriting of Peter Jefferson and, without much doubt, it was drawn by him ca. 1750. Since no other original map of the line of 1749 is known to be extant, this is undoubtedly a unique document.11 11. A "tracing" (preliminary draft?) of this boundary line, with an almost identical legend but in another handwriting, in the possession of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, Washington, D. C., is listed in E. G. Swem, Maps Relating to Virginia in the Virginia State Library and Other Departments of the Commonwealth . . . (Virginia State Library Bulletin, VII, nos. 2-3, Richmond, 1914), page 58. The University of Virginia Library has secured a blue-print copy of this tracing; size 6Â¼â³ Ã 30Â¼â³. Among other individual manuscripts of special interest are two letters of Thomas Jefferson to Philip L. Grymes, 1800 and 1802; a pardon issued to John Henry of Charlotte County and signed by President Andrew Johnson, 1865; and a bill of "Mr. Cary Seldon to George Washington Esqr., President of the United States," for the breeding of certain mares by "Knight of Malta" and "Compound", and for pasturage. The bill, dated July 20, 1794, was written and signed by William Pearce, manager of the Mount Vernon farms during 1793-96. This manuscript has further historical interest because written on it in pencil is a letter which shows that it was sent from Virginia to Wisconsin in the spring of 1862 by a Union soldier from that state.12 12. The soldier, Charles H. Ferrand, wrote regarding the Washington account: "I procured this in a secesh's house cellar. There were a number of old writings, some over 100 years. When I got this they were pretty well culled. . . ." This may serve as a significant commentary upon one cause for Virginia's loss of historical materials. After three-quarters of a century the manuscript was returned to Virginia through the courtesy of Professor A. H. Sanford of the Wisconsin State Teachers College, La Crosse. A large collection of manuscripts acquired recently is that of the Morris Family of Hanover and Louisa counties. Chiefly letters received by three succeeding generations of the family, especially by Colonel Richard, Dr. James M., and Richard O. Morris, they deal with business and politics (including a few Henry Clay letters) and with general social conditions during the period 1770-1900. The Davis-Terrell collection from Albemarle County numbers some thirty letters written by Dabney C. Terrell and his sisters on social affairs in the community and in Lexington and Winchester during 1796 and 1810-26. Included also are letters of Dabney Carr and of J. A. G. Davis (18021840), first law professor of the University of Virginia, discussing some early problems of the institution; two communications from Albert Gallatin in Paris to Dabney C. Terrell while a student at the University of Geneva; and two John R. Thompson letters of 1870. In connection with Professor Davis should be mentioned a "Commonplace Book" (183â?) of memoranda kept by him and notes on his law course made by Benjamin B. Minor (1818-1905), later law professor and editor of the Southern Literary Messenger. Two incomplete diaries of Major James M. Glassell, U. S. A. (d. 1838) are on file: one of his tour in England and Paris in 1825-26; the other in the nature of official memoranda kept while on military duty in the Western Department in Louisiana, 1837-38, until his last illness. Of interest to the student of education are the lecture notes of Launcelot M. Blackford (1837-1914), graduate of the University of Virginia, used while associate principal of the Norwood School in Nelson County, Virginia, ca. 1868-70. In the field of economic history are miscellaneous papers (bills, accounts, and inventories) of a succession of Scotch-American merchant firms operating out of Fredericksburg as early as 1759âScott &amp; Gray, Gray &amp; Mitchell, Mitchell, Gray &amp; Coatesâand continuing, with several gaps in the record, well into the nineteenth century. The functions of foreign exchange, wholesale and retail trade in Virginia, and banking were intermingled, in customary fashion, with the pursuit of agriculture. From southwestern Virginia come a few volumes of account books of the Abingdon Democrat, founded and edited by Leonidas Baugh during 1849-53.13 13. Cf. L. J. Cappon, Virginia Newspapers, 1821-1935, page 39. As postmaster during the "fifties he also acted as agent for newspapers and periodicals both in and outside the state; his book containing the list of subscribers to each paper and terms of payment, 1853-58, throws considerable light upon the reading population of Washington County. The business correspondence of the hotels at Sweet Chalybeate Springs, Va., and Sweet Springs, W. Va., in the Alleghanies, for the years 1895-96 and 1914-15 have been presented to the University; few records of this kind of economic enterprise, it may be asserted positively, have gravitated to any library. A shoemaker's account book from Albemarle County, 1859-60, has been added to the large collection of tradesmen's and merchants' original records. Through the co-operation of the clerks in a number of Virginia counties original state capitation tax lists for the past three years (or longer in a few cases) have been received from ten localities, and poll tax lists from fourteen.14 14. State capitation tax lists from Bath, Brunswick, Campbell, Grayson, Gloucester, Lynchburg (1908-10, 1925-28, 1931-35), Mecklenburg, Middlesex, Suffolk, and Wise. Poll tax lists from Amelia, Bedford, Clifton Forge, Craig, Culpeper, Cumberland, Isle of Wight, King George, Madison, Norfolk City, Roanoke City, Russell, Warren, and Warwick (1911-24, 1926-36). Some of the manuscript collections already on loan deposit have been enlarged by the transfer of additional material. Correspondence, legal papers, and maps have been added to the Anderson collection15 15. Cf. Second Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1931-32 (University, Va., 1932), page 4; Third Annual Report . . . 1932-33, page 4. from Rockbridge County; they provide detailed information on natural resources and attempts at industrial development in that section of the Valley of Virginia during the latter decades of the nineteenth century. The James Barbour Family papers16 16. Cf. Fifth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1934-35, page 6. in the Library have doubled in quantity by an additional deposit from Barboursville." The Berkeley Family, beginning with a small deposit of seventeenth and eighteenth papers, have steadily increased it during the past three years until it contains several thousand manuscripts spanning almost three centuries of this Virginia family from the first Edmund Berkeley. The LatanÃ© Family have placed on deposit some rare documents (1700-49) concerning the life of Parson Lewis LatanÃ© of Essex County,17 17. Lucy Temple LatanÃ©, Parson LatanÃ©, 1672-1732 (Charlottesville, Va., 1936), is based in part upon these manuscripts. including a letter to the vestry of South Farnham Parish from Alexander Spotswood (1716) rebuking them for their presumption in suspending the parson on their own authority. Two pocket diaries of Robert Larimer, Ohio Volunteer Infantry, kept during the Civil War, one on the Carolina coast in 1863 and the other in Richmond and vicinity in 1865, have been deposited along with a few miscellaneous papers concerning him. Photographic work with the Leica camera has expanded almost too rapidly for present facilities, and the technique of operation has been steadily perfected by Mr. John Cook Wyllie who is in charge. So vast are the potentialities of photographic reproduction in library work and so numerous the experiments for improving and standardizing the technique that the American Library Association devoted a full day to the discussion of microphotography at its annual conference in Richmond last May.18 18. Cf. American Library Association, Bulletin, XXX, no. 6 (June, 1936), page 494; also ibid., XXX, no. 2 (Feb., 1936), pages 80-88. The University Library now has a complete printing equipment in connection with the Leica camera. Even at low cost to faculty members, visiting and corresponding scholars, and occasional students, the photographic service is able to meet a large share of its expense. Most of the Library's own film copy is not printed since a projector, to be acquired in the near future, will be less expensive and equally satisfactory for most purposes. A number of manuscript records which were photographed deserve special mention. The four-volume diary of Captain Philip Slaughter (1758-1849), father of the minister and historian of the same name, is a unique, almost day by day commentary on farm life and business in Culpeper County with remarks about political and social events as they touched his own affairs during the period 1796-1848.19 19. Capt. Slaughter, a member of the Board of Commissioners who met at Rockfish Gap in August 1818 to determine the location of the University of Virginia, wrote a brief account of the meeting in his diary. Since the volumes are scattered among three of his descendants, the University's complete photographic copy is especially valuable. The first Minute Book of Mount Edd Baptist Church of Batesville, Albemarle County, tells of its founding in December 1823 and carries the record to 1843, with lists of white and colored members. The Council Minutes of Falmouth, Va., 1727-ca. 1870, include the only extant colonial record of this historic one-time port. An account book of "Carter's Grove" near Williamsburg, 1736-46 and 1773-78, is an interesting plantation record. A seven-volume set of Burwell store and farm account books, 1789-1870, from Millwood in Clarke County have been photographed for their value as a long-time record of business affected by trade with Maryland and Pennsylvania. A schoolmaster's account book from Sussex County reveals pointedly the dearth of cash at the end of the eighteenth century. The Library has also acquired photostatic copies of materials in other institutions or in private hands: Sir William Berkeley letters and documents, 1661-90, from the British Public Record Office through the courtesy of Dr. William E. Dodd, American Ambassador to Germany; a few pages from a Peter Jefferson account book in the Henry E. Huntington Library; Mary Washington's will, 1782, from the original in the clerk's office, Fredericksburg. Several unpublished histories of local Virginia churches have been copied; and among printed records photographed the Ordinances of the town of Suffolk, Va., 1858, should be mentioned. The Virginia Room and the Bureau of Public Administration of the University are co-operating in the preservation of Virginia state, city and county documents of all kinds, the older and rarer imprints being filed in the former collection; both departments have profited by exchanges with other institutions. It may not be inappropriate in this report to commend the fine work of the Bureau of Public Administration in obtaining the documents of other states, thereby improving the facilities for research in all the social sciences. It was the University's good fortune to secure again the services of Mr. W. Edwin Hemphill as acting archivist during the summer of 1936. He was also acting assistant state supervisor of the Historical Records Survey project under the WPA. He carried on the work with that thoroughness and understanding which we have come to anticipate in all that he undertakes. The Appendix to the present Annual Report, continuing the policy of publishing each year a list of original records of some Virginia agency or institution, as a cross-section of historical sources in the State, was prepared by Mr. Hemphill. Many generous and genuinely interested persons have contributed to the accomplishments of the past year and in expressing his appreciation the archivist is deeply conscious of the co-operative spirit so essential to the progress of this phase of the University's research program. This spirit is equally real within the University, especially between the Library and the Institute for Research in the Social Sciences, as indicated in Director Wilson Gee's brochure, A Decade of Organized Social Science Research at the University of Virginia, published just before the present report went to press. The archivist is especially indebted to Miss Elizabeth B. Parker of the Historical Records Survey, upon whom have fallen many of the burdens of the Richmond office in addition to her work as district supervisor. In conclusion, it is always a pleasure to express sincere thanks to Mr. Harry Clemons and the Library staff for their many favors. A postscript, dated September 15, is in order: news of the grant from the Public Works Administration which makes possible the Alderman Memorial Library of the University, ground to be broken this autumn. The University Library faces a new era of development. Lester J. Cappon, Archivist. 1 September 1936.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Appendix by W. Edwin Hemphill A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE UNPRINTED OFFICIAL RECORDS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Several years ago the Librarian of the University, in recognition of their value as historical sources, gathered for his files scanty information about the minutes of the University's general, academic, and departmental faculties. A suggestive fruit of that effort was the observation of a real need for a more comprehensive inventory of the University's recordsâa need which did not lack ample testimony in the experience of other University officials. Fortunately, the year 1936 has made possible such a survey, probably one of the first to be published by the more historic educational institutions in the United States. From the accompanying list one may determine quickly the period for which each kind of record has been preserved and its present location. Emphasis is given to the almost axiomatic worth of this bibliography when it is realized that Dr. Philip Alexander Bruce consulted only eight of the more important sets in the composition of his five-volume centennial history of the University. The first there divisions of the following list were compiled and edited by the Acting Archivist. Much of the spade work was done under his supervision during the summer months by WPA workers of the Historical Records Survey. The fourth section is almost exclusively a product of the Archivist; it was impossible to secure the data on student organizations until the opening of the fall quarter. It is necessary to state certain limitations within which this inventory was made. Comparatively speaking, there was obviously little justification for a bibliography of University publications and histories; thus the work was confined to manuscript, typescript, and mimeographed sources. The line of demarcation between official and unofficial records had to be drawn rather arbitrarily in a number of instances. In this manner was eliminated a wealth of manuscripts (of which the Jefferson, Cabell, Alderman, Gordon, and University collections deserve specific mention), broadsides, programs, examinations, student notebooks, and other materials housed in the Virginia Room, despite their official, or at least semi-official, nature and a widespread desire for a published calendar of these sources. It was felt that information concerning the current correspondence files of University officials could not be understandably organized for inclusion and could be of no value until they were definitely made available for research. Finally, though their records might be surprisingly extant and valuable in their portrayal of an influential phase of student life, no effort to list the historical sources of social and medical fraternities was attempted; but the investigation included nearly every honorary fraternity. If the list under Part IV appears incomplete, the explanation is the lack of continuity in many student organizations from year to year and the consequent failure to preserve any except current records. The contents of several of the records herein reported are, quite naturally, either partially or wholly confidential. Administrative approval of the project for making and publishing this inventory was asked and granted only under the express stipulation that no violation of trust should result from it. Thus it must be stated that access to each record can be granted only by the proper custodian. This survey affords opportunity for summarizing the extent of the University's own historical sources. Among the non-departmental records the three or four more significant sets are extant in unbroken series of volumes. But whatever efforts earlier University generations may have made to preserve their documents of lesser consequence were rewarded with only partial success: for within some items there are inexplicable gaps, and in too many cases only single volumes remain from what must have been at one time more copious records. The sections on University subdivisions and student organizations reflect plainly a basic decentralization, with which few would quarrel. Yet this characteristic may serve as a boomerang to destroy its own story. By a happy chance the completion of this survey coincides with preliminary preparation of the ground upon which the proposed Alderman Memorial Library will be erected. Thus it seems appropriate to point out the value of a more unified policy for future preservation, under adequate and favorable conditions, of records not in current use. The condensed form adopted for reporting vital data on these historical sources is almost self-explanatory. Titles are given exactly as they appear on the bindings. All numbering, lettering, and dating of volumes, if any, is recorded as an aid to easy identification of them. Roman numerals represent an editorial numbering of volumes. A date followed by a plus sign (+) indicates that the recording of that item began in that year and is still continuing. Brackets [] enclose information supplied by the editor. With more specific directions advisable only for the voluminous records housed in the Bursar's office, the following letters are used as symbols for the locations of the materials: B Bursar's Office C Custodian of the department's, organization's, or other subdivision's records P President's Office R Registrar's Office V Virginia Room of the Library Though it is self-evident that co-operation by each custodian of the records was indispensable, it should not go without saying that grateful acknowledgments are due to more than a score of persons for access and assistance. In return for special courtesies and patience specific thanks are given to Mr. E. I. Carruthers, Bursar; Miss Virginia Moran, Registrar; and Mr. John Cook Wyllie, Curator of the Virginia Collection. I. ADMINISTRATIVE Board of Visitors 1. [Minutes of the Board of Trustees], 1814-1817. 1 vol. Not indexed. B (central room, in safe). A copy, which may not be the official one but which has been adopted as such, of the minutes of the meetings of the Board of Trustees of Albemarle Academy. For other copies of these meetings cf. items 3, 4. 2. Minutes [of the] Board of Visitors, 1817+. 10 vols., numbered I-X. Index attached in front or back of each vol. B (central room, in safe): I. B (central room, east wall): II-X. Minutes of the meetings of the Boards of Visitors of Central College (1817-1819) and of the University of Virginia (1819+). The first vol. was apparently a personal record kept by Thomas Jefferson; pp. 1-105 of it cover in his handwriting all of the meetings prior to his death. In the absence of any better claimant, it has been adopted as the official copy of the minutes for that period. It was reprinted in the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Association's edition of his Writings, XIX. For other copies of the earlier minutes cf. items 1, 3, 4. 3. [Minutes of the Board of Visitors], 1814-1825. Folded sheaf of 150 pp. Not indexed. V. Copies of the minutes of the Board of Trustees of Albemarle Academy (1814-1817) and of the Board of Visitors of Central College (1817-1819) and of the University (1819-1825). Front page carries the initials "J. B."; this copy was probably presented to James Breckinridge. It was transcribed in the same hand as the major portion of the copy reported herein as item 4. 4. [Minutes of the Board of Visitors], 1814-1830. Sheaf of 250 pp. bound without covers. Not indexed. V. Copies of the minutes of the Board of Trustees of Albemarle Academy (1814-1817) and of the Board of Visitors of Central College (1817-1819) and of the University (1819-1830). Front page carries the initials "J. H. C."; this copy was presented to John H. Cocke. Until the first meeting after Jefferson's death the unidentified handwriting is that of the copy listed herein as item 3. This fact suggests that Jefferson may have had a number of copies transcribed from his own (cf. item 2) for the use of his associates in the building of the University. Bound with this copy, at its back, is a memorandum or report (n. d.), written in an unidentified hand, favoring the proposed appointment of a President of the University. 5.

There are also 15 wooden filing cases of cards and questionnaires, arranged alphabetically in one folder for each student, from which these catalogues were compiled; this file is practically complete for 1894-1904, covers 1884-1894 less completely, and contains occasional entries for 1825-1884. 30. University Administration, Catalogue Applications, 1900. 1 vol. Not indexed. V.

Original entries of business transactions of Central College (1817-1819) and of the University (1819-1851). Vol. I covers 1817-1822 and vol. II covers 1819-1828; but, despite the overlapping of dates, they are apparently the same type of record and presumably belong in the same series. 33. Proctor's Ledger, 1817-1832, 1859-1905. 47 vols.; IV lettered "C"; III, V-XLVII dated. Index attached in front of I, II, IV; index unattached in V-XLVII; not indexed, III. B (west room, west wall).

A daily record of all business transactions. 35. Receipt Book [for Subscriptions to the University], 1824. 1 vol. Not indexed. B (west room, south wall). Accounts of about 100 persons who had subscribed to an unknown fund for the University. The debit for each was dated April 30 or 31; it is interesting to note that as late as June 30, the date of latest entry, only a handful of payments had been credited to these accounts. For other contents of this vol. cf. item 36. 36. Receipt Book, 1825-1827. 1 vol. Not indexed. B (west room, south wall). Signed receipts demanded by the Proctor of persons to whom he made payments. For other contents of this vol. cf. item 35. 37. Students' Register, 1825-1905. 4 vols.; III dated. Not indexed. B (west room, west wall). Title varies: Matriculation Book, I, II; Register of Students, III; Students' Register, IV. Matriculation records probably kept by the Proctor, perhaps more in his capacity as a disciplinary officer than as a financial accountant. At the top of the pages is a pledge of intention to obey the University's laws, which the students signed below, giving typical matriculation information about themselves. This series is especially valuable as the largest repository of student signatures. It was abandoned when the Registrar's Matriculation Cards (item 25) came into use. For other matriculation records cf. items 17, 20, 24, 26. 38. Students Receipt Book [for Unsettled Accounts], 1865-1882. 1 vol. Not indexed. B (west room, west wall). Record of amounts overdue on student fees and of the notes by which these debts were covered.

Record of deductions from funds deposited by each student with the Patron. Vol. I includes expenditures for board and fuel, a record of fees paid to each professor, and a memo, dated July, 1833, of students' fines and assessments. Both vols. include notations of bills or orders presented for student purchases from local merchants for books, clothing, etc.; for in that day the Patron was custodian of the students' allowances and "pocket money". For other contents of vol. II cf. items 47, 72. 46. Patron's Ledger, 1833-1858. 27 vols.; dated. Index unattached in front or back of each vol. B (west room, west wall).
