      <field name="fulltext">ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. For admission to any department of the University the general conditions are the following: 1. Sufficient Age:âThe minimum legal age is sixteen years; the Faculty advises seventeen or more. Eighteen years is the minimum for admission to the Department of Law. 2. Good Character:âThis must be attested by a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended, or by other valid proof. 3. Adequate Preparation:âThis must be such as will enable the candidate to meet the requirements for admission to the several departments of the University, as detailed below. For admission to the Department of Graduate Studies, see page 12. For admission to the Department of Medicine, see page 11. For admission to the College, the Department of Law, or the Department of Engineering, the candidate must present a certificate or pass an equivalent examination. In either case the amount of preparation required is measured in terms of units. For a detailed description of the entrance units, see pp. 83-92 of the General Catalogue. A unit represents a year's study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year's work. This definition of a unit takes the four-year high-school course as a basis, and assumes that the length of the school year is from thirty-six to forty weeks, that a period is from forty to sixty minutes in length, and that the study is pursued for four or five periods a week; but under ordinary circumstances a satisfactory year's work in any subject can not be accomplished in less than one hundred and twenty hours, or their equivalent. Schools organized on any other than a four-year basis can, nevertheless, estimate their work in terms of this unit. For the requirements as to the number and selection of units for entrance to the three departments mentioned above, see, for the College, p. 9; for the Department of Law, p. 10; for the Department of Engineering, p. 11. SUBJECTS ACCEPTED FOR ADMISSION. The subjects accepted for admission and their values in units are gives below in tabulated form. Subject Topics Units English A Grammar and Grammatical Analysis 1 English B Composition and Rhetoric 1 English C Critical Study of Specimens of English Literature 1 English D History of English and American Literature 1 Mathematics A1 Algebra to Quadratic Equations 1 Mathematics A2 Quadratics, Progressions, and the Binomial Formula Â½ or 1 Mathematics B Plane Geometry 1 Mathematics C Solid Geometry Â½ Mathematics D Plane Trigonometry Â½ History A Greek and Roman History 1 History B MediÃ¦val and Modern European History 1 History C English History 1 History D American History and Civil Government 1 Latin A Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Latin B CÃ¦sar's Gallic War, I-IV; Grammar; Composition 1 Latin C Cicero's Orations (6); Grammar; Composition 1 Latin D Virgil's Ãneid, I-VI; Grammar; Composition 1 Greek A Elementary Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Greek B Xenophon's Anabasis, I-IV; Grammar; Composition 1 German A Elementary Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 German B Intermediate Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 German C Third-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 German D Fourth-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 French A Elementary Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 French B Intermediate Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 French C Third-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 French D Fourth-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Spanish A Elementary Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Spanish B Intermediate Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Spanish C Third-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Spanish D Fourth-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Science A Physical Geography 1 Science B Inorganic Chemistry 1 Science C Experimental Physics 1 Science D Botany Â½ Science E ZoÃ¶logy Â½ Science F Agriculture (special schools) 2 Drawing Mechanical and Projection Drawing 1 Shop-Work Wood-Work, Forging, and Machine-Work 1 ADMISSION BY CERTIFICATE. For admission by certificate the applicant should file with the Dean of the University not later than the first of September a Certificate of Preparation, made out on the blank form furnished by the University. This certificate must come from a recognized institution of collegiate rank, from an accredited public high school, or from an accredited private secondary school. The candidate for admission from a public high school must be a graduate of an accredited four-year high school. The candidate for admission from a private secondary school must be a graduate of the school, or must present a certificate showing that he has had at least the equivalent of four years of satisfactory high-school work of standard grade. In every case the candidate for admission must have the recommendation of the principal of the certifying school. Schools in Virginia are accredited by the Faculty of this university after inspection and report by a committee of the Faculty (see pages 14-18). The Dean of the University is further authorized to accept certificates from schools outside Virginia, accredited by their own State Universities or institutions of equal rank, provided the courses of study offered in such schools meet the requirements demanded of accredited schools in this State. If in any accredited school the number of periods given to a study, or the length of the period, is below the specified standard, the credit for such subject is reduced pro rata. In the science subjects only half-credit is allowed unless individual laboratory notebooks, properly attested by the teacher in charge, are filed with the certificate. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must in all cases take the entrance examinations. ADMISSION BY EXAMINATION. For admission by examination the candidate must present himself at the University in June or in September, according to the dates given in the Program of Entrance Examinations. The examinations are held under the honor system, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge. All candidates who take their examinations at the times appointed are tested free of charge. In case of delayed entrance, where the grounds of postponement are good, the President of the University may admit the candidate to a special examination, for which a fee of five dollars is charged. This fee is payable in advance and is in no case returned. PROGRAM OF ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS. June, 1916 9-11 A. M. 11-1 A. M. 3-5 P. M. Sept., 1916 Botany Mon. 5 ZoÃ¶logy Phys. Geog.

C and D Sat. 10 Latin A Latin C Latin D Sat. 16 Latin B German C English D For admission to the College the candidate should possess an amount of preparation which is at least the equivalent of that represented by four years of successful work in an accredited school. He must offer fourteen units, of which three must be in English, two and one-half in Mathematics, and one in History. The remaining seven and one-half units may be selected at will from the list on page 7, unless the candidate expects to apply for a baccalaureate degree. In that case he should offer, if he is an applicant for the degree of Bachelor of Arts, four units in Latin or two units in Greek; if he is an applicant for the degree of Bachelor of Science, four units in two modern languages (French, German, Spanish). Advanced standing is given to any candidate who, in addition to meeting the minimum requirements for entrance above stated, can show by passing an examination that he has done work equivalent to that covered by any of the following courses offered in the College: Latin A1, Greek A1, English Literature A1, English Literature A2, Mathematics A1, Mathematics A2. Such a candidate will be admitted to the corresponding B course, and upon his successful completion of the same will be entitled to count toward a baccalaureate degree the credit value of both the A and the B courses in question. The examinations for advanced standing are set at some time during the first month of the session. Candidates who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students, and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the College a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. This certificate must be acceptable both to the Dean and to the professors in charge of the courses accredited. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college, must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate, and must give his grades, which should in no case fall below the standard of seventy-five per cent. The final validation of such certificates is effected by the successful completion of the courses taken in this university In no case will credit be given on more than forty-five session-hours of work done elsewhere, and any candidate who receives this maximum amount of credit can count among the remaining fifteen session-hours required for his degree only the credit value of the courses he has passed as a resident student in the College, exclusive of any credit for work done in the Summer School or in any of the professional departments. In every case the candidate must spend at least one regular session exclusively in college work in this university. A candidate for entrance who cannot offer fourteen units may be admitted with conditions on any two units except English A and B. All conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the session following initial registration. This may be done by private study or by taking courses in the University or in the Summer School. But no course taken to remove a condition may be counted as part of the work credited toward a degree. No conditioned student may be later registered as a special student. A candidate may be admitted as a special student without fulfilling the entrance requirements above specified, provided he is more than twenty years old on the day of registration and gives adequate evidence of serious purpose and of the training needed to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for a degree; but such students are permitted and encouraged to make up their deficiencies by private study or by taking courses in the University or in the Summer School. They will then be admitted as regular students, and may be accepted as applicants for degrees provided all entrance requirements are met at least one academic year before the date of graduation. For admission to the Department of Law the candidate must offer fourteen units, selected at will. By special action of the Law Faculty an applicant who is at least 23 years old, and who presents proper evidence of good character, and of needful maturity and training, though unable to fulfill the foregoing entrance requirements, may, in exceptional cases, be admitted as a special student, and not as a candidate for the degree. When so admitted, such special student may qualify as a regular student, and as a candidate for the degree, by fulfilling the entrance requirements before the beginning of the second year of his work in the Law School, and not afterwards. Every applicant for admission as a special student shall make written application to the Dean of the University, on a blank furnished for the purpose, with detailed information as to his age, general habits, his educational and business experience, and his general fitness to undertake the study of law. Such application, together with such testimonials as may be required, must be filed with the Dean of the University not later than August 1 of the year in which the applicant desires to enter the Law School. In rare instances, and for good cause shown, the requirement as to the time of filing such application may be waived. Every such applicant for admission as a special student must pass a satisfactory examination, to be held at the University on the first registration day of the session This examination, which will be conducted by a committee of the Law Faculty, will include the subjects of English, American and English History, and Civil Government. For admission to the Department of Engineering the candidate must offer fourteen units, which must include English A, B, C, Mathematics A1, A2, B, C, D, and one unit of History. The remaining six units are elective. A candidate may be admitted as a Conditioned Student in spite of some deficiencies, provided these are not such as will impair the integrity of his work. But no such candidate will be conditioned except upon subjects actually taught in this university, nor will any candidate be conditioned on more than two units; and all conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the next session after initial registration. Courses taken for the removal of entrance conditions may in no case be counted as part of the work credited for any degree. No conditions will be allowed in English A, or B, or in Mathematics A1, A2, or B. A candidate may be admitted as a Special Student, without formal examination, provided he is more than twenty years old, and gives evidence of serious purpose and of fitness to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for any degree. No conditioned student may register later as a special student. Requirements for Admission to the Department of Medicine, Session 1916-1917.âApplicants for admission to the Department of Medicine are required to present the diploma of a recognized institution of collegiate rank; or a certificate of good standing in such an institution; or the diploma of a recognized public or private high school having a four years' course, or acceptable certificates which represent work equivalent in amount and character to such a high-school course; and, in addition, to present evidence of the completion of at least one year's work in Inorganic (General) Chemistry, Physics, and Biology, at an approved institution of collegiate rank. Candidates for admission will be required also to present satisfactory evidence of a reading knowledge of at least one modern language besides English, preferably German; this requirement may be satisfied either by the presentation of certificates showing the completion of one year of college work following upon two years of high-school work in the same language or by an examination which will test the candidate's reading knowledge of the language. The completion of a year's work in ZoÃ¶logy or Botany will be accepted as satisfying the requirements in Biology. A student may be admitted conditioned on any one of the above subjects except Chemistry, this condition to be removed before entering on the work of the second year. The requirement in Biology may be waived in the case of graduates of approved colleges and universities. The number of students in the first-year class is limited to thirty-six. Further information concerning the character of these requirements and forms for certificates may be obtained by addressing the Dean of the Department of Medicine, or Mr. Howard Winston, Registrar, at the University. Requirements for Admission to the Department of Medicine beginning with the Session 1917-18.âApplicants for admission to the Department of Medicine are required to furnish evidence of the completion of a four-year course at a recognized public or private high school, or acceptable certificates which represent work equivalent in amount and character to such a high-school course, and, in addition, to present evidence of the completion at an approved institution of collegiate rank of two years of work of not less than fifteen session-hours each. This college course must include a year's work in each of the following subjects: English (rhetoric, composition, and literature), mathematics (solid geometry and trigonometry), inorganic (general) chemistry, physics, biology, and either German or French. A session-hour is one hour a week throughout the session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week throughout the session of laboratory work. A student otherwise qualified may be admitted conditioned upon one of these subjects, the condition to be removed before admission to the second year of the medical course; but no condition may be allowed in chemistry, English, or mathematics. The modern language (German or French) course must be based upon two years of high-school work in that language or its equivalent; but a candidate may absolve the requirement in this subject by demonstrating on examination the possession of a satisfactory reading knowledge thereof. A year's work in either general biology, zoÃ¶logy, or botany, will be regarded as satisfying the requirement in biology. ZoÃ¶logy is considered preferable to botany; and it is desirable that the course should include the dissection of a mammal. For admission to the Department of Graduate Studies the candidate must have a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank; or, in case the institution he attended does not confer such a degree, he must present a certificate of graduation in a course of study accepted by the Academic Faculty as fully equivalent to that ordinarily required for the degree in question. In order to be recognized as an applicant for a Master's or Doctor's degree, any candidate who has not received a baccalaureate degree from this university must secure from the Registrar of the University a blank form, which, when properly filled out, he must file with the Dean of this department, together with a catalogue of the institution from which he graduated. If that institution has (1) a faculty of at least six professors giving their full time to college or university work; (2) entrance requirements equal to those of this university, and (3) a course of four full years in the liberal arts and sciences, the candidate will not be required to take any undergraduate courses except such as the Committee on Rules and Courses or the professors in charge of the graduate courses he elects may consider necessary for the successful prosecution of those courses. If, however, the institution in question does not meet the three conditions mentioned above, the candidate's preparation will be carefully considered by the Committee on Rules and Courses, which will prescribe such undergraduate courses as are deemed necessary to supply his deficiencies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACCREDITED SCHOOLS ACCREDITED SCHOOLS. Conditions for the Accrediting of Schools.âA school desiring to be placed on the accredited list of the University should apply to the Chairman of the Committee on Accredited Schools. In response to the application, a blank form inquiring into the course of study, faculty, etc., of the school will be sent to the principal. Upon the return of this blank, properly filled out, a representative of the University will be sent to inspect the school, and to report on such matters as the quality of instruction, the general intellectual and moral tone of the school, and the efficiency of the equipment, especially library and laboratory facilities. If his report is favorable and the Committee concurs, the school will be accepted and the principal duly notified. The name of the school will be entered upon the list of accredited schools and published in the catalogue of the University. Each school must meet the following requirements: (1) A course of study covering not less than four years of high-school work, based on at least seven years of competent elementary instruction, and embracing at least sixteen units as defined on pages 83-92. These sixteen units must include English A, B, C, Mathematics A1, A2, B, and one unit of History. Those schools which wish to prepare students for the study of Latin in the University must offer instruction in this subject to the extent of four units. (2) A teaching force of not less than three teachers, each of whom devotes his entire time to high-school instruction, and conducts not more than seven recitation periods a day. The University will scrutinize with extreme care any school in which any instructor teaches more than six periods a day. All teachers should possess college training, and preference will be given to those schools in which the teachers are college graduates. List of Accredited Schools.âThe following is a list of the schools within the State of Virginia at present accredited by the University. This list is revised annually by the Committee, and any school which fails to report to the Committee when requested to do so, or which fails to maintain the standard above specified, may be removed therefrom.

      <field name="fulltext">REGULATIONS REGULATIONS. REGISTRATION. Registration of New Students.âApplicants seeking admission to the University for the first time must present themselves to the Dean of the University at some time during the first three days of the session. Each candidate who satisfies the requirements for admission set forth on pp. 6-13 will be directed to the dean of the department which he proposes to enter. The dean in question will, upon being satisfied that the candidate is fitted to enter upon the work of the department, issue to him a card containing the names of the courses which the candidate proposes to pursue during the session; this card must be presented in turn to each professor concerned, who will, on satisfying himself that the applicant is prepared to pursue with profit the course in question, sign the card, and enter the applicant's name upon the roll of the course. The card must then be returned to the Dean of the University, who will endorse upon it the amount of fees to be paid to the Bursar. On payment of these fees the registration of the applicant as a student of the University will be completed. Delayed Registration.âAny student who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session will be admitted to registration only provided the President considers the delay adequately explained, and will be charged a delayed registration fee of three dollars. REGULATIONS RESIDENCE AND ATTENDANCE. The Academic Year begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September and continues for thirty-nine weeks. Thanksgiving Day and Jefferson Day are holidays, and there is a Christmas recess beginning on the morning of the twenty-fourth of December and closing on the evening of the second of January. Attendance is required of each student throughout the entire session with the exception of holidays, unless he has received permission to be temporarily absent, or to withdraw before its close. Leave of absence is granted by the deans for sufficient reason. While in residence each student is required to attend regularly all lectures and other prescribed exercises and all examinations in the courses which he pursues. Absence from the University is permitted upon the written leave of the dean of the department in which the student is registered, and must in every case be obtained in advance. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or musical clubs on excursions will not be granted except to the officers and members of these organizations. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the student's professors and of the Dean of the University. When a permit is granted upon the University Physician's certificate that withdrawal is necessary on account of ill health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct, the fees are returned pro rata. Under no other circumstances will there be a return of fees. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the several department faculties for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. Absence from Examinations.âWritten examinations are an essential part of the work of every course in the University, and attendance upon them is required of every student. Absence may be excused only on the ground of sickness or other providential cause which may be approved by the several faculties of the University under the regulations of their respective departments. Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the Honor System, and an unpledged paper is counted as a total failure. In matters of class standing as well, students are expected to regard themselves as governed by the law of honor. REGULATIONS CONDUCT. The laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or not. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University for the residue of the current session any student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The keeping of dogs by students within the University grounds is forbidden. Prohibition of Credit.âAn act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting minor students. The license to contract debts, which the President is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity. DORMITORY AND BOARD. Dormitory.âStudents may reside in the university dormitories, in their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. The President will withdraw from the approved list any house in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Any change of residence during the session should be reported at the office of the Registrar. For rules governing the rental and occupancy of university dormitories, and the rates charged for the same, see pages 27-29. For list of private lodging-houses, with rates, apply to the Registrar. Board.âStudents may board at the University Commons, at their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. For the cost of board at the Commons, see p. 27. For list of private boarding-houses, with rates, apply to the Registrar. MEDICAL ATTENDANCE AND PHYSICAL TRAINING. Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the University Physician; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for his maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, treatment of the eye, ear, nose, and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated REGULATIONS by severe illness of students, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Students who take the responsibility of boarding at houses not approved by the Board of Health forfeit the right of medical attendance. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the University Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. Physical Training.âNo student is permitted to undertake an amount of work greater than he may reasonably be expected to do well without detriment to his health; and every student is advised to take a due amount of daily outdoor exercise, for which ample opportunities are afforded by the athletic fields, the tennis courts, the golf course, and elsewhere; and, in addition, to make systematic use of the facilities afforded without cost for definite and judicious physical training at the Fayerweather Gymnasium under the advice and instruction of the Director and his assistants.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EXPENSES EXPENSES. The university fee, tuition and laboratory fees, the contingent deposit, rents of rooms in the university buildings, and charges for service in the same, are payable upon entrance. Under special conditions the President is authorized to allow credit, but these deferred payments are in all cases to be properly secured. Students permitted to register during a term are required to pay the full fees for that term. Under no circumstances will there be a return of fees except upon certificate from the University Physician that withdrawal from the University is necessary on account of ill health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct. Upon receipt of the University Physician's certificate, the President will return the fees pro rata. A student's necessary expenses are as follows: I. University Charges, which are the same for all students, except Virginians in the College, the Department of Graduate Studies, and the Department of Engineering; II. Department Fees, which depend upon the course of study pursued; III. Board and Lodging, the cost of which varies according to the degree of economy the student is inclined to practice. I. UNIVERSITY CHARGES. Under the first head are included (a) the university fee, $40 ($10 for Virginians in the Academic Departments, $20 for Virginians in the Department of Engineering), and (b) the contingent deposit, $10; as well as (c) certain special fees which may or may not be incurred, namely: 1. The special entrance examination fee of five dollars, 2. The delayed registration fee of three dollars, 3. The re-examination fee of five dollars. (a) The university fee goes to the fund intended to defray the general expenses of the University. Payment of this fee entitles the student, without additional charge, to the use of the Library; to the privileges of the Gymnasium, with baths, private lockers, etc., and the advice and aid of the Instructor in Physical Culture; and to free medical attendance by the University Physician in case of illness (see page 21). It also covers all regular examination and diploma fees. (b) The contingent deposit is intended to cover any damage to university property for which the student is responsible, and any fines incurred by violating the rules of the Library. It is returned at the end of the session, less any charges that may have been made against it. EXPENSES From this deposit there will be deducted the sum of $2 for the support of the chapel services and general religious work of the University, unless within one month after registration the student shall request the Bursar not to deduct this amount. It will be observed that this sum (which is less than the average contribution made by the students who have subscribed to the chapel fund in past years) is not a necessary expense, as the support of the religious work of the University is entirely optional. This method of collection is intended merely as a substitute for the canvass formerly made, and it is the desire of the Faculty that the students thus unite with them in maintaining the religious work of the University. (c) 1. The special entrance examination fee of five dollars is required of any candidate admitted to a special entrance examination, under the provision set forth on page 8. 2. The delayed registration fee of three dollars is required of any student who fails to register promptly at the beginning of the session or after the Christmas recess, under the provisions set forth on page 19. 3. The re-examination fee of five dollars is required of any student admitted to re-examination. II. DEPARTMENT FEES. Under this head are comprised the charges for instruction, which include the tuition fee, and laboratory fees. As these differ in different departments, they are set forth below in tabular form, and for the sake of convenience the university charges above specified are grouped with them. Students from Virginia.âIn accordance with the statute (Virginia Code 1887, Ch. 68, Sec. 1554), the University remits to Virginia students in the Academic Departments the tuition fee (except in Analytical Chemistry) and all but $10 of the university fee, and to Virginia students in the Department of Engineering the tuition fee in those courses (except Analytical Chemistry) which are also offered in the College, and one-half the university fee. In order to be considered a Virginia student, it is necessary that the applicant's parents be domiciled in the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; if he has attained his majority, it is necessary that he himself be domiciled here. One is domiciled in the State who is living in it at the time the application is made and has no intention of removing therefrom in the future, or who, though absent from the State, has not lost his former domicile by acquiring one elsewhere. No other person can honestly avail himself of this privilege. White Male Teachers and Superintendents of the Public Schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Academic Schools of the University without payment of fees (except those charged in laboratory courses), upon presentation of certificates EXPENSES that they have been teachers in the public schools of the State during the year. At the beginning of the third term any of the following courses may be entered upon with profit by an applicant prepared for them: Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, Italian, German, English, English Literature and Rhetoric, Biblical History and Literature, Public Speaking, History, Economics, Political Science, Education, Philosophy, Mathematics, Astronomy, Physics, Chemistry, Industrial Chemistry, Geology, Biology, Botany, and ZoÃ¶logy. Special courses for teachers will be offered in English and Mathematics, and perhaps in several other subjects during the approaching spring term, if the demand for them is sufficient. Applicants for admission as teachers are required to send in their names to the President of the University not later than March fifth. Ministerial Students.âMinisters of the gospel may attend any of the Academic Schools of the University without payment of the tuition fee. The same privilege will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet without aid the expense of an education at the University.

Courses in Analytical Chemistry: The courses in Analytical Chemistry, being professional courses, are not provided for by the regular department fees in the Academic Departments, nor are they included among the courses in which free tuition is given to Virginians and other privileged students. The fees for each course in Analytical Chemistry are: Tuition $40 Laboratory 10 Apparatus (contingent) 10 (for two courses, $15) $60 Students from other states than Virginia taking one or both courses in Analytical Chemistry in connection with other courses in the College or the Department of Graduate Studies pay a total tuition fee of $100. D. Department of Law: University Fee $ 40 Tuition Fee 100 Contingent Fee 10 $150 Students taking an irregular course pay for tuition according to the relation which the amount of work taken bears to the regular course. For such course the tuition fee may be estimated approximately in dollars as three-tenths of the total number of lecture periods. EXPENSES E. Department of Medicine: University Fee $ 40 Tuition Fee 100 Contingent Fee 10 $150 Students taking courses in Organic and Physiological Chemistry are required to deposit, in addition to the charges above stated, $10 as a contingent laboratory fee.

For courses in Analytical Chemistry, see above. Virginians are relieved of tuition in collegiate courses. The fee for each technical lecture course is $30; for each practice course in Drawing, $15; for each laboratory or practice course in Applied Mechanics, Engineering, Shop-Work, or Field-Work, $5. These fees include all charges for laboratory materials, but the student is held further responsible for breakage. III. BOARD AND LODGING. A student may rent a room in one of the university dormitories, and take his meals either in the University Commons or in an approved private boarding-house; or he may take both room and board in such boardinghouse, in which case he pays no room-rent or servant-hire to the University. A list of private boarding- and lodging-houses, with rates, may be had upon application to the Registrar. The University Commons. This building, conveniently situated near the center of the University, provides an attractive dining hall, with accommodations for seating more than two hundred and fifty students at one time. Board is now furnished at $16.50 per month, and it is hoped that it will be possible to continue this rate. University Dormitories. Rules.âThe rules governing the rental and occupancy of rooms in the university dormitories are as follows: EXPENSES Students desiring rooms should apply to the Bursar, enclosing the reservation fee of $5, which will be returned should there be no room to let. The occupant of a room may reserve it for the next session, by applying to the Bursar, and depositing $5 (which is in no case returnable), not later than May first. The balance of the rent must be paid not later than the first registration day of the session, otherwise such preference or other right shall be forfeited. No room may be sublet. Two students may occupy a room together, each paying half of the rent. Rates.âAll rooms are unfurnished. For a single room furniture can be secured from the local dealers at a minimum cost of $15 for the session. All rooms are provided with either steam or hot-water heat, electric light, and janitor service, except where otherwise specified. The rooms on East and West Lawn (with the exception of Bachelor's Row), East and West Range, and Dawson's Row, are commodious, and are frequently occupied by two students. The rates given below are for the session of nine months. Randall Building. The rooms in this building are assigned only to students taking board at the University Commons, and any student occupying one of these rooms, who fails to remain at the Commons until the end of the session, will be required to vacate the same. The single rooms are 10 Ã 14, 10 Ã 15, 10 Ã 16. The double rooms are 14 Ã 15, 15 Ã 15, 15 Ã 17. The study is 9â² 6â³ Ã 11â² 6â³. No janitor service is provided. Single rooms (32) $35.00 Double rooms (9) 40.00 Double room with study (1) 50.00 East Range. Rooms in old gymnasium building (8) $60.00 Other rooms (26) 72.00 West Range. Rooms, no heat, but provided with grate (4) $60.00 Other rooms (20) 72.00 East and West Lawns. Rooms in Bachelor's Row (9) $70.00 Other rooms (27) 75.00 Dawson's Row. Rooms (56) $75.00 EXPENSES Dawson's Row comprises seven detached 8-room houses, water closet in each house, lavatory with running water in each room. Bath house with shower is provided for the row. APPROXIMATE SUMMARY OF ALL EXPENSES. The figures in the following tables may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of nine months. As necessary expenses are reckoned here university and tuition fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. For each department three estimates are given,â a low, an average, and a liberal, estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundry,âin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. By sharing a room with another student, and by practicing the strictest economy, a student's expenses may possibly be reduced below the low estimate. A. ESTIMATE OF NECESSARY EXPENSES IN THE COLLEGE.

While it is difficult for any student to be assured of remunerative work before he reaches the University, information as to such employment may be had from the Secretary of the Committee on Student Self-Help, Madison Hall.
