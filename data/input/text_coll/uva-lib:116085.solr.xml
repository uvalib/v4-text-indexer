The Summer Quarter of the University is an integral part of the University Year, the Courses in the College of Arts and Sciences being the same in character method and in credit value as in the other quarters. In the Department of Education many professional courses for Elementary and high school teachers which are not offered in the regular session are given to meet certificate requirements. The Summer Quarter is divided into two terms for the accommodation of those who can give only six weeks to the work but who desire University credit. The First Term will begin June 20th, and will close July 30th, with lectures five times a week. The Second Term will begin August 1st, and will close September 3rd, with six lectures a week. Students may enter for either term or both. A separate registration card must be filled out for each Term. The normal amount of work for college credit which a student may take, is three courses; but in a few exceptional cases, by special permission of the Dean and the approval of the instructors in all the courses taken, permission may be obtained to take four courses. In all cases an additional fee of $5.00 will be charged for each extra advanced course, and $3.00 for each extra elementary course. The University of Virginia Summer Quarter is conducted for teachers and students in high schools, academies and colleges and for those who desire professional training for primary and grammar grade work. It also offers many courses for college credit, and others to meet the needs of students preparing for college entrance or who have conditions to absolve. It takes as its peculiar province, not the ordinary summer institute, but the solid and substantial training of high school teachers, college teachers, college students, and teachers of any grade who wish to procure professional work. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS.âThere are no formal examinations for admission to the Summer Quarter. Students, both men and women, will be admitted to such courses as the respective instructors find them qualified to pursue with advantage. If a student wishes regular admission with a view to taking a degree, and does not expect to register in the regular session of the University, he should present a full statement with, as far as possible, official credentials of all work which he has done in high school or college. These credentials should be sent in advance to the Dean of the Summer Quarter. Suitable blank forms will be furnished upon request. LOCATION.âCharlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The sanitary arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about six hundred and fifty feet above sea level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete. The average monthly mean temperature from 1901 to 1911, taken from the records of the weather station at the University Observatory, was: June, 71.4; July, 76.8. There are three golf links, a well-conducted country club and many other attractions for summer visitors. EXCURSIONS.âUnder the directorship of a competent guide, there will be excursions to neighboring points of interest such as Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson; the Natural Bridge; Luray Caverns; the Grottoes of the Shenandoah; the battle fields in Virginia; and any other points to which a sufficiently large number may care to go. The proximity to Washington and Richmond and Old Point Comfort (three hours' ride to each) should make a visit exceptionally interesting. On designated clear nights parties will leave Cabell Hall at 8 o'clock to visit the McCormick Astronomical Observatory, where they will be shown the stars through the large telescope in the Observatory. ENTERTAINMENTS, AND LECTURES.âA Musical Festival and other entertainments will be announced during the session of the Summer Quarter. The whole course includes about twenty numbers and the price of a season ticket is low, making the cost about the same as moving pictures. Among the attractions already engaged are The Salzedo Harp Ensemble; Reinald Werrenrath, noted Baritone; Irma Seydel, Violinist; The Devereux Players; Alma Clayburgh, soprano; Frank McEntee Players. BOARD AND ROOMS.âBoard and room may be had at prices ranging from $7.00 per week, where several stay in the same room, upward, according to accommodation and proximity to the University, the average being $7.00 to $9.00 per week. Most of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the University grounds. The University Cafeteria furnishes excellent fare at most reasonable prices. The average cost per month during the regular session has been $22.00. Since prices have come down it is expected that students in the summer will be able to obtain their meals at from $18.00 to $20.00 per month. One hundred single furnished rooms and one hundred and twenty-five furnished double rooms in the University dormitories will be reserved in the order of application. The price for each term will be $7.00 for the full term of six weeks for a single room, and $10.00 for a double room. All checks for rooms should be made payable to E. I. Carruthers, Bursar. Every double room must be occupied by two persons. No reduction will be made for parts of a term. Applications for rooms must be accompanied with the full amount of the fee, which will be returned for good reason and room released if application is made before June 10th. No rooms will be rented to any person who does not register and pay the fee in the Summer Quarter. Rooms that are reserved will not be held later than July 1st. No room will be open for occupancy before June 19th. Roomers must provide themselves with necessary bed clothes, towels, etc. Rooms will be in charge of Mrs. C. B. Thomas, an experienced matron and chaperon. Some members of the faculty will be located in each set of dormitories. No cooking allowed in rooms. Several houses on Dawson's Row will be reserved for men. The location of these dormitories in the University grounds and the social advantages resulting from bringing so many teachers close together make this arrangement a very desirable one and the rooms are eagerly sought. UNIVERSITY CAFETERIA.âThe University Cafeteria, conducted by Mrs. Josie W. Rodes, will be open for summer students and will provide table board for three hundred and fifty persons at very low prices. It is estimated that excellent meals may be had there at from $18.00 to $20.00 per month. Application for dormitory rooms should be sent promptly with retaining fee. For list of boarding houses, rates, etc., see page 00, or write to Secretary Summer Quarter, Box 149, University, Virginia. FEES FOR VIRGINIA TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.âTuition is entirely free to all Virginia teachers in all the regular courses, both elementary and advanced, leading to the professional certificates. No student, however, will be permitted to take more than three advanced courses or four elementary courses without the payment of $5.00 for each additional advanced course and $3.00 for each extra elementary course. To meet local expenses the State Board of Education has fixed a registration fee of $1.50 for a six weeks' term for all of the Summer Schools of the State, and this fee will be charged here. There are a few special courses offered to meet certain demands but not necessary for certificate credit, for which fees will be charged to all who take them. The fee for each is designated in the catalogue. Small fees in laboratory courses will also be charged all students who register in them. Students from Virginia who are not teachers or definitely preparing to teach next session will be charged the same tuition as nonVirginia students. Teachers whose residence is in Virginia but who are teaching outside of Virginia will be charged the same fee as non-Virginians. FEES FOR NON-VIRGINIA STUDENTS.âA single registration fee of fifteen dollars for each term will be charged each student who registers from outside of Virginia. This fee will entitle the student to enter any of the courses outlined in the catalogue (except a few special courses which are so designated). No student, however, will be permitted to take more than three advanced courses or four elementary courses without special permission in writing from all instructors concerned and the Dean and without paying a fee of $5.00 for each extra advanced course, or $3.00 for each elementary course. Note.âTeachers outside of Virginia are not limited in the choice of their courses to the regulations under which Virginia certificates are issued, unless they desire to teach in Virginia and apply for a license issued in this State. In this case only State certificates from other states issued by a State Superintendent or a State Board of Examiners, and approved in advance by the Department of Public Instruction of Virginia, will be recognized as a proper basis for professional credit. Teachers from other states will receive credit for all work done in accordance with the certificate regulations of those States from which they come. Most Southern States accept the work of the University Summer Quarter for certificate credit or renewal. Medical Fee.âA small medical fee of 50 cents will be charged each person who registers each term, which will entitle him or her to free medical attendance by Dr. W. E. Bray, the Physician of the Summer Quarter, hospital phone, 548; residence phone, 565; office hours at the hospital 11:30 to 12:30 and 4:30 to 5:00. Greatly reduced charges, if it should be necessary, will be given at the University Hospital, under the following regulations: The same arrangement may be made for the second term. Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the Summer School Physician; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, and for special treatment of the eye, ear, nose, and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of students, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the Summer Quarter Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. TIME AND PLACE OF RECITATIONS AND LECTURES.â Recitations will begin in all courses Tuesday, June 21st, at 8:30 a. m. There will be no classes on Saturdays in the first term except on June 25th, and July 9th, when classes will meet at the usual hours to make up for registration and examination days. The length of recitation periods will be one hour, ten minutes of which will be allowed for transfer from one room to another. DAILY GENERAL ASSEMBLY.âDaily from 11:30 to 12:20 there will be a period in which the students may have the privilege of attending a gathering of the entire body. At this time there will be devotional exercises, music, short addresses on timely topics by prominent speakers invited for this purpose, or some other interesting exercise. SUNDAY VESPER SERVICES.âExperience has shown that no Sunday service held here during the summer has been more attractive or more appreciated than what has sometimes been called the Sunset Service. Holding this service at this hour enables all the faculty and the students of the summer school to unite in one common service without at all interfering with their attending the churches of their choice in the city. The service, which is always kept within one hour, begins at seven o'clock. When weather permits, the service is held out of doors on the North Rotunda steps. Otherwise in Cabell Hall. REGISTRATION.âMonday, June 20th, will be devoted to the registration of students. All students who can possibly do so should register on this day. Those who fail to register before June 21st, will be permitted to attend classes and register as promptly as possible at other hours. The Registrar's office, located in Peabody Hall, will be open continuously from 8:30 a. m. to 5:00 p. m. Students should consult freely with members of the Faculty in case of difficulty in choosing courses. No certificate will be granted to students who fail to register before Tuesday, June 28th, except a certificate of attendance. No student will be enrolled in any course without a registration card naming the course in question and properly signed by the Registrar and the Bursar. THE GENERAL LIBRARY.âThe General Library is open to the corps of instructors and the students of the Summer Quarter, from 9 a. m. to 1:30 p. m.; 3 to 5, and from 7:30 to 10 p. m. The collection contains about seventy thousand volumes. All books withdrawn from the library must be charged at the desk. Usually books are lent for one week but there are exceptions, and the loan expires on the date stamped in the book. Prompt return not later than the date on which the loan expires is expected and borrowers will be fined ten cents for each day delinquent. Students are expected to give prompt attention to all communications from the librarian. REST AND STUDY ROOMS.âMadison Hall, the beautiful building of the Young Men's Christian Association, and during the summer session headquarters for the Y. W. C. A., will be open to students and Faculty of the Summer Quarter, from nine o'clock in the morning until ten at night. Students will have access to the current periodicals in the reading room. The other rooms will be used for rest, for study, for recreation, and for social gatherings. North of the building there are nineteen tennis courts which will be equipped for the use of the students. THE YOUNG WOMEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. The program of the Y. W. C. A. in a summer school is most elastic for its great aim is to fit into an already packed six weeks of work by serving wherever it is most needed. Whether the demands are for recreationâparties, games, tournaments, hikes, etc.,âor for opportunities for spiritual growthâby Bible classes or meetingsâthe Y. W. C. A. strives to meet the needs. Sometimes the requests of the student for spiritual growth calls into existence Bible classes where, under strong leadership, the principles of religion and life are discussed. Sometimes, a desire for corporate worship is expressed, and the vesper service meets the need. The Y. W. C. A. Secretary is on the campus to look after the "activities" of the Association, but better still, she is there as a friend for every student. The Y. W. C. A. building (Madison Hall) is of value only as it is of serviceâwhether through its reading room, as a social center, or as an information bureau. The desire of the Y. W. C. A. is that every woman in attendance during the Summer Quarter may find something she needs or wants from the Y. W. C. A. The Secretary in charge will be Miss Elsie B. Heller, Student Secretary of the South Atlantic Field Committee of the Y. W. C. A. She and her assistant request the co-operation of all and invite each student to make the Y. W. C. A. her "home" while at the University. STUDENTS' MAIL.âIn order to insure safe and prompt delivery of mail, every student should have all mail directed to, University, Virginia, giving always the street and number of his or her boarding place or the number and location of his or her room in the University. The local address should be filed at the post office promptly upon arrival. TEACHERS' POSITIONS.âThe University Appointment Committee receives demands for teachers each year. This committee is glad to have well qualified teachers who are in attendance upon the Summer Quarter file their applications. There is no charge for this service. THE SUMMER SCHOOL NEWS.âThe News is a college newspaper, edited and managed by students of the Summer Quarter. It contains all official and student organization announcements, campus news and notes, editorial comment, etc. Its object is to acquaint individuals with the life of the whole student body, and to unify the interests of all. REGULATIONS CONCERNING CREDIT.âThe instructor giving each course will keep the class grades and attendance, hold the examination, and average the class grade with the examination grade, returning to the Dean of the Summer Quarter the general average grade of each student in each course. Absences or delayed entrance will be counted against the student. All examinations must be held under the Honor System. A certificate for each course completed with an average grade of 75 per cent will be signed by the instructor and the Dean of the Summer Quarter, and mailed to the student. Each student who wishes certificates sent, should file with the registrar not later than July 20th, a large self-addressed stamped envelope for mailing them. Credit Allowed by Other States than Virginia.âApplication has been made to other Southern States for credit equal to that accorded by the Virginia State Board of Education. Credit is now allowed toward the extension of certificates by many Southern States. All persons wishing to arrange for credits with their respective school authorities should correspond with the Dean of the Summer Quarter. Entrance Credit.âWhere courses in the Summer Quarter are taken to absolve conditions or to meet entrance requirements, no more than three units of entrance credit may be obtained in a full quarter. University of Virginia College Credit.âBelow are stated the conditions upon which credit in the University of Virginia may be granted for work done in the Summer School. (a) The student must satisfy the entrance requirements of the University of Virginia and matriculate before he can receive credit in the College for any work done in the University of Virginia Summer Quarter. (b) The Dean of the College will accept the completion of the courses in the Summer Quarter in lieu of the entrance examinations in the same subject, provided that in his judgment the courses are equivalent to those required for entrance to the University of Virginia, and provided, that the certificates of courses completed be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned. (c) The Dean of the College will accept certificates of completion of summer courses in the University of Virginia, provided that such summer courses be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned as the full equivalent in character and scope of the corresponding courses in the University. All courses numbered from 1 to 100 in this catalogue have been approved by the professors concerned and will be accepted by the Dean for such credit as is indicated in the description of each course. (d) Students both men and women who satisfy entrance requirements will not only receive credit at the University of Virginia for college courses taken in the Summer Quarter, but the summer work is recognized by standard colleges everywhere, so that students have no difficulty in securing transfer of credits. (e) That graduate courses completed in the Summer Quarter, if approved by the Committee on Graduate Studies, shall be credited just as if they were taken in the regular session; that residence work aggregating three summer quarters of twelve weeks each shall be considered as fulfilling the residence requirements for the master's degree. The following courses offered this Quarter will be given M. A. credit: Biology 7 and 8; Chemistry 10; Economics 76; Education 13, 14, 17, 18, 20 and 23; English 30, 31, 33, 34 and 35; Government 84. The Courses of Instruction are designated as follows: Courses numbered less than 100 may be credited toward the bachelor's degree in the University of Virginia. Courses numbered from 100 to 299 are courses for which college credit is recommended, though not given in the University of Virginia because corresponding work is not offered in this University during the regular session. These courses are, however, accepted by other standard colleges which offer similar work, and in which transfer of credit may be obtained. Their credit value is expressed in semester hours. Each course of one hour for thirty lectures has a credit value of two semester hours. One hundred and twenty semester hours are usually required for the baccalaureate degree. The amount of College Credit in this University for each course is indicated in connection with that course and is expressed in session-hours. One course of thirty recitations of one hour each has a credit value of one session-hour. Sixty-three session-hours, three of which may be in physical education, distributed according to the group requirements printed in the general catalogue of the University are required for the baccalaureate degree. The normal amount of credit which may be obtained in a summer session is three session-hours for each term or a total of 6 session-hours for the quarter. In exceptional cases students may be permitted to take more work. Appropriate credit will be allowed for work completed in recognized standard colleges. Students who desire credit towards a degree must meet the entrance requirements of this University before receiving such credit. Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the honor system and the honor pledge is required. VIRGINIA STATE CERTIFICATES. The Virginia certificates with which the courses of study at the University Summer Quarter are immediately concerned, are the following: The Elementary Certificate, for either Primary or Grammar Grades. The Special Certificate, for High School Teachers. The Collegiate Certificate, for High School Teachers. The Collegiate Professional Certificate, for High School Teachers. Courses are also offered to meet the requirements of the State Board of Education for High School graduates, who wish to obtain certificates, and for the renewal of certificates. Observation work will be provided in a well organized vacation school, under the supervision of a special instructor. CERTIFICATE FOR HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES. Graduates of standard four year high schools who attend a summer normal school for one term of six weeks, taking the first year of an Elementary Professional Course, may be granted a Provisional First Grade Certificate. Graduates of four year high schools who attend a summer school for two years of six weeks each, completing the second year of an Elementary Professional Course and having had seven months' teaching experience will be given a First Grade Certificate. The course may be taken at this school in either the first term or the second term this summer, the same credit will be allowed in the second term. EXTENSION OR RENEWAL OF CERTIFICATES. A Virginia State Teacher's Certificate which expires this summer may be renewed by the State Board of Education. The requirements for renewal are as follows: 1. Applicants must read five books on the Teachers' Reading Course during the life of the certificate to be renewed. 2. In addition to the first requirements, applicant must satisfy one of the following conditions: (a) Take an examination on the book in Elementary Education included in the Reading Course for the year in which the certificate expires. This examination is prepared by the State Board of Education.

The program must be approved by the Dean of the Summer Quarter. A copy of the Reading Course for 1920-1921 may be obtained from the State Board of Education, Richmond, Virginia. Work taken in the Summer Quarter counts for certificate credit or the renewal of certificates in most of the Southern States. Teachers from States other than Virginia desiring such credit should communicate with the Dean of the Summer Quarter or their own Superintendent of Public Instruction before registering. REGULATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. It will be the policy of the Department of Education to require, beginning with January 1st, 1922, three full quarters of normal work in order to secure the elementary professional certificate. Since under the regulations of the Board an applicant was allowed five (5) years in which to complete the requirements for an elementary certificate, those who have heretofore entered this course will be granted a five (5) year privilege, but under no condition can the time be extended beyong the summer of 1924. Applicants who enter the professional course in the summer of 1921 will have the privilege of completing the requirements under the condition now permitted, namely, in three (3) terms of six weeks each over a three year period, or in two (2) terms of twelve weeks each over a two year period, but such applicants must complete the requirements by the summer of 1924. When the elementary professional course is to be completed in two summers of twelve weeks each, one-half of the first summer's work shall be independent of the elementary course of study. The precise content of this one-half of the course shall be fixed by the director of the summer school, and should be academic as distinguished from purely method work. Graduates of the normal training departments in high schools who enter the elementary professional course may be credited with one-third of the requirement for this course, said one-third to be fixed in the discretion of the summer school director. An applicant who has taught for at least three years on a first grade certificate may, if she so elect, complete the elementary professional course in two summers, and be excused from the prescribed six weeks of academic work in the first summer. Applicants who have completed any part of the professional course as outlined prior to the summer of 1917 may be given appropriate credit by the director of the summer school on the elementary professional course as outlined at the present time. It is agreed that the number of subjects in the elementary professional course will be strictly alhered to, namely, four (4) subjects in the first year; four (4) in the second, and five (5) in the third year. Applicants who have completed two years of the three year course, as outlined prior to 1920, and thus have credit for ten courses, shall take in the summer school the third year of the present professional course embracing five subjects. In cases where obvious duplication of branches occurs, the director of the summer school shall have discretion to make appropriate substitutes. THE ELEMENTARY PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE. The requirements of the State Board of Education for an Elementary Professional Certificate either primary or grammar grades are as follows: A. Academic requirements: I. Graduation from an accredited high school, or II. Sixteen units from an institution recognized by the State Department of Education as giving equivalent high school courses, or III. A full first grade certificate issued by the State Department of Education of Virginia. B. Professional requirements: I. Thirteen courses, each having thirty recitation periods, at least ten of which shall be in education and special methods. Such courses may be taken at Summer Schoolsâ 1. In three summer sessions of six weeks each within a period of five years, orâ 2. In two summer sessions of twelve weeks each, provided that one-half of the work of the first year shall be in academic subjects, the applicant receiving a second grade certificate at close of first summer session. C. Teaching experience of seven months is necessary for securing a first grade certificate for part of the Elementary Professional Course. D. Credits secured in summer school professional courses prior to 1917 may be applied to present Elementary Professional Courses, provided such credits be granted by the Dean of the Summer Quarter before applicant enters course. E. All summer school professional courses listed prior to 1916 have been discontinued, and no new certificates will be issued upon such a basis. Outline for Primary Grades.
