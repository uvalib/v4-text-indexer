ANNOUNCEMENTS The University of Virginia Summer School is conducted for teachers and students in high schools, academies and colleges and for those who desire professional training for primary and grammar grade work. It also offers many courses for college credit, and others to meet the needs of students preparing for college entrance or who have conditions to absolve. It takes as its peculiar province, not the ordinary summer institute, but the solid and substantial training of high school teachers, college teachers, college students, and teachers who either have professional or life certificates or wish to procure them. Because the courses of instruction in high schools are not clearly defined but merge into the grammar grades below and into the lower college classes above, the high school offers itself as a strategic center around which to build up instruction, the emphasis of which is upon subject matter. The justification of such a summer school for high school teachers is the unusual activity in the South just now in behalf of secondary education. The large number of high school and college teachers attending the Summer School each year is an additional proof of the need of such a school. In addition to courses for high school teachers, the demand for courses for primary and grammar grade teachers is fully met. LOCATION.âCharlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The sanitary arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about six hundred and fifty feet above sea level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete. The average monthly mean temperature from 1901 to 1911, taken from the records of the weather station at the University Observatory, was: June, 71.4 July, 76.8. Summer rates are given by the railroads to this point. There are three golf links, a well-conducted country club and many other attractions for summer visitors. LABORATORIES AND MUSEUMS.âThe equipment possessed by the University for the work of instruction, alike in academic and in the professional departments, has been much augmented in recent years, and is now excellent in quality, as well as extensive. In scientific studies large facilities are offered by the Rouss Physical Laboratory, the Chemical Laboratory and the Museum of Industrial Chemistry, the Lewis Brooks Museum, the Biological Laboratory, and the large new Education Building with laboratories for Manual Arts and Domestic Arts. THE GENERAL LIBRARY.âThe General Library is open to the corps of instructors and the students of the Summer School from 9 a. m. to 1:30 p. m., 3 to 5, and from 7:30 to 10 p. m. The collection contains about seventy thousand volumes, including the standard books of history, literature, and science, and is particularly rich in materials for the study of education and other social subjects. The reference section is well supplied with encyclopedias and other sources of information. All books withdrawn from the library must be charged at the desk. Usually books are lent for one week but there are exceptions, and the loan expires on the date stamped in the book. Prompt return not later than the date on which the loan expires is expected and borrowers will be fined ten cents for each day delinquent. Students are expected to give prompt attention to all communications from the librarian. Volumes in the reference collection are not available to borrowers but may be freely consulted in the library, and works in current general use in connection with any course of instruction will be temporarily placed on reference and made subject to this rule. All bound magazines are classed as reference books. REST AND STUDY ROOMS.âMadison Hall, the beautiful new building of the Young Men's Christian Association, which was recently erected at a cost of seventy-five thousand dollars, will be open to students of the Summer School from nine o'clock in the morning until ten at night. Students will have access to the current periodicals in the reading room during the day and until ten at night. The other rooms will be used for rest, for study, for recreation, and for social gatherings. North of the building there are nineteen tennis courts which will be equipped for the use of the students. DAILY GENERAL ASSEMBLY.âDaily from 11:30 to 12:15 there will be a period in which the students may have the privilege of attending a gathering of the entire body. At this time there will be short addresses on interesting topics by prominent speakers invited for this purpose, and a brief prayer and song service. Generally the singing will be choral, under the direction of the instructor of music, but occasionally, as opportunity offers, prominent soloists will be procured. SUNDAY VESPER SERVICES.âExperience has shown that no Sunday service held here during the summer has been more attractive or more appreciated than what has sometimes been called the Sunset Service. Holding this service at this hour enables all the faculty and the students of the summer school to unite in one common service without at all interfering with their attending the churches of their choice in the city. The service, which will always be kept within one hour, will begin at seven o'clock. It will consist of congregational singing and a brief address by some prominent minister or layman. The pipe organ used when held in the chapel is the work of one of the best organ makers in the country, and is admirably adapted, both in size and tone, for church purposes. When the weather permits the service is held out of doors on the north steps of the Rotunda. RECREATION.âProvision has been made to keep the Fayerweather Gymnasium open for regularly registered students during the summer. No fee will be charged for the use of the gymnasium, and it is hoped that every student will come prepared to take advantage of the physical training courses. A portion of each day set apart to systematic physical development will be profitably spent. The swimming pool and baths will be at the service of the students. The tennis courts belonging to Madison Hall will also be kept in readiness, duly marked and with nets in place. All men will be charged a fee of $2.00 for all the privileges of the Association during the whole summer session, including tennis, lockers, reading room, and the use of the pool room at ten cents per hour per cue. The splendid athletic field, one of he finest in the South, with baseball ground and quarter mile running track, will be at the disposal of those who wish to engage in the manly sports. Within three minutes' walk from the Academic Building, the woods may be reached. These woods and the neighboring mountains furnish ample opportunity for pleasant strolls or for longer tramps on the part of those more vigorous. One of these walks lead to Fry's Spring, a most efficacious chalybeate spring, which may also be reached by street car. EXCURSIONS.âUnder the directorship of a competent guide, there will be excursions to neighboring points of interest such as Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson; the Natural Bridge; Luray Caverns; the Grottoes of the Shenandoah; the battle fields in Virginia; and any other points to which a sufficiently large number may care to go. The proximity to Washington and Richmond and Old Point Comfort (three hours ride to each) should make a visit to either exceptionally interesting. Saturdays will be reserved for these excursions. On designated clear nights parties will leave Cabell Hall at 8 o'clock to visit the McCormick Astronomical Observatory, where they will be shown the stars through the large telescope in the Observatory. ORGAN RECITALS, ENTERTAINMENTS, AND LECTURES. âThe pipe organ in Cabell Hall is one of the best products of one of the largest organ manufacturers in America. It is an antiphonal organ with fifteen hundred pipes, and exhibits all the possibilities of organ manufacture. To bring out these possibilities requires a master organist, and it is the purpose of the management of the Summer School to procure distinguished organists for the recitals. A Musical Festival and other entertainments will be announced during the session of the Summer School. The Coburn Players will present three plays. The Clifford B. Devereux Company will give three plays. And negotiations are pending for a number of other high class attractions. The whole course includes about twenty numbers and the price of a season ticket is $2.50 making the cost about the same as moving pictures. Besides there will be moving pictures regularly in Peabody Hall. RURAL LIFE WEEK.âThe time between July 17 and 21 will be devoted to the study of rural life problems in general, and the rural church in particular. A special effort will be made to secure a large attendance of country ministers and laymen, and distinguished speakers from all sections of the United States will participate in the Conferences. FOURTH OF JULY PAGEANT.âEach year an elaborate pageant is given in connection with the Fourth of July Celebration. An extensive celebration will be a feature this year. This year a Shakespeare Pageant will also be held. REDUCED RAILWAY RATES.âAll students coming to the Summer School from points within the territory covered by the Southeastern Passenger Association, i. e. the territory lying south of the Potomac and east of the Mississippi, should apply some time in advance to the local agent for reduced rates which have been granted by the Southern Passenger Association on a basis of approximately three cents a mile plus 25 cents for the round trip. Tickets will be on sale June 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, with privilege of extension of final limit to September 30. In Virginia reduced rate tickets will be on sale at all railroad stations. Announcements of dates will be made later by the Department of Public Instruction. Application has been made to have them correspond with the above. A committee will meet all incoming trains night and day, from June 18th to June 26th, to assist teachers in finding boarding places, to attend to baggage and to render any other service needed. On arriving teachers should inquire at the station for members of the committee who will wear suitable badges. A committee of ladies from the Y. W. C. A. will assist in welcoming teachers attending for the first time. Teachers arriving at Charlottesville from points on the C. and O. are advised to have their baggage checked to Union Station, Charlottesville. This will save a great deal of time in having trunks delivered to destination. Teachers are advised to hand their baggage checks to the committee. If handed to others a receipt should be taken. Teachers arriving before 6 a. m. and later than 10:30 p. m. will be met, provided they notify the Director. Only trains from 7 a. m. to 10 p. m. are met, unless notified to the contrary. A YOUNG WOMEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION CLUB, open to every woman in the Summer School, is organized for the purpose of promoting a pleasant social atmosphere, giving an opportunity for social service and religious development, and for the study of methods in club work and church work. The activities include "stunt parties," camp breakfast, Camp Fire Girls demonstrations, weekly meetings on religious and social questions and special lectures on rural life questions. A secretary devotes her entire time to the work and has charge of the club headquarters at Madison Hall. Her office hours are from 9 to 11 a. m. and from 2 to 3 p. m. THE SUMMER SCHOOL NEWS is a college newspaper, edited and managed by students of the University and of the Summer School. It contains all official and student organization announcements, campus news and notes, editorial comment, etc. Its object is to acquaint individuals with the life of the whole student body, and to unify the interests of all. Four monthly issues, beginning with February, will be printed and circulated in addition to the twelve regular numbers. The subscription price for the whole sixteen issues is the moderate sum of twenty-five cents. Subscriptions should be sent to the Business Manager, Summer School News, University, Virginia. BOARD AND ROOMS.âBoard and room may be had at prices ranging from $4 per week, where several stay in the same room, upward, according to accommodations and proximity to the University, the average being $4.50 to $5.50 per week. Many of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the University grounds. One hundred single rooms and one hundred and twenty-five double rooms in the University dormitories will be reserved in the order of application upon the following terms: The price will be $5.00 for the full term of six weeks for a single room, and $8.00 for a room which will accommodate two. No reduction will be made for parts of a term. Applications for rooms must be accompanied with the full amount of the fee in order to have them reserved. The amount of the fee will be returned for good reason and room released if application is made before June 10th, No rooms will be rented to any person who does not register and pay the fee in the Summer School. Rooms that are reserved will not be held later than July 1st. No room will be open for occupancy before June 19th. Each room is lighted by electricity, has stationary wash stand and running water and will contain one bed, one mattress, one pillow, one chiffonier, one table, one rocking chair, one straight chair. Double rooms will be furnished with two single beds complete, one chiffonier, except where there are more than two in room; one rocking chair or one morris chair and two single chairs. Wash stands and toilet sets will be provided where necessary. Roomers must provide themselves with necessary bed clothes, towels, etc. The Randall Building, East and West Lawns and East and West Ranges will be reserved exclusively for ladies and will be under the charge of Mrs. M. P. Harris, an experienced matron and chaperone. Some members of the faculty will be located in each set of dormitories. No cooking allowed in rooms. The rooms on Dawson's Row will be reserved for men. The location of these dormitories in the University grounds and the social advantages resulting from bringing so many teachers close together make this arrangement a very desirable one and the rooms are eargerly sought. The University Commons, the handsome new dining hall, will be open for summer students and will provide table board for three hundred and fifty persons at the very low price of $4.00 a week, $16.50 a month or $23.00 for the session of forty-six days. Weekly credit will be given only on account of sickness or leaving the University. The University Commons will be managed this year by Mr. Charles Jaimes, a caterer and restaurateur of wide experience. A Restaurant a la Carte and lunch counter will be run in connection with the Commons, open from 9:30 A. M. to 11 P. M. Application for dormitory rooms should be sent promptly, with retaining fee. For list of boarding houses, rates, etc., see page 71. FEES FOR NON-VIRGINIA STUDENTS.âA single registration fee of fifteen dollars will be charged each teacher who registers from outside of Virginia. This fee will entitle the student to enter any of the courses outlined in the catalogue (except a few special courses which are so designated). No student, however, will be allowed to take more than three advanced courses or six elementary courses without special permission in writing from the Director. FEES FOR VIRGINIA TEACHERS.âTuition will be entirely free to all Virginia teachers in all the regular courses, both elementary and advanced, leading to the professional and first grade certificates. To meet local expenses the State Board of Education has fixed a registration fee of $1.00 for a four weeks' term and $1.50 for a six weeks' term for all of the Summer Schools of the State, and these fees will be charged here. There are a few special courses offered to meet certain demands but not necessary for certificate credit, for which fees will be charged to all who take them. The fee for each is designated in the catalogue. Small fees in laboratory courses will also be charged all students who register in them. Students from Virginia who are not teachers or preparing to teach next session will be charged the same tuition as non-Virginia students. Teachers whose residence is in Virginia but who are teaching outside of Virginia will be charged the same fee as non-Virginians. TEACHERS' POSITIONS.âThe University Appointment Committee receives demands for teachers each year. This committee would be glad to have well qualified teachers who are in attendance upon the Summer School leave their applications with the Director, who is a member of the committee. A representative of the Virginia Teachers Agency conducted by the Department of Public Instruction of Virginia will also be at the Summer School the whole term. TIME AND PLACE OF RECITATIONS AND LECTURES.â Recitations will begin in all courses Wednesday, June 21, at 8:30 a. m. Students should present themselves at the first meeting of their classes with the required text-books and be prepared with tablets to take notes on introductory lectures. There will be no classes on Saturday except possibly on Saturday, July 8th, when classes will meet at the usual hours. The length of recitation will be one hour, ten minutes of which will be allowed for transfer from one room to another. Tuesday, August 1st, Wednesday and Thursday, August 2nd and 3rd, will be used for examinations; the determination being to provide for six full weeks of recitation over and above registration and examination days. Following the outline of each course in this announcement will be found the time and place of meeting for each class. The courses outlined will be given as scheduled. Students should therefore follow the schedule in selecting courses that will not conflict. It is well for the student to select such courses from this catalogue before the opening of the Summer School, so that little delay may be experienced in registration. The Summer School lecture rooms are for the most part restricted to six buildingsâPeabody Hall, Cabell Hall, Rouss Physical Laboratory, Mechanical Laboratory, Rotunda, and the Law Building. REGISTRATION.âTuesday, June 20th, will be devoted to the registration of students. All students who can possibly do so should register on this day. Those who fail to register before June 21st will be permitted to attend classes and register as promptly as possible at other hours. The Registrar's office, located in Peabody Hall will be open continuously June 20th, 21st, and 22nd from 8:30 a. m. until 6:30 p. m. Students should consult freely with members of the Faculty in case of difficulty in choosing courses. No certificate will be granted to students who fail to register before Wednesday, June 28th, except a certificate of attendance. Students preparing to stand the examination for teachers' certificates held at this place by the State Department of Public Instruction, July 19th, 20th, and 21st, must enter twenty days prior to July 19th. No student will be admitted to any course without a registration card naming the course in question and properly signed by the Registrar and the Bursar. In registering, students must state upon the registration card what credit, if any, is desired, as arrangements for credit must be made before taking the courses. No course may be counted toward a certificate without the consent of the Director or Registrar, and instructors will not admit a student to any course not mentioned on the registration card, which must be signed by the Registrar and the Bursar to be valid. IMPORTANT NOTE.âEvery teacher who is applying for a Virginia State Teachers' Summer School Professional Certificate of any kind should bring with her and before registering have whatever certificate she holds and which she desires to use as a basis of entrance on such professional work, approved by a representative of the Department of Public Instruction who will be present for that purpose. NON-VIRGINIA TEACHERS.âThe regulations in regard to teachers' certificates and the requirements for entrance to certain courses in the Summer School do not apply to teachers from other states than Virginia unless they desire to apply for a Virginia teachers' certificate. STUDENTS' MAIL.âIn order to insure safe and prompt delivery of mail, every student should have all mail directed to University, Virginia, giving always the street and number of his boarding place or the number and location of his room in the University. REGULATIONS CONCERNING CREDIT.âThe instructor giving each course will keep the class grades, and attendance, hold the examination, and average the class grade with the examination grade, returning to the Director the general average grade of each student in each course. Absences or delayed entrance will be counted against the student. A certificate for each course completed with an average grade of 75 per cent will be signed by the instructor and the Director of the Summer School, and mailed to the student. At the close of each session every teacher who expects to apply for a Virginia Summer School Professional Certificate should fill out and file with the Director one of the application blanks (Form S. S. 7-10) furnished by the Department of Public Instruction. When all of the courses required for any certificate are completed, the Department will issue the certificate and mail it to the applicant direct. In no case should the certificates given by the Summer School be sent to the Department. Credit Allowed by Other States than Virginia.âApplication has been made to other Southern States for credit equal to that accorded by the Virginia Department of Public Instruction. Credits are now allowed toward the extension of the certificates by certain other States. All persons wishing to arrange for credits with their respective school authorities should correspond with the Director of the Summer School. University of Virginia College Credit.âBelow are stated the conditions upon which credit in the University of Virginia may be granted for work done in the Summer School. (a) The student must satisfy the entrance examination requirements of the University of Virginia and matriculate before he can receive credit in the College for any work done in the University of Virginia Summer School. (b) The Dean of the College will accept the completion of the courses in the Summer School in lieu of the entrance examinations in the same subject, provided that in his judgment the courses are equivalent to those required for entrance to the University of Virginia, and provided, that the certificates of courses completed be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned. (c) The Dean of the College and the professor in charge of the school in which credit is desired will accept certificates of completion of summer courses in lieu of "A" courses in the University of Virginia, provided that such summer courses be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned as the full equivalent in character and scope of the corresponding "A" courses in the University. (d) Certificates of completion of certain summer courses approved by the Academic Faculty will be accepted in lieu of portions of "B" courses, provided that in each case the Dean of the College, the Faculty Committee on Degrees, and the professor in charge of the courses for which credit is desired certify in writing that the summer courses completed are equivalent in character and scope to that portion of the regular sessional work for which credit is desired. (e) The character of the examinations and the numerical standard (75 per cent) required for their successful completion shall be the same as those of the sessional examinations. (f) Courses which satisfy the conditions above stated will be credited toward the B. A. and B. S. degrees offered in the College of the University as follows: 1. Courses in which not less than thirty (30) hours of lecture instruction are given will be credited as one session hour. 2. Courses in which not less than thirty hours of lecture instruction and not less than sixty (60) hours of laboratory instruction is given will be credited as two sessional hours. (g) No student wishing University credit will be permitted to take more than three courses in one session except by special permission of the Director upon the recommendation of the professors offering the courses he desires to take. (h) Students who satisfy entrance requirements will not only receive credit at the University of Virginia for college courses taken in the Summer School, but the summer school work is recognized by standard colleges everywhere, so that students have no difficulty in securing transfer of credits. VIRGINIA STATE CERTIFICATES. Note.âTeachers outside of Virginia are not limited in the choice of their courses to the conditions under which Virginia certificates are issued, unless they desire to teach in Virginia and apply for a license issued in this State. In this case only state certificates from other states issued by a State Superintendent or a State Board of Examiners, and approved in advance by the Department of Public Instruction of Virginia, will be recognized as a proper basis for professional work. Teachers from other states will receive credit for all work done at the University Summer School in accordance with the certificate regulations of those States from which they come. The Virginia certificates with which the courses of study at the University Summer School are immediately concerned are the following: The Summer School Professional CertificateâPrimary Grade.

The new courses leading to the Summer School Professional Certificate herein outlined shall be offered under the same conditions and at the same places as the Old Summer School Professional courses, except that the work must be completed within a period of five years from the date of beginning and shall cover at least three terms of six weeks each, occupying a minimum of 500 recitation periods of at least 40 minutes each. These courses shall be taken as indicated in the following outline. The first year of the Old Professional Courses, requiring twelve weeks for completion, will not be given after January 1, 1917. However, those who have completed a part of either of the Old Professional Courses, and those who may begin the work of same this year, will be allowed to finish under the rules and regulations of the year 1915. As this new course will undoubtedly lead to a certificate of much greater value than the old course, all teachers are urged to begin the new course instead of the old one. For this purpose the first year of the new course will be offered this session. Outline for Primary Grades. First Year.

Important Caution.âAll Virginia teachers who desire to enter the professional course must present at the time of registration either one of the following:â(1) A full First Grade Certificate (provisional certificates or those of any lower grade cannot be accepted) issued for satisfactory grades made on State Examination; or (2) A High School Certificate issued by the State Department of Public Instruction (High School diplomas cannot be accepted) and also a letter from the principal or division superintendent, under whose direction the applicant has taught, stating that the applicant has had at least five months of satisfactory teaching experience. These credentials must be brought by the student in order to avoid delay in registering. The school cannot be responsible for credits for work on this course unless the credentials are found correct when the student registers. A high school graduate who has not obtained a State High School Certificate should write for it to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Richmond, Virginia, and secure it before coming to the school. Second Grade high School Certificates cannot be accepted for entrance to the professional course. Training Class Certificates given for less than four years of combined high school and normal training work cannot be accepted for entrance to the professional course. Those who have started work on this course at some other summer school will please bring with them their reports for the work already completed. If the course was started at this school in a previous summer, it is not necessary to bring credentials as our office records are all that is necessary. (d) Summer School Professional CertificateâFor High School GradesâMinimum Entrance Requirement.âThe holder of a Virginia First Grade High School Certificate or the holder of a Virginia First Grade Certificate who presents satisfactory evidence of having completed the equivalent of a standard four-year high school course, shall be granted a Summer School Professional Certificate âFor High School Grades, under the terms and conditions hereinafter stated. The certificate and other credentials which entitle the applicant to enter upon and pursue the course of study herein outlined must be presented to and approved by the conductor of the summer school before the applicant can be registered and admitted to classes. The Summer School Professional Certificate.âFor High School Grades entitles the holder to teach only the high school branches named in the certificate. General Requirements.âThe courses prescribed in any of the branches hereinafter stated for the Summer School Professional CertificateâFor High School Grades, must embrace no work unless it be of College Grade, requiring minimum hours or recitation periods of sixty minutes each. These courses must be taken in a summer school at a registered college or university and must be completed within a period of three years from the date of beginning. In all cases a statement of each professor under whom the course is pursued, to the effect that the applicant is highly proficient in his branch must accompany the final report. The following "Content Table" gives the number of hours or recitation periods required in each branch, and in addition thereto the applicant must complete a course of thirty hours in educational psychology and the principles of teaching. Content Table Agriculture, 90 hours. Botany, 60 hours. Chemistry, 150 hours, of which 60 hours must be laboratory work. Drawing, 90 hours. English, 120 hours, including 30 hours in English Grammar, 30 hours in Rhetoric and Composition, and 60 hours in English and American Literature. Domestic Science, 90 hours. French, 90 hours.

Music, 90 hours. Physics, 150 hours, of which 60 shall be laboratory work. Physical Geography, 60 hours. Spanish, 90 hours. Zoology, 60 hours. This certificate shall continue in force for seven years, and may be renewed for a similar period from time to time, as provided in section 38 of this circular. N. B.âThis course must not be given at any school in Virginia unless it is specially mentioned and advertised in its literature; no supposedly equal course at any other than a designated summer school will be recognized or accepted by the Department of Public Instruction. Note.âFor those who wish to prepare for the State Examination for certificates to teach in High Schools, a Special Examination will be held at the close of the Summer School in order that they may have full six weeks to prepare for it. Preparation for State Examinations for First and Second Grade Certificates. The State Examinations will be given at the Summer School July 19, 20 and 21, 1916. Heretofore these courses have been offered at the University, but this year a much better arrangement has been made with Supt. Johnson and the Charlottesville School Board, whereby the classes will be held in Midway School building in Charlottesville, from 8:30 a. m. to 1 o'clock p. m. in accordance with the following schedule. The advantages of this plan are: 1. The work will all be given in one building, the classes will be divided into sections small enough for drill, the periods will be forty-five minutes each, and the Topical Outlines furnished by the Department will be strictly followed and thus a thorough review guaranteed. 2. A vacation school will be in daily session in the building affording an excellent opportunity for observation work in all the grades. 3. The afternoons and evenings will be open for extra work in special subjects and for the general lectures and entertainments which are such attractive and valuable features of the University Summer School. 4. Excellent boarding accommodations at very reasonable rates may be obtained in the vicinity of Midway School building thus relieving the congestion at the University and reducing somewhat the cost of living. 5. Those registering for this course will be entitled to all the privileges of the Summer School without additional cost. The Third Grade Certificate is no longer issued by the State Board of Education. The following extracts from Form EâNo. 19 of the Department of Public Instruction give the requirements for these certificates: (Sec. 31) "First Grade Certificate.âTo obtain a First Grade Certificate the applicant must be at least nineteen years old, must have had nine months successful experience in teaching, must make an average of 85 per cent. on the following subjects: Spelling, writing, reading, arithmetic, grammar (including composition), geography, history of the United States, history of Virginia, civil government (including the government of Virginia), drawing, theory and practice of teaching, physiology and hygiene, physical geography, elementary agriculture, and English history, and must not fall below 70 per cent. on any subject. "A First Grade Certificate based on the foregoing requirements shall continue in force for five years and may be renewed from a similar period from time to time upon satisfactory evidence that the holder has taught successfully for at least three of the five years, and fulfills the other requirements of section 38 of Form EâNo. 19. "An applicant who makes the first grade average on the required subjects, but who has not had the requisite experience will be issued a Second Grade Certificate, which may be changed to a First Grade Certificate after nine months of successful teaching. "A First Grade Certificate issued by a division superintendent, which has finally expired, may be exchanged for a new First Grade Certificate provided the holder passes the examination on the added subjects for a new First Grade Certificate, which are English history, physical geography, and elementary agriculture." 34. "Second Grade Certificate.âTo obtain a Second Grade Certificate the applicant must be not less than eighteen years old, and must make an average of 75 per cent. on the following subjects: Spelling, reading, writing, arithmetic (including business forms), grammar (including composition), geography, history of the United States, history of Virginia, civil government (including the government of Virginia), drawing, theory and practice of teaching, physiology and hygiene, and must not fall below 60 per cent. on any subject. "This certificate shall continue in force for a period of two years and may be renewed for a similar period as provided in section 38 (of Form Eâ19)." Because of the great amount of investigation and bookkeeping involved, the Department of Public Instruction cannot undertake to duplicate reports of examinations that may have been lost or destroyed by applicants desiring the benefits of a combination and an applicant who seeks the advantages offered by this section must attach the report of the former examinations to be combined to Form EâNo. 2 when he takes the second examination.

ART. The School of Art was founded a number of years ago under the direction and personal instruction of the famous illustrator and alumnus of the University of Virginia, Mr. F. Graham Cootes and for five summers was successfully conducted by him in conjunction with such artists as R. S. Bredin, George Bellows, W. Scott and Duncan Smith. It will open its ninth session this summer. The classes as usual will be two in number, one in the morning from 9:30 to 1 o'clock, and one in the afternoon, in which the pupils work out of doors from nature. In the morning the pupils draw and paint from a model in costume, in any medium. The course is designed for pupils interested in illustrations, cartooning, poster work, portrait, landscape or decorative painting, and for those who desire it as an aid in teaching. The class in Composition meets on Saturday. At the end of the term an exhibition of the work done by the students is held in Peabody Hall. These exhibitions have been features of the Summer School, and have always attracted wide interest and much favorable comment. The work compares favorably with that of far larger Schools of Art. No other school of art can advance the pupil so rapidly, as the students have daily criticisms, instead of the usual one or two a week, and more personal attention and interest on the part of the instructor than in other art schools. A scholarship for 1916-17 is offered by the New York School of Fine and Applied Art (formerly "Chase's") to the student doing the best all around work. Miss Emily Hall, of Richmond, was the winner of this scholarship last summer. A prize will be awarded for the best painting made during the term. The term is that of the Summer School, six weeks, June 20 to August 3. Rates: $10 per month, half day; $15 per month, full day; $15 per term (6 weeks) half day; $20 per term (6 weeks) full day. An initiation fee of $2 will be required of new students. A full line of art materials will be for sale at the studio. For further particulars address Mr. Duncan Smith, instructor and director, 42 Washington Square, New York. Daily, Peabody Hall, Room 5, Mr. Smith. ASTRONOMY The courses in astronomy are intended primarily for university students. Course sB1 covers the work given in the fall term of the regular session of Astronomy B1, while course sB2 covers that taken up in the winter term. In the summer session of 1916, course sB1 will again be given and also course sB3 which is parallel to the spring term of Astronomy B1. Astronomy is taught by text-books, lectures, problems, and observational exercise. A knowledge of plane trigonometry is prerequisite. sB1.

BIOLOGY The courses in biology have been organized with two ends in view: First, to give teachers adequate training to carry courses in botany, zÃ¶ology and biology in their public school work and to give them instruction that will supplement their work in physiology, hygiene and agriculture. Second, to enable premedical students to fulfill the medical entrance requirements as prescribed by the American Medical Association in June, 1913. It is to be noted here all premedical students are required to take course 3 with their course in either Botany or ZoÃ¶logy. 1. Botany.âThis course is outlined primarily to give the student a knowledge of how plants live, grow and propagate themselves, and of their structure. An introduction to the systematic study and naming of ferns and flowering plants will be included in this course. The teacher completing this work will be prepared to place an introductory course of botany in his or her high school curriculum. This work will also supplement, in a helpful manner, his or her work in drawing, geography and physiology. No text-book required. Laboratory fee for teachers $1.00, for premedical students and for those seeking University credit $10.00, which fee includes the registration fee. Daily, 8:30 to 9:30; Laboratory 9:30 to 11:30; Laboratory for premedical students and University credit students 11:30 to 12:30. Professor Kepner and Mr. Taliaferro. Cabell Hall, Room 12. 2. Zoology.âThis course is outlined primarily to give the student a knowledge of how animals live, grow and propagate themselves, and of their structure. The teacher completing this work will be prepared to place an introductory course of ZoÃ¶logy in his or her high school curriculum. This work will also supplement, in a helpful manner, his or her work in drawing, geography and physiology. No text-book will be required. Laboratory fee for teachers $1.00, for premedical students and for those seeking University credit $10.00, which fee includes the registration fee. Daily, 2:30 to 3:30; Laboratory, 3:30 to 5:30. Professor Kepner and Mr. Taliaferro. Cabell Hall, Room 12. 3. Experimental Biology.âThis course consists of a series of laboratory experiments, on plants and animals, supplemented with a limited number of explanatory lectures. Its object, on one hand, is to give teachers of both Botany and ZoÃ¶logy a series of experiments that they can use as demonstrations in their class work. On the other hand it supplements the premedical students' work in either Botany or ZoÃ¶logy by giving them some idea of experimental Biology. No text-book or laboratory fee required. Daily, 11:30 to 12:30. Professor Kepner and Mr. Taliaferro. Cabell Hall, Room 12. Certificate Credit.âSummer School Professional Certificate Advanced GradeâBiology, 1, 2 and 3; Summer School Professional CertificateâHigh School GradeâBiology, 1, 2 and 3. University Credit.âStudents who complete the work of courses 1 and 3 will be given credit for one term's work in Botany B1. Those who complete the work in courses 2 and 3 will be given credit for one term's work in ZoÃ¶logy. Fee.âStudents not registered in either Biology 1 or 2 will be charged a registration fee of $5 for course 3. FIELD BOTANY The outline projected is intended to give to the student a systematized course of study, making it an easy and agreeable task for him to identify the various plant families in his locality and acquire methods of study by which children may identify and become familar with the individual plants of their neighborhood. At the beginning of the course attention will be given to plant morphology and physiology, but the course will be of a practical character and performed in the fields and forests near the University where the plant life is diversified and rich in both indigenous and imported varieties, furnishing exceptional opportunities for the purpose. During the term each student will, under direction, collect, identify, mount, and preserve, characteristic types, so that he will have commenced the accumulation of an herbarium for use in his teaching, and to which he can continually add specimens from his own locality or that in which he is teaching. The hours for daily exercises will be arranged as far as possible so that they will not conflict with other courses taught in the Summer School. Daily, from 5:30 to 6:30. Professor Lambeth. Rotunda, Room 3. Text-Book.âGray's Manual of Botany. Certificate Credit.âSummer School Professional CertificateâAdvanced Grade and High School Grade. CHEMISTRY Instruction in chemistry is offered to high school teachers and to others as indicated below. The ample facilities of the School of Chemistry of the University are available and its laboratory and library will be used. 1. General Chemistry for High School Teachers.âThis course is designed to meet the needs of those who may have to give instruction in chemistry in high schools. A daily discussion of the elementary principles of the science will be held and simple lecture table demonstrations made. Daily, from 10:30 to 11:30. Professor Bird. West Range Laboratory. 2. Laboratory Course for High School Teachers.âThe sole object of this course is to train each member of the class to give laboratory instruction in secondary schools; the situation that is likely to confront each one will be considered individually. The following topics will be discussed: the particular branches of the subject which should be taught high school students; the apparatus and chemicals necessary and their cost; how to equip a laboratory and how to make the best use of facilities likely to be found in a high school. It is planned to have the teacher perform, under the eye of the instructor, all experiments that the pupils should perform and such demonstration experiments as seem desirable. Special attention will be given to the fitting up of apparatus at a nominal cost, and the apparatus thus assembled may be taken away for future use. The essential pedagogic points of the experiments will be discussed fully and an effort made to show the teacher how to instill life into the laboratory work of the pupil, by pointing out its practical bearing. The chief emphasis will be laid upon the essential phenomena and laws of matter changes, especially those of daily occurrence. Daily, 8:30 to 10:30. Professor Bird, and Mr. Carter. West Range Laboratory. 3. The Principles of General Chemistry.âThis course is offered especially for those who desire University credit in general chemistry, or who are preparing to enter some medical school requiring chemistry for entrance. It will deal mainly with the more important phenomena of inorganic chemistry and the fundamental laws of chemical science. Daily, 12:15 to 1:15. Professor Bird. West Range Laboratory. 4. Laboratory Course.âThe facilities of the laboratory and library are offered to those who wish to do special work in general or analytical chemistry. The instruction in this course will be such as to meet the needs of the following groups of students: those who desire experience in the analytical methods used in a particular line they may seek to enter; those who contemplate taking a civil service examination in chemistry and who wish additional laboratory instruction; those who need additional laboratory experience in order to meet the entrance requirements of professional schools; those who desire to apply for University credit. Daily, 8:30 to 12:15 for advanced laboratory work and 10:30 to 12:15 for others. Professor Bird, Professor Pratt and Mr. Carter. West Range Laboratory. 5.

SCHOOL MUSIC Courses for Supervisors of Music.âThese courses are primarily intended for the training of supervisors of music and special teachers of music in the public schools. In order to complete the work and receive a supervisor's certificate, allowing a graduate to teach music in the public schools of Virginia, it is required that the candidate shall have attended two summer sessions. Detailed information in regard to home study during the academic year may be had on application to Professor Fillmore. Courses for Grade Teachers.âThe probability is that the near future will witness a requirement made by school boards and State boards of education, demanding that the grade teacher shall qualify in music as she must qualify in every other subject in the elementary curriculum. Such a requirement is already in force in several states. This makes a special course of music for grade teachers an actual necessity. DEPARTMENT OF MUSIC, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.
