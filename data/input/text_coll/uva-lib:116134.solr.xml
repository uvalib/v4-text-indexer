      <field name="fulltext">ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. For admission to any department of the University, the general conditions are the following: 1. Sufficient Age.âThe minimum legal age is sixteen years; the faculty advise seventeen or more. Eighteen years is the minimum for admission to the Department of Law. 2. Good Character.âThis must be attested by a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended, or by other valid proof. 3. Adequate Preparation.âThis must be such as will enable the candidate to meet the requirements for admission to the several departments of the University. For admission to the College, the candidate must present a certificate or pass an equivalent examination. In either case the amount of preparation required is measured in terms of units. A unit represents a year's study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year's work. This definition of a unit takes the four-year high-school course as a basis and assumes that the length of the school year is from thirty-six to forty weeks, that a period is from forty to sixty minutes in length, and that the study is pursued for four or five periods a week; but under ordinary circumstances a satisfactory year's work in any subject cannot be accomplished in less than one hundred and twenty hours, or their equivalent. Schools organized on any other than a four-year basis can, nevertheless, estimate their work in terms of this unit. For the requirements as to the number and selection of the units required for entrance to the College, see page 54. ADMISSION BY CERTIFICATE. For admission by certificate, the applicant should file with the Dean of the University not later than September 1 a Certificate of Preparation, made out on the blank form furnished by the University. This certificate must come from a recognized institution of collegiate rank, from an accredited public high school, or from an accredited private secondary school. The candidate for admission from a public high school must be a graduate of an accredited four-year high school. The candidate for admission from a private secondary school must be a graduate of the school, or must present a certificate showing that he has completed at least the equivalent of four years of satisfactory high-school work of standard grade, covering at least fifteen entrance units. In every case the candidate for admission must have the recommendation of the principal of the certifying school. Private secondary schools in Virginia are accredited by the faculty of this university after inspection and report by a committee of the faculty. The university also accredits all four year public high schools which are fully accredited by the State Board of Education of Virginia. The Dean of the University is further authorized to accept certificates from schools outside Virginia, accredited by their own state universities or institutions of equal rank, or by their own state departments of education, provided the courses of study offered in such schools meet the requirements demanded of accredited schools in this state. If in any accredited school the number of periods given to a study, or the length of the period, is below the specified standard, the credit for such subject is reduced pro rata. In the science subjects only half-credit is allowed unless individual laboratory notebooks, properly attested by the teacher in charge, are filed with the certificate. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must in all cases take the entrance examinations. ADMISSION BY EXAMINATION. For admission by examination, the candidate must present himself at the University in June or in September, according to the dates given in the Program of Entrance Examinations. The examinations are held under the honor system, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge. All candidates who take their examinations at the times appointed are tested free of charge. In case of delayed entrance, where the grounds of postponement are good, the President of the University may admit the candidate to a special examination, for which a fee of five dollars is charged. This fee is payable in advance, and is in no case returned. PROGRAM OF ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS. June, 1921 9-11 A.M. 11 A.M.-1 P.M. 3-5 P.M.

      <field name="fulltext">REGULATIONS. REGISTRATION. Registration of New Students.âApplicants seeking admission to the University for the first time must present themselves to the Dean of the University at some time during the first three days of the session. Registration of Matriculated Students.âStudents who have previously been matriculated as members of the University must present themselves to the deans of their respective departments upon one of the first three days of the session. Delayed Registration.âAny student who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session will not be admitted unless he can explain his delay in a manner satisfactory to the President, and will be charged a delayed registration fee of five dollars. Spring Registration Period in the College.âStudents enrolled in the College who expect to return for the next succeeding session must register during the Spring Registration Period. Any student who fails to register during this period will be charged a delayed registration fee of five dollars upon registering in the College at the opening of the following session. Registration after the Christmas Recess.âOn the first week-day after the Christmas recess every student is required to register with the dean of his department between the hours of 9 a. m. and 2 p. m. Any student failing to register thus will be required to pay the delayed registration fee of five dollars, and will be liable to whatever penalties may be imposed by his professors for unexcused absences. But if the delay is due to illness or other providential cause, the dean is authorized to remit the fee and to notify the professors concerned that the student's absences have been satisfactorily explained. RESIDENCE AND ATTENDANCE. The Academic Year begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September and continues for thirty-nine weeks. Thanksgiving Day and Jefferson Day are holidays, and there is a Christmas recess beginning on the last week-day before the twenty-fifth of December and closing on the evening of the second of January. Attendance is required of each student throughout the entire session, with the exception of holidays, unless he has received written permission to be temporarily absent, or to withdraw before the close of the session. While in residence each student is required to attend regularly all lectures and other prescribed exercises in the courses which he pursues, or else suffer such penalties as his professors may impose for unexcused absences. Leave of Absence from the University is granted for sufficient reason by the dean of the department in which the student is registered, and must in every case be obtained in advance. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or other student organizations on excursions will not be granted except to the officers and members of these organizations. The laws relating to absence from the University of members of the athletic teams are found in the General Catalogue. The same regulations apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University and the dean of the department in which the student is registered. When a permit is granted upon the University Physician's certificate that withdrawal is necessary on account of ill health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct, the fees are returned pro rata. Under no other circumstances will there be a return of fees. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the several departmental faculties for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also the regulations as to delinquent students in the various departments. Absence from Examinations.âWritten examinations are an essential part of the work of every course in the University, and attendance upon them is required of every student. Absence may be excused only on the ground of sickness on the day of the examination (attested by a physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause which may be approved by the several faculties of the University. Special Examinations are granted only upon prompt application therefor, and in case the applicant's absence from the regular examination has been excused. See the preceding paragraph. Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the Honor System, and an unpledged paper is counted as a total failure. In matters of class standing as well, students are expected to regard themselves as governed by the law of honor. CONDUCT. The laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the University precincts or not. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University any student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The keeping of dogs by students within the university grounds is forbidden. Prohibition of Credit.âAn act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting minor students. The license to contract debts, which the President is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity. DORMITORIES AND BOARD. Dormitories.âStudents may reside in the university dormitories, in their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. The President will withdraw from the approved list any house in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Any change of residence during the session should be reported at the office of the Registrar. For rules governing the rental and occupancy of university dormitories, and the rates charged for the same, see pages 16-17. For list of private lodging houses, with rates, apply to the Registrar. Board.âStudents may board at the University Cafeteria, at their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. For the cost of board at the Cafeteria, see page 16. For list of private boarding houses, with rates, apply to the Registrar. MEDICAL ATTENDANCE AND PHYSICAL TRAINING. Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the University Physician; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for his maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, treatment of the eye, ear, nose and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of students, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Students who take the responsibility of boarding at houses not approved by the Board of Health forfeit the right of medical attendance. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the University Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. Physical Training.âNo student is permitted to undertake an amount of work greater than he may reasonably be expected to carry without detriment to his health; and every student is advised to take a due amount of daily outdoor exercise, for which ample opportunities are afforded by the athletic fields, the tennis courts, the golf course, and elsewhere; and, in addition, to make systematic use of the facilities afforded without cost for definite and judicious physical training at the Fayerweather Gymnasium under the advice and instruction of the director and his assistants. For the regular course in Physical Training with credit value toward academic degrees, see page 49. Further information upon the equipment and policy of the University in the matter of Physical Training and Athletics will be found on page 249 of the General Catalogue. EXPENSES. Payment of Fees.âAll university charges and rent of rooms in the university buildings are payable upon entrance. Under special conditions the President is authorized to allow credit, but deferred payments are in all cases to be properly secured. Students permitted to register during a term are required to pay the full fees for that term. Return of Fees.âUnder no circumstances will there be a return of fees except upon certificate from the University Physician that withdrawal from the University is necessary on account of ill health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct. Upon receipt of the University Physician's certificate, the President will return the fees pro rata. Remission of Fees is made in the following cases: (1) In accordance with the statute (Virginia Code 1887, Ch. 68, Sec. 1554), fees are remitted to Virginia students as detailed below under University Charges. In order to be considered a Virginia student, it is necessary that the applicant's parents be domiciled in the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; if he has attained his majority, it is necessary that he himself be domiciled here. One is domiciled in the State who is living in it at the time the application is made and has no intention of removing therefrom in the future, or who, though absent from the State, has not lost his former domicile by acquiring one elsewhere. No other person can honestly avail himself of this privilege. (2) White male teachers and superintendents of the public schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Academic Schools of the University without payment of fees (except those charged in laboratory courses), upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the public schools of the State during the year. Applicants for admission as teachers are required to send in their names to the President of the University not later than March 5. (3) Ministers of religion may attend any of the Academic Schools of the University without payment of the tuition fee. The same privilege will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet without aid the expense of an education. UNIVERSITY CHARGES. University and Tuition Fees.* * The university fee goes to the fund intended to defray the general expenses of the University. Payment of this fee entitles the student, without additional charge, to the use of the library; to the privileges of the gymnasium, with baths, private lockers, etc., and the advice and aid of the physical training staff (see page 14); and to free medical attendance by the University Physician in case of illness (see page 14). It also covers all regular examination and diploma fees. The College: VIRGINIANS NON-VIRGINIANS University fee $ 10.00 $ 40.00 Tuition 135.00 Laboratory Fees. The College: FEE Architecture B2 $40.00â¡ â¡ This fee is included in the tuition fee paid by non-Virginians. Architecture C1 40.00â¡ Astronomy B3 5.00 Biology (each course) 5.00 Botany (each course) 5.00 â  â  In Chemistry a deposit of $5 is required in addition, to cover breakage of apparatus. Chemistry (each course) 20.00 Geology B4 3.00 Physics B1, C1 and C2 (each) 15.00 ZoÃ¶logy (each course) 5.00 BOARD AND LODGING. A student may rent a room in one of the university dormitories and take his meals either in the University Cafeteria or in an approved private boarding house; or he may take both room and board in such boarding house, in which case he pays no room-rent or servant-hire to the University. A list of private boarding and lodging houses, with rates, may be had upon application to the Registrar. The University Cafeteria. The University Commons, conveniently situated near the center of the University, is now being conducted on the Cafeteria plan, with accommodations for seating three hundred students at one time. Good, wholesome food is being served at costs ranging from $20 to $30 per month. Many of the students are finding it possible to board at the lower rate. University Dormitories. Rules.âStudents desiring rooms should apply to the Bursar, enclosing a reservation fee of $5, which will be returned should there be no room to let. The occupant of a room may reserve it for the next session by applying to the Bursar and depositing $5 (which is in no case returnable), not later than May 1. The balance of the rent must be paid not later than the first registration day of the session, otherwise such preference or other right shall be forfeited. No room may be sublet. Rates.âAll rooms are rented unfurnished, but the University has arranged with a local dealer to place in each room the necessary articles, consisting of one three-piece enameled bed with comfortable springs, one thoroughly sanitary all-cotton mattress, one solid oak six-drawer chiffonier with mirror, one student rocker with cane seat and back, one student straight chair and one student table with 24 Ã 36-inch top. This furniture will be placed in the room before the opening of the session, so that the room will be ready for occupancy immediately upon arrival. The student will pay the local dealer $20 per session as rent for the furniture. The rental for the necessary furniture for a room occupied by two students will be $25.50 using a double bed, or $28 for a double room using two single beds or a double-deck bed. Additional furniture may be rented if desired. The student should bring bed linen, towels, blankets, pillow, etc., or be prepared to purchase them here. All rooms are provided with either steam or hot-water heat and electric light, except where otherwise specified. Janitor service is included in the rate given. The rooms on East and West Lawn (with the exception of Bachelors' Row), East and West Range, and Dawson's Row, are commodious, and are frequently occupied by two students. The rates given below are for the session of nine months. East and West Lawns. ONE OCCUPANT TWO OCCUPANTS Rooms in Bachelors' Row (9) $ 70.00 $ 70.00 Other rooms (27) 75.00 100.00 East Range.

In order to provide rooming facilities at the very lowest cost to the students, a large, frame two-story barracks building has been erected on the grounds, conveniently located to the lecture halls and cafeteria. The building comprises four large, well-lighted sleeping rooms, equipped with 20 single iron beds with good all-cotton mattresses in each room. Builtin clothes closets and all-steel lockers are provided for each occupant. The house contains two large study rooms equipped with tables and chairs. Steam heat, electric light and janitor service are provided. The discipline and conduct of the building are in charge of a committee of the occupants who will see that order is maintained. Accommodation may be had in the Club for $45 for the session. APPROXIMATE SUMMARY OF NECESSARY EXPENSES. The figures in the following tables may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of nine months. As necessary expenses are reckoned here university and tuition fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. For each department three estimates are given âa low, an average, and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundryâ in other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. If a student shares a room with another student, and practices the strictest economy, he may possibly reduce his expenses below the low estimate.

While it is difficult for any student to be assured of remunerative work before he reaches the University, information as to such employment may be had from the Secretary of the Committee on Student Self-Help, Madison Hall. For Loan Funds for deserving students, see page 25.</field>

The holder must be a graduate student taking Astronomy as his major subject, and must occupy a portion of his time in work connected with the observatory. Appointments are made upon the recommendation of the Director of the Observatory. LICENTIATESHIPS. Any person of unexceptionable character and habits, upon producing to the faculty satisfactory evidence of suitable capacity and attainments, may be licensed by the faculty to form classes for private instruction in any Schools of the University, in aid of and in conformity with the public teachings of the professor upon any subject taught therein. The employment and compensation of any such licentiate are matters of private agreement between him and the student. Students whose preparation for the work of the university courses is inadequate may often economize time and energy by securing the services of a licentiate at the same time that they are attending the regular lectures. LOAN FUNDS. Applicants for loans, if not already registered as students in the University, must have complied with all the requirements for entrance. All inquiries concerning loans should be addressed to the Bursar. Harvard Loan Fund.âThe Harvard Loan Fund was established in February, 1909, by an alumnus of Harvard University, who gave to the University of Virginia the sum of five thousand dollars as an evidence of the friendship and kindly relations existing between the two institutions. Loans from this fund will be made to needy and deserving students pursuing or intending to pursue studies in any department of the University, in amounts not to exceed one hundred dollars in any one session to a single student, at an annual rate of interest of four per cent. Virginia Students' Loan Fund.âThe Virginia Students' Loan Fund was established by an act of the General Assembly of Virginia, approved March 14, 1908, and amounts each year to one per cent of the annual appropriation made by the Legislature for the support of the University. In accordance with the terms of this act, loans will be made "to needy and deserving students of talent and character, from Virginia, in the Academic Departments," in amounts not to exceed one hundred dollars in any one session to a single student, at an annual rate of interest of four per cent.

      <field name="fulltext">THE COLLEGE. Edwin Anderson Alderman, Ph.B., D.C.L., LL.D. President James Morris Page, M.A., Ph.D., LL.D. Dean ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. The general requirements for admission to the University may be found on page 9. For admission to the College, the candidate should possess an amount of preparation which is at least the equivalent of that represented by four years of successful work in an accredited school. He must offer, either by certificate or by examination (see page 9) fifteen units, of which three must be in English, two and one-half in Mathematics, and one in History. The remaining eight and one-half units may be selected at will from the list on page 11, unless the candidate expects to apply for a baccalaureate degree. In that case he should offer, if he is an applicant for the degree of Bachelor of Arts, four units in Latin or two units in Greek; if he is an applicant for the degree of Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Science in Commerce, two units in each of two modern languages (French, German, Spanish); if he is an applicant for the degree of Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, or Bachelor of Science in Medicine, two units in French and two units in German. For definitions of the entrance units, apply to the Dean. Advanced Standing is given to any candidate who, in addition to meeting the minimum requirements for entrance above stated, can show by passing an examination that he has done work equivalent to that covered by any of the following courses offered in the college: Latin A1, Greek A1 or A2, Greek A3, English A1 or A2 or A3, German A1, Mathematics A1, French A, Spanish A. Such a candidate will be admitted to the corresponding B course, and upon his successful completion of the same will be entitled to count toward a baccalaureate degree the credit value of both the A and the B courses in question. The examinations for advanced standing are set at some time during the first month of the session. College Credit.âCandidates who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students, and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the College a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. This certificate must be acceptable both to the Dean and to the professors in charge of the courses accredited. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college, must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate, and must give his grades. The final validation of such certificates is effected by the successful completion of the courses taken in this university. In no case will credit be given on more than forty-eight session-hours of work done elsewhere, and any candidate who receives this maximum amount of credit can count among the remaining fifteen session-hours required for his degree only the credit value of the courses he has passed as a resident student in the College, exclusive of any credit for work done in the Summer Quarter or in any of the professional departments. In every case the candidate must spend at least one regular session exclusively in college work in this university. Conditioned Students.âA candidate for entrance must offer fifteen units as defined by the Southern Commission on Accredited Schools. At least thirteen of the units offered must be included in the list of units accepted for admission on page 11. A student not able to offer fifteen units as defined in this list may be conditioned on any two units except English A and B. All conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the session following initial registration. This may be done by private study or by taking courses in the regular session of the University or in the Summer Quarter. But no course taken to remove a condition may be counted as part of the work credited toward a degree. No conditioned student may be later registered as a special student. Special Students.âA candidate may be admitted as a special student without fulfilling the entrance requirements above specified, provided he is more than twenty years old on the day of registration and gives adequate evidence of serious purpose and of the training needed to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for a degree; but such students are permitted and encouraged to make up their deficiencies by private study or by taking courses in the regular sessions of the University or in the Summer Quarter. They will then be admitted as regular students, and may be accepted as applicants for degrees, provided all entrance requirements are met at least one academic year before the date of graduation. Admission of Women.âWomen are admitted as candidates for the vocational degrees of Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, Bachelor of Science in Architecture and Bachelor of Science in Commerce. A candidate must be at least twenty years old on the birthday preceding matriculation; must present certificates showing graduation from an accredited public high-school, or not less than four years' attendance in an accredited private school, with credit for not less than fifteen college entrance units obtained at least two years before admission to the University; and must in addition show by proper certificate the completion in a standard college, subsequent to the credit obtained for fifteen entrance-units, of at least thirty session-hours, (sixty semester hours), of courses of college grade, in not less than eighteen calendar months. The thirty session-hours of college courses required for admission must include: three session-hours each in French and German; six in Mathematics; twelve in laboratory sciences; and six in English. REGULATIONS. The Session-Hour.âAll courses are measured in terms of the session-hour as a unit. A session-hour is one hour a week throughout the session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week throughout the session of laboratory work. Maximum and Minimum Number of Session-Hours in One Session.â Each College student is required to undertake each session courses aggregating fifteen session-hours (with the exception noted below under Minimum Grade Required). This number may be increased in the following cases: (1) Any first-year student may take eighteen session-hours, provided (a) three of these be in Greek A1, Greek A2, German A1, French A or Spanish A; or (b) the student in question is credited with six session-hours of advanced standing. (2) A student not in his first year in the College may take eighteen session-hours, provided he (a) has passed in the preceding session courses aggregating fifteen session-hours, or (b) is repeating a course on which he failed in the preceding session, or (c) is in his graduating year and needs eighteen session-hours for his degree. (3) A student not in his first year may take twenty-one session-hours provided he passes in the preceding session courses aggregating eighteen session-hours, or provided he is repeating a six-hour course on which he failed. Exceptions to the above regulations will be allowed only by special permission of the Academic Faculty. Physical Training is not counted in the maximum and minimum requirements detailed above. Grade.âThe grade of a student in any course, either for a term or for the session, is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Class standing in any course is determined by the regularity of the student's attendance upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercises) of the course, and by the quality of his work, as indicated by his recitation grades, written tests, laboratory work, etc. Grade Required for Passing.âFor passing in any course a grade of seventy-five per cent is required. Grade Required for ReÃ«xamination.âA student whose session grade in any course falls below seventy-five per cent, but not below sixty-five per cent, may, upon the written recommendation of the professor in charge, be admitted to reÃ«xamination upon that course, or upon such portion of it as the professor shall determine, during the registration week of the following September. The fee for each reÃ«xamination is five dollars, and must be paid to the Bursar on or before July 15. An applicant for a degree who fails on a single term of not more than one of his courses during the last year of his candidacy, is entitled to a special examination before Final Day on the work of that term, and will receive credit for the course, provided the result of this special examination entitles him to a grade of seventy-five per cent for the term in question, considered independently and without reference to his grade for the other two terms. In such cases no reÃ«xamination fee is charged. Minimum Grade Required.â(1) (a) A student whose grade in a course for any term is less than fifty per cent shall be considered as making no real progress in the course and shall be dropped from the rolls of the class by the Registrar, unless the professor recommends in writing to the Registrar, on the term report of the class, that the student be kept on the rolls. (b) A student who through neglect of his work is evidently making no real progress in a course may at any time, after due admonition, be required by the professor concerned and the dean, to drop the course in question. (2) A student, dropped from any course under the above regulation, who has been successful for the term on at least six session-hours and has a grade of at least sixty-five per cent on three session-hours of his other courses may, at the discretion of the dean, and of the professor whose course he desires to enter, substitute at the beginning of the following term a new course for the one from which he has been dropped, provided that this substitution will not bring his total number of session-hours above fifteen. (3) Any student who through enforcement of these regulations is left with only twelve session-hours, and who does not pass on six session-hours and average at least sixty per cent on six session-hours of the remaining courses, for any ensuing term; and any student left with nine session-hours, who does not pass on six session-hours and receive a grade of at least sixty-five per cent on the three session-hours of his remaining course for any ensuing term shall be dropped from the University. (4) Any student, other than a first-year student, who through enforcement of these regulations is left with less than nine session-hours shall be dropped from the University. A first-year student who through enforcement of these regulations is left with less than nine session-hours, shall be dropped from the University unless he shall have made a grade of seventy-five per cent on three session-hours, and at least sixty-five per cent on the other three session-hours. But any student who is permitted under this condition to remain in the University, shall be required to take up new courses sufficient to bring his session-hours up to twelve, and shall be dropped from the University if in the next ensuing term he does not pass on six session-hours and average at least sixty per cent on the remaining six session-hours. (5) The dean shall have power to suspend the enforcement of any of the above regulations in any case in which the low grade was the result of circumstances over which the student had no control. Advisers.âTo each first-year student is assigned, before his registration is completed, a member of the faculty as his adviser, whose acquaintance he should cultivate, and whom he may feel free to consult on any question touching his work or his life as a student of this university. The relation between the student and his adviser is purely voluntary on both sides, except that the student is expected to call to see his adviser at least once early in the session and that the consent of the adviser must be obtained before the student can make a change in his course of study. Change of Studies.âSubjects of study in a student's schedule may be changed, dropped, or added to, only with the consent of his adviser and of the professors concerned, and only within the first two weeks of each term, except that first-year students may make such changes at any time during the first month of the session. Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors, but only for sickness or like providential cause. Any explanation of an absence which a student has to offer must be made on the day of the first lecture after the absence. Unexcused absences from lectures render the student liable to such penalties as his professors may impose, or, in serious cases, to faculty discipline. No student who has, for any reason, been absent from more than fifty per cent of the lectures of any one term, can receive a grade on the work of that term. Absence from Examinations will not be excused except for sickness on the day of the examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, is entitled to a special examination on a date to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge, not later than the end of the registration period of the following session. Reports.âReports are sent at the end of each term to the parent or guardian of each student. These reports indicate the number of times the student has been absent from lectures, and give his term grade in each course. Preliminary reports on attendance and class-standing are made on November 4 to the parent or guardian of every first-year student. The Dean will be glad at any time to furnish to the proper person a special report on any student's standing. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES. Full opportunity is given to any student to carry out any definite plan of work which he may have in view on coming to the University, or which may have been prescribed for him by those under whose direction he is completing his education. But when no well-considered plan has been outlined in advance, and the end in view is that for which the great majority of students enter college, namely, the attainment of a liberal education, the student will be expected to enter upon the regular work of the college leading to a baccalaureate degree. Six degrees are offered candidates for graduation in the College. Two of these, the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science, are cultural; the Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, the name of which is inscribed on the diploma, the Bachelor of Science in Architecture, the Bachelor of Science in Commerce, and the Bachelor of Science in Medicine, are vocational degrees, designed for those who wish to fit themselves especially for professional work. No course offered by a successful candidate for one of the cultural baccalaureate degrees can be offered by the same candidate as part of the work credited toward the other cultural baccalaureate degree, nor can any work done to remove an entrance condition be counted for any degree. For a student who enters without advanced standing the normal time required for obtaining a baccalaureate degree is four years, assuming that he completes each year courses which aggregate the regular minimum of fifteen session-hours. A student receiving advanced standing in not less than two subjects may obtain a degree in three years, provided he is able to complete each year eighteen session-hours. A student may materially shorten the time required for obtaining a degree by taking courses in the Summer Quarter on which college credit is given. For credit for work done at other colleges, see page 54. The requirements for the baccalaureate degrees are such as to allow a large measure of freedom of election on the part of the individual student, such restriction only being placed upon this liberty as is necessary to insure at the same time the thoroughness and the breadth of culture for which these degrees stand. In order to secure to the recipient of a degree a due measure of acquaintance with the methods of thought characteristic of each of the leading departments of knowledge, as well as with their subject matter, his courses must be chosen, subject to the specific requirements detailed below, from the following groups, among which are distributed all the academic undergraduate courses having credit value toward a baccalaureate degree.
