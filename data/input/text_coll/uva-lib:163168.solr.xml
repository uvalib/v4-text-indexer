      <field name="fulltext">TERMS OF ADMISSION. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. MATRICULATION. To be admitted as a student of the University, the applicant must be at least sixteen years of age; but the Faculty may dispense with this requirement in favor of one who has a brother of the requisite age entering at the same time. If the applicant for admission has been a student at any other incorporated seminary, he must produce a certificate from such seminary, or other satisfactory evidence of general good conduct. In this institution there is no curriculum or prescribed course of study to be pursued by every student, whatever his previous preparation or special objects. In establishing the University of Virginia, Mr. Jefferson, for the first time in America, threw open the doors of a University in the true sense of the name, providing, as amply as the available means would permit, for thorough instruction in independent schools in all the chief branches of learning, assuming that the opportunities for study thus presented were privileges to be voluntarily and eagerly sought, and allowing students to select for themselves the departments to which they are led by their special tastes and proposed pursuits in life to devote themselves. The wisdom of this plan has been amply vindicated by time and experience; and within the last few years many of the institutions of higher culture in the United States have, to a greater or less extent, remodelled their method of study in accordance with the example here set. This elective system commends itself especially to those who desire to make professional attainments in any department of knowledge. At the same time the courses of academic study are so arranged as to provide for the systematic prosecution of a complete plan of general education. TERMS OF ADMISSION. While every student may thus select the schools he will attend, in the academic department he is required, as a rule, to attend at least three, unless, upon the written request of his parent or guardian, or for good cause shown, the Faculty shall allow him to attend less than three. Students are permitted to exchange schools, with transfer of fees, within ONE WEEK after admission; thereafter no exchange is allowed, except by leave of the Faculty, and then without transfer of fees. The session commences on the 1st of October, and continues without interruption until the Thursday before the 4th of July. The mode of instruction is by lectures and text-books, accompanied by daily examinations. NO HONORARY DEGREES ARE CONFERRED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. SCHOOL OF LATIN. Prof. Peters. The subjects taught in this school are the Latin Language and Literature, with the History of Rome. The school is divided into two classes âJunior and Senior. Text-books. Junior ClassâSallust, Ovid, Terence, Cicero de Officiis, Horace. Senior ClassâHorace, Seneca, Juvenal, Livy, Cicero, Tacitus. Grammars. Zumpt's, Gildersleeve's, Roby's, Printed Lectures of the Professor. Lexicons. Andrew's, or Freunds' Leverett. History. Browne's Roman Literature, Liddell's Rome, Long's Atlas. Instruction is given by lectures, and by examinations upon the portions of text assigned for recitation. The exercises of rendering Latin into English, and English into Latin, in writing, constitute a prominent feature in the course. In addition to the portions of the several authors read in the Lecture room, a course of extra and parallel reading is required in each class. The examination for graduation is not limited to the portions read in the lecture room, nor to the parallel reading. The different systems of Latin versification are fully explained by lectures, and the general subject applied by readings and metrical exercises. Note.âPost-Graduate Class.âThis class is composed of students who have graduated in the school of Latin, and who desire a wider acquaintance with Latin than is implied in graduation. Authors not embraced in the regular course are read and closely studied. Special attention is given to translation; and a prominent feature of the lecture-room exercises is the discussion by members of the class of the text translated. The vocabulary acquired by extensive translation is frequently applied in rendering into Latin English selected for the purpose. Sanskrit. The Professor of Latin will also give instruction in Sanskrit. SCHOOL OF GREEK. Prof. Price. The school is divided into three classesâJunior, Intermediate, and Senior. The method of instruction is by lectures (systematic and exegetical), by examination, and by written and oral exercises. LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT.

In the examination of candidates for graduation, the passages given for translation are selected, not from the portions read and explained in the lecture-room, but from the classic writers at will. Post-Graduate Department.âThe Post-Graduate Department has been instituted for the benefit of graduates and others that wish to pursue a more extended course of reading. The authors read in this department are such as are, either by their form or subjects, less suited for the regular school; e. g. Ãschylus, Aristophanes, and Aristotle. HEBREW. The Professor of Greek will give instruction in Hebrew also, whenever the demand for such instruction is sufficient to make the institution of a course of lectures expedient.

It embraces Applications of the Differential and Integral Calculus to selected portions of Mechanics, Physics, and Physical Astronomy. There is one class in Mixed Mathematics. In the class of Mixed Mathematics there are two Lectures each week. The instruction in each class in the School of Mathematics is conveyed partly by lectures and partly by the systematic study of approved textbooks. The student is assisted by full and frequent explanations from the Professor, and constantly subjected to rigid examinations. The progress of the student in each class is also tested by his being required to perform written exercises, in which the principles acquired are applied to the solution of particular problems. Any student entering the school has the privilege of attending all or any of the classes, and if prepared to enter an advanced class, may often find it highly advantageous to review his previous studies by attendance on a lower class also. SCHOOL OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. Prof. Smith. This School includes two departmentsâGeneral Physics and Practical Physics. I. General Physics. Junior Class.âThe Junior Class meets three times in each week throughout the session of nine months. The object of the course of LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. lectures to this class is to furnish the student with a comprehensive view of Modern Physics, and to make him familiar with its methods of investigation. With the design of laying a thoroughly scientific basis for the course, a large space is given at the outset to the discussion of the cardinal doctrines of motion, force, energy, and potential, and to their simpler applications in the pressure and motion of visible masses. With this preparation the student proceeds to the subject of Molecular Physics, embracing Sound, Light, Heat and Electricity. Throughout the course the established laws of motion and force are kept steadily in view, and an attempt is made to exhibit the evidence, daily becoming stronger and clearer, for the prevalent belief among scientists, that the entire body of Physics is a coherent and harmonious system of mechanical truth. Text-Books.âThe Professor's Syllabus; Everett's Units and Physical Constants. For Reference.âEverett's Privat Deschanel; Jamin; Daguin. Senior Class.âThis class meets thrice each week, and studies Mathematical Physics and Astronomy. Text-Books.âCummings' Electricity; Bartlett's Acoustics and Optics.

Note.âPersons engaged in the study of Geology and Mineralogy, though not members of the University class, can, with the leave of the Professor, and by paying $25 to the Proctor, join the party of the Professor in the prosecution of the field explorations, and work during the months of May and June. Note.âThe lectures on Geology and Mineralogy will terminate the last of April, when the Professor will begin Field Explorations, and work with his class, and continue it for two months. Note.âThe hours of lecture will be appointed by the Professor, so as to avoid conflict with other schools. THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. JAMES L. CABELL, M. D., M. A., LL. D.

At the last meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, it was enactedâ 1. That the curriculum for the Medical Degree be arranged for a graduated course to cover two full sessions. 2. That, to this end, in each of the schools of the Medical Department, except in the school of Chemistry, there shall be a Junior and a Senior Class, the studies of which shall be carried on concurrently, those of the Junior Class embracing the elementary branches of Medical Science, and adapted for students entering upon such studies for the first time; while those of the Senior Class shall be such as to require a previous knowledge of the subjects taught in the Junior Class. Thus the studies of the Junior Class shall include Anatomy, in the school of Anatomy and Materia Medica; Physiology, in the school of Physiology and MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. Surgery; Medical Jurisprudence and Obstetrics, in the school of Practice of Medicine and Obstetrics; and Chemistry, in the school of Chemistry and Pharmacy. The studies of the Senior Class shall include all the other subjects now embraced in the Medical curriculum. 3. At the close of the Junior year, the student shall be examined on the subjects taught in the Junior Class, and, if successful, shall not be required to stand another examination on those subjects, but only to attend the lectures on such subjects during the next session; if unsuccessful at any of the Junior examinations, they shall have the privilege of standing the regular examinations at the next session on the subjects on which they previously failed. 4. Students who, in the opinion of the whole Medical Faculty, by previous study elsewhere, have made such attainments as to enable them to carry on the studies of the Senior Class at the commencement of the session, shall have the privilege of offering for graduation at the end of one session, by standing all the examinations in both classes. 5. The fees in the Medical Department shall remain as at present. The Medical Department of the University aims at thorough work in its special province, to-wit: the instruction of the student in the princiciples of medicine, and his discipline in the modes of acquiring and applying knowledge. Thus, whilst the only solid foundation of professional attainments is laid, the mental faculties are expanded and strengthened for that growth in knowledge, usefulness and distinction to which every one who enlists in an honorable and responsible profession should aspire. The organization and arrangements by which these aims are successfully accomplished may be briefly stated: ARRANGEMENT OF STUDIES. The length of the session (nine months) renders it convenient and eligible to distribute the subjects of instruction among a smaller number of Professors than in the other medical schools of the United States, whose sessions are only four or five months long. Thus, to one Professor is assigned Physiology and Surgery; to another, Human Anatomy and Materia Medica; to a third, Chemistry and Pharmacy; and to a fourth, Medical Jurisprudence, Obstetrics, and the Practice of Medicine. This distribution renders it practicable to bring the different subjects to the attention of the student in their natural and successive order. The arrangement of the lectures is such that he acquires a competent knowledge MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. of Anatomy, Physiology and Chemistry, before he enters upon the study of the principles and practice of Medicine and Surgery, which can only be studied properly in the light shed upon them by the former. The instructions in Materia Medica and Pharmacy are also given in due relation to the progress of the student in Chemistry. LECTURES AND DAILY EXAMINATIONS. Favored as the student is in the comprehensiveness, scientific basis and order of his studies, he is not less favored by arrangements which give ample time for the preparation of every lecture, and address motives to him for such preparation. Each professor gives three regular lectures a week, with occasional extra lectures, making the average weekly aggregate not over fourteen, or a little more than two a day. The student, therefore, is not over-burdened with lecture-room attendance. He has time for study in his private room, to consult books, and compare their teachings with the oral instructions of his Professor, and to digest and systematise his acquisitions from both sources. The daily examinations which precede every lecture supply the stimulus to regular and active study, serve as summary reviews of what he has already heard or read, and as correctives of any misconceptions he may have fallen into in his hearing or reading. The daily examinations constitute a very valuable part of the exercises of the Institution, and are taken into account in determining the fitness of a student for graduation. APPARATUS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. The equipment of the Medical Department in apparatus, specimens and drawings, is extensive and excellent. The collection of paintings for the illustration of the lectures on Anatomy, Physiology and Surgery, several hundred in number, is unequalled by anything of the kind in the United States, or perhaps abroad. PRACTICAL ANATOMY AND DISSECTION. The Department furnishes every facility for the study of practical Anatomy that can be furnished in similar institutions elsewhere. Adequate provision is made for the supply of subjects, and each student has the opportunity, by actual dissection under the guidance of the Demonstrator of Anatomy, of acquiring a practical knowledge of the structure of the human body in all its parts. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. DEGREES. The degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred upon such students as prove their fitness for the same by rigid and searching examination. It has ever been the policy of the Institution to make its honors testimonials of merit, and not certificates of attendance on a prescribed course of instruction. LABORATORY COURSES FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS. In addition to the usual course of Medical Lectures, two special courses of instruction will be given by the Professor of Analytical Chemistry to such Medical Students as may desire to pursue them: 1st, Sixteen lessons in the practical applications of Chemistry to Medicine, (the detection of poisons, chemical and microsopic examination of animal products, urine, blood, etc). 2nd, Fourteen lessons in practical pharmaceutical manipulations. Each of the above (optional) courses will be at a charge of $20 tuition fee, and $5 for laboratory material consumed. LAW DEPARTMENT. JOHN B. MINOR, LL. D., Professor of Common and Statute Law. STEPHEN O. SOUTHALL, LL. D., Professor of Civil, International, and Constitutional Law, and Equity. This Department is organized with a view to acquaint the student FAMILIARLY AND PRACTICALLY with the principles of his profession. The instruction is as thorough as possible, and is given partly through textbooks and partly through lectures, with daily examination upon both. A Moot-Court, in connection with other instruction, tends to perfect the student in the details of practice. Under the immediate supervision of the professors, he is required to pronounce opinions upon supposed cases; to devise and institute remedies by suit or otherwise; to conduct suits at law and in equity from their inception, through all their stages; to draw wills, conveyances, and other assurances; and in short, to perform most of the functions of a practising lawyer. The Department comprises two schools, each of which is divided into two classes, and the course of study is as follows: SCHOOL OF COMMON AND STATUTE LAW. Prof. John B. Minor, LL. D. Junior Class.âBlackstone's Commentaries. Minor's Institutes of Common and Statute Law, namely: Vol. I, The Rights which relate to the Person. Vol. II, The Rights which relate to Real Property. Minor's Synopsis of Criminal Law. Senior Class.âStephen on Pleading. Minor's Institutes of Common and Statute Law, namely: Vol. IV, The Practice of the Law in Civil Cases, including Pleading. Vol. III, The Rights which relate to Personal Property. ? For reference, Virginia Code, (1873); Revised Statutes of United States. LAW DEPARTMENT. SCHOOL OF EQUITY, MERCANTILE AND INTERNATIONAL. CONSTITUTIONAL AND CIVIL LAW, AND GOVERNMENT. Prof. S. O. Southall, LL. D. Junior Class.âVattel's International Law, Lectures on Government, Federalist. Senior Class.âSmith's Mercantile Law; Greenleaf's Evidence; Adams' Equity, with Lectures. For reference, Stephen's Digest of the Law of Evidence. In the Department of Law, the degree of Bachelor of Law is conferred upon those who, upon examination conducted in writing, manifest an intimate acquaintance with the subjects taught in ALL THE CLASSES; and to those who, upon like examination, exhibit a competent knowledge of International and Constitutional Law, and of the Science of Government, a Certificate of Proficiency is awarded. In order to obtain the degree, the whole of the foregoing course must be completed HERE, no preliminary examination being had upon entering. The course is designed for two sessions, and in general it is not prudent to devote less to it; the future professional success of the student depending much upon his full mastery of it. It is a maxim sanctioned by long and wide experience, that "he who is not a good lawyer when he comes to the bar, will seldom be a good one afterwards." And in order to such thorough acquaintance with the elements of the law, thought is requisite as well as reading; and for the purpose of thought, there must be TIME to digest, as well as INDUSTRY to acquire. One cannot expect to gorge himself with law, as a boa constrictor does with masses of food, and then digest it afterwards; the process of assimilation must go on, if it is to proceed healthfully and beneficially, at the same time with the reception of the knowledge. So the athlete judges, who wishes to train the physical man to the most vigorous development, and the intellectual athlete cannot do better than imitate the example. But whilst the student is advised, as a general rule, to avoid the attempt to complete the course in a single session, yet, if he chooses to essay it (as some do successfully,) he is admitted to stand the graduating examinations, and if he attains the standard required, he is entitled to his degree. The expenses of a Law student, as appears from page 54 of this Catalogue, amount to about $312 to $339 for a session of nine months, commencing 1st October; or in the boarding club to about $280.50 per session. AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. JOHN R. PAGE, M. D., Professor of Zoology, Agricultural Botany and Agriculture. JOHN W. MALLET, Ph. D., M. D., LL. D., F. R. S., Professor of General and Applied Chemistry. FRANCIS P. DUNNINGTON, B. Sc., Adjunct Professor of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry. WILLIAM M. THORNTON, Adjunct Professor of Applied Mathematics and Engineering. The late Samuel Miller, of Lynchburg, having by deed given in trust one hundred thousand dollars for the establishment of a Department of Scientific and Practical Agriculture at the University of Virginia, the Trustees under this deed met the Rector and Visitors of the University on the 17th of September, 1869, and arrangements were made for putting the said department in operation. These arrangements have subsequently, by action taken at various times, been extended and added to; the above named Professors have been nominated by the Trustees of the "Miller Fund," and elected by the Board of Visitors of the University; certain lands belonging to the University have been set aside and brought into cultivation as an Experimental Farm; a machine for the manufacture of drain tiles has been imported from England, and put in operation; aud implements, apparatus, models and specimens of various kinds have been collected as material aids to the course of instruction. In this, as in all the other departments of the University, entire freedom of choice is left to the student as to the schools he shall attend, and the order in which he shall attend them, and this choice will be influenced in individual cases by the nature and extent of previous preparation, as well as by difference of ulterior aim; but a student of average ability, who has already had a fair general education, and who comes to AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. the University with the intention of devoting himself to a study of the principles upon which Agriculture is based, will probably do well to select for the first year Natural Philosophy, (Junior Class,) Chemistry (general), Zoology, Agricultural Botany and Agriculture, and Mineralogy and Geology; and for the second year Scientific and Practical Agriculture, Agricultural and Industrial Chemistry (including the first Laboratory class of Analytical Chemistry) and Agricultural Engineering. This arrangement of studies may with advantage be expanded to a course for three years, or may be varied by the selection of other Schools when deemed desirable. For the method of study in the respective Schools, reference should be made to the preceding pages of this Catalogue. Trustees of Miller Fund. J. F. SLAUGHTER, President. W. W. MINOR, S. V.

The examinations are of three kinds: 1, the Daily examinations; 2 the Intermediate and Final general examinations; and 3, the examinations for Graduation. DAILY EXAMINATIONS. Each Professor, before commencing the lectures of the day, examines his class orally on the subject of the preceding lecture, as developed in the text-book and expounded in the lecture. GENERAL EXAMINATIONS. Two general examinations of each class are held during the session in the presence of a committee of the Faculty, which every student is required to stand. The first, called the intermediate examination, is held about the middle of the session, and embraces in its scope the subjects of instruction in the first half of the course. The second, called the Final examination, is held in the closing month of the session, and embraces the subjects treated of in the second half of the course. These examinations are conducted in writing. The questions propounded have each numerical values attached to them. If the answers of the student are valued in the aggregate at not less than three-fourths of the aggregate values assigned to the questions, he is ranked in the FIRST division; if less than three-fourths, and more than one-half, in the SECOND division; if less than one-half, and more than one-fourth, in the THIRD division; and if less than one-fourth, in the FOURTH division. Certificates of distinction are awarded to those who attain the first division at one or both of these examinations, and their names are published or announced at the closing exercises of the session. The general examinations are sufficiently comprehensive and difficult to render it impossible for the student, without steady diligence, to secure a place in the first division. The results, whatever they may be, are communicated to parents and guardians respectively in the final circular of the session. The standing of the student at the daily and general examinations is taken into account in ascertaining his qualifications for graduation in any of the schools. DEGREES. EXAMINATIONS FOR GRADUATION. The examinations for graduation are held in the last month of the session. They are conducted in each school by the Professor thereof, in the presence of two other Professors, forming with him the committee of examination for the school. The candidates for graduation are subjected to searching interrogations on the details and niceties as well as on the leading principles of the subject, and they are expected to be accurately versed in all the topics treated of in the lectures and correlative text, These examinations are chiefly carried on in writing; but in some of the schools they are partly oral. As a proper acquaintance with the English language is indispensable to the attainment of any of the honors of the Institution, all candidates for graduation are required to exhibit in their examination due qualifications in this respect. DEGREES. The degrees conferred by the University are Academic and Professional. The Academic Degrees are: 1. That of Proficientâconferred for satisfactory attainments in certain subjects of study, to-wit: In Anglo-Saxon, the Junior and Intermediate Course of Mathematics, Geology, Mineralogy, Botany, Physics, Physiology, Medical Jurisprudence, Human Anatomy, Political Economy, History, Literature, International Law and Government, Pharmacy, and Agricultural Chemistry. 2. That of Graduate in a Schoolâconferred for satisfactory attainments in the leading subjects of instruction in the same, to-wit: In the Latin Language and Literature, in the GreekLanguage and Literature, in the French, German, Spanish, or Italian Language and Literature, Mixed Mathematics, Pure Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Practical Physics, Moral Philosophy, History and Literature, Applied Mathematics, Analytical Chemistry, General Chemistry, Industrial Chemistry, Zoology, Agricultural Botany and Agriculture, and Natural History and Geology. 3. That of Bachelor of Artsâconferred on such candidates as haveâ1st, Attained distinction on the whole course taught in the Intermediate Class, (or its equivalent, as fixed by the Faculty, where no Intermediate Class exists), in the Schools of Pure Mathematics, of Latin, of Greek, of Natural Philosophy, and of Moral Philosophy; 2nd, Graduated in any two of the Academic Schools; and 3rd, DEGREES. Presented an essay, or treatise, composed by themselves, and accepted as satisfactory by the Faculty, on some subject of science, philosophy, history or literature. 4. That of Doctor of Philosophyâgranted to students who shall have graduated and obtained Post-Graduate distinction in the studies contained in any one of the five following classes, (after having received the Degree of Bachelor of Arts, as a previous condition): Class I. to containâMathematics, and Mathematical Physics. Class II. to containâLatin and Greek. Class III. to containâMoral Philosophy, Political Economy, and History and Literature. Class IV. to containâModern Languages, (including Anglo-Saxon,) History and Literature. Class V. to containâExperimental Physics, Chemistry, and Natural History and Geology. It will be perceived that the above scheme leaves unchanged the present degrees of Proficients and Graduates in single Schools, and also the present Degree of Master of Arts. 5. That of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia, conferred upon students who have graduated in the Latin, Greek, French and German Languages, Pure Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, General Chemistry, Moral Philosophy, and History, Literature and Rhetoric, and who have been subjected in the last year of their candidacy to a special examination, in any two schools of their own selection, in which they may have graduated in a previous year. The candidate for the degree of Bachelor or Master of Arts is also required to submit for the approval of the Faculty an essay, composed by himself, on some subject of Literature or Science, which essay must be read by the author on the Public Day, if so ordered. The Professional Degrees are: 1. That of Bachelor of Lawâconferred for satisfactory attainments in all the subjects of instruction in the Schools of Law. 2. That of Doctor of Medicineâconferred for satisfactory attainments in all the subjects of instruction in the several schools constituting the Medical Department. Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine who have been previously declared graduates in General Chemistry, or proficients in Anatomy, Physiology, or Medical Jurisprudence, are not required to stand the examinations in these subjects anew; and the same rule applies to DEGREES. candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Law who are proficients in International Law and Government. 3. That of Civil Engineerâconferred on such students as have graduated in the schools of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry or Industrial Chemistry, obtained Certificates of Proficiency in Mathematics and in Geology and Mineralogy, and graduated in the School of Applied Mathematics, course of Civil Engineering, with satisfactory attainments in a prescribed course on the Infinitesimal Calculus. 4. That of Mining Engineerâconferred on such students as have graduated in the Schools of Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry, obtained Certificates of Proficiency in Physics, in Geology and Mineralogy, and in Mathematics, and graduated in the School of Applied Mathematics, course of Mining Engineering, with satisfactory attainments in a prescribed course on the Infinitesimal Calculus. 5. That of Bachelor of Scientific Agricultureâconferred on such students as have obtained a certificate of proficiency in the Class of Physics, distinctions in Junior Applied Mathematics, Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry, and graduated in the Schools of General and Industrial Chemistry, Zoology, Agricultural Botany, Agriculture, and Natural History and Geology. PUBLIC DAY. On the closing day of the session, which occurs on the Thursday before the 4th day of July, the Visitors, Faculty, Officers and Students of the University assemble in the Public Hall, whither also the friends of the students and the public generally are invited. On this occasion the results of the examinations are announced, and certificates and diplomas awarded. EXPENSES. 1. The charges common to all classes of students, if two occupy the same room, are as follows: Matriculation, including Library Fee, cost of Diplomas, Room-Rent, Infirmary Fee, $60 00 Contingent Deposit, 10 00 Fuel and Lights, about 13 50 Washing, about 13 50 $97 00 (Where one student occupies a double room, $15 is added to the above charge. Where a student lives at home, $22.50 is deducted.) EXPENSES. The contingent deposit is designed to cover any assessments that may be made against the student during the session for violation of the rules of the library, damage to books, room, etc. The residue is refunded to the student on the settlement of his account at the close of the session. 2. Tuition. The tuition fee in each of the Academic Schools is $25; in Applied Mathematics, $50; in Law, $80; in Medicine, $110; in Practical Physics, $50, with a charge of $10 for outfit. The fees for students of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry are as follows: First Laboratory Class, $50, with $10 for materials. Second Laboratory Class, 100, with 25 for materials. Third Laboratory Class, 20, with 5 for materials. Practical Pharmacy, 20, with 5 for materials. Each Laboratory student (except students of Pharmacy) is required to furnish himself with the more common and generally necessary articles of apparatus. The cost of a suitable set need not exceed $15. Laboratory students may attend, without additional charge, the course of lectures on Agricultural Chemistryâthe fee to others is $15. The tuition fees of Academic students attending three schools (the usual number attended in one session) amount to $75; of Law students to $80; of students of Civil Engineering, attending three schools, to $100; and of Medical students, to $110. 3. Board. There are two large boarding houses within the precincts of the University, at which the cost of board, including diet, furniture of room, and attendance, is $18 per month. Besides these, there are several licensed boarding houses in the immediate vicinity, at which the charges are from $15 to $18 per month. There are also two boarding clubs within the precincts of the University instituted by the Faculty, and under the control of the Chairman. The affairs of the club are administered by a superintendent appointed by the Chairman. The accounts of the superintendent are audited monthly by a committee, consisting of the President and two other members of the club, before being presented to the Proctor for payment. The expense of board to each member of the club is a deposit of $5 with the Proctor for outfit of club-halls, and a monthly charge of $10 for diet and servant's attendance, with fuel and lights for dining-halls. Furniture for lodging-room, with fuel and lights, cost $1.50 a month. EXPENSES. Board, at $11 50 a month in the Club, including fire, furniture and attendance, for Club Halls, for nine months, $103 50 Matriculation, etc., 97 00 $200 50 Board, at $15 a month, in licensed boarding-house, including fire, furniture and attendance, for nine months, $135 00 Matriculation, etc., 97 00 $232 00 Board, at $18 a month, in boarding-house within the precincts, including fire, furniture and attendance, for nine months, $162 00 Matriculation, etc., 97 00 $259 00 4. Total Expenses, exclusive of Books, Clothing, and PocketMoney, for Nine Months. In the Clubs. Boarding-houses. At $11.50 a month. At $15. At $18.

Mode of Payment. All the foregoing items are payable in advance, except board and washing. One-third of the board is required on admission, and the balance in equal instalments, at three and six months thereafter. Washing is paid for monthly. To secure rooms in the University buildings, application may be made by letter to the Proctor; but if the rent is not deposited with him before the 15th of September, the room is considered to be unengaged. UNIVERSITY BOARDING CLUB. Apply to the Manager of the Club for further information upon the subject of the boarding clubs, which have been in successful operation during several sessions. Over eighty students have been boarding in two distinct clubs in different locations within the precincts. Boarding Houses near the University. Dr. Chancellor's; Mrs. Emerson's; Mrs. McKennie's; Mrs. Garth's; Morea, by Mrs. Smith; Mrs. Smithson's; Ivy House, by Mr. Smith; Mrs. Keller's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REGULATIONS. LATE ENTRANCE AND WITHDRAWAL. No abatement is made in the matriculation, tuition fees and room rent, on account of late entrance, unless the student enter after the first of January, and no portion of the same is refunded on account of withdrawal from the University before the close of the session, unless the withdrawal be rendered necessary by ill health, and occur before the first of March. The charges for board, fuel, lights, and washing, are estimated from the time of entrance. Many disadvantages to the student result from late entrance; therefore prompt attendance at the beginning of the session is earnestly enjoined upon all who wish to derive the full benefits of the course of instruction. PROHIBITION OF CREDIT. An act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting students. The license to contract debts, which the chairman is authorized to grant, is confined (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing,) to cases of urgent necessity; and these, it is hoped, parents and guardians will as far as possible prevent from arising by the timely supply of the requisite funds. PRIVILEGED STUDENTS. Ministers of the Gospel may attend any of the schools of the University without the payment of tuition fees. The same privilege will be extended to any young man preparing for the ministry, on condition that he shall submit testimonials that he is a bona fide candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet the expenses of education at the University without aid. LIBRARY. Wm. Wertenbaker, Librarian. F. W. Page, Assistant Librarian. The Library of the University, originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, and since enlarged by purchases and donations, now contains about 36,000 volumes. Valuable additions are made from the donation of $1,000 per annum for five years by W. W. Corcoran, Esq., of Washington, D. C. Students are allowed the use of the books under the usual restrictions, and the librarian is present in the library for four hours daily, to attend to their wants. BROOKS MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY. Persons at a distance, who may desire to consult this library by correspondence, can do so on payment of a small charge, proportioned to the time and labor expended on the research required, copying of titles, or passages from authors, &amp;c. A letter on this subject, prepaid, and addressed to Frederick W. Page, Esq., Assistant Librarian, will receive attention. BROOKS MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY. This Museum consists of well-selected cabinets of Zoology, Mineralogy and Geology, arranged in a handsome building, erected for the purpose, according to the plans of a competent architect. They furnish ample means of illustration in their several departments. The building and its various cabinets are the gift of the late Mr. Lewis Brooks, of New York. A Botanical collectionâwhich formed a part of the original plan of Mr. Brooks, but had not been provided for before his deathâhas been presented by his brothers, the Rev. Lemuel Brooks and Mr. Garey Brooks, of New York, and is now in its proper place in the Botanical Hall. INFIRMARY. There is a well-appointed infirmary connected with the University for the care and comfort of sick students. Every student on admission deposits the infirmary fee, ($7.50,) which entitles him, in case of sickness during the session, to the advice and attention of the infirmary physicians, (Professors in the Medical Department,) and if necessary, to nursing by professional nurses, without additional charge. LITERARY SOCIETIES. There are two Literary Societies ("the Washington Society" and the "Jefferson Society") of long standing connected with the University. They meet weekly in their respective halls for the purpose of cultivating debate and composition, and occasionally hold public exhibitions. DISCIPLINE. Morality and Religion are recognized as the foundation and indispensable concomitants of education. The dicipline of the University is sedulously administered with a view to confirm integrity and to maintain a sacred regard for truth. Great efforts are made to surround the students with religious influences; but experience has proved that the best way to effect this result is to forbear the employment of coercion; the attendance on religious exercises is therefore entirely voluntary. Prayers are held every morning in the chapel, and divine service is performed twice on Sunday by a chaplain, selected in turn from the principal religious denominations. UNIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIPS. YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. This society seeks to bring new students under good influences, and furnishes opportunities for Christian work in the University and its neighborhood. It has been in active operation many years. It has established and maintained the STUDENTS' UNIVERSITY READING ROOM. This is convenient of access, comfortably arranged and furnished, and supplied with a large selection of the best periodical literature. It is open to all members of the University upon the payment of a fee to meet its current expenses. FRIENDS OF TEMPERANCE. The Friends of Temperance are represented by University Council, No. 46, an association which has done good service in guarding young men against dangerous excesses, and in promoting literary and moral culture. MONTHLY CIRCULAR. At the end of every month a circular letter is addressed by the Chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from lectures and examinations, and any other irregularities of which he may have been guilty, together with such further information as to the student's progress and conduct as it may be deemed proper to communicate, or as the parent or guardian may specially request. The object of such reports being, on the one hand, to incite the student to steady diligence, by eliciting the commendation and encouragement of his friends; and, on the other, to restrain him from idleness and disorder, or to urge him to amendment by their admonition and advice; their usefulness greatly depends upon the prompt and judicious attention they receive from those to whom they are addressed. Parents and guardians, therefore, cannot be too earnest in communicating such advice or encouragement as the monthly reports may suggest. UNIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIPS. Eleven Scholarships, entitling the successful candidates at a competitive examination to prosecute their studies for one session at the University of Virginia without the payment of matriculation fees or tuition fees, will be open to new-comers from all the States at the beginning of the next academic year (October 1st). Of these eleven Scholarships five are in the Academic Department, and two each in the departments of Law; of Medicine; and of Industrial Chemistry, Civil and Mining Engineering VIRGINIA STUDENTS. and Agriculture. The examination is uniform, and embraces Latin, Greek, Mathematics, and English. In order to secure positive attainments the right is reserved to reject any papers that do not reach the standard required for distinction at the Final Examination in Junior Latin, Junior Greek, and Junior Mathematics, and do not show a competent acquaintance with the grammatical and rhetorical structure of the English language. VIRGINIA STUDENTS. Under a late act of the Legislature, students from Virginia over eighteen years of age are, on examination, admitted into the Academic Schools without being required to pay tuition fees therein. The expenses of such students, exclusive of text-books, clothing, and pocket-money, will beâ For those who board, from $232 to $259. For those who mess, $200.50. By authority of the General Assembly, the following regulations have been adopted by the Board of Visitors as to the General and Special Examinations for admission of Virginia students into the University: General Examination. Applicants are required to pass, once for all, to entitle them to matriculation, on their first coming to the University, an examination in the English language and in Arithmetic. In English, they will be required to show both a practical knowledge of the language, as proved by orthography and by correctness in composition, and a theoretical knowledge of the inflections and Syntax. In Arithmetic, they will be required to know the elementary processes, Vulgar and Decimal Fractions, Proportion, and the metric system of Denominate Numbers. Special Examinations. After passing the General Examination, the Virginia students who desire to study Latin, Greek, Mathematics, or History and Literature, will be required to pass the following Special Examinations for each school: I. For admission to the School of Latinâthe full knowledge of the Inflections of the language will be rigorously demanded; besides this, acquaintance with the elementary principles of Syntax, and ability to translate any passage from Books I and II of CÃ¦sar's Commentaries, or from Cicero's four orations against Catiline. II. For admission to the School of Greekâa full and exact knowledge VIRGINIA STUDENTS. of the Attic Inflections, especially of the verb, will be rigorously demanded; besides this, acquaintance with the elementary principles of Syntax, and ability to translate any passage from the first two books of Xenophon's Anabasis. III. For admission to the School of Mathematicsâthe knowledge of Algebra, embracing the fundamental operations, simple and quadratic equations, and proportion, and the first three books of Plane Geometry. IV. For admission to the School of History and Literature: For the Class of HistoryâModern Geography, and an Elementary History of Greece, Rome, the United States, or England; for the Class of Literatureâan Elementary History of England. For admission to the other Academic Schools, not specified above' only the General Examination will be required. The preparation required for the advanced classes, Intermediate or Senior, in the several schools, is shown by the courses laid down in the Catalogue. The examinations of Academic Students from Virginia, over eighteen years of age, for admission under the late act of the Legislature, will be held on the 26th, 27th, 28th, and 29th of September. All students that intend to apply for examination under the law are urged to report themselves promptly to the Chairman of the Faculty before the beginning of the session, (1st of October) Those that come later, after the work of the session has begun, will of necessity be subjected to inconvenience and delay. The time of the special examinations will be fixed by the several professors, each for his own school. The Faculty of the University, prompted by their experience of the preliminary examinations of the present session, wish most earnestly to call the attention of the public, and especially of their brother teachers in Virginia, to the importance of accuracy and thoroughness in the elements of education, especially in English orthography and composition, in elementary geography and history, in arithmetic, and in the inflections of the classical languages. Students that are well grounded in these elementary studies can do well from the first, and can advance themselves steadily from class to class; but looseness and inaccuracy of knowledge in these lead only to prolonged and disheartening failure. The stress of the preliminary examinations will, therefore, be laid upon accuracy in elementary knowledge. Note.âIn the Schools of Greek and Mathematics, young men are advised to prepare themselves at least for the intermediate classes. DONATIONS. DONATIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. Under an act of the Legislature, entitled "A bill to encourage donations to the University of Virginia, and to constitute the State of Virginia the trustee thereof," "any person may deposit in the treasury of this State, or bequeath money, stock, or public bonds of any kind, to be so deposited, or grant, devise, or bequeath property, real or personal, to be sold, and the proceeds to be so deposited, in sums not less than one hundred dollars, which shall be invested in certificates of debt of the State of Virginia, or of the United States, or any other State thereof, for the benefit of the University of Virginia; and in such case the interest or dividend accruing on such stock, certificates of debt or bonds, shall be paid to the Rector and Visitors of the University, to be by them appropriated to the general purposes thereof, unless some particular appropriation shall have been designated by the donor or testator as hereinafter provided.âThe State of Virginia is hereby constituted the trustee for the safekeeping and due application of all funds which may be deposited in the treasury in pursuance of this act."
