      <field name="fulltext">A 3 TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE COUNTESS OF SUSSEX. Madam, I Should not intreat your Ladyship's acceptance of the following sheets, if they had not a moral tendency: if they were not designed to countenance virtue and to discourage vice. At a time when this nation swarms with fictitious narratives of the most licentious and immoral turn, it may have some good effect to shew what strict regard to virtue and decorum is paid by writers amongst the Chinese, notwithstanding the deplorable ignorance they labour under of those sublime and noble truths, which we enjoy to so little purpose. A 4 To prepare these volumes for the public, has been the agreeable employment of some vacant hours of rural life: and I shall be happy, if the perusal of them can supply your Ladyship's leisure with amusement. One reward of my labours I have already obtained, in the opportunity they afford me of acknowledging the great obligations I am under to the House of SUSSEX, and to your Ladyship in particular, and of pouring forth every ardent wish for the happiness and welfare of that noble family, to which I owe so much. I am, Madam, Your Ladyship's most obliged, and faithful Servant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PREFACE. THE following translation was found in manuscript, among the papers of a gentleman who had large concerns in the East-India Company, and occasionally resided much at Canton* * The Manuscript is dated 1719, which was the last Year he spent in China. He died in 1736. . It is believed by his relations, that he had bestowed considerable attention on the Chinese language, and that this translation (or at least part of it) was undertaken by him as a kind of exercise while he was studying it: the many interlineations, &amp;c. which it abounds with, shew it to be the work of a learner: and as the manuscript appears in many places to have been first written with a black-lead pencil, and afterwards more correctly over-written with ink, it should seem to have been drawn up under the direction of a Chinese master or tutor. The History is contained in four thin folio books or volumes of Chinese paper; which after the manner of that country, are doubled in the fore-edge, and cut on the back. The three first of these volumes are in English: the fourth in Portuguese; and written in a different hand from the former. This part the Editor hath now translated into our own language. The missionaries have given abstracts and versions of several Chinese books, which may be seen in the curious collection of P. Du Halde. Among them are some few novels. As these are but short pieces, the Editor thought it would be no unacceptable present to the curious to afford them a specimen of a larger kind: that they might see how a Chinese Author would conduct himself through the windings of a long narration. Although the general character of a people should not be drawn from one or two individuals; nor their literary excellence determined by the particular merit of one book: yet it may be concluded that the following is a piece of considerable note among the Chinese, otherwise a stranger would not have been tempted to translate it. That book would naturally be put first into the hands of a foreigner, which is in highest repute among the natives. Such as it is, the Editor here presents it to the Public. Examined by the laws of European criticism, he believes it liable to many objections. It will doubtless be urged, that the incidents are neither sufficiently numerous, nor all of them ingeniously contrived; that the imagery is often neither exact nor lively; that the narrative is frequently dry and tedious, and while it runs out into a minute detail of unimportant circumstances, is too deficient in what should interest the passions or divert the imagination. That there is a littleness and poverty of genius in almost* * Perhaps their taste in gardening ought to be excepted. all the works of taste of the Chinese, must be acknowledged by capable judges. This at least is evident in their writings; and in a narrative like the following, would make a writer creep along through a minute relation of trifling particulars, without daring to omit the most inconsiderable. The abjectness of their genius may easily be accounted for from that servile submission, and dread of novelty, which inslaves the minds of the Chinese, and while it promotes the peace and quiet of their empire, dulls their spirit and cramps their imagination. It ought, however, to be observed in favour of the Chinese, that if they do not take such bold and daring flights as some of the other Eastern nations, neither do they run into such extravagant absurdities. Whether this be owing to the cause now assigned, or to their having bestowed more attention on literature, so it is that they pay a greater regard to truth and nature in their fictitious narratives, than any other of the Asiatics. For it must be allowed to our present work, that the conduct of the story is more regular and artful than is generally seen in the compositions of the East; hath less of the marvellous and more of the probable. It contains an unity of design or fable, and the incidents all tend to one end, in a regular natural manner, with little interruption or incoherence. After all, the Editor is not concerned about the judgment that will be passed on this performance, and neither attempts to conceal nor extenuate its faults. He gives it not as a piece to be admired for the beauties of its composition, but as a curious specimen of Chinese litera- ture, and leaves to the critics to decide its merit. But he also begs it may be considered in another light, as a faithful picture of Chinese manners, wherein the domestic and political oeconomy of that vast people is displayed with an exactness and accuracy to which none but a native could be capable of attaining. To read in a Collection of Voyages and Travels; in a portion of Universal History; or in a Present State of any Country, an elaborate account of it, under the several heads of its customs, laws, government, &amp;c. drawn up by a foreigner however well acquainted with the subject, can convey but a superficial knowledge to the mind. Those accurate compilations have certainly their merit, but the little distinguishing peculiarities which chiefly compose the true character of a living people will hardly be learnt from them. Many of these can come under no regular head of methodical arrangement. Those writers may give a dead resemblance, while they are careful to trace out every feature, but the life, the spirit, the expression will be apt to escape them. To gain a true notion of these we must see the object in action. There is not a greater difference between the man who is sitting for his portrait, stiffened into a studied composure, with every feature and limb under constraint; and the same person unreserved, acting in his common sphere of life, with every passion in play, and every part of him in motion: than there is between a Vol. I. a people methodically described in a formal account, and painted out in the lively narrative of some domestic history. A foreigner will form a truer notion of the genius and spirit of the English, from one page of Fielding, and one or two writers now alive, than from whole volumes of Present States of England, or French Letters concerning the English Nation. But not to mention that many curious customs and peculiarities of a nation are better understood by example than by description: many of these cannot easily be known to foreigners at all. The whole system of the manners of a people can only be thoroughly known to themselves. The missionaries are the only foreigners from whom we can possibly expect compleat and accurate accounts of China, for none besides themselves were ever permitted to range at large through the Chinese empire: but let it be considered, that supposing we had no reason to question their veracity* * This requires some explanation. Most of the accounts of China have been given by missionaries of the Jesuite order. Now these accounts have been taxed, as partial and defective, especially so far as they describe the religious ceremonies of the Chinese. For the reader is to be informed that the Jesuites have been accused by the missionaries of other orders, of making very improper concessions to their Chinese converts, and of so modelling christianity, as to allow an occasional conformity to many pagan superstitions, under a pretence that they are only of a civil nature. How far this charge was true, we will not pretend to determine, but probably it was not altogether groundless, as sentence was given against them by their superiors. These disputes have subsisted near a century; and in all the descriptions of China, published by the Jesuites during this period, it may be expected they would give such an account of the Chinese ceremonies, as would best favour their cause. , yet the very gravity of their a 2 character† † Un air serieux et grave est celuy qu'un missionnaire doit prendre, et retenir inviolablement jusques dans l' interieur de sa maison, s'il veut que les Chinois l'estiment &amp; que ses paroles fassent impression sur leurs esprits. Lett. edif. viii. p. 238. would prevent them from being ocular witnesses (not only of the idolatrous ceremonies, but) of many particulars of the interiour conduct of the Chinese. It is well known that this people affect a privacy and reserve beyond all other nations, which must prevent many of their domestic customs from transpiring to strangers: and therefore the intire manners of the Chinese can only be thoroughly described by themselves. Thus much in favour of the present, which the Editor here makes to the Public. It behoves him now to mention the share he hath had in preparing it for their acceptance. As the version was the work of a gentleman whose province was trade, and who probably never designed it for the Public, nothing could be expected from him but fidelity to the original: and this, if one may judge from the erasures and corrections that abound in the manuscript, was not neglected; which the general prevalence of the Chinese idiom will serve to confirm. The Editor therefore hath been so far obliged to revise the whole, as to render the language somewhat more grammatical and correct. Yet as the principal merit of such a piece, as this, must consist in the peculiarities of its style and manner, he hath been careful to make no other alterations than what grammar and common sense merely required. He is desirous to a 3 conceal none of its faults, and he hopes he hath obscured none of its beauties. He hath been particularly exact in retaining the imagery, the allusions, the reflections, the proverbial sayings, any uncommon sentiment or mode of expression, and as much of the Chinese idiom in general as was not utterly inconsistent with the purity of our own: and when he could not retain this in the text; he hath frequently been careful to preserve it in the margin* * It may not be improper to mention here, that in the Translator's manuscript, the whole work being divided but into XVI. Chapters, and these being of an inconvenient length, it was thought necessary to subdivide them afresh: yet because there is reason to believe that the former are the divisions of the Chinese author, we have every where preserved them in the margin. . Sometimes where the narrative was insupportably diffuse and languid, interrupted by short questions and answers of no conse- quence, or retarded by dull and unmeaning repetitions: in these cases he could not help somewhat shortening and contracting it; and probably the most rigid admirer of Chinese literature, would have pardoned him, if he had done this oftener. As the great fault of the original was its prolixity, it was generally more requisite to prune away than to add; yet as the Editor hath been sometimes tempted to throw in a few words, it may be proper to inform the Reader that these will generally be found included in brackets. Once or twice where the incidents were inartificially conducted, a discovery which seemed rather premature, hath been postponed for a few pages, but never without notice to the reader. Some few inconsistencies and contradictions have been removed by the Editor, but generally such as the Transla- a 4 tor himself had corrected in some other place: and where he had rendered a Chinese title improperly, it hath been set right from better authorities: two or three instances have occurred of this kind, wherein it was thought unnecessary to detain the Reader with particular information. But even this liberty hath never been assumed, where there could be the least doubt of its propriety. In short, as the grand merit of such a piece as this must consist in its peculiarities and authenticity; the reader may be assured that nothing hath been done to lessen the one or impair the other. This close attachment to the original may perhaps be blamed, as it hath prevented the style from being more lively and flowing; but the Editor had in view rather to satisfy the curious than to amuse the idle. It may have rendered the book less entertaining, but he believes more valuable. It was his intention, however, to have removed all such expressions, as were quite barbarous and ungrammatical, yet he cannot be sure but instances of both will be found to have escaped him. If any thing faulty of this kind should occur, he hopes the candid will pardon it as one of those oversights, which will sometimes elude the most vigilant attention. It remains that something be said concerning the Notes, if it be only to apologize for their frequency and length. It was at first intended to have incumbered the page with as few of these as possible: but it was soon found necessary to depart from this plan. The manners and customs of the Chinese, their peculiar ways of thinking, and modes of expression are so remote from our own, that they frequently require a large detail to render them intelligible. The Editor quickly saw that he should have occasion to touch upon most things remarkable among the Chinese: this tempted him to introduce a short account of others. He was desirous that the History and Notes taken together might be considered as forming a concise, and not altogether defective account of the Chinese, such as might be sufficient to gratify the curiosity of most readers, and to refresh the memory of others. This he hopes will serve as an apology for such of the Notes as appear impertinent or digressive. Where the narrative can interest or entertain the Reader, he will not suffer them to take off his attention: and where it is dull and tedious, they may possibly prove no unwelcome relief. The Editor was the less sparing of them, in hopes they might procure the book a second perusal: he can truly affirm, that they are extracted from the best and most authentic writers on the subject, many of which are scarce and curious: and that they will be frequently found to supply omissions in more celebrated and more voluminous accounts of China. The Editor wishes he could as easily apologize for some of the Notes which he is afraid will be thought unimportant and trifling: but, after the labour of inquiry many things will appear more deserving of attention than they really are; and such is the weakness of the human mind, that it is apt to estimate things not so much by their intrinsic worth, as by the difficulty and pains with which they were acquired. After all, 'tis hoped there will not be found many instances of this kind, and that these will be pardoned for the sake of others more curious and important. The Editor ought not to conclude without returning thanks to that Gentleman, to whose friendship he is indebted for the use of the manuscript here printed: who not only gave him leave to commit this piece to the press, but in the most obliging manner indulged him with the free use of all the Translator's papers, many of which contributed to throw light upon it. His thanks are also due to those Gentlemen of distinction, who so obligingly gave him access to their libraries, and thereby enabled him to prefix to his Notes a list of Authors, that would do honour to a much more considerable publication. The assistance received from the Earl of Sussex's library deserves particularly to be acknowledged; the treasures of literature contained in that large and valuable collection are so well known to the learned world* * Vide MSS. Yelverton. in Catalog. Libror. MSS Ang. à T.

      <field name="fulltext">[1]Vol. I. B HAU KIOU CHOAAN. A CHINESE HISTORY. BOOK I. CHAP. I. IN the city of Tah-ming* * Tah-ming-foo or Tai-ming-fou, as it is written by Du Halde, is a city of the first order, and is south of Pe-king, being in the same province with it. See Pere Du Halde's Description of China, in 2 vols. folio, printed for Cave 1738, which is the translation always referred to in the following notes. N. B. Foo or fou signifies a city. , formerly lived a student named Tieh-chung-u, of great endowments of body and mind: for the beauty of his person, which equaled that of the finest woman, he was called the handsome Tieh: yet was his temper no less rough and impetuous than his form was elegant and pleasing: bold and resolute in resenting affronts, without any regard or awe of his superiors; yet strictly just, humane, generous, and noble, never so happy as when employed in assisting and relieving the distressed. His father, whose name was Tieh-ying, was a Mandarine of justice: his mother's name was Sheh-sheh: his father belonged to one of the tribunals in the palace, but because of the violent temper of his son, confined him at his house in another city* * 'Tis the custom in China for Mandarines to have their houses in a different place from that where they hold their office. Translator. , lest he should involve him in Vol. B 2 any trouble at court. There he lived and kept house, pursuing his studies, and at proper intervals unbending his mind with company. When he had attained his sixteenth year, his father and mother began to think of marrying their son* * The Chinese drink often between meals. Trans. . They acquainted him with it; but he was no way disposed to concur with their intentions: on the contrary, he urged that marriage was not like an acquaintance or friendship, which could not be quitted on any dislike or disagreement† † See the notes at the end of the vol. p. 231. : that whenever he should incline to marry, he would take more than common care in his choice: but should hardly think of it 'till he could meet with a lady possessed of every perfection of mind and person. These arguments weighed so deeply with his parents, that they left him to himself. When he had arrived at his twentieth year, one day as he was amusing himself with reading an ancient history, and drinking between whiles* * The Chinese drink often between meals. Trans. , he met with the story of an Emperor, who sent to one of his Mandarines, named Pé-kan, for his heart† † See note among the additions at the end of the vol. to make a medical potion for his queen, who was sick. Pé-kan immediately suffered himself to be opened, and his heart to be taken out in obedience to the Emperor's order. Here the young Tieh-chung-u saw how much the great were exposed to the fatal caprice B 3 of Princes, and how far more desirable was a life of obscurity. But more particularly struck with the great resignation of Pé-kan, he was led to reflect on that duty and obedience he had been wanting in to his parents. So deeply was he stung with remorse, that he passed the night without sleep. At length he resolved to go and throw himself at their feet; and to implore their pardon for that stubbornness of temper, which had kept him so long apart from them. Full of these resolutions he arose in the morning, and taking with him only one servant named Siow-tan, left his house and set out for the court. He had been now two days on the road, and so impatient to see his father, as to neglect almost all repose and refreshment, when he found himself on the approach of night far from any house of reception for travellers* * The inns in China are commonly mean, being generally four walls made of earth, without plaister or floor, except in the greatest roads of all, where they are large and handsome: but it is necessary for travellers to carry their beds with them (commonly a quilt or two) or they must lie on a mat. See P. Du Halde, &amp;c. . At length he came where at some distance was a large village, but near were only a few scattered cottages of very poor people: at one of these he alighted, and calling, an old woman came to him: who seeing him drest in his student's habit, said to him, "Siang-coon, or young gentleman, I suppose you are come from court B 4 hither to visit Wey-fiang-coon, or our young student of this village." He said he knew no such person. She enquired what then could bring him thither. He told her he had lost his road, and intreated her to give him room in some part of her house to pass the night. She said he was welcome, and that she was only sorry she could not entertain him as he deserved. His servant Siow-tan brought in his bed and other travelling furniture: and the old woman shewed him a place for his horse, furnished out a room for him with clean straw, and brought him tea. Tieh-chung-u having refreshed himself a little, asked why she was so inquisitive at his arrival, and who the young student was whom she had mentioned. "You don't know perhaps, said she, that this village was not formerly called as, as it was at present, Wey-tswün* * Tswün in the Chinese language signifies a village. Trans. , but received that name from a family that lives here, who were once great people at court, but are now reduced to the meanest condition. But thank heaven, there is one of the family, who altho' poor, understands letters: he went to court to undergo his examination† † Called by the Chinese Kow-shé. As all civil offices in China are bestowed according to personal merit, no wonder that the study of letters is in the highest esteem, and that the examinations of students are conducted with the greatest decorum, solemnity, and exactness. There are several lesser examinations before the students are admitted to be examined for the degree of Sieou-tsai (answering to Batchelor of arts in our universities): the examination for which is made once in three years in each of the largest districts of the province before the Mandarines, who seldom conser it on more than four or five out of a hundred.—The examinations for the second degree, or Kiu-gin (answering to Master of arts or Licentiate in Europe) are also once in three years at the capital of the whole province, at which all the Sieou-tsai are obliged to attend: out of ten thousand of whom perhaps only sixty are admitted. This degree intitles them to lower offices: but the highest employments are sure to be conferred on those who can obtain the degree of Tsin-seé (or Doctor) which they are examined for the year after they have obtained the former degree (but this they are not obliged to attend) at Pe-king before the Emperor himself: who seldom confers this degree on more than one hundred and fifty out of five or six thousand candidates. Each of these degrees is conferred according to their proficiency in history, politics, morality, but a particular regard is had to their skill in composing in their own language, and the knowledge of their laws. Similar examinations and degrees are also appointed for their military people. P. Du Halde, Vol. 1. p. 376. : there he met with a friend, a learned man, named Han- yuen, who conceived a great fondness for him; and having one only daughter would give her to him in marriage: for which purpose he caused him to take a pledge. 'Tis now four years since he was betrothed, without ever fetching home his wife, not having wherewithal to maintain her. Some time since she happened to be seen by a great Mandarine, who fell in love with her, and would have her for a second wife, or concubine, which the father and mother would by no means consent to. This enraged the nobleman, who contrived many ways to get her, and at last carryed her off by force. Wey-siang-coon was advised of his loss, and repaired to the court to make his complaint: but not knowing how to apply for relief, and unable to learn news of his wife or her relations, all whom the Mandarine had secured, he returned home in despair. Since that time, his mother, fearing he might make himself away, hath desired the assistance of her neighbours to prevent such a misfortune." While she was yet talking, they heard a great noise and disturbance in the street: they looked out and saw a crowd of people, and in the midst of them a young man clad in blue* * The habit of those who have taken the lowest degree, or Sieou-tsai, is a blue gown, with a black border round it, and a pewter or silver bird on the top of their cap.—Those who have taken the second degree, or Kiu-gin, are distinguished by a gown of a dark colour with a blue border: the bird in their cap is gold, or copper gilt.—The first degree, or that of Tsin-seé, is also distinguished by a habit different from the former, but more particularly by a girdle which they always wear at their governments, but is more rich and precious according to the offices they are advanced to. P. Du Halde ubi supra. Semedo's hist. p. 46. &amp;c. , who wept and lamented. In the crowd the old woman saw her husband, whom she called to her, and informed of their guest: he blamed her for having delayed to provide a supper for the stranger, and commanded her to hasten it. Of this man Tieh-chung-u enquired whether the student's wife was carried off by night or by day? He told him, in the day time. He then asked if there were none that saw it. He was answered there were several, but none that durst open their lips: for who would be forward to appear against so great and powerful a Mandarine? Here the old woman interrupted, begging them to talk no more of it, for that now there was no remedy. Tieh-chung-u smiled and said, "You people of the villages are so fainthearted and doubtful! but perhaps you know not the truth of the story, and all you have been telling me is a fiction." "By no means, she replied, nettled at his affected incredulity; I know it to be true: a cousin of mine who sells straw at the court, by great chance was present, and saw both the young woman and also her father and mother carried into the Mandarine's house, which is a palace of retirement given him by the Emperor, who hath made it sacred to every body but himself and to whom he pleases." "Why did not you advise the young man of this?" said Tieh-chung-u. "To what purpose? said the other: it is in vain for him to contend." He then enquired where this palace stood: she told, him without the city: but though he should find it, no one durst look into it. Supper being ready they ended talking: after which he called his servant Siow-tan to lay his bed, being fatigued and sleepy. In the morning when he had breakfasted, he ordered his servant to weigh out five mace* * About 3s. 4d. English money. Trans. to pay the old woman: he then took leave of her with many thanks for her kind treatment: she in return asked him pardon for any thing that was amiss; but particularly intreated him not to open his lips about what she had told him, as well for his own safety as hers.—"What is that affair to me? he replied: your kind entertainment of me is all I have to remember: fear nothing." The old woman waited on him to the great road, and there took her leave of him. Tieh-chung-u mounted his horse, and was got two or three lee* * A lee is as far as a voice can be heard: ten of them make a league. Trans. N. B. The French missionaries write it ly, or li. on his way, when he perceived at some distance before him Wey-siang-coon stamping and raving by himself, calling out to heaven and complaining of his fate. Tieh-chung-u no sooner discovered who he was, but he made all haste to come up to him: when dismounting† † 'Tis the custom in China to dismount, when they salute equals or betters. Trans. from his horse, he ran to him and clapped him on the shoulder: "Brother, said he, yield not up to despair: your cause of grief may be removed: I'll use my endeavours, and doubt not but to get your fair mistress restored to you." Surprised at being accosted in this manner, the student lifted up his eyes and looked stedfastly at him; when seeing him to be a person of good and genteel aspect, but utterly unknown to him, he was the Vol. I. C more astonished: nevertheless he said, "Sir, you seem to be a man of rank and consideration: I am a poor and mean person. Till this moment I never had the honour to see you. I am plunged in the deepest sorrow and affliction: but I cannot account for your knowledge of it. The words you spoke just now have so rejoiced me, that I think they could only come from Heaven. But, alas! 'tis all in vain! my misfortune is so great that it is not possible for you, tho' you were an angel* * The Chinese believe there are a kind of tutelar spirits, or good Genii: in the cities there are temples to them, in which the Mandarines offer sacrifice: as also to the spirits of the rivers, mountains, four parts of the world, &amp;c. P. Semedo's hist. part. 1. chap. 18. p. 86. , to afford me relief." Tieh-chung-u laughed, and said, "This is no more than the sting of a bee: if I can't untye this knot, let the world laugh at me. In former times there were heroes who could perform great atchievements: and why not now?" Wey-siang-coon thought there was something in this more than ordinary: "Sir, said he, I perceive you are a person of uncommon merit: I ask your pardon: pray, how am I to call you?" "That, replied Tieh-chung-u, it is not necessary for you to know at present: but I must beg to be informed of your own original name* * The other was his complimental name, bestowed on account of his profession. Trans. , and where you would betake yourself, for I have something to say to you farther." "My name, said he, is Wey-phey, and I should go find out some way to end my life, but for C 2 my mother, who is a widow, and depends on me alone for her support. For her sake I endure my misfortunes, and have sought all means of relief: none offers now but to write a petition and carry it to court, there to present myself with it to some Mandarine: if he refuses to accept it I will go to another; and so on 'till I find one that will: if none will do me justice, I can then but dye: I shall dye in the face of the world, and not meanly in secret." And taking out his petition, he gave it to Tieh-chung-u; who read it, and found the wife's father to be a Doctor of law* * The second degree, called Kiu-gin, perhaps answers better to the degree of Master of arts or Licentiate in the European universities: however, as it is rather a civil distinction, Doctor of law seems to convey a more adequate idea. See note above. See P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 377. , of the second degree. The Mandarine also, who had committed the violence, was not unknown to him. "Very well, said he, this petition is right, and must be presented to the Emperor; he has power: to apply to any other audience beside will be to no purpose: nor would it avail to carry it to the Emperor yourself. Intrust it to my care, perhaps I may have an opportunity to serve you." Wey-phey bowed down and embraced his feet. "Sir, said he, the joy your compassion excites in my heart is like the springing forth of tender leaves from the withered branches of a tree. If you do me this favour in procuring my petition to be seen, 'tis not fitting I stay here: let me rather follow your horse's feet and wait on you to court." C 3 "Should you go with me, answered Tieh-chung-u, it might alarm the world: it is much better for you to return to your village: within ten days expect to hear from me." "Sir and brother, said Wey-phey, this favour you do me is as great as the heaven and the earth." He then shed some tears, and made him a profound reverence. Tieh-chung-u exhorting him to be comforted, took the petition and put it in his sleeve; then bidding him adieu, mounted his horse and put forward. Wey-phey stood amazed and motionless, with his eyes fixed on Tieh-chung-u 'till he was out of sight, not knowing whether what had happened was real or a dream. CHAP. II. THE village of Wey-tswün was distant fifty lee* * Viz, five leagues. from the court, where Tieh-chung-u arrived in two hours: he hastened to his father's house: he found every thing still and quiet before the doors; not a person to be seen. He alighted off his horse, and went into the hall of audience; but neither was one of the clerks, or any one else, to be met with there: he would have proceeded farther, but he found the doors fast shut. He knocked and called; the servants within knew his voice: they unlocked the door, and meeting their young master cryed out! "Bad news! things go very ill!" He asked them, why? "Our master, replied they, is cast C 4 into prison by the Emperor's order: you are now arrived in good time: pray go immediately to our lady your mother's apartment, and advise with her." Tieh-chung-u was struck speechless with surprize and grief, and suffered himself to be led to the door of her apartment. His mother, who was called She-fu-jen, or my Lady Sheh, perceiving him, went and caught hold of his sleeve, crying, "My son, you are arrived in good time. Your father has discharged the part of a good man, with the most unwearied perseverance: eager to redress grievances, he would be presenting petitions, from morning to night* * The Chinese idiom is, "your father to-day would be a good man, to-morrow would be a good man; he would be presenting petitions," &amp;c. : there has happened an affair of great consequence: I know not whether he is dead or alive: he is in prison." Tieh-chung-u fell into a violent transport of grief: but observing, how deeply his mother was affected, he fell upon his knees before her and said: "Mother, be not cast down, you must not give yourself up to affliction: though the affair be as great as the heavens are high, we must not yield to despair: we must consult together: you must tell me plainly all that has happened." She bade him rise and take a chair, then told him as follows: "Some days ago, as your father was returning from the Emperor's palace, he was stopped in his way home by an old man and his wife, who had their hair loose and disordered, their faces bruised and bloody, and their cloaths rent: they threw themselves before his horse's feet, crying out for justice. Your father asked them who they were, and by whom they were injured. I am a Doctor of law, said the old man, of the second degree, my name is Han-yuen: I have a daughter, whom I have long promised in marriage: but a great Mandarine, named Tah-quay, hearing of her, and that she was something handsome, ordered people to come, and propose terms of marriage, for her to be a second wife, or concubine* * The Chinese laws allow but one, who can properly be called a wife. Yet they may have several second wives or concubines, whose situation is not at all disreputable: but they are greatly dependent on the first, who alone is mistress of the house. Their children are deemed to belong to the true wife, and inherit equally with her own. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 304. to him: I answered, that it was impossible for me to consent, for I had already engaged her to another: if he has a mind to take my life, I am content; but I can never yield to give him my daughter. Tah-quay was much enraged: "What! said he, have I made so reasonable a proposal, and am to see it rejected! I'll try whether force can be more successful." Accordingly he sent people to carry her off; which endeavouring to prevent, they abused both of us, in the manner you see. Your father was much affected with his tale, and passionately moved to procure them redress: hurrying home therefore, he instantly drew up a petition to present to the Emperor. But alas, proceeded the Lady Sheh, your father, notwithstanding his great judgement, was at that time overseen, not to secure the two old people for witnesses: for the Emperor, when he had read his petition, demanded what evidence he had to support it. Upon which he went to seek them, but in vain: for Tah-quay had immediate advice of the affair, and instantly secreted them. The awe of his power drew almost all the Manda-rines of the court over to his party. And he in his turn delivered in a petition, wherein he charged your father, with abusing the Emperor's confidence, and possessing him with falsehoods against his faithful servants. Upon this your father's office was taken away, and he was sent to prison. And though some of the Mandarines expressed an inclination to assist him, it was to no purpose, as he had no witnesses to produce in his favour: and if he can procure none, he must suffer death." When she had finished her relation, the countenance of Tieh-chung-u cleared up: "And is Han-yuen, said he, the occasion of all this? this is an affair of trifling consequence; Han-yuen and his daughter every body knows, and the seizing them in their house is known to many. Be no longer dejected, Madam, but take comfort; they cannot be lost. Robbers and thieves, though they be fled into other provinces, are to be found* * It is very difficult for robbers to escape in China: for upon all the great roads at every half league are centries stationed, and the exact notice that the Mandarines have of every thing that passes in their respective wards and districts, makes it very rare that they can lie concealed. One of the Missionaries has said, that a criminal cannot find a hiding place in all that vast empire. See P. Semedo, p. 2. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 266. &amp; passim. , and why not those that are about the court: fear not then but we shall find these people: nay I myself know where they are concealed." "How! said Sheh-fu-jen, is it possible? do you speak certainly true?" "Can a son, said Tieh-chung-u speak untruths before his mother? that can never be." The Lady Sheh at this was greatly rejoiced, and said, "If this news is true, rest a little and refresh yourself: then hasten to see your father in prison, and take away his sorrow." Upon this she ordered a table to be spread for him to eat; which having done, and changed his cloaths, she called for a servant to attend him. "Madam, said Tieh-chung u, there is no occasion for such haste; I will first draw up a petition for my father to shew the Emperor." When he had finished it, he asked his mother for his father's chop or seal: and taking that, together with the petition of Wey-phey, he put them both in his sleeve, and bade the servant shew him the way to his father. The Mandarine, that was governor of the prison, knew Tieh-chung-u, and received him with great courtesy: "Sir, said he, the Mandarine your father is within; pray be pleased to go to him; pardon me that I don't wait on you: you have doubtless something to impart to him in private." Tieh-chung-u returned his civilities in a proper manner, and went in. He found his father sitting, without irons, in great composure. He immediately ran and bowed down four times at his feet; asking pardon for not coming sooner to assist him in his troubles: that he deserved not the name of a son, for being absent when he might have performed him services, or at least have known his commands. Tieh-u-sheh* * The name he received from his office. Trans. raised himself from his chair: "I am, said he, in the place where my duty requires me to be: why are you not at home minding your studies and doing your duty." "Sir, said Tieh-chung-u, if if it is your duty to be here, it is mine also to be here to wait upon you." His father paused: at length he answered, "You are in the right: you do your duty: but we live in times, when the Mandarines of the court are corrupted, and duty has no longer any regard paid to it: from a just sense of mine, I presented my petition, putting to the hazard whether it would be heard or not: and now, whether I shall live or die, is in the hand of the Emperor: your coming here will avail me nothing." "Sir, replied Tieh chung-u, I am made acquainted with the cause of your confinement: but why do you sit down quietly under it: why do not you continue to seek out the old man and his wife; and without trusting to others, petition for leave to do it in your own person." "That, said Vol. I. D Tieh-u-sheh, it would not be difficult to obtain: but I fear, if I should apply for such licence, and be still unsuccessful, it will only aggravate my crime, and increase my disgrace." "I have notice of these three people, said the son, but without an express order from the Emperor, they cannot be apprehended." "His order was issued out at the first, replied the father, but they could not be found: my friends inquired, but could learn no news of them. And that you, who are but just arrived, should know any thing of them, is very unlikely. 'Tis all a jest! you are but a boy, and having heard something of it, from people's discourse, only love to hear yourself talk. Go! you are a simpleton." "Sir, answered Tieh-chung-u, this is a matter which regards your life: is it possible for a son to jest upon such an occasion?" Then looking round to see, that nobody was within hearing, he related all that had happened on his journey, both the discourse he had had with the old woman, and with Wey-phey, whose petition he shewed him. At this Tieh-u-sheh became joyful, and said, "If it be so, the Emperor will see that I am blameless: there will then be no danger of my suffering death. But is it not to be feared, that this Tah quay has poisoned, or otherwise made away with these people?" Tieh-chung-u answered, "The palace where he resides, is the Emperor's gift, which no one can enter: your adversary is a wicked man, and of very D 2 mean understanding; wholly addicted to pleasure, and immersed in luxury, he thinks of nothing farther: imagining himself secure, he neither suspects any danger, nor has contrivance enough to prevent it: be not therefore, Sir, cast down or sorrowful." "Son, said the Mandarine Tieh, you say well: go home now, and fetch some paper and my seal, that I may draw up a petition to the Emperor." "That is already done, said his son, I have here brought it with me: if you like it, let it go: if not, please to draw it up afresh with greater elegance and accuracy." He read it, and pronounced it was very well, and required no alteration: then putting his seal to it, he folded it up, and gave it to the governor of the prison, desiring it might be delivered to a Mandarine of the Emperor's audience chamber, called Tong-ching-su, whose business it is to receive petitions. CHAP. III.* * This is CHAP. II. in the Translator's manuscript. THE Mandarine Tieh-u-sheh, was not two days longer in prison, before the Emperor sent him a private answer to his petition. When every body was retired, he opened it, and found an order to go, and apprehend the persons in question: at this he greatly rejoiced, and making an offering of fire, prayed for the Emperor† † The Editor could meet with no account of this custom; which yet should seem to be the usual one on these occasions. . D 3 Then he took the letter, and folded it up again: and proposed to his son, to set out both of them upon the search. "Pardon me, Sir, said Tieh-chung-u, that must not be. It will excite suspicion: somebody will acquaint Tah-quay of your being abroad, and we shall be disappointed. Let me rather go privately, and when I have broke open the gates, and found the three persons, do you be ready, mount your horse, and bring with you the Emperor's order, openly proclaiming it to be a power to apprehend them." To this his father assented. By this time the Mandarine of the prison came, and inquired what news? for he saw, that they had been making an offering of fire. Tieh-u-sheh injoining him secrecy, informed him of the private order he had received. He then said to his son, "Now go, but be very careful." The youth accordingly withdrew, and went to tell his mother all that had happened. He then asked her for his brazen mace, weighing twenty catty* * The catty or catte is the Chinese pound, and contains sixteen tael: as the tael contains ten mace:—sixteen catte make twenty pounds Portugueze weight, sixteen ounces to the pound. Twenty catty are therefore equivalent to twenty five European pounds. See P. Semedo's hist. part 1. chap. 2. p. 52. N. B. Maces are still in use among the guards that attend a Vice-roy, &amp;c. when he goes in procession. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 253. : which although so heavy, he had been able to manage at eleven or twelve years old, but his parents had taken it from him, lest he should do mischief with it. His mother was suprized at his demand, and D 4 said, "Your father ordered me to lay it up, and never give it you: why do you ask for it? "I am going, replied Tieh-chung-u, to the den of a tiger: if I have not that with me, how shall I defend myself?" When he had received it, he asked for wine, and drank till he made his heart glad: after which, he put on his soldier's habit, and his other dress over it; then ordered a white horse to be got ready, which he mounted, commanding twenty servants of the house to come after him at a distance, but Siow-tan to follow him near. This done, he rode softly on, 'till he was got without the gate of the city: then he set out full speed, till he came to a splendid palace. Here he stopped and alighted. Walking about a little, he came to a court, with three gates, very strong and lofty, and curiously wrought: over the middlemost of these, were inscribed the three characters, Yanghien tang, or the name of the palace. These gates he perceived to be too strong, and too closely shut, for him possibly to open them: but he imagined there must be another entrance besides this to so magnificent a building: and looking round, in an alley he discovered a little gate painted red; over which was this inscription: By the Emperor's order, no one can so much as look in here, under pain of severe punishment. Tieh-chung-u finding a crack in the door, peeped through, and saw a great many servants waiting within, and whispering to one another. He then withdrew as softly as he could to his servant: and taking off his upper coat, which covered his soldier's dress, and grasping at the same time his arms, mounted his horse; appearing with all the glory of an hero, or rather an angel* * i. e. Genius or spirit. See not. p. 17. Altho' the Chinese must differ considerably from us in their notion of spirits, the Translator hath every where used the word angel: and as it is only employed in figurative allusion, the Editor hath ventured to retain it. , in the beauty and gracefulness of his person, and brightness of his arms. "Go now, said he to Siow-tan, and acquaint the servants that are behind to come up: afterwards you shall go to the great Mandarine your master in the prison, and desire him to come presently." Then riding up to the red gate, and there dismounting, he knocked, and called out, saying, "I come here by the Emperor's order, and must speak with the Mandarine Tah-quay; acquaint him with it immediately." The servants answered roughly, "Our master is not here, he is at his palace in the city." " 'Tis false, said he, he is here in the house: ye slaves, do ye mean to oppose the commands of the Emperor?" They stood silent. "Open the door, proceeded he, without delay." One of the servants answered, "As our master is not here, who dares open the door? And if it were open, who dares enter, in defiance of the Emperor's order to the contrary?" Tieh-chung-u in a rage answered, "I have the Emperor's order: if you don't open the door, I shall open it myself." Then lifting up his foot against the gate, and striking the lock with his brazen mace, at one blow he burst it open; this done, he entered, notwithstanding all the resistance of the Mandarine's people. Upon this, some of them ran to acquaint their master, who was employed in examining and punishing the old people, each of them apart, for refusing him their daughter: remonstrating, that it was in his power to make them amends; and that as they were poor, it was foolish obstinacy not to comply with his desires. Poor as they were, they replied, they could not consent to things so unreasonable. "I am a Doctor of the law, said the old man, though of the second degree, and of no mean extraction; and had rather live in indigence, than act so unworthily: your riches will have no effect upon me." Tah-quay grew outrageous at this, and commanded him to be stripped naked, and bound, in order to be whipped. At this instant four or five of his people came running in, who cried out, "Bad news! a very bad affair has happened!" He inquired what. They told him, a very bold young man had forced open the door, under pretence of the Emperor's order. By this time, Tieh-chung-u was advanced as far as the great hall: at which Tah-quay was greatly surprized, and was going to hide himself: but the other came too suddenly upon him. "Ching-leao, your servant Sir, said the youth as he came forward: I am come here by the Emperor's order, to speak with you: why are you denied to me?" "If you have such an order, said the other, why did not you advise me of it before-hand, instead of forcing your way in, with so much noise, impertinence, and insult?" Tieh-chung-u answered, that his order was private, and admitted of no previous notice. Then advancing, with one hand he seized him, and with the other his sword: asking him at the same time, if the Emperor did not give this, for a house of retirement and pleasure, and not for a place to administer public justice: and if so, why was that person stripped naked, and bound? "That man, said he, is my servant, and neither public justice, nor the Emperor, are concerned in what I do to him." "I am not his servant, cry'd the old man, I am a Doctor of law, and independent of him." "If you are a Doctor, said Tieh-chung-u, how came you to be chastised here in this manner? what is your name?" He replied, "Han-yuen." "If your name is Han-yuen, when the Emperor's order came out for your appearance, why did you conceal yourself?" Then looking back, he gave a signal to Siow-tan to call in his servants. "Here, said he to them, take that old man into custody, he is a person under cognizance of the Emperor's tribunal." Tieh-chung-u then renewed his question, why he came there? "I was forced here, answered he, on account of my daughter: and had no more power to resist, than a kid has to withstand a tiger.* * The tiger is almost the only beast of prey known in China: but this beast is exceedingly fierce and dreadful, often committing terrible ravages. See L'Embassade, &amp;c. par Nieuhoff, part 2d. p. 97. Kircheri Chin. p, 52. This animal seems to furnish out the imagery of the Chinese, as constantly as the lion does that of Homer. If you had not come as you did, I know not whether I should have been alive by this time." He then asked him, "Is your daughter here, or your wife?" he answered, "My wife is in an adjoining room; my daughter also is within: she every day persists in her refusal of Tah-quay, and would rather die by her own hands than submit: so that I know not, whether she be dead or alive." Tieh-chung-u at this was deeply affected, and sent his people instantly to secure the mother and daughter. This alarmed Tah-quay, who began to bluster: "How dare you, said he, violate this place, by breaking open the doors, and laying hands on the owner. If I have done amiss, you ought to produce the Emperor's order: without it, you are guilty of an unpardonable outrage." This said, he endeavoured, but in vain, to force away his hand. He then called out to his people, to come and assist him: but Tieh-chung-u bade them it do at their peril: "Who will dare to offer violence to me, who act under the Emperor's authority? Vol. I. E who will lay hands on me?" So saying, he took their master by the girdle, and swung him round, beating down the people, that came to his assistance: until he cried out, "Forbear, forbear; dispute with him no longer." CHAP. IV. IT happened, that at this juncture arrived several great Mandarines of Tah-quay's acquaintance, and seeing him in this situation, trembling like a mouse in the paws of a cat, they said to Tieh-chung-u, "This Mandarine is of great rank, and if he has offended, you must not treat him so as to violate his dignity and honour: but let others, or some of us, know the cause of this difference, that matters may be composed between you." "This man, replied the youth, has deceived the Emperor with false testimony, and is guilty of the greatest crimes: what dignity then, what honour is to be regarded?" "If it be so, replied the Mandarines, the Emperor ought to be informed of it; that he may punish them, as he shall think proper: but it becomes not you to treat him thus." "You say well; said Tieh-chung-u, but being all alone, when I entered the house, if I had not secured him, I should have met with ill treatment." "You are very brave and valiant, said the Mandarines; pray did you come hither to-day, in order to revenge any former quarrel; or to asist these old E 2 people?" "For neither of these reasons, answered he, but by a private order of the Emperor, to apprehend them as persons concealed in this house." "Why does not that order appear? said they, read it to us." He replied, "You shall see it presently." Tah-quay perceiving so many of his acquaintance near him, began to resume courage; "Do not regard him, he cried out; there is no truth in what he says: he is no officer under the Emperor: he is no way impowered to execute his orders: he is no Manda-rine of justice. He is only come with these pretences, to carry off Han-yuen his friend in a lawless manner, together with his wife, and daughter." "If you have not the Emperor's order, said the others turning to Tieh-chung-u, your coming hither to affront this great Mandarine, and thus to violate his honour and dignity, is a crime of the deepest dye. Feats of this kind might have been more safely performed in some distant village: there you might have appeared a valiant fellow. But here, so nigh the city, and limits of the court, to affront a Nobleman, and thus to disgrace his family and rank, is an unpardonable offence: altho' you had wings, you could not escape. But we must send to the city, for the Man-darines of justice." "That is right, said Tieh-chung-u, let them be called." They were accordingly sent for. E 3 Presently arrived the Che foo, and soon after him, the Che-hien* * In all great cities there is a superior Manda-rine or Governor, stiled Che-foo, who is of the fourth order of Mandarines. There are besides, one or more inferior Magistrates, with the title of Che-hien: whose jurisdiction is notwithstanding often of great extent: these are Manda-rines of the seventh order. See P. Du Halde, vol. 1. pag. 2. pag. 251, &amp;c. . The Mandarines rel ted to them, what had happened. "We know not, said those Magistrates, on which side lies the truth: if there is the Emperor's order, it must be read." Then the Che-hien commanded a place for a tribunal to to be prepared, and when it was ready, the order to be produced. Before answer could be made, notice was given that Tieh-u-sheh was arrived. Tah-quay and all the company were amazed: "This man, said they, is under close confinement: how came he here?" Here Tieh-u-sheh entered, holding before him the Emperor's order rolled in yellow* * Yellow is the imperial colour; never worn but by the Emperor, or employed but when he is immediately concerned. P. Du Halde, &amp;c. . His son cried out, "Shew respect to the Emperor's order." On this, they all knelt down. Tieh-u-sheh seeing so many Mandarines present, said, "This order I am commissioned to read; but my eyes being weak, Sir, said he, addressing himself to the Che-foo, be pleased to read it." The Che-foo took the order, and read as follows. "This order requires Tieh-u-sheh to go to the house of Tah-quay, and to E 4 take into custody, Han-yuen, his wife, and his daughter: which three persons, wheresoever concealed, Tieh-u-sheh is hereby impowered to make search after, and to secure." "This order shall continue in force for three days." When he had done, Tieh-u-sheh, and all the company, made their profound reverence, and rose up. The great Mandarines of Tah-quay's acquaintance departed in silence: leaving only the two Mandarines of the city with them. "These three persons, said Tieh u-sheh to the Che-hien, are the Emperor's prisoners: to your custody I commit them, while I go to acquaint his Majesty of it, and know his farther pleasure." Han-yuen paid the most profound respect to Tieh-u-sheh, and acknowledged that himself, his wife, and daughter, owed their lives to his great piety and justice: but he told them, they must thank the Emperor alone, for their preservation and safety; then turning to the Che-foo, he said, "I have committed these persons to the care of the Che-hien, in order to carry them to a superior tribunal: but as Tah-quay is a great Mandarine, and of grave and respectable character, you, Sir, are desired to attend him alone to the same audience." Then Tieh-u-sheh, attended by his son, returned back to prison, to await the Emperor's further order. He then drew up a petition, to acquaint his Majesty of their whole proceedings: which he graciously received, and returned for answer, "You have done well, and have conducted your self through this whole business like a true Mandarine of justice: when the affair is ended you shall be promoted to a higher dignity." Orders were then issued out to release him from prison. Tah quay in the mean time was not idle: he offered presents to the Man-darines of the tribunal: but none of them durst accept any. The depositions of the injured parties lay too strongly against him; and proved beyond all doubt, the forcible seizure they had undergone, and all the other ill usage they had received. The supreme Mandarine of the audience, seeing no other way to bring off his friend, pronounced judgment as follows. "Tah-quay is advanced in years, and is without issue: this induced him to carry away the young woman* * The Chinese look upon it of such sacred importance to leave posterity, that almost any means are esteemed allowable, which conduce to that end. See P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 303, 304. : but though he brought her home to his house, it does not appear that he ever offered her any dishonour. He is descended from an illustrious family: several of his ancestors have served the Emperor in the capacity of Generals, and have made extensive conquests: he himself hath also had his share, and given signal proofs of his ability and courage. All this considered, as the carrying off this young woman was from the motives above recited, and was not followed by any violence, he is neither guilty of a great offence, nor deserving of very severe punishment: but this must be left to the determination of his Majesty." The Emperor issued out this answer to the proceedings of the audience. "Tah-quay* * Here in the original are recited all his titles, Tah quay gkeou shau lee: of which the two first signify his name; the others his rank, answering to Duke with us. Trans. is of an illustrious family; and of a respectable rank: but both these he hath forfeited: he hath made a tyrannical use of his power in forcing away these people: the daughter was already engaged to another; his attempt was therefore the highest injustice: when Tieh-u-sheh delivered in his petition; to secrete them in his house was a contempt of our authority: and to lodge a false accusation against that Man-darine, a great abuse of our confidence. To do justice therefore, 'tis necessary to take away his office: let him also be confined to his house for three years, paying to Han yuen one year's income of his place: and for the sake of his ancestors, let him be excused any farther punishment. The young woman, let Wey-phey marry. Let Han-yuen be advanced to a higher degree. Let Tieh-u-sheh be promoted to the office of Tu-cha-yuen, or Superior of the Viceroys. And lastly, for the Mandarine of the audience, who was judge in this cause, let him be amerced three months of his salary." The determination of the Emperor being made public, every body admired Tieh-chung-u, for his wisdom and courage. His fame spread abroad, and he was the general topic of conversation. Mandarines from all parts came to make him visits of congratulation* * The paying of visits is a great article of Chinese politeness: these are made upon every occasion, and are conducted with the most ceremonious formality, in which every thing is regulated by a public memorial; even to the number of bows, the expressions of compliment, titles, genuflexions, and several turns to the right hand and left, &amp;c. See Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 226. ; from morning to night, some or other came to pay him their compliments. Too much honour and respect conferred on a youth, said the Mandarine pensively to himself, may produce fatal consequences: it may expose him to envy: it may be productive of pride: it may be misrepresented to his prejudice: it may be followed by neglect. "Son, said he, one day calling him to him, the bow will break that is too violently bent: no man should exceed what is fit and becoming. Tah-quay is now a prisoner, but he will one day be at liberty; when you apprehended the people at his house, you disgraced him too much for him ever to forget: he perhaps will hereafter study to requite it, and will pay back the injury, he thinks you have done him. I have now, proceeded he, a great office conferred on me by the Emperor, which I am obliged to attend: whatever be my success, I cannot abandon it: here I must remain: but you are at liberty to go where you please. You have now gained to yourself a great deal of ho-nour; you are admired as a youth of uncommon courage and prudence; nothing at present can add to your reputation; it may be forfeited or tarnished." "Sir, said Tieh-chung-u, I have been so happy, as to entertain the same sentiments myself: far am I from desiring so large a share of the public attention: I had much rather go out of the way of it, did not the duty I owe you, require me to stay, lest you should have occasion for my service." "As to that, replied his father, 'tis no matter; I will excuse you: before I was but a small Mandarine; now I am raised to a superior rank, and fixed above the malice of my enemies: retire therefore from the court, and apply yourself to your studies: nay rather go travel, than continue here. I leave you now to your own direction; but keep a strict guard over your passions: learn to curb your resentment, and to suppress that extravagance of warmth, to which your temper is addicted." Tieh-chung-u bowed in token of obedience, Vol. I. F and went in to take leave of his mother. She was concerned to part with him so suddenly, and intreated him to stay a few days longer. He submitted: but before three days were expired, so many people came to visit him that he was quite wearied out. He bad adieu therefore to his father and mother, and set out, attended only by Siow-tan. He arrived at the city where he had usually lived: but the news of his be-haviour had got there before him: the people were alarmed, and the streets crowded as he passed along. The Mandarines had all notice of his arrival, and visited him in their turns, to congratulate him on his success, and the advancement of his father. "Have I left the court, said Tieh-chung-u, because of the fatiguing frequency of visitants, and am come hither purposely to avoid them? better were it to have staid with my father: there I should have had the advantage of being with him, and of acquiring valuable friends. Here is the same interruption, without the enjoyment of their company. I will, agreeable to my father's permission, go visit the four parts of the world* * This, in the mouth of a Chinese, means little more than the Chinese empire. P. Du Halde tells a pleasant story on this subject. One day some of their literati, desiring P. Chavagnac to shew them a map of the world, they sought a long while for China; at length took one of the two hemispheres for it, containing Europe, Africa and Asia: supposing America too large for the rest of the world. The father let them alone in this error, till one of them desiring an explanation of the letters and names in the map: "You see Europe, said he, Africa and Asia; in Asia here is Persia, the Indies and Tartary." "Where then is China, cryed they? He replied, "It is this little corner of the earth, and these are the bounds of it." Upon this they looked astonished at one another, saying in Chinese, Syaute-kin, it is very small. Vol. 1. p. 280. Perhaps after all, the expression in the text, means only the four points of the compass. . When this month is expired, I will resign the house, and all that belongs to it, to the care of my steward, and then I will depart. F 2 When that time was elapsed, he ordered his travelling furniture to be packed up, and accompanied with only one servant, began his travels. CHAP. V.* * CHAP. III. in the Translator's manuscript. TIeh-chung-u was already upon the road, and had gone forward for some time, before he could resolve on the course of his journey: at last he determined in favour of Shan-tong* * Shan-tong is one of the most fertile provinces of the empire: it contains six cities of the first rank, which have under them, one hundred and fourteen of the second and third order. The capital Tséé-nan-foo is a very great and populous city. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 104, &amp;c. , a province no less noted for the beauty and fertility of its lands, than for the courtesy and integrity of its inhabitants. He called therefore to Siow-tan, and bade him hire the first ass he could meet with on the road† † It should seem that in short journeys, their servants follow them on foot; which, as they carry only a quilt or two for their master to lie on, they can easily perform. , and follow him to Shan-tong: whither we shall at present leave him, pursuing his journey. In the city of Tséé-nan, the capital of that province, lived at that time a great F 3 Mandarine, aged about sixty, who belonged to the Ping-pû, or tribunal of arms* * In the Translator's manuscript he is called Ping-pû, or Lord Lieutenant of the province of Shan-tong: but, beside that Ping-pû has no such meaning, (see P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 249.) this is both contradicted by what follows in the course of this history, and is contrary to that refined maxim of Chinese policy, which prescribes it as an invariable law, that no Mandarine be preferred to any office, either in the city he belongs to, or in the province where his family dwells; or within fifty leagues of the province he came from. An admirable expedient to prevent partiality, and procure them respect. See P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 257. N. B. The council of Ping-pû takes cognizance of all the military affairs of the whole empire. It provides all sorts of stores for the armies, disposes of all military employments, &amp;c. P. Du Halde, supra. P. Semedo, p. 124. ; his name was Shuey-kew-yeh: he had lost his wife, and had no other children, but only one daughter, who was so exquisitely beautiful, that it would exceed the power of the most masterly pencil, to express the exactness of her proportion: nor could the whitest lilly, or richest carnation among the flowery tribes, exhibit tints so lovely, as were blended in her cheeks. She was no less distinguished for the rare endowments of her mind, and greatness of her capacity, in which she equalled the most eminent of the opposite sex. Shuey-ping-sin* * i. e. water, ice, heart. — It is essential to a Chinese beauty, to have a large forehead, a short nose, and little eyes: in other respects, their women don't yield to the ladies of Europe. P. Le Compte. Memoires. Amst. 1697. 12mo. tom. 1. p. 192. P. Du Halde, &amp;c. , for that was her name, was the darling of her father, who loved her with an affection, equal to that he would have had for a son of the same accomplishments† † The Chinese value their daughters so little, that when they have more children than they can easily maintain, they hire the midwives to stifle the females in a bason of water as soon as they are born. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 278. , and gave her the entire F 4 management of his house: where she governed his family with such admirable skill, that Shuey-kew-yeh, who was continally at court, gave himself no longer any care on that head. She was now a young maid of about seventeen years, and yet the great business of his office so intirely ingrossed her father's attention, as to make him neglect to dispose of her in marriage. This young lady had an uncle, named Shuey-guwin, who affected the appearance of a man of letters, and had great respect shewn him on account of his brother. But he was very illiterate, and the whole aim of his studies was by any indirect means to extort money to spend on his pleasures. He had three sons, as ignorant and illiberal as himself; and also one daughter, in manners and disposition still more unamiable than her brothers, and in person as disagreeable as her manners. She was called Ghiang-koo* * That is, sweet young woman. Du Halde observes, (vol. 2. p. 221. note) that no nation in in the world abounds with more fantastical names than the Chinese: this is a proof that they have unmeaning and improper ones. , and was born in the same year with Shuey-ping-sin; than whom she was about two months older. "My brother, said Shuey-guwin, is a very rich and honourable man, but he has never a son: if he dies, all his riches must fall to me: the only obstacle is this girl of his, who remains unmarried, and has the sole possession of my brother's house. Could I once get her disposed of, the whole then would be mine* * The women don't inherit in China. ." Upon this, he contrives among his acquaintance to get her married, and prevailed on several of their relations, to come and propose to her a great many matches with men, distinguished for their persons, their possessions, or accomplishments: to all offers of this kind, she gave neither encouragement nor answer† † Altho' the Chinese Author hath not assigned any reason for this conduct of hers; it may be collected from other parts of the history, that she was unwilling to give up the trust reposed in her by her father, or to marry at all in his absence: and she might be unwilling to assign her reasons, lest they should apply to her father to lay his injunctions upon her. ; burying her thoughts in profound and invincible silence. This conduct of hers very much perplexed her uncle, who found she was not to be managed in that manner. At last he bethought himself of a young man of quality belonging to the same place, for whom his friends were looking out a wife. The father of this youth, who was of the second order of Mandarines which compose the Emperor's privy council* * The Nwi-yuen, or inner court, is composed of three orders of Mandarines, which form the Emperor's privy council. The second of these are called Ta-hio-se, or Magistrates of approved capacity. Out of their number are appointed Vice-roys of provinces, and Presidents of other tribunals. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 248. , was called Kwo sho-su: Kwo-khé-tzu was the name of the son. Shuey-guwin went to pay a visit to the young gentleman, and taking an opportunity to tell him of his niece, asked him how he should like her for his wife: "I know nothing of her, said the youth, whether she be handsome or ugly." "She is very handsome, said her uncle, and has a fine understanding." Kwo-khé-tzu expressed some doubt of this. "To convince you of the truth of what I have said, answered he, you shall go home with me: I live next door to her, and she often comes through the garden to visit my daughter, where you will have a good opportunity of seeing her." "If it be so, replied the other, I will attend you." When they were arrived at his house, Shuy-guwin desired him to wait a little in the outward apartment, while he went to see if Shuyping-sin was with his daughter: he returned immediately, crying out, "This is a very favourable opportunity, my fair niece is now with her sister* * So cousin germans are called in China. Trans. : come, let us go see them together." "How can that be? said the other." "I'll carry you, replied he, to a door that has a crevice in it, through which you may see them perfectly well." When Kwo-khé-tzu had seen her; "She is indeed, said he, as you told me; exquisitely charming and beautiful. I will hasten home, and immediately order a person proper for this occasion to come and discourse about the marriage." All the way home, he did nothing but revolve in his mind the charms of the young lady he had seen, which had made the deepest impression on his heart: eager to obtain her, he rested not a moment to send proposals of marriage. She refused them, and slighted his fairest offers. Kwo-khé-tzu was plunged in the greatest concern, but found no other remedy, than to visit and make his court to the Che-foo, by friends and presents; desiring him to use his interest to make him acceptable to the young lady, he being equally acquainted with both their fathers and families. The Che-foo, unwilling to disoblige him, with some difficulty complied, and made her two visits: but for all he could say he was not able to prevail with her* * Beside the reason assigned in the note p. 73. the reader will find ample cause for this pertinacious refusal of Kwo-khé-tzu, in the dissoluteness of his manners and badness of his character: of which he will find remarkable instances in the course of this history. . He acquainted Kwo-khé-tzu with his success: "Very well: we cannot help it: 'tis sufficient:" said the youth with an indifference but ill dissembled; while his heart felt the deepest uneasiness. In a short time after, arrived news from court, that the father of Shuey-ping-sin was fallen into disgrace, and sent an exile into Tartary: and that the father of Kwo-khé-tzu was advanced to the dignity of Co-lau, or Minister of state* * The first order of Mandarines, is that of the Co-laus, i. e. Ministers of state, or Chief Presidents of the supreme courts. This is the highest dignity the Literati can arrive at. They are seldom more than five or six, and have each of them a magnificent hall of audience assigned them in the palace. They have no particular office, but have an eye over the government of the whole empire. P. Du Haide, vol. 1. p. 138. 248. P. Semedo, p. 127. . Transported with this news, his son was encouraged once more to sollicit the Che-foo, and to intreat him to try again some way to accomplish a marriage between him and the young lady. The Che-foo sent for her uncle: "Your niece, said he, is of age to be married: you are a man of sense, and must know the world: you cannot be ignorant that time is not to be neglected: and that when young persons are arrived at the marriageable age, it ought not to be deferred. While her father was at liberty to direct her, she did right in waiting for his pleasure therein: not knowing perhaps, but he was looking out a proper match for her at court. But she has now no longer that pretence: his office is taken away, he is disgraced and sent into Tartary: no one knows whether he's dead or alive. Besides, as she is grown up, and has a great many servants and young men in her house, 'tis to be feared that people will give a liberty to their tongues that will hurt her reputation: you are her uncle, and nearest in blood, cannot you lay your commands upon her, now in the absence of your brother? Kwo-khé-tzu is a youth of great spirit, capacity and worth; and his father's advancement renders him still more respectable: if she persists in refusing him, she will not easily meet with so valuable an offer: go home therefore, and Vol. I. G persuade your niece to accept of him." "Sir, replied Shuey-guwin, you speak with great judgment; I shall obey." Taking leave of the Che-foo, he went to her house with such visible marks of displeasure in his countenance, that she enquired the reason: he told her it was because she had slighted the offers of marriage that had been made to her in favour of Kwo-khé-tzu; especially as the Che-foo had come in person to propose them to her with the greatest marks of courtesy and respect. "Now your father is in disgrace, proceeded he, you must not expect that Magistrate will give himself the trouble of waiting on you any more: he will not shew you so much complaisance. He sent for me to-day to upbraid me with your contemptuous treatment of the young gentleman; and even exhorted me to use the authority I have a right to exert in my brother's absence." He ceased speaking, and Shuey-ping-sin stood fixed in profound silence,: he urged her to answer: "Well, replied she fighing after some time, "as my father is banished, and the Che-foo commands me to respect you as my father, whatever you are pleased to order I must obey: 'tis in vain to resist: you must do in this matter whatever you please." "This ready compliance, answered her uncle overjoyed at her submission, shews your good sense and judgment: you don't perhaps know how wealthy and considerable the house of Kwo-khé-tzu G 2 is: he is a youth of great merit and understanding: his father is lately promoted to a very high office; and should you marry his son, he may be able to restore my brother." "'Tis indeed possible, said the young lady."— "Well then, replied Shuey-guwin eagerly, I'll go and acquaint the Che-foo that you consent to the proposals: give me here the Nean-kung* * The Nean-kung is a writing of eight letters or characters, containing an account of the year, month, day, and hour of a person's birth. Trans. —These are called in P. Du Halde's hist. Pa-tse; and also the eight letters of good luck, because fortune-tellers and diviners calculate nativities by them, &amp;c. It is one of the usual ceremonies before marriage for these to be sent to each party; which is done in order that the good luck attending them may be examined into. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 304, 664. v. 2. p. 45, &amp;c. , or writing of eight letters." "If it must be so, said Shuey-ping-sin, please to let me have the paper† † A red paper usual in such cases. Trans. , and I will write it." It was presently brought, and she wrote upon it according to form. Shuey-guwin took the paper, and folded it up with great content: then bidding her adieu, he hasted home to his house, and acquainted his sons and daughter that his niece had at last given her consent. They were too well acquainted with her aversion to the match to be over-ready in believing him: "Surely, said they, it must be a work of more difficulty than this to procure her compliance: you may be deceived in her, for she is very artful: she will seem to consent to-day, but put you off to-morrow." He told them, G 3 that she had submitted to obey him as her father: "Beside, said he, here is the Nean-kung, as an acknowledgment of the marriage." They saw it and had no farther scruples: "'Tis very well, said they, and yet there is one thing wanting; as it is the marriage of persons of quality, and in a Mandarine's family, the eight letters ought to be in gold upon scarlet taffaty, and not upon paper." He agreed it was proper, and ordered them to be fixed on accordingly. He then carried it to the Che-foo, who when he saw it was very well pleased, but told him he could not order the marriage [farther]; he must take the writing to the Che-hien. The latter of these Mandarines received the writing, as sent by the other; and carried it the day after to the youth whom it concerned. Kwo-khé-tzu was no less transported, than if he had found the most valuable jewel in the world. He instantly ordered a Nean-kung to be drawn up on his part, and looking in the calendar for a fortunate day* * In the calendar or almanac, which is published every year in great form, by the Emperor's authority, beside astronomical calculations, &amp;c. the days and hours are divided into lucky and unlucky by judicial astrology, to which the Chinese are much addicted; therein is marked by characters, the time to let blood, &amp;c. nay the lucky minute to ask a favour of the Emperor, to honour the dead, offer sacrifice, marry, build, invite friends, and every thing else relating to public and private affairs. This calendar is in every body's hands, and is regardded as an oracle. See P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 133. , made a great entertainment, wherein the Che-foo and Che-hien were G 4 the principal guests. When the feast was over the latter of those magistrates went with the writing to the house of Shuey-guwin. He immediately acquainted his niece of it: and told her, "The day after to-morrow, is a fortunate or good day, when Kwo-khé-tzu designs to send you the nuptial present: command your house to be put in order, and sit out your hall to receive it." "Sir, replied she, if the present should come, order it to your own house. As my father is not at home it will be more proper: and whether it is brought hither or there the difference will be little." "Very well, said her uncle, and what name shall be prefixed to the letter of thanks to be returned for the present?" "Yours, Sir, said she; let your name be to it: you are my father here; my own father being disgraced and banished the prefixing of his name may occasion some discourtesy. And whatever relates to the paying of compliments, or the like, on this occasion it will be proper for you to take upon you." "It is true, said Shuey-guwin, it ought to be so." He then sent to buy a great number of Tieh-tse, or red and gilded papers, to write invitations upon* * Tieh-tse is also a general name for visiting or complimentary billets of any kind. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 296, 7. , and desired Shuey-ping-sin to write them. She said, "I will do it as you cannot write yourself, but you must not let any one know but that you wrote them." "Very well, said he; there must also be the letter of compliments* * 'Tis the custom for the parents of the young people, to write a paper of compliments three times to each other, with great professions of courtesy and respect, and with much affected humility, declaring themselves unworthy of the honour intended their son or daughter. Trans. ." "I will write that likewise, said the young lady." When she had finished, she desired her uncle to read it. He obeyed and began thus; "My daughter"— "How, says he, my daughter! what do you mean by that? am not I your uncle?" "Yes, said she, but is not my own father banished, and don't you tell me I must obey you as my father?" Shuey-guwin was satisfied: then he took the papers, and went home rejoicing. "These writings, said he to his children, are in my name, and your cousin is in them stiled it my daughter: by which not only her house, but whatever she is now presented with, will be ours." After two days Kwo-khé-tzu sent the customary present* * The Chinese give no portions with their daughters: on the contrary the father receives from the bridegroom a certain sum agreed upon beforehand; of which however a great part is laid out in cloaths, &amp;c. for the bride. This ceremony seems as essential with them as the giving of a ring is with us, only among the great it is managed with more generosity, "for with these (says P. Semedo) there is no talk of money." By which expression it should seem that the nuptial present is not necessarily restrained to money. However both he and P. Du Halde agree, that presents of jewels, &amp;c. are sent to the bride on this occasion. P. Semedo. p. 71. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 304. : at which Shuey-guwin rejoiced, and put on his habit of ceremony, ordering music to be provided, his house to be adorned, and the great gates thrown open to receive it. The Che-hien accompanied it in person: Shuey-guwin sent for his friends and acquaintance in order to receive him with the greater respect. He made a grand feast on the occasion; and to the servants that brought the present he gave gifts of money; expressing throughout the whole day the supreme content and satisfaction of a man who is near the accomplishment of a favourite project. Shuey-ping-sin heard all these rejoicings without any emotion. When the feast was over and the guests retired, her uncle invited her to go see the present: she complied with his request. He asked her, who now must take it? "Certainly, said she, it belongs to you, you are my uncle and father; you have been at great expence and trouble; this is but a small return; a trifle hardly worth mentioning, since my house, my people, and my land, and whatever else belongs to me is yours." "Why, said he, should you think they are mine?" "My father, she replied, has no son, and is now in banishment: I only am left, and under your direction as your daughter, therefore all I have is yours: but as I only govern in my father's absence, and cannot learn whether he is dead or alive, I dare not yet deliver up my charge." "Niece, said Shuey-guwin, you have great generosity and penetration, and shew an uncommon knowledge of the world." He then called his three sons and daughter, and bade them take the present and lay it up; and upon her offering to go, entreated her to sit down and drink something with them. This she waved on pretence of some late indisposition, and begged to retire. Shuey-guwin attributed her refusal to that shyness and modesty, which commonly prevails among young ladies upon so delicate an occasion as the receiving of the nuptial present; and permitted her to withdraw. CHAP. VI. IT was now a month that Kwo-khé-tzu had sent his present; when having fitted up his house and prepared every thing for his marriage, he chose a fortunate day, and sent to acquaint Shuey-guwin that he should come on the morrow to fetch home his bride. A piece of news, which the latter received with much satisfaction. He went immediately to inform his niece of it, and desired her to make all suitable preparations. "I have no need, said she, to prepare any thing about me, otherwise than it is." "Ah! ah! said he, you are merry; you know better: you do but jest with me." When he came home, he told his family, that he believed his niece had lost her senses: "She talks of making no preparation for her wedding. 'Tis very whimsical; but perhaps it is only talk: she will doubtless to-night comply with custom and get things in order. Early to-morrow I will go again and see what she has done." The next day Kwo-khé-tzu, according to his promise, sent his gilded chair, his trumpets and music, with a long train of attendants, all in great magnificence and order, to the house of Shuey-guwin. He immediately run to his niece to tell her to get ready, for that the chair was come for her. "What is it you would have me get ready, replied she hastily? Am I not well enough as I am?" "Are you so ignorant, said he, as not to know what you ought to do? Has not the bridegroom sent his chair for you? He is also coming to conduct you himself* * It is only in some provinces (but chiefly the northern ones) that the bridegroom goes in person to conduct home the bride. See P. Semedo, p. 72. . Does not he not shew you great honour and respect? Why then do you talk at this ridiculous rate?" "What is all that to me, replied the young Lady? I have nothing to say to it, it only relates to my† † See note to p. 75. sister your daughter." Shuey-guwin in the greatest consternation at these words, was not able to speak for some time: at last he said; "Is it not for your sake that this young gentleman hath taken so much pains, and put himself to all this trouble and expence? Whom then does he come for? My daughter, do you say, that is as ugly as Vol. I. H an evil genius or demon? ? It is chiefly the sects of Fo and Tao-tsë that believe the existence of evil spirits called Yen, whose business it is to torment the souls of the wicked in another life, &amp;c. Their ignorance of nature makes the Chinese attribute its most common effects to some evil genius or demon. See P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 664, 675. vol. 2. 235. , in comparison of you? no such thing." "My father, answered the young lady, is in disgrace; he is banished afar off, and has committed all he has here to my care: in this situation, how can I marry?" "Nay, said he in deep concern, if you are not disposed to marry, who will go about to force you? But why then did you give me your eight letters of Nean-kung?" "Uncle, said she, you was then asleep, and are not yet awake. I should be a fool indeed to give you any such writing while I was averse to marriage." "What, said he, did not I procure you the coloured paper? and did not you yourself write upon it?" "If it was so, she replied, let me see it." Shuey-guwin hasted home: "My niece, said he to his sons and daughter, refuses to marry Kwo-khé-tzu; and denies that the Nean-kung was of her writing." Then he took the paper* * Viz. the original writing from which the letters of gold, that were fixed on the silk, had been copied. and went to her house. "Here! said he holding it out, will you deny this to be your own hand-writing?" "I acknowledge the writing, replied she: I deny it not: but if the eight letters are found to be mine, I'll be content to marry. Pray uncle, do H 2 you know when I was born?" "Doubtless, said he, I do: you were born on the fifteenth day of the eighth moon, at ten o'clock: I remember it perfectly well; it was a feast day, and I was making merry with your father." "Very well, Sir, said she; and when was my cousin Ghiang-koo born, your daughter?" "I must certainly, said he, be well acquainted with my daughter's birth: it was on the sixth day of the sixth moon, in the middle of the day." "Pray, Sir, then, proceeded she, when you took the paper with you, did not you observe the eight letters written upon it: they are as follows;"—here she repeated them — "The writing, you see, relates to your daughter; I am no way concerned in it: why then do you give me so much trouble and perplexity?" Shuey-guwin at this was greatly disturbed, "However, it is sufficient, he cried out in a rage; I saw you write it, and it matters not in what manner it was done." Seeing him begin to make a disturbance, she said to him calmly; "Sir, you must not be so warm: pray go and consult one that can divine* * See note, p. 83. Diviners, soothsayers and astrologers no where meet with greater encouragement than in China: the market places and streets are every where full of them, where they keep open shop with their tables of calculation, and scarce any thing is done without consulting them. See P. Semedo, p. 93. P. Du Halde, &amp;c. , and let him see whether those eight letters belong to me or your H 3 daughter." She argued in vain, he became still more angry and began to rave and stamp with his feet; saying that she only sought to do him prejudice. "However, said he, it is no matter; you cannot hurt me; truth is truth. Both the Che-foo and Che-hien solicited your consent: the whole city knows of the young gentleman's present. How then can you say it is no concern of yours? you are extremely blameable." "If it was me, whom Kwo-khé-tzu designed to marry, she replied, why did not he order his present to be brought to me here at my own house? The Tieh-tse and letter of compliments, run in your name: and therein you only speak of your daughter; there is not the least mention of me." "How can you thus embroil the matter, said her uncle? the letter relates alone to you, and the form of it was agreed on between us." "If you had no daughter, resumed she, then you might have bestowed that title upon me without reserve: it is not unusual, it is true, to reckon the nieces for daughters, but they are always distinguished by elder and younger: but since in your paper 'tis written simply, my daughter, it can be only understood of Ghiang-koo my cousin. If you will force this marriage upon me, how will it appear reasonable to any Mandarine with whom a petition may chance to be lodged?" "To so much talk and prate, replied Shuey-guwin, it is in vain to give answer. H 4 Very well! very well! said he in a violent passion, your design I see is to plague and kill me. If we had proceeded thus far with a man of the lowest rank, how should we avoid trouble and disgrace? much more with such a person as this, who is a youth of great resentment, and whose father is prefered to such power at court. Your abrupt refusal! what disturbance, trouble and confusion will it cause? I shall certainly be ashamed to shew my head: you will force me to lay aside all respect of kindred. I must go lodge a complaint against you before a Mandarine; then how will you be able to unravel and clear up so long a story before him* * The women in China are kept so recluse, and converse so little with the men, that to be obliged to appear before a court of justice, and there to enter into a long detail of facts, may well be supposed very terrible to them. The Chinese women not only immure themselves in their apartments, into which scarce their nearest relations of the opposite sex are permitted to enter, but it is even thought indecent for them when they salute a man to use the common Chinese form Van fo, or All happiness to you; their salute is therefore confined to a silent curt'sey, which they make in the same manner as the ladies in Europe. Even in the prison and the grave, where all distinctions commonly cease, that of sex is not forgotten in China: in both these the men and women are most carefully separated. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 281, 293, 310, 555. vol. 2. p. 49, 50, 77. ? or how will you avoid exposing yourself to a great deal of shame?" All this he spoke with tears in his eyes. "Uncle, answered Shuey-ping-sin, I shall not make so long a story of it, as you may imagine: I shall only say that you, who are my uncle, taking advantage of my father's absence, would force me, who am left a young and helpless maid, to marry, in order to take possession of my substance. This will make you appear in so criminal a light, that you will not be able to hold up your head." Shuey-guwin was a good deal alarmed at these words, and began to be more calm. "I would not willingly, said he, bring a petition before a Mandarine: but if I do not, how shall I extricate myself out of these difficulties?" "Uncle, said the young lady, if you will lay aside your ungenerous intentions against me, I'll undertake to bring you off clear." Shuey-guwin wiping his eyes replied, "Alas! that I fear is impossible; it is not in the power of a Saint† † It is chiefly among the followers of the two idolatrous sects of Fo and Tao-tsë that there are worshiped in China a kind of Saints or Heroes under the name of Sien-jin, or immortal men. These are commonly represented by little images. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 649, 674, &amp;c. The name of Shing or Saint is also given by the sect of the Literati or Philosophers, (whose religion is more pure and uncorrupt) to some of their ancients as have been uncommonly distinguished for their virtue and wisdom: they explain the word Shing to mean such as have arrived to the utmost pitch that man by his faculties can attain unto. Vid. Confucius five Scien. Sin. p. 52. N. B. The former seem to be chiefly intended in this history. to deliver me." "Pursue my directions, proceeded she, and this sorrow shall be turned into joy." "Alas! said he, at a time when life and death are indifferent to me, what hope can I have of so favourable a change? However, I would know how you propose to assist me in this affair, so that this young man's resentment may not fall on my head." "Attend then, said she, and do exactly as I would have you: if I mistake not, my cousin Ghiang-koo is just seventeen, of a fit age to be married, you have now a fine opportunity of doing it: send her in my stead, and all the difficulty is over." At these words he hung down his head and paused: at length looking up with a mixture of joy and terror, he said, "Well, but your cousin is very ordinary and disagreeable in her person; and if she should marry Kwo-khé-tzu, he will not like her, and so I shall still be involved in trouble* * As the Chinese marriages are altogether brought about by the intervention of some third person, and the bridegroom never sees the bride till she is brought home to him; so when he first opens the chair, if he finds he has been deceived in his account of her, he may have his remedy in sending her back, provided he will be content to lose the presents, &amp;c. which he made her. In this case the persons that deceived him are liable to be punished. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 304, 305, &amp;c. ." "Uncle, she replied, leave that to me: in other respects there's nothing irregular; the eight letters are rightly and truly your daughter's: 'tis as true that the present came to your house: all this is notorious. The Tieh-tse run in your name: and in the letter of compliments you say, my daughter: in consequence of all this the chair is now come to your house: then what should hinder you from sending my cousin? on the other hand consider the credit it will be to have him for your son-in-law: does not all this afford you pleasure?" At this the countenance of Shuey-guwin began to clear up: he smiled and said, "Daughter and cousin, how came you, that are a little helpless and lonely maid, to be possessed of so much ingenuity, as at once thus to kill me and restore me to life? "Sir, replied his niece, it was never my desire to deceive you: this affair was all your own seeking to give me disturbance." "Enough, said he, let that be forgotten: one thing yet remains; your cousin is very aukward, and neither knows how to dress herself out, not to behave as she ought, on such an occasion: you must go to assist, and instruct her." "I will go, said she, and if any thing be wanting, let me have the blame." She took accordingly two of her maids, and went to dress up her cousin; in order to which she caused her to bathe and wash herself clean from head to foot, to whiten her teeth, to form her eye-brows, and put on cloaths perfumed with the sweetest wood and gums: this took them up a good part of the day: she then instructed her, when she was brought to the house of the bridegroom to behave herself with reserve and modesty; and on coming into his own apartment when he should advance to take off her veil, to run and hide herself in the curtains. She also instructed the two waiting women, when they were to offer him wine* * After the bride is brought home, and has performed the four reverences to heaven in the great hall, and the same to her husband's relations, she is then led into the inner apartment, &amp;c. where she and her husband usually drink what is called the cup of alliance; after which they sit down together to an entertainment, &amp;c. but sometimes the bridegroom stays and makes merry with his relations; on all which occasions the wine flows about freely. As for the bride, she is put into the hands of the female relations who are present. P. Semedo, p. 72. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 303, 632. vol. 2. p. 43, 45, 122, 172. , to be as liberal of it as possible, and when he should have a mind to retire, to be sure to put out the lights. Then ordering the maids to withdraw and get themselves ready, she took the opportunity of their absence to proceed as follows: "The next morning when the bridegroom sees you, he will perhaps be angry to find you not so handsome as he expected: in that case you must throw yourself into violent fits of crying, and offer to lay violent hands on yourself; this will doubtless make him afraid, and prevent his offering you any ill treatment." Ghiang-koo promised to observe all her directions: and then they took their leaves of each other. Kwo-khé-tzu was now arrived to fetch home his bride. Shuey-guwin went in to see her. "You are very fine, said he, there wants nothing now but a veil for your face: when that is covered you will be perfectly handsome." Then taking her in his arms he carried and seated her in the chair. That ceremony over, the bridegroom mounting his horse with great content, went before the chair towards his house: there he ordered the gates to be thrown open, and desired his Vol. I. I female relations to be ready to receive er. He beheld her with great de- ght as she got out of the chair, and her face being covered she ap- peared to him like a Saint or Angel* * See notes pag. 17, 41, 105. . hen walking by her side into the great hall, their friends and relations ade them their compliments. After is they retired into his apartment, here he went to take off her veil: upon which, according to her cousin's advice, she ran and hid herself in the ed. The bridegroom then ordered the ble to be covered, but Ghiang-koo would not come to sit down. The wait- ing women desired him to seat himself and drink first. He said, "No: your mistress is ashamed now, and out of mo- desty will not shew herself, yet perhaps would be glad to take some refreshment: therefore to save her blushes, I'll retire a little while she comes out, and will go and eat with my friends and acquaintance." His relations asked him why he left the lady, and if it were not usual for the bride and bridegroom to eat together? "Shuey-ping-sin* * It may be proper to observe here once for all, that in the Translator's manuscript she is never spoken of by her proper name, except by her parents or superiors, but instead thereof by that of Shuey-siauw-tze, or tsieh, that is, Shuey the young Lady or Mandarine's daughter: it being unpolite in China, as well as with us, to call persons of any rank by their bare proper names: only the Chinese range the complimentary title differently, putting it after the name. In the same manner Kwo-khé-tzu, Tieh-chung-u, and the rest, are always spoken of (except in the cases above mentioned) by the name of Kwo or Tieh-cong-tzu, i. e. Tieh a Mandarine's son. Unless when they are addressed by an inferior, or when some particular respect is intended; and then it is Tieh-siang-coon, rendered by the Translator T. the young Gentleman; tho' he acknowledges it to mean something more, and to be equivalent to his or your honour, worship, &amp;c. with us.—To prevent confusion the Editor chose to retain only the proper name every where. , replied he, is a woman of great I 2 fashion and delicacy: she ought to be treated with suitable respect, and hath certainly now a just claim to indulgence." Her relations acknowledged it was very kind and respectful: then inviting him to sit down and partake of their entertainment, they quickly fell to drinking, plying one another* * In the Translator's manuscript it is "plying one another left and right hand man." This is only mentioned as it is probably the Chinese idiom. so fast, that Kwo-khé-tzu became very much fuddled. When all the guests were retired, he went into the bride's chamber; and seeing it full of lights, he approached the bed, and asked her why she did not take her repose? why she stayed for him, and hindered herself from sleeping with so many tapers? Ghiang-koo, as he opened the curtains, turned aside her face, and ordered her women to put out the lights. They hesitated, observing that he was not undressed: but he said, "Whatever your new lady orders, obey her: defer it not upon my account." They obeyed him and retired† † The laws the Editor hath prescribed to himself of suppressing nothing however ridiculous, oblige him to inform the reader that the Chinese Author concludes this paragraph with a passage, that will not fail to make him smile, viz. "They obeyed him and retired. Kwo-khé-tzu then stretching out his hands to find his way to the bed, said, "Ah! she is asleep: I will pull off my cloaths and go to sleep too." This probably did not so much proceed from simplicity in the Author, as from an affectation of modesty. The Chinese are a very affected people, and all affectation leads to absurdity. . I 3 The next morning an hour or two after it was day, as he was going to rise and put on his cloaths, he saw the ugly face of his wife. He could not for some time believe his senses: "Surely, said he aloud rubbing his eyes, "the Shuey-ping-sin which I saw, was exquisitely beautiful: but who are you? you are not the bride for whom I contracted." "Why not, answered Ghiang-koo? but I am." "I expected a lady compleatly handsome, said he, and here is an ill-favoured monster indeed." Then starting up in a rage, he vented his fury in exclamations against Shuey-guwin, pouring on his head a thousand curses. Ghiang-koo hearing him thus abuse her father, calling him dog and villain so to deceive him, was highly troubled "What, said she, am not I your wife, and is not my father your father-in-law: and do you treat him with no more respect, than thus to abuse him in my hearing?" Kwo-khé-tzu at this was the more perplexed: "'Tis enough, said he, I am soundly cheated! and is Shuey-guwin really your father?" "Is he, said she? most certainly: you must know nothing: you must be very dull of apprehension to doubt it. Why, Shuey-ping-sin is my younger sister; the daughter of my uncle. If you would have married her, why did not you go to her own house, and ask for her there? The Nean-kung you received is really mine: the Tieh-tse run in the name of my father. In his letter he writes, my daughter. 'Twas to his house your present was brought: and thither you came yourself to fetch me away. I 4 All the city knows I was carried out of his house, and no other. I am of a family very much honoured and respected; and for you, to whom I am newly married, to treat me and my friends with all this scorn and abuse, is it possible I should bear it? No: I will never live under so much indignity. I will sooner die a thousand deaths." Then working herself up into the greatest transport of rage and grief, she fell to stamp and beat herself suriously: and snatching up a sash that lay in the room, was going to strangle herself with it. Kwo-khé-tzu alarmed at this violence; and fearing the trouble and disgrace in which it would involve him and his family should such an accident happen within his own apartment, and to his new-married bride; flew to her instantly and held her arm: then in a soothing manner begged her to attribute his words to the wine he had drank over-night; it being usually his misfortune to be passionate after it: that she should not be so moved by a few inconsiderate expressions: but that now they were married, they should endeavour to live in peace and amity. CHAP. VII.* * CHAP. IV. in the Translator's manuscript. KWo-khé-tzu having thus married a wife, who was his aversion, in all respects the reverse of Shuey-ping-sin, was greatly perplexed and disturbed in his mind. "And yet, said he to himself, although Ghiang-koo my bride is very ugly, she hath a great deal of reason for what she says: and if she should do herself any violence, it will be attributed to me." He therefore ordered his servants to keep along with her, and take care no harm happened to her in his absence. This done, he went to visit the Che-foo; to whom with a heavy heart he related the villainous trick Shuey-guwin had played him; who after carrying him to see his niece, and encouraging a marriage contract between them, had put his ugly daughter upon him in her stead: "I have also been, said he, at vast expence in this affair; yet that I regard not; but to be thus out-witted and made a a jest of, I cannot endure: I hope therefore, he added, as you, Sir, are acquainted with my father, for the sake of his honour you will not suffer me to be so scandalously imposed on." "Certainly, replied that Mandarine, Shuey-guwin hath done very ill in puting this abuse upon you: but you yourself have been also to blame; you should have proceeded on greater certainty. Why did not you send the nuptial present to the house of the young lady herself? When you received the eight letters, why did not you cause inquiry to be made whether they were truly hers? The papers of invitation were in the name of her uncle: yesterday you went yourself to his house: and you have accordingly brought away his daughter: there is nothing irregular in all this. Had you gone to the house of Shuey-ping-sin, and thence carried away the other, so flagrant an imposition and fraud had been punishable. But if you found yourself cheated in your bride, why did not you send her back the same night you were married? then your charge would have procured credit, and you might have obtained redress: now it cannot be had in the ordinary course of justice: we must go more artfully to work. I will send for Shuey-guwin and talk over the matter with him calmly: perhaps by fair and gentle means I may gradually draw forth a discovery of the truth. But with regard to his carrying you to see his niece, that will not be proper to be laid before the public; neither can it give any advantage to your cause. Go home then, make no more disturbance; on the contrary seem contented and happy: above all things carry it kindly to your wife, lest you drive her to extremities, that may occasion you infinite trouble." Kwo-khé-tzu finding there was no better course to be taken, thanked him and promised to follow his advice. All this while Shuy-guwin was not more happy: he had no sooner sent away his daughter, but he began to apprehend what might follow. He slept not a wink all that night, but getting up in the morning at break of day, sent people to the house of the bridegroom to listen if they could hear any disturbance. Intelligence was brought him that every thing was in profound quiet. He revolved again and again what could be the meaning of this tranquility: he could not account to himself for this passive conduct of Kwo-khé-tzu, whose fiery temper he knew very well, and whose resentment he had so much right to expect. In the midst of reflections of this kind he received a message that the Che-foo wanted to see him. Then his mind misgave him, and he suspected every thing was not right. With an aching heart he waited on that magistrate: who received him into the second hall* * The houses of all the Mandarines are pretty much alike. After one or two large courts, round which are small houses for the officers of the tribunal, there is a another court, at the end of which is a great hall, wherein the Mandarine administers public justice: lastly follow successively two very neat halls for receiving visits, furnished with chairs and other moveables, &amp;c. The courts are large, the gates lofty, and sometimes adorned with elegant carvings, but the halls of audience are neither beautiful nor neat. N. B. The houses in China are generally but one story high. P. Le Compte, tom. 1. p. 97. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 284. , and after the customary salute invited him to sit down. Then ordering all the servants out of the room, he very mildly opened the matter. "Kwo-khé-tzu, said he, this morning presented a petition to me, wherein he accuses you of very criminal practices. You know that even I interested myself to bring on a marriage between him and your niece: how then could you palm your daughter upon him? You have not only deceived that young nobleman, but me also; and thereby shewn me the greatest slight and disrespect imaginable. Now justice demands that this fraud should be punished with the utmost rigour, and the youth himself insists upon it: but having a respect for your brother, who was a great Mandarine, I was unwilling to proceed to severities, 'till I had talked over the matter with you in friendship. Pray therefore let me know the whole truth, otherwise I must shew you no favour." Frighted at these words, Shuey-guwin fell on his knees, "Sir, said he, my life is in your hands: how then can I dare to deceive you? Yesterday's business hath ten thousand intricacies in it: but it was not of my seeking: it was a violence upon my inclinations; and if you will pardon me, I will let you know all that relates to it." The Che-foo bade him rise and speak without reserve. "Let me then inform you Sir, said he, that my niece, whose aversion to this marriage is not unknown to yourself, is the spring and mover of all this confusion. Every step that has been taken was the effect of her management: for she hath a surprizing capacity. Yesterday when the bridegroom came for his wife, I went to my niece, expecting she was ready to go with him: instead of that she flew into a passion, and refused to comply, insisting upon it that it was no affair of hers; but suggested to me for my own security, to obtrude my daughter upon him in her stead: which far from being the result of my own choice or intentions, was merely owing to that necessity to which she had reduced me. This considered therefore, and as it cannot be recalled, let me intreat you to intercede with Kwo-khé-tzu to forgive me." "And is your niece indeed so ingenious, Vol. I. K said the Che-foo? truly I cannot but admire* * In the original it is, "he was very glad to hear it. I shall have a great love and esteem for her." The Chinese, who are the most subtle crafty people in the world, may naturally be supposed to esteem and admire subtilty and craft. The reader must have observed that these qualities are predominant in the character of Shuey-ping-sin; who is yet set forth by the Chinese author, as a perfect exemplar of all virtue. The Chinese morals, notwithstanding their boasted purity, evidently fall short of the Christian, since they know not how to inspire that open and ingenuous simplicity, void of all guile, which more elevated principles of morality propose to our esteem and imitation. a lady of such uncommon spirit and understanding. If it be so, justice is disarmed: only I fear this young gentleman will still nourish for her a fruitless passion." "The disappointment, said Shuey-guwin, may possibly increase it: however as all is now over, and as my niece is quiet and composed, nor thinks any longer of a marriage she hath got clear of so handsomely, it will be best not to alarm her afresh, but to let the affair sleep, at least for the present. Yet if he will not be prevailed on to forget her; let him wait a little with patience: I hope yet for an opportunity to obtain her for him." The Mandarine, glad to hear him speak thus, said, "If you can still effect this marriage, you will entirely disarm all resentment, and convince the world you were no way blameable. But then if this young lady hath so much wit, you will not easily over-reach her." "Now my daughter is married, and all is quiet, he replied, my niece will be no longer on her guard. If you will please to send for the young gentleman, I will talk over the matter here before you." K 2 The Che-foo assented, and Kwo-khé-tzu accordingly came. When they had unravelled the whole affair, the youth remained fully satisfied, and told him, "If you will still endeavour to procure me your beautiful niece, I shall entirely forget the injury done me, nor shall the less esteem and respect your daughter. But what means can you think of to effect your purpose?" "I am not unprovided of these, said the other. Do you go home, caress and make much of your wife: touch not on the affair of Shuey-ping sin, nor on any thing that hath past: let no dissatisfaction appear in your face, on the contrary seem contented and happy: and on the third, the sixth, the ninth or twelfth day, on any one of these, when it is usual to entertain the relations, the men in the outer apartments and the women within, let my niece be invited with the rest: you must also intreat the presence of the two Mandarines of the city. The eight letters of Nean-kung you must get changed to those of my niece, whom it will be the principal part of your management to induce to come by means of your wife, and by all gentle and persuasive methods. Every thing being thus previously disposed, when she is arrived at your house and got into the hall, you must produce the eight letters, and pronouncing them to be hers, tax her with the former deceit she was guilty of, and appeal to the magistrates and company for the right you have to do yourself justice. How after this K 3 can she avoid marrying you?" Kwo-khé-tzu was charmed with his plausible contrivance, and pronounced it excellent. The Che-foo himself thought it well concerted, yet doubted of its success from the proofs she had given of her great penetration, apprehending she would hardly be induced to come." "Why not, said her uncle? my daughter lives in great harmony with her husband: all is quiet: what then should alarm her?" Here they parted. Shuey-guwin went home to his house, and from thence to that of his niece. He dropped not a syllable that could give her suspicion: on the contrary he complimented her on her great ingenuity, in having extricated him so well out of all his difficulties. She received his applauses with a becoming modesty. "I was this morning, said he, very uneasy and fearful of mischief, for which reason I sent spies to listen if all was right; they brought me back notice that every thing was quiet: perhaps it is so, and he is not disatisfied with my daughter." "I can hardly be persuaded to believe that, she replied; I am well assured he cannot love her: you will yet perhaps hear something about them." "That is by no means likely now," said he as he withdrew: who went home admiring the shrewd and subtle spirit of his niece, and fearing every thing from so piercing a discernment. K 4 On the other hand Kwo-khé-tzu was so sanguine about the success of their artifice, that he thought twelve days as long as so many years: for in order to remove suspicion, he had brought himself to fix on the longest day. Three days therefore before it came, he sent five Tieh-tse or papers of invitation* * The Tieh-tse, or (as it is rendered by P. Du Halde) the visiting billet, consists of a sheet of red paper, slightly embellished with flowers of gold and folded up like a screen. On one of the folds is written the name of the person who sends it with the addition of some respectful terms, according to the rank of the person to whom it is sent: they would say for instance, The tender and sincere friend of your Lordship, and the perpetual disciple of your doctrine, presents himself in this quality to pay his duty, and make his reverence even to the earth. Which is expressed in these words tun-shew-pay. It consists of only one line of writing. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 296. P. Semedo, p. 60. , one for the young lady, the rest for her uncle and his three sons. Shuey-guwin carried that for his niece to her himself. "The day, said he, that I followed your advice and sent away my daughter, I was very apprehensive of bad consequences. You encouraged me and rather foretold a great deal of joy. Your prediction is now verified, and all is right between her and her husband; otherwise he would hardly have sent us these invitations: here is one directed for yourself; which, as there will be other female relations there, it will be but right in you to comply with." The young lady assented. "If you intend to go then, said her uncle, it is customary always to send some present a day or two before." She agreed it was proper. Upon which he run and fetched the gilded paper and paint for her to write the particulars of the present* * It is the custom in China to accompany their presents with billets of the particulars. Sometimes they send these billets before the presents are bought, intending to purchase those which shall be pitched upon: these are selected from the rest by drawing a small circle round them, &amp;c. Then a billet of thanks is returned, wherein mention is made of what is either received or chosen. If any thing is returned back or refused they add the words Pi-sie, these are precious pearls, I dare not touch them. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 298. N. B. The gilded paper mentioned above, is perhaps only the red paper described in the preceding note as ornamented with the golden flowers. See P. Du Halde, ibid. P. Semedo, p. 60. As we are not informed by the authors just quoted, that they write with a different colour on these occasions; by paint in the text is probably meant only ink, which as it in China is used with a hair pencil may properly enough be so called. This will be found explained in 2 future note. : in the mean while she desired him to get it ready, for as it was for a new relation, she would have it conducted in the genteelest manner. Shuey-guwin obeyed her with great satisfaction, and went to his son-in-law to tell him that his niece would certainly come. "Prepare, said he, the Nean-kung: she suspects nothing: I told you this was the way to catch her." Kwo-khé-tzu got ready the piece of silk together with the proper letters, and gave them to his wife to fix them on. Shuey-guwin had notwithstanding frequent returns of doubt and distrust, fearing that some whim would seize his niece, and prevent her from going at the time appointed. He went therefore the day before, and advised Kwo-khé-tzu to send two of his maids to know if she wovld assuredly come. He approved of his advice and sent the women accordingly: who together with enquiries after her health, said that her company would give such pleasure to their master and mistress, that they could not be satisfied 'till they had sent to know whether she would certainly favour them with it. She told them, if they had not paid her this compliment she intended to go and wish them joy. This she spoke with a very pleasant countenance, ordering tea to be brought, and appointing them to sit down on one side of the room. While the servants were gone for tea, she asked them; "Hath your mistress been well since she came home?" One of them answered, "She hath been very well, and passes her time with much satisfaction in playing, telling stories, and such diversions." "This morning, said the other, my master brought her a piece of red twan-ze or taffaty to fix something of embroidery upon it." "Flowers I suppose," said Shuey-ping-sin. "They were neither flowers, nor any thing in colours, she answered: but something in gold." "Possibly letters," said the young lady. "Yes, she replied, they were letters." She asked how many pieces there were: and was answered about seven or eight. Then having entertained and given them presents, she dismissed them. They returned home with answer that the young lady would not fail to come. "Twice, said Kwo-khé-tzu, have messages been sent, they must go again tomorrow which will finish the compliment. Accordingly he gave them a golden box curiously wrought, in which he inclosed ten large pearls of the finest water: and sent them away with proper instructions. Shuey-guwin who was present inquired the meaning of this. "The eight letters, said he, have been followed by no present, for which reason I send these jewels." "You are right, said the other; you have as good a head as my niece: you know what belongs to ceremonies* * There is nothing for which the Chinese have higher veneration than their ceremonies: these are looked upon by them as essential to the good order and peace of the state. The common salutations, visits, presents, feasts, &amp;c. &amp;c. being rather so many standing laws than fashions introduced by custom. Among their books upon this subject, there is one that prescribes upwards of 3000 rules of civility. Far from being discouraged at their number, the Chinese, who are brought up to them from their infancy, are greatly pleased with them, and believe for want of the like, other nations become barbarous. One of the principal councils of the empire, called the Li-pu or Tribunal of Rites, is established to watch over the observance of them, wherein it is so strict that it will not excuse even foreign ambassadors from the obligation. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 249. 291. vol. 2. p. 62. Ridiculous as these punctilios may appear, to them is owing in a great measure the wonderful stability of the Chinese empire, and its having subsisted above 4000 years. Compare on this subject the fine remarks in L'Esprit des Loix, liv. 19. ch. 12, 13, 16, 17, &amp;c. with P. Le Compte, tom. 2. p. 30—49. . When once you are married what a sensible pair will you two make?" The maids carried the present in the name of the bride, whose compliments they presented with a great deal of ceremony, intreating her ladyship to let their mistress see her as soon as possible, for that she had a thousand things to talk over with her. "She likewise, proceeded they, intreats your acceptance of this box of pearls: which she gave us to present to you privately as a small acknowledgement for the trouble your ladyship had at her wedding." "These pearls, said Shuey-ping-sin looking upon the box and its contents, are exceedingly precious indeed: if they are to be sold, my house is not valuable enough to purchase them: if they are a present, I dare not be bold enough to accept them: therefore carry them back again to your lady: I will at least defer my acceptance of them till I see her." The women express'd an unwillingness to carry them back. "Well, said she, on no other condition will I go to your house." The maids not being prepared for this accident, with some difficulty took up the box and carry'd it back with them. By this time arrived Shuey-guwin, who commanded her servants to get ready the chair of state and the Whangsan or umbrella. His niece hearing him cried out, that so much ceremony and trouble was needless. "Needless! replied he; at the house of your cousin yonder are assembled a great many Mandarines and people of quality; and every thing is disposed with the utmost grandeur: and will not you make a Vol. I. L suitable preparation?" "My father, said she, is in disgrace and banishment: how will it appear for me to assume so much pomp and state at a juncture like this? It will not only expose me to the derision of the world, but should the Emperor hear of it, he will think that our house contemns his authority. Pray uncle don't give yourself so much trouble, when I am able to give orders myself." "Well then, said Shuey-guwin, if I leave you to yourself; how will you proceed?" "Yesterday, replied she, came here four countrymen, that brought corn with them; two of them I ordered to stay: there is a little chair in the house, which two men can carry: they shall attend me with that." "Should you come in that manner, said her uncle, would you not be more exposed to the laughter of mankind? Would your relations and the other visitants shew you any respect?" "Let me be laught at or affronted, said she, I go notwithstanding no otherwise than I ought." When Shuey-guwin found her so determined, he said, "Enough! it shall be as you please. It is high time for me to go: I hope we shall presently see you there." He then took his three sons with him and departed. Kwo-khé-tzu, who waited for her arrival with the utmost impatience, had sent people to inform him of all her motions: and when he heard that she was preparing to come, was hardly able to contain his joy. He then applied to L 2 the Che-foo and Chi-hien to be witnesses to the marriage: and having sent for four counsellors* * Beside the Che-foo and Che-hien, &amp;c. every city hath nineteen lesser magistrates employed in several Offices subordinate to the principal: two whereof have a president and four counsellors, &amp;c. P. Semedo, p. 131. , he laid before them the steps he had taken, both the box of jewels which had been sent for a present, and her writing of eight letters which he had to produce. He then ordered seven or eight lusty women to be ready, who immediately when she was set down were to prevent her from getting away, as also from flying into any outrage. He had likewise prepared a chamber for her reception, set off with the richest furniture of gold and silver. Mid-day was now past, when intelligence was brought him, that the young lady was set out. He was presently informed she was arrived half way. Transported at the news he instantly planted the music at the gates, ordering them the moment she arrived to sound aloud the marriage song* * The reader is not to understand by this expression, that there is any piece of music particularly appropriated to the nuptial solemnity, or always to be used on that occasion. None of the accounts of China mention any such thing: and the contrary is evident from the beginning of the next chapter, &amp;c. . So great was his impatience, that the chair not instantly appearing, he could not forbear going out to look for it† † This is to be supposed a piece of levity inconsistent with the Chinese gravity and decorum. . At a distance he beheld it coming, attended by four welllooking maids, and followed by seven or eight servants. Ravished at the L 3 sight, he stay'd in the street till they were got pretty near: he then hasted in, and told the company that his new bride was just at the door. They all wished him joy, except the two Mandarines of the city, who said one to the other, "This young person discovered at first a great deal of sense: but there is a weakness in women, which notwithstanding their wit fails not to appear one time or other; and in this inconstancy they are inferior to men." "This is a poor unfortunate girl, said the other; with all her caution and foresight she at length is fallen into the snare." Scarce had he spoke, when Shuey-ping-sin arrived at the gates; and the four female attendants lifting up the chair, she rose from her seat* * The custom is to sit at the bottom of the chair or sedan cross-legg'd upon a cushion. And yet these vehicles are made so very low, that the person doth almost reach the top with her head. Modern Univers. Hist. vol. 8. p. 260. note. in order to go out. At the same instant the music and trumpets began to sound. Struck with the noise, and alarmed at the sight of the eight women planted near the door, she set herself down again in her chair, and turn'd her face aside in great displeasure, saying, "The noise of this ugly music is enough to tear one's head to pieces: it would kill me if I was to go in!" Then immediately she gave a signal to return, and her attendants carried her out of sight in a moment: they came the more slowly, in order to make their retutn the speedier. L 4 CHAP. VIII. KWO-khé-tzu hearing the trumpets and music, never doubted but Shuey-ping-sin had entered the house: nay he posted himself in a private corner that he might behold her as she passed by: having waited some time, and heard the music play twice, he began to wonder that no body appeared; but how great was his astonishment and confusion, when the eight women came to tell him, his beautiful mistress was gone back again. He enquired the meaning. They told him that when the music begun to play, she seemed surprized, and instantly fled. He asked why they did not endeavour to stay her? They said, that was impossible, she was gone so suddenly. He would have sent his people after her, but they assured him it would be in vain; she must have got home by this time: for that she went away as swift as an arrow. Kwo-khé-tzu raved and stared like a madman: he returned to the hall, and acquainted the Man-darines of the city, together with all his relations and friends. Some of them smiled, all were astonished. "This young woman, said the Che-foo, is a prodigy: to discover his intention from the bare playing of the music! What, said he, turning to Shuey-guwin, does your niece study at home any book of divination?" "When she was a child, replied her uncle, she would be always with her father poring over his books; so that by often reading and conversing with him, she would tell what days would be fortunate, and what unlucky: when to expect good weather, or bad: but we never used to regard what she said: however she now seems to have a spirit of divination, that from the bare sound of the music could discover our intentions." None that were present could help conceiving a great esteem and admiration for a lady of so much discernment. Kwo-khé-tzu stood overwhelmed with the deepest melancholy: at length rousing himself up, he could not help making one other effort, by sending the two females once more to her house. They were ordered to remind her that this was the twelfth day of her cousin's marriage: that her friends and relations were there assembled: that their mistress had a particular affection for her, and renewed her intreaties that she would not disappoint her of her company, it being a pleasure she had so much depended on: and that their master had the utmost esteem and respect for her. All this they punctually delivered: adding farther, that they were surprized her ladyship should return, after she had once come to the door: that the music was now removed; and therefore they hoped nothing would prevent her from going again. She replied: "As I thought the invitation I received from your lady and her spouse, flowed from sincere and undesigning friendship, I esteemed it my duty to comply with it: how far it proceeded from sinister views, is best known to themselves. But if there was nothing extraordinary intended, how came the eight letters to be changed? What was meant yesterday by the present of pearls? What brought the Che-foo, and Che-hien, who I have discovered were at his house? Was it not with a view of trepanning me into a marriage with your master? Thank Heaven* * It is thus that the Chinese generally speak of Divine Providence: see pag. 17. of this hist. &amp; passim: and here it may not be improper to observe, that although the vulgar are chiefly of the idolatrous sects of Fo and Tao-tsë, yet the Literati, Mandarines, &amp;c. profess no other religion than that prescribed in their ancient classical books, which is the worship of one Supreme Being, the Lord and sovereign Principle of all things, under the name of Shang-ti, i. e. Supreme Emperor: but more frequently under that of Tien, or Heaven: which their interpreters explain to mean, that Spirit which presides in Heaven, because Heaven is the most excellent work produced by this first cause. The same books enjoyn to honour, but (as the missionaries pretend) with a subordinate worship, inferior spirits which preside over cities, rivers, mountains, &amp;c. None but the Emperor sacrifices to Heaven, which he does in a magnificent temple three or four times a a year. After all most of the modern Literati understand the word Tien, &amp;c in their ancient books in a low material sense, and are downright atheists. See P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 640, 658. &amp;c. P. Semedo, p. 96. the music at the door preserved me: but for that friendly alarm I had now been at his disposal. [Then wiping her eyes, for she could not refrain from tears when she thought of the narrow escape she had had;] Go home, proceeded she, and together with my humble services to your master, advise him to live peaceably and lovingly with his wife: for that he and myself are never formed to come together: it will therefore be his wisest way to desist from all future attempts, and to trouble me no more." When this answer was reported to the Magistrates and the company, their admiration was still increased, and they looked upon her as no less then a prophetess: however as they had been invited to a feast, and had been waiting a great while, they desired it might be served up; and after they had eaten, took their leaves and departed. When all the company was gone: "Certainly, said Kwo khé-tzu to Shuey-guwin whom he had detained still with him: your niece is a woman of uncommon penetration: and yet all this may be accounted for, without supposing her possessed of supernatural powers: perhaps she and you have agreed together to play me these tricks: and it was from yourself she learnt my designs." Shuey guwin, piqued at this suspicion, not only denied it with the most vehement asseverations, but offered to take his solemn oath* * After a very close enquiry among the writers concerning China, the Editor hath not been able to meet with any account of the Chinese Oaths or Forms of swearing, nor of the ceremonies attending it. But this is not the only omission, which we have reason to complain of in the descriptions which those gentlemen give of the civil and religious rites of China. That the Chinese are not without Forms of Swearing, appears not only from the text, but from the following Authors. The first is Martinius, who in his Atlas Sinensis. (pag. 13.) tells us, that in every city, among other idol-temples, "is a magnificent one to its guardian Genius, in which although idols are at present sacrilegiously worshiped: yet there was a time when they only acknowledged the tutelar Spirit. Here all the Magistrates, when first they enter upon their office, TAKE AN OATH (sacramentum dicunt) by which they promise to discharge it faithfully, and to have regard to justice: calling upon the Spirit to bear witness and to punish their default." Ogilby hath copied this account, and from this or some other writer adds, "In ancient times instead of images in these temples, was only a board written with characters [of gold] to this effect, The seat of the guardian Angel of the city. But in these latter times they have used images instead of boards to represent their protectors, so to strike the greater awe on those that take the Oath [of allegiance] vol. 2. p. 547." Picart gives the same passages, and tells us that the Mandarines, not only when they enter on any post do homage in the first place to the Chin-hoan or guardian Genius, and take the Oath, &amp;c. but that this homage must be repeated twice a year. See vol. 4. p. 220. Martinius also tells us of the Chinese, that "PEJERANTES, obscenæve loquentes audire rarum est." Which however proves the existence of the thing. Atlas Sin. p. 9. That forms of swearing are familiar to the Chinese, appears also from a curious passage in The Travels of P. Gerbillon, &amp;c. into Tartary in 1689, as given us by P. Du Halde, vol. 2. the length of which the reader will excuse. That father, who was present at the treaty concluded between the Russians and Chinese for settling their respective frontiers, tells us, that after each party had signed and sealed the two copies that were to be delivered to the other, viz. the Chinese, one in Tartarian and the second in Latin; and the Russians one in their own language and the other in Latin; after this the ambassadors rising all together, and holding each the copies of the treaty, "swore in the names of their masters to observe them faithfully, taking Almighty God, the Sovereign Lord of all things, to witness to the sincerity of their intentions. Our ambassadors, (adds the father, meaning the Chinese,) had express orders from the Emperor, to swear the peace by the God of the Christians, believing nothing could influence the Russians more to the observance of it, than their knowing it was sworn in the name of the true God. Our ambassadors had composed the form of an Oath, which I shall here faithfully translate, the better to shew their genius." The Oath itself is too long to be here inserted: but after observing that effusion of blood, &amp;c. is intirely contrary to the will of Heaven, which is a friend to publick tranquillity, and after giving the heads of the treaty, it concludes in this remarkable manner, But should any one have the thought only or secret design to transgress these articles of peace, or breaking his word and faith, should violate them out of private interest, or from the design of exciting new troubles and of rekindling the fire of war, we pray the Supreme Lord of all things, who knows the bottom of men's hearts, not to suffer such people to live out their days, but to punish them by an untimely death. "It was the design (he adds) of the Chinese ambassadors to have read this form of Oath before an image of the God of the Christians, and to have adored him by prostrating themselves on the ground according to their custom, and then to have burnt the said formula signed with their hand, and sealed with the seal of the Emperor's troops. But the Russians said each party should swear after their own manner. For this reason our ambassadors dropped their own formula . . . . and swore in the in the same terms with the Russians." Ibid. pag. 315. Let. ed. vij. 195. But that the Chinese are not unacquainted with Forms of Swearing, and that they readily adopt those of other nations, appears also from a Letter of P. Jartoux in the Lettres edifiant. &amp; curieus. jx. 403. where we are told, but in general terms, that to remove certain scruples of the Missionaries, the heir apparent Swore upon the faith of a Prince, and moreover drew a Cross upon the ground, and Swore by the Cross. See also P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 385. Upon the whole then it may be inferred from the above extracts, that the manner of Swearing in China is to fall prostrate before the image of one of their Genij, Spirits, &amp;c. calling upon him to attest the truth and integrity of their words or actions, and to punish any deviation from it. Vide Mart. Hist. p. 12. The length of this note it is hoped will be excused, as it is upon a subject, which perhaps is no where professedly treated of, but in this book. of it. He accepted this offer, and remained satisfied: then desiring him to sit down by him, he said, "When first I saw your niece, I fell in love with her for Vol. I. M her beauty, but now were she more ugly than Ghiang-koo, I should admire her no less for her ingenuity and wit. I am distracted to obtain her: you must still contrive some way to oblige me." M 2 After a profound silence of some minutes, Shuey-guwin started up and said, "I have at length discovered means which I think cannot fail." Kwo-khé-tzu was all attention. "The twentieth day of the ninth moon, proceeded the other, is the anniversary of her mother's death, when it was her yearly custom to go to her tomb, and there to burn incense and offer up sacrifice* * As the Chinese are distinguished for filial piety beyond all other nations, so they seem to carry this to an idolatrous excess. Various and excessive are the honours which they pay to their deceased parents and ancestors. * * Dionys. Kao. p. 179, n. Before the dead are interred, while the corpse lies in state they make many prostrations, and offer perfumes, flowers, lighted tapers, &amp;c. before it. They afterwards observe a long time of mourning [three years for a father or the Emperor] during which time they wear coarse white garments, and must retire from all publick employments, &amp;c. They afterwards every spring and autumn meet in an apartment called, The Hall of their Ancestors, where all the descendants of the family assemble, and burn perfumes, offer delicate viands, &amp;c. before their images, their pictures, or at least their names. The last honours the Chinese pay to their deceased parents is to resort once a year to their burial places; which are built without the city, generally upon some eminence, and planted round with pine and cypress trees, diversified with little groves, &amp;c. After clearing the sepulchres from weeds and bushes, they make the same expressions of veneration, gratitude and grief, which they observed at their death. Then they offer up on the tomb, wine and victuals, with which they afterwards regale themselves. The Jesuits alledge that these ceremonies, as prescribed by the laws, are not idolatrous, but only marks of civil respect: but this notion has been much controverted by the Missionaries of other orders. However the former (while they had admission into China) allowed their converts to join in those rites, tho' they taught them to place a crucifix* * So P. Gobien quoted by Picart, p. 213. among the statues when they made the prostrations. But it is agreed that the Bonzees have introduced many superstitious practices, such as burning gilt paper in the form of money, and even pieces of silk; teaching that the souls of the deceased hover about and feed upon the meats and perfumes that are burnt. N. B. At or near the tombs of people of quality are built several apartments, where the relations sometimes pass a month in mourning, and whither they occasionally return. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 306. &amp;c. P. Semedo, part 1. ch. 16. &amp; 19 passim. Picart, p. 212, &amp;c. : at which time she receives her rents of the neighbouring villages, and walks and amuses herself M 3 for two or three days among the gardens. At that juncture do you provide a good swift horse for yourself, and a set of stout Cooleys or chairmen: lay wait for her with these as she goes or returns: ordering them, when you give the signal, to stop the men that carry her chair, and after they have fallen upon them and beat them, to seize and carry her home to your house." Kwo-khé-tzu was charmed with this proposal, and resolved to put it in execution. "Nothing, said he, can defeat a design so well concerted as this: unless badness of weather should keep her at home." "Even that, said Shuey-guwin, will hardly prevent her from going: for she bears the greatest regard for her mother's memory." Kwo-khé-tzu had no farther doubts about the success of their project: in the happy contemplation of which Shuey-guwin left him. As soon as he got home, he hastened to his niece to chide her for what had happened. "Your cousin's husband, said he, shewed you great civility, not only to invite you, but also to do it in M 4 so respectful a manner: and for you to come to his door and then run away, what could occasion such strange be-haviour? It hath brought a great deal of shame not only on yourself but also on me: for I could hardly lift up my head any more in company." "I need not use many words, replied Shuey-ping-sin; let me only say, that whether my suspicions were well grounded or not, is best known to himself, but I had certainly the strongest foundation for them." "By no means, said he, all that he wanted was to pay his compliments to his new relations, and to shew you that respect which he thought due to the cousin of his wife." "That, said his niece, you will hardly persuade me to believe: nay although I escaped the snare this time, I am of opinion that he is still contriving some trick to catch me. And you know best whether you yourself are altogether innocent. You will probably deny it; but the event will shew it before it be long." Shuey-guwin's heart began to beat, and he went home without uttering a single syllable. Now the ninth moon being come, Shuey-ping-sin began to think of paying her respects at her mother's tomb, and of visiting the places where she was every year accustomed to go. She sent therefore to acquaint her uncle and his three sons, of her intention. It instantly occured to Shuey-guwin, that if he went with her, he would be thought a party concerned in the carrying her off: he therefore returned for answer that he was indisposed. She then desired his two eldest sons might accompany her: but they, it was answered, were ingaged in business which they could not leave: but that his youngest son, if she required it, might go with her. At the same time he sent to advise Kwo-khé-tzu of it, and that she was to set out the very next morning. On the morrow she ordered every thing to be got ready with such preparation, as might testify her respect for the memory of her mother. She appointed her grand chair* * The compilers of the Modern Universal History inform us, that these chairs or sedans are of two sorts. Those belonging to people of quality are borne on two or more men's shoulders; but those of the inferior rank have only one pole put through a ring on the top; and rather resemble a large cage carried between two men, the hindermost holding it with both his hands to prevent it from jogging to and fro. Those of the inferior kind, which are commonly of japanned wood, have either some small holes or oblong narrow slits, not only to let in the air, but to give them that are in it a glimpse of what passes in the streets through which they are conveyed: but those of the better sort are covered with such rich silks as not only shut out the light, but even the fresh air. The same writers describe both kinds as made very low. (See vol. 8. p. 260. note K.) If one may judge from the Chinese prints, these sedans are not so very low, as they are here represented. And with regard to those used by the men for travelling, Du Halde assures us that they are higher as well as lighter than those used in Europe. These, he says, are made of bambû, and are of a convenient size for sitting at ease, being carried by men like ours. If there be but two chairmen, the ends of the poles rest on their shoulders: but if there be four, then the ends of the poles, as well before as behind, pass through two running knots of a strong pliable cord, hung by the middle to a thick stick, whose ends rest on the shoulders of the chairman. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 266. N. B. All authors inform us, that the chairs used on solemn occasions are very splendid, being finely gilt, and in other respects pompously decorated. to be set out, together with four smaller chairs for her maids. She had a horse brought to the door in the street for her cousin* * Brother in the original. : then ordering the chairs into the hall, and having placed herself and her women in them, the chairmen came and took them away. From thence they marched along in great order; first of all went the chair of state, preceded by a magnificent umbrella, and carried by four cooleys or chairmen: then came the four small ones, followed by her cousin on horseback attended by two servants. They were now got out of the city, and wanted but about a lee* * See note pag. 15. of the tomb: when suddenly there came up three lusty men on the left hand and as many on the right; who stopped the grand chair. And presently after from among the bushes, there rushed out more than twenty cooleys or chairmen, five or six of whom immediately seized on the chair, crying out to them who carried it: "This is our place; would you take our livelihood from us?" Then beating them off, they took it up and ran away with it as fast as they could. The servants on horseback seeing this, rode after them, demanding how they durst offer such insult to a lady of quality. They made no reply, but hurried away the faster. One of the servants was almost up with the chair: when of a sudden bolted out Kwo-khé-tzu himself and stopped him. "How now, impudence! said he, your lady there is my wife." "I knew not that, Sir, said the servant, I only did my duty: which had I not done, my lady would have punished me." "Lay the blame upon me, replied the other, do you go home about your business." The servant stood still. Then Kwo-khé-tzu forbidding him with heavy threats to advance, hasted after the chair. By this time the four other chairs were come up together with the attendants; who after a little consultation, turn'd about and went home again. In the mean while Kwo-khé-tzu accompanied his prize 'till it was got within the gate of the city: then giving the strictest charge to his servants to take great care of it, and see it safely set down within his house, he turned aside to the Che-foo and Che-hien, in order to intreat them to come and be witnesses. CHAP IX.* * CHAP. V. in the Translator's manuscript. KWO-khé-tzu was not so overjoyed that he had secured the prize, as to be neglectful of what might happen; left therefore upon her arrival at his house, she would make a disturbance and reject the marriage, he made all possible haste to fetch the Magistrates of the city, together with others of his relations and friends; in order to produce her eight letters before them; and to silence whatever she might plead to the contrary. He was transported that he should now recover his credit, in shewing himself capable of outwitting her; and congratulated himself as well for the happy concerting of his project, as for the resolution and dexterity with which it had been executed. He used such expedition in mustering his friends, that he was got home before the chair. It was not however long behind him. He soon saw it coming; his people driving along the streets, and clearing their way like a swarm of wasps. They were going to set it down at the gates: but he would not let them, neither at the second door, but made them carry it into the great hall. Upon this the Che-foo, the Che-hien, and all his relations and friends rose up, and came to meet him, crying out, "Kong-héé, or much joy to you! how rare is it to find a woman so beautiful and so accomplished as Shuey-ping-sin? What cause have you to rejoice in having at length obtained so inestimable a treasure?" Kwo-khé-tzu beheld the chair with the most evident satisfaction, and advancing towards the upper end of the hall, returned their compliments with equal civility: "Extraordinary, said he, as Vol. I. N this step I have taken may appear, I have been guilty of no unwarrantable violence: this lady was the person to whom I was originally contracted in marriage; and the receiving another woman in her stead, was the effect of her contrivance: the opportunity I now have, permits me but barely to do myself justice: I must therefore desire you all to be my witnesses; and that the Che-foo and Che-hien will be in this affair as my father and mother, in making the marriage firm and valid, and in preventing any farther trouble about it. Those magistrates advised him to bury in profound silence all that was past; telling him they were ready to attest what he had asserted; that since he had brought her there, he was now obliged to marry her, and therefore had nothing to do, but to carry her in, and have performed the usual ceremonies* * Viz. "of drinking wine together; of making their joint reverences to Heaven, &amp;c." (See note page 110:) to which some writers add, "and to the names or images of their ancestors." See P. Semedo, p. 72. . Kwo-khé-tzu desired before this was done, she might appear before them; that she might have no pretence to complain of compulsive or hasty measures, or that the marriage was conducted otherwise than openly, with the most proper and deliberate decorum. "Well, said the Che-foo,if you would rather have it so, let the chair be opened, and let the lady appear." N 2 Kwo-khé-tzu then ordered his women to go to the chair, and lifting up the curtain, to open the door. They went accordingly, but found it lock'd: of which they returned and inform'd their master. He was not surpriz'd at this, attributing it either to her delicacy or her fear. Then going himself and trying in vain to open the lock, at length he broke it. On this, the women advanced to open the door, which as soon as they had done, they stood still for some minutes. Enrag'd at this delay he began to storm at them, asking, why they stood staring, and did not hand their lady out of the chair? With looks of the utmost astonishment and confusion, they told him there was no lady; not so much as the shadow of one. He was greatly surprized, and advancing to the chair to be satisfied himself, instead of the fair Shuey-ping-sin, he saw nothing but a bundle wrapt about with a scarlet cloth. At this he fell a stamping and raving like one distracted: "How can this be possible? said he; one of my own women servants this morning saw her drest, and ready to go into the chair, but a little while before it set out." The Che-foo and Che-hien, with the rest that were invited, went also to the chair, and with equal astonishment saw nobody was in it. "Surely, said they all, this young lady must be a prophetess, and have a power of divining, thus to foresee, and avoid all your pursuits: 'tis enough; you must think no more N 3 of her: for whether she be saint or demon, there is no fathoming her contrivances: she must surely be of no common capacity." Kwo-khé-tzu was too much mortified and confounded to answer a syllable. The Che-foo seeing him cast down and dejected, ordered them to take out the bundle and see what was in it. Opening it they found only a box filled with pebble stones. At this every body laugh'd: and taking their leave, left Kwo-khé-tzu to bewail his disgrace* * The Chinese author hath told this story with so little art, that in page 173 he forestalls our curiosity by informing us, that when Kwo-khé-tzu forbad the servant to advance, "He (the servant) knowing what he was about, said, it is very well, I will stay here and rest myself. Accordingly he stay'd till the other small chairs were come up, in one of which was Shuey-ping-sin: whom he with the rest of the servants, accompanied home again." The Editor hath taken the liberty to suppress this single passage, which he doubts not every reader of taste will pardon. . He was so disturbed in his mind, that for some time he did not perceive they had left him: at length raising up his head and looking round, he saw his hall empty, and nobody left, except one friend, who sat unobserv'd in a corner, and seem'd buried in profound thought. The name of this person was Chun kéé. Taking courage to find he was not totally deserted, the youth called out, inviting him to come and sit down with him, and to talk over the affair that had happen'd. "To-day, said he, after having thought myself secure of the accomplishment N 4 of my wishes beyond all possibility of disappointment, how have I been deceived, and shamed and mortified? I cannot account for the trick she hath play'd me; it seems to exceed all human power: and yet I cannot forget her; neither shall I give her up, as those here advised me. Tell me how you would act in like situation?" "This young lady, answer'd Chun-kéé, is very subtle; she is no less uncomplying and obstinate: to think to obtain her therefore by soft and gentle means, will be involving yourself in an endless pursuit: nothing but downright force can succeed with her." "Alas! replied the other, of what little effect bare force can be, the disappointment of this day may shew: besides, after this unsuccessful attempt, she will not easily fall in my way again: her youth and sex will afford her no occasion to stir out for the future: nor will she readily venture of herself." "Do not despair, said the other, I have bethought myself of an expedient, that does not seem unlikely." Kwo-khé-tzu listen'd with great attention. "Her father, proceeded Chun kéé, is in banishment, and I hear 'tis a long while that she hath had no news of him: I hear also that she preserves for him the most ardent affection, and continually feeds an hope that he will one day obtain the Emperor's pardon." "All this said the other, may be very true: but what is it to our purpose?" "You must get, said his friend, a coloured paper, upon which let it be written, that a great Mandarine hath procured a pardon for him, and that the Emperor has restored him to his office again. Send this dispatch to her house by a train of twenty messengers, and let her be called upon to receive the mandate* * In the original Ngun-cheaow-chyéé, or "paper of pleasure." Trans. with due respect. This will oblige her to come out to meet it. Then let a chair be ready, and the moment she steps out of the hall force her into it and away." Kwo-khé-tzu applauded this scheme, and thought it might be successful. "But stay, proceeded Chun-kéé, we must at the same time make some provision for our own security. Shuey-ping-sin is the daughter of a Mandarine of good family: and when she sees herself thus suddenly beset and carried away by violence, it may cause her to commit some desperate action: perhaps to strangle herself with her garter; or to stab herself with her scissars, or some other implement she may have about her. To prevent therefore the blame of any such action, you shall present a petition to the Che-foo and Che-hien to summon her before them at your suit: by which you will have their officers to accompany your people, and their authority for your sanction: and at the same time that you are screen'd from the consequences† † In the original it is, "If she should do herself a mischief, then it will be nothing." of the attempt, you will have those magistrates ready to compleat the marriage." Kwo-khé-tzu could not conceal his satisfaction at so artful and at the same time so safe a contrivance: "This, says he, is a thousand* * In the original it is "a million of times." times better than any I have undertaken before: nothing remains but to fix the time for its execution." When they had settled this point between them, they parted. Shuey-ping-sin, having thus a third time narrowly escaped falling into the hands of her persecutor, kept herself very close at home, and would scarcely suffer any one to go in or out of her house. As for Shuey-guwin and his sons, being sensible she strongly suspected them, they came in her way as little as possible. Yet greatly as she had been harrassed, alarmed and terrified, her concern on that account was light, compared with what she suffered for the sake of her father. His misfortunes and disgrace were the constant subject of her thoughts: and if she sometimes encouraged an hope, that he would one day be restored to his family and his friends, it was as often interrupted by doubt and stifled by despair. One morning as she was employed in dressing her head* * Although the Chinese Ladies are extremely confined, and seldom stir out of their apartment, which is in the most retired part of the house, having no communication but with the women servants; yet it does not appear that they have a greater aversion for dress than the ladies of Europe: for we are told, that they spend several hours every morning in dressing and setting themselves out, though they have so little chance to be seen. Their head-dress usually consists of several curls, interspersed with little tufts of gold and silver flowers: some adorn their heads with the figure of a fabulous bird called fong-whang, answering to the phænix with us. The young ladies commonly wear a kind of crown made with paste-board, and covered with a beautiful silk; the forepart whereof rises in a point above the forehead, and is covered with jewels, &amp;c. but on the top of the head with natural and artificial flowers. Women in years are content with a piece of fine silk, wound two or three times about the head. There appears an uncommon modesty in their looks and dress. Their gowns are very long, and cover them from head to foot, so that nothing is to be seen but their faces; their hands being always concealed within their wide long sleeves, which almost drag on the ground. And here it may be proper to observe, that if they have occasion to present any thing to a man, they always do it with their hand wrapt up in their sleeve. And if a man presents any thing to them, he must set it down upon a table, &amp;c. and then they will come and take it up in their sleeve. (See Martin. Atlas Sin. p. 9. &amp;c. To return; there is nothing the Chinese women esteem more beautiful, than to have little feet: as soon as they are born, the nurses are careful to bind this part very close, to prevent its growing: so that when they are marriageable, their feet are not larger than those of a child of three or four years old. This we are told does not affect their health, although it renders their gait ungraceful. Their shoes are finely embroidered, and of finished neatness. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 281, &amp;c. P. Le Compte, tom. 1. p. 191, &amp;c. , she was alarmed by a great noise and disturbance in the street at the gate of her court: she sent an old woman of her attendants to inquire the meaning of it. But before she could get to the gate, it was already broken down, and a great many people came running in with the coloured paper, who cried out, "Good news! much joy to Shuey-ping-sin!" These words, though not very distinctly heard, reached the ears of the young lady: she therefore hastened into the hall, and stood behind the door to be the better satisfied: where she saw the people, and heard very plainly what they said: crying aloud, "Here is the Emperor's mandate, she must come out immediately to meet and receive it." Upon this, accompanied by two of her maids, she ventured out: and was instantly surrounded. She asked where the order was: they answered, at the Che-foo's, and that she must go there: and immediately a chair was brought into the hall. Perceiving how matters were conducted, she began to suspect all was not right, and that some evil design was in agitation against her: but finding it too late to retreat, she mustered up a noble courage and resolution, and concealing her fear and surprize, waved her hand to be heard. "You that are now come here, said she, upon this pretence, belong to, or are sent by Kwo-khé-tzu; and the reason he sends you hither to take me, is not because he hates me or is my enemy, but it rather proceeds from his violent regard: and therefore if I comply with his desires and marry him, don't I not only gratify his utmost wishes, but also immediately become your mistress? As therefore it will then be in my power to punish you as I please, be careful how you are guilty here of any indecency." Chun-kéé, who was in the crowd, hearing what she said, cried out, "It is very true, Lady, and therefore if you will please to go into the chair, no one will offer Vol. I. O the least discourtesy." "Well then, said she, stand aside a little and give me room; let me speak to my people, and make some little change in my dress." Then calling a female attendant to bid her bring her cloaths, she whispered in her ear, to conceal a knife in the sleeve of her gown. All this was performed, and she accordingly changed her habit. Then having given orders to her servants about the management of her house, she addressed herself once more to the people: "To-day, said she, if you would gain an interest in your master, by doing me a favour, you must oblige me in one thing." "If you will but marry Kwo-khé-tzu, replied Chun-kéé, there is nothing we shall dare to refuse you." She proceeded, "It is now three times that that young Lord hath come to marry me: it is not in my power to resist him any longer, but then you must not carry me directly to his house; for I will sooner dye, than be married there by force, and in a low clandestine manner. Therefore carry me first to the Man-darines of the city: and let the marriage be performed openly and honourably before those Magistrates, suitable to the dignity of my rank, and of his pretensions." "You say right, said Chun-kéé, it shall be as you order, you shall go first to the Che-hien, then to the Che-foo, and afterwards to the house of your husband: thus will every thing be decent and regular." Shuey-ping-sin then ordering two of her maids O 2 to attend her, and bidding one of her servants to take down the coloured paper, which had been fixed to the gate, and to bring it along to the Che-hien's, called for the chair, and threw herself into it. The people of Kwo-khé-tzu, who were about thirty in number, having thus got possession of the prize, which had so often eluded their master's pursuit, with the utmost alacrity and speed took up the chair and ran away with it through the city, regardless of every thing they met in their passage; like a flight of crows, that are winging their way through the air. They had now almost reached the audience of the Che-hien, when in crossing a street, they ran against a young gentleman mounted on a mule with such violence, that they had like to have beaten both to the ground. Upon this the stranger, who was dressed in a student's habit, and was followed by one servant, instantly dismounted, and not a little incensed at their rudeness, laid hold of the chairmen, calling them impertinent and clownish rascals: "You are not, said he, escaping from fire or thieves, wherefore then do you hurry along at this uncivil and disorderly rate, overturning every thing in your way? How durst you affront me in this audacious manner?" They answered, that they were employed about a marriage of distinction; O 3 and who should hinder them? "Were you gold or diamonds, iron or glass, said they, go with us to the Che-hien, and we will grind you to powder." "If this marriage, replied he, is between people of quality, where are the usual ceremonies to attend it? Where is the chair of state adorned for that purpose? Where is the music, and other splendid attendance? Here is nothing of all this; but you rather seem to be villains that have stolen away some unfortunate lady: and as that is the case, I will go along with you to the audience myself." Chun-kéé hearing what he said, and perceiving by his mien, that he was no ordinary person, addressed him very respectfully, and said, "Pray, Sir, excuse the incivility done you by these fellows, who are clowns and know no better: they deserve correction, but in truth are not worthy your notice: better let them alone." The stranger recollected himself, and was going away; when of a sudden he heard a voice from the chair crying out for succour: "I am greatly injured: you seem to be a person of valour: O assist and save me!" Upon which he laid his hand on the chair, and once more stopped it: saying, "Is this then the reason of your indecent haste? Come away, I will go with you to the Mandarine's audience." The chairmen thus interrupted, seeing he would O 4 not quit them, went to fall upon him with their fists: but loosing the chair, he so well exerted himself, that he quickly laid many of them at his feet. Upon which Chun-kéé came up to him, and said: "Sir, you must not beat the people thus; though you would not before have gone to the Che-hien, now we must oblige you: let go the chair; and we will go there together." "By no means, said the young stranger: not 'till I am got to the door of the audience." As soon as they were arrived there, he raised the end of his whip, and struck the great drum* * As the Mandarines are appointed solely to protect the people, they ought always to be ready to hear their complaints, not only at the stated times of audience, but at all other hours of the day. If the affair be urgent, then they go to the Mandarine's palace, and beat upon a kind of kettle-drum, which is sometimes on one side of the hall of justice, but commonly without the doors, that the people may come at it both night and day. At this signal, the Mandarine, though never so much employed, is obliged to leave every thing immediately, to grant the audience demanded. But whoever gives the alarm, unless he hath suffered some extraordinary wrong that requires speedy redress, is sure to receive the bastinado for his pains. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 254. N. B. The Translator tells us in another place, that it is the custom for the officers of the tribunal, to take and bind the person that strikes upon the drum, until they have presented him to the Mandarine. It appears also from the Chinese anthor himself, that such was the custom, at least in his time. See book 3. chap. 4. that stood at the door: upon which all the people came out, wondering at his boldness. The Che-hien, who had expected the chair, sate in the hall waiting for it, when hearing the drum beat, he could not conceive what was the matter: immediately he saw his people come in, bringing in the stranger: "This, they said, is the person that beat on the drum." CHAP. X. THE young gentleman being brought before him, did not fall on his knees, or use those other signs of high reverence, which are usual from an inferior to one of higher rank. But when his hands were let go, held them up with the common salute, of one equal to another* * The Courtesy or Salute used by the common people, or such as treat one another freely, is to clap their hands one upon the other, and lift them up as high as their head: this is done twice, crying cin, cin, or rather ching, ching. When they would express more deference, after joining their hands, they first lift them up, and then let them fall almost to the earth, bowing their heads very low. When two friends meet after long separation, they both fall on their knees and bow to the earth, then rise up again, and perform the same ceremony two or three times. But if you appear before a person of the first quality, you must bend one knee, and remain in this posture till they raise you up. Lastly, when an inferior appears before one very much superior to him, the reverence is expressed by four times bowing as they stand, and by four times kneeling; which the other party receives sitting, and in some cases standing. See P. Semedo, p. 59. Nieuhoff, p. 37. P. Le Compte, tom 2. p. 40. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 293. Ogilby, vol. 2. p. 442. There is some little difference in the accounts of all these Writers: owing perhaps to the different times they lived in, or the different provinces they frequented. The Editor hath selected from each such particulars, as were most conformable to this history; but hath chiefly followed P. Semedo who lived nearest the time of its author, and before any innovations were made by the Tartars. : accosting him with ching, ching, or your servant, your servant. The Che-hien still more sur-prized at a familiarity, which seemed so ill-assumed; asked very sternly who he was, and for what reason he had beat on the drum. "Who I am, replied the other, is no way material: here hath great injustice been committed; for which reason I struck the drum, that you might examine into, and redress it." Before the Mandarine could answer: Chun-kéé entered: "Here, Sir, said he, is the young lady Shuey-ping-sin, whom I have brought in behalf of Kwo-khé-tzu: though engaged to him by all the due solemnities of the law, she hath put another in his place, and abused him: he hath now got her in his power; and having presented her to you, for your approbation and licence, will afterwards carry her home, and compleat the marriage." "If your friend, answered the other, hath gone through all the previous solemnities according to law, why do you bring her here? carry her home to her husband to whom she belongs." On this Chun-kéé turned to the people, saying, "The Mandarine hath given his permission, take up the chair and carry it home." The young lady hearing this, cried out, "Injustice! I am wronged and abused! Sir, you must see me righted!" Then she sprung from the chair, and was going into the hall: but the people there said, "What would you have? hath not the Che-hien ordered you to be carried away? You must not advance." Upon this she sat herself down on the floor, crying out aloud; "You Che-hien, that should be the father and mother* * "The principal duty of a Mandarine," saith a Chinese author, translated by P. Du Halde, "is to have paternal bowels for the preservation of those intrusted to his care; and in his whole conduct should do nothing unworthy the amiable name of father and mother of the people." Such language is natural in a nation, whose fundamental principle it is, that the state is a large family, and that the rulers ought to have for the subjects, the same regard that parents have for their children. "The first care of a father of a family," (in this style run some of their Publick Edicts;) "is to provide plentifully for the subsistence of his children; for a like reason, the Sovereign, who is father and mother of his people, ought to do the same." The Chinese require no refined skill in politics to judge of the merit and talents of their princes: they examine their conduct by this easy rule: "Why, say they, hath Heaven placed him on the throne? is it not that he may be, as a father and a mother to us?" See P. Du Halde vol. 2. p. 156. vol. 1. p. 508. 242. 243. See also L' Esprit des Loix, liv. 19. ch. 19 and page 177. of this volume. of the city, how can you thus abandon me to injustice, and send me away without hearing my defence?" The young stranger observing all that past, could no longer contain himself, but very much inraged said to the Mandarine: "This, Sir, is very unjust: your eyes are blinded, and your ears deaf to the cries of the injured: you are void of reason and conscience, you will hear but one side: is it thus you sit in the chair of justice for the Emperor? Surely you think there is none greater than yourself: that you are the only and chief Che-hien." At this the magistrate, highly provoked and stung to the quick with remonstrances at once so just and so severe, loaded him with reproaches, and cry'd out, "What impudent person are you that dare come into the Emperor's court, and make there this noise and disturbance?" "Truly a great court of the Emperor's! replied the other with a sneer of contempt; a great office yours of the Che-hien! Why I have gone into the house of the greatest Manda-rine, a house given him by the Emperor himself, and therefore sacred: I have broke open the doors by violence in order to rescue and protect the injured; yet he hath not dared to load me with obloquy: and are you of so exalted an office, as to heap abuses upon me, and to charge me with impudence?" The Che-hien, who chanced to be at court when the fact abovemention'd had happen'd, instantly recollected the whole affair; as also the person who stood before him. Struck therefore with no little fear, and softening his voice, "What then, said he, are you the son* * The Chinese author with great simplicity, opens his account of this adventure by telling us page 196, that the people of Kwo-khé-tzu met with and and run against "Tieh-chung-u being just arrived from the province of Ho-nan, who was seated on a mule, &amp;c." As the Editor conceived the suppressing of this circumstance for a page or two would serve to awake the Reader's attention and heighten the surprize, he presumes he shall be excused the liberty he hath taken. of the chief viceroy Tieh-ying? Is it possible?" And rising from his chair he saluted him in the most respectful manner. "Pardon me, Sir, said he; pardon me, that when a diamond was before my eyes, I could not know it. When I was at court I heard of your Vol. I. P fame, which sounded like thunder in my ears. Yet was I so unfortunate that I could not then have the happiness to visit you: and that I should meet with you now is a perfect miracle! I am sorry too it should be upon an occasion wherein you think I have done amiss: but I hope still to recover your good opinion." Then respectfully desiring him to sit, he call'd for tea* * The name of Thé or Tea comes to us from the corrupt pronunciation of one or two places in the province of Fo-kien: in all other parts of the Empire it is called Cha, which is the word used also by the Portuguese. The Chinese use tea for their common drink, but without any sugar or other sweetener. They have commonly in all families a boiler or other vessel over a fire; and whenever they are thirsty or faint put a few leaves of it in a bason and pour the hot water upon it, and as soon as it is cool enough to drink, swallow it down and go about their business. But when they drink it in form, the custom is to take the dish in both hands, and making a low bow to touch the ground with it: then they drink it at several sips, holding the dish in their left hand. The Tartarian manner is to hold the dish in the right hand, and to make a low bow to the person who gives the treat, both before and after they have drank. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 10. 297. Modern Univ. Hist. vol. 8. p. 228. note (B.) : which being brought, the Che-hien began to talk of the affair before them, asking him how he came to be concern'd in it, as he seemed to know the whole matter." "For my part, said Tieh-chung-u, I am intirely ignorant of the affair; but met these people just now in the street: when hearing one complain of injury and implore protection, I came along to your audience to procure redress; pray acquaint me with the whole story." "It is so very intricate and perplexed, P 2 replied the Che-hien, that I can hardly unravel it myself; but what I know of the matter is this: that young lady is the daughter of a great Man-darine of this city, named Shuey-keu-ye; her beauty hath made such an impression on the son of a minister of state, named Kwo-khé-tzu, that there is nothing he hath not attempted to gain her. The first time she changed the eight letters of Nean-kung, and gave her sister to him in her stead. The second time, when he had allured her to his house under pretence of a wedding visit, from the sound of the music she discovered his intention. The third time he attempted to catch her, as she was going to the gardens: but instead of securing her brought home nothing but a heap of stones." "Certainly, cried Tieh-chung-u, this person must be admirable; perhaps the world hath not her fellow. With your leave, Sir, I will go and view this prodigy." He had no sooner cast his eyes upon her, but struck with her beauty, he said aloud: "Sure never was a form more compleat and lovely: what a face and mien, beautiful without the assistance of art! what killing eyes, over-shaded with the most exact and finished arches, like little moons! neither air nor sun can wither or blast a flower whose teints are the gift of nature alone: there is no need of paint to that charming complexion: her countenance bespeaks a disposition as sweet as the most odoriserous P 3 flowers." He was so charmed with her appearance, that it made the deepest impression on his mind. Then approaching one step nearer, he made her a very low bow. "Lady, said he, how came you to be entrap'd, and brought hither now, after you had so often and so dexterously escaped?" Shuey-ping-sin rose up from the ground and replied, "My father, who is in banishment, hath caused me for a long time to pass my days in sorrow and affliction: but hearing of a sudden to-day, that the Emperor's order of pardon was come to recall him, I immediately, as it behoved me, ran out to meet it: but no sooner had set my foot in the hall and perceived it was false, but I was surrounded by these people, and had no other remedy but to come with them: yet, Sir, I have brought with me this knife, being resolved to die in the Che-hien's presence. I had determined never to behold the light of another day: but you seem to be a person of virtue and goodness, and were doubtless sent by my good Genius in this extremity to save me." [This said, she let fall a shower of tears, and hid her head in her bosom.] Tieh-chung-u was strongly moved at her distress: "Where, said he with great emotion, where is this order of the Emperor's? let me see it." She ordered the coloured paper to be brought to him; and he carried and shewed it to the Che-hien. "Is this, said he, the Emperor's order or not? you ought to know!" "I know nothing of it, replied the Che- P 4 hien, nor from whence it came." "That is much" said the other; and putting it into his sleeve, he remonstrated to that magistrate in very strong terms, the clandestine manner of his proceedings: "To-morrow, said he, I shall go and lodge a complaint with the Fu-yuen or Viceroy: and as for these people who have been the instruments in this affair, I charge you with them, that they be forth-coming, whenever the Viceroy thinks proper to call for them." Then slightly saluting him he was going away. The Che-hien, extremely frighted at the danger he was in, called to Tieh-chung-u and intreated him to stay: "Pray, Sir, said he, be not so hasty and passionate, let me have time to inquire into this affair, before you take a step of such consequence." Then calling before him Chun-kéé, and the rest of his party, with violent emotions of anger he told them they were ignorant of what related to justice, and had acted in this affair like slaves and villains. "Whence, said he, have you brought this order? what authority have you for it?" They all stood silent. Then he ordered the stocks of confession* * The ordinary Torture in China to extort Confession is very acute and painful. It is inflicted both on the feet and hands: for the former they use an instrument called kia-quen, composed of three cross pieces of wood; that in the middle is fixed, the two other move and turn about; between these the feet are put, and squeezed so violently that the ancle bone is rendered quite flat. However, P. Du Halde tells us, they have remedies to diminish and stupefy the sense of pain during the torture; and others to restore in a few days the use of their limbs. See vol. 1. p. 314. P. Semedo, p. 143. to be broughtforth. On which in great fright, they all cryed out, "Sir, don't charge this to our account; every thing was done by our master's order." "Very well, said the Che-hien: to-day I have a guest with me, and therefore shall suspend for the present any farther examination." He then ordered them all to be carried to prison: and appointed some of his own people to convey the young lady back to her house. Every thing being thus dispatched, the Che-hien ordered an entertainment to be got ready, and intreated Tieh-chung-u to stay and drink wine with him; which the latter, who was extremely pleased in having procured redress for the fair Shuey-ping-sin, readily complied with. When they had drank pretty plentifully, and all reserve was banished, the Che-hien renewed the former topic, assuring him that all was the contrivance of Kwo-khé-tzu, who was alone in fault: that wholly taken up in his employments at court, his father knew nothing of these transactions: "Yet, said he, if it should be carried before the Viceroy, not the youth alone would suffer, but his father* * In China the Parents are accountable for the behaviour of their Children, and when the latter are guilty of extraordinary crimes, the former are put to death along with them. This is done upon a supposition, that they must have neglected their education, and have failed to exert that paternal authority to restrain them, which nature hath established, and to which the Chinese laws give such additional force. Upon the same principles, the Mandarines are obliged to answer for the behaviour of their People: for whenever any enormous crime is committed within their district, they are all deprived of their offices. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 257. L'Esprit des Loix, liv. 6. chap. 20. , and even myself. Let me conjure you therefore not to carry things to extremity." "For my part, said Tieh-chung-u, my being concerned in this affair was purely accidental: I have no otherwise interposed in it, than as I was led by a disinterested regard for justice: far from bearing any personal resentment against Kwo-khé-tzu, I do not even know him: and the manner in which I became interested in opposing his desires, will clear me from the charge of seeking it busily. Therefore if he will engage to lay aside all thoughts of this young lady, and desist from troubling her, nothing more need be said about it." The Mandarine, glad to see him so well inclined, was full of acknowledgments, and applauded him as a person of great virtue and worth. By this time Tieh-chung-u began to express a desire to withdraw: and upon the Che-hien's demanding where he was lodged, and being told he was not yet provided, he sent his people to conduct him to a Pagoda or Convent* * The Pagods, or Pagodas (for so their idol-temples or convents are called) may be reckoned among the most sumptuous buildings of the Chinese. The structure consists partly of porticos and partly of halls and pavillions, which stand in the corners of the courts and communicate by long galleries: the roofs of these buildings shine with beautiful japan'd tiles, &amp;c. Near to these temples commonly stands, but by itself, a great pyramidal tower; of this kind is the famous porcelain one at Nan-king. This is the form of most of the Pagodas, and these are the habitations of the Bonzees or idol-priests, and monks; who live inclosed, sometimes to the number of four or five hundred together, within a large circuit of wall, three or four in a house, that is, one master and the rest scholars. These (we are told by an Author quoted in Picart) serve for the accommodation of travellers like the Turkish Caravansera's. But according to P. Du Halde it is with great difficulty that any except the Mandarines are permitted to lodge there all night. However the Bonzees wait upon such as are their guests with great affection, lodge them in their own apartments, and take care of their baggage, their servants and porters: notice being given of their arrival by beating on a drum at the gate. Yet P. Trigaut (as quoted by Ogilby) tells us, that it is customary with the Bonzees (chiefly at Pe-king) to let their cells to strangers who come thither to trade, which for the more profit they divide into as many partitions as they can. So that these cloysters seem rather publick inns than places of sanctity. The Bonzees have a moderate allowance from the Emperor, beside what they can get by begging, singing their prayers, &amp;c. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. 289. 265. vol. 2. 73. &amp;c. P. Semedo, p. 89. Ogilby, vol. 2. p. 584. Picart, vol. 4. p. 233. N. B. The disagreement observable in the accounts of these Authors, may be owing to the different regulations, which may have been made at different times and places, concerning the Bonzees, who are subject to the Tribunal of Rites. and to see him accommodated suitably to his rank. Let us now return to Kwo-khé-tzu, who was flattering himself that he had at last surmounted all obstacles, when he received an imperfect account, that the chair with Shuey-ping-sin had been met by a stranger, who had gone with her to the Che-hien's audience, and that there some dispute had happened, the particulars of which he could not learn: but that the whole had ended in their conveying the young lady home, and his servants to prison. With a heavy heart therefore he repaired to the Che-foo, and acquainted him with what he had heard. "What! more difficulties yet? said he, I'll send and talk with the Che-hien about it." He had scarcely spoke, when that magistrate appeared. The Che-foo informed him what he had heard, and inquired who the stranger was, whom he had treated with so much respect and ceremony. "The person you speak of, answered the other, is the son of the Tieh-tu-yuen (or supreme Viceroy) his name is Tieh-chung-u: he doth not exceed twenty years of age. When I was at court waiting for my present office, there was a great Mandarine who had taken a young maid and kept her by force in his house, which was sacred and none dared so much as look into it: but this youth with his mace, weighing twenty catty, broke open the door and boldly rescued her: which the Emperor hearing of was highly pleased, and did justice to all the parties. But who is ignorant of Tieh-chung-u? the court rings with his name. Shuey-ping-sin was met by him to-day as she was brought to my house: he hath informed himself of the whole affair, and got possession of the counterfeit order: nay he was going to present it to the Viceroy of the province, which if he had done, it would have affected both yourself and me, no less than Kwo-khé-tzu and his father. The least I could do therefore was to shew some outward respect to one who had us all so much in his power." The Che-foo told him, he did well. But Kwo-khé-tzu was greatly chagrined, and said, Vol. I. Q "What though he is valiant, and his father a Viceroy; am not I the son of a Minister of State? I am not therefore to submit to him: why did not you manage this business for me better?" "This stranger, replied the Che-hien, got the counterfeit order into his hands, and had it in his power to have ruined us all: it was therefore through fear, and not any respect to him, that I carried matters so smoothly." "Well: said Kwo-khé-tzu, since things are so, there's an end of my hopes: Shuey-ping-sin is irretrievably lost." "As to that matter, said the Che-hien, it becomes not me to interpose in it: but if you have still a desire to obtain her, you must go home and consult with the most sensible of your friends. With regard to Tieh-chung-u, I have lodged him at a Convent, where he is alone without friends or acquaintance." These words did not escape Kwo-khé-tzu, who took his leave of those Magistrates, and, as soon as he was got home, sent to find out his friend Chun-kéé. With him he talked over all that had happened: "And yet, concluded he, the Che-hien seems to hint to me not to despair; notwithstanding I can see no possibility of success: and unless you can help me, must give up all hopes." "With regard to the Che-hien, answered the Q 2 other, he is still disposed to serve you: all the civilities he heaped on the stranger were meerly for a blind: he is not on that account the less a friend to our cause. The hint which he dropped that he had carried him to a Convent, where he was alone and without friends, was not without meaning: he intended to point out a way for you to do yourself justice." "True; said Kwo-khé-tzu, this is a valuable hint; but how shall we improve it? Shall we put him to death, or order him only to be soundly beaten?" "However we shall determine that point, said his friend; it will behove us to be careful that no ill consequences accrue to ourselves; let us do nothing that shall afford a handle for justice." He then paused a little, and with great secrecy, communicated to him, a scheme* * All who have described the genius and character of the Chinese, ascribe to them an acuteness and cunning that is truly wonderful, whether it be exerted in promoting their own interest in general, or in extricating themselves on sudden emergences. (See P. Du Halde, vol. 1. pag. 280, &amp;c. Martin. Atlas Sinens. pag. 5. P. Semedo, p. 27.) There is a remarkable instance of the latter kind, adduced both by P. Semedo and P. Du Halde, to this effect. "A certain Mandarine the Visitor of a Province having acted some time in his government, of a sudden shut up his gates and refused access to any person, pretending he was sick. A Mandarine, one of his friends, was much troubled at it, and with great difficulty obtained leave to speak with him. When he was admitted, he informed him of the discontent that was in the city by reason that all public business was at a stand. The Visitor put him off with the same excuse of his sickness. "I see no signs of this, answered his friend, but if your Lordship will be pleased to unfold to me the true cause, I will serve you in it at the hazard of my life." "Know then, replied the Visitor, that some one hath stolen the Emperor's seal out of the cabinet where it used to be kept, leaving it locked as if it had not been touched; so that if I would give audience, I am not able to seal dispaches. Now should my negligence in the loss of the seal, be discovered, I shall lose my government, at least, if not my life. In this suspence, I am endeavouring to gain time, which yet will but little avail me, being more sensible than the people themselves of this delay of justice." The Mandarine readily perceiving how terrible his situation was, asked him if he had no enemy whom he suspected. He answered. Yes: that the Che-foo or Governor of the city had long borne a concealed malice against him, and would now be the first to inform the court of his misfortune. "Away then, my Lord, quoth the Mandarine in great haste; remove all your goods into the most secret part of your palace, and at night set fire to the empty apartments; calling out for help to quench the fire. Thither the Che-foo must of necessity repair with the first, this being one of the principal duties of his office. As soon as you see him among the people, call out to him aloud, and consign to his care the cabinet thus shut up as it is: and if he maliciously caused the seal to be stolen, he will replace it there, or you may accuse him of having lost it." The Visitor followed his advice, and it succeeded so well, that the next morning the seal was restored to him. P. Semedo, p. 28. P. Du Halde, v. 1. p. 243. , which diffused a visible transport over the countenance of Kwo- Q 3 khé-tzu: who instantly resolved to put it in execution. "Haste, said he, let us not slip this favourable occasion: let there be no delay lest he should be gone before we can effect it."

[See P. Du Halde, v. 2. p. 85. and Ibid. pag. 167.]— Nor is the notion of using human substance confined to medicine only; one of their Emperors is said to have employed in a Mausoleum, which he built, lamps, that were fed with human fat. [Id. vol. 1. p. 494.] Even so lately as in the year 1746. one of the Missionaries being seized on, and some white wax candles found in his custody; the Chinese (among whom the art of blanching wax is unknown) instantly imagined them to be made of human fat: and these suspicions seized not the common people only, but the Mandarines themselves, who should have known better. See Lett. edif. xxvij. 365. As to Pe-kan, his story is a very celebrated one among the Chinese, but is related by most of their writers in the following manner. The Emperor Chew (who reigned An. 1154. before Christ, and who is looked upon as the Nero of the Chinese) had a very wicked queen named Ta-kia, at whose instigation he perpetrated a thousand cruel actions, and rendered himself universally odious. One of his uncles named Pe-kan (or Pi-cang) said to himself, "It is better to die than to keep silence any longer: though the tyrant will not hear my remonstrance, yet my country will, and so will posterity." He accordingly addressed himself to the Emperor, who heard his reproofs with an air of indignation and sury, "It is pretended, said he, that the hearts of the sages have seven ventricles* * A proverbial expression of the Chinese to signify the superior fortitude and wisdom of their saints or heroes, &amp;c. , I will see, if it be so in this Pe-kan, who makes such an ostentation of his wisdom and fortitude." So saying he ordered his breast to be opened, and with many scoffs and jeers had his heart brought for him to examine. Vid. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 447. Conf. lib. 3. p. 133. Mart. Hist. p. 94. N. B. The Chinese Historians tells us, it was this Queen that introduced the fashion of little seet among the women. Her own being very small, she bound them tight with filets, affecting to make that pass for a studied beauty, which was originally an accidental blemish. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 157. Mart. Hist. p. 95. Page 5. lin. 6. note [parents*.] The Translator's MS. adds, "which was next to that due to the Emperor." This connection of ideas is natural to the Chinese, whose government is purely partriarchal, and with whom it is a fundamental principle, "that the state is a large family: that kings ought to have in the empire all the tenderness of fathers, and fathers in their families all the tenderness of kings." P. Du Halde, v. 1. p. 303. .] Page 7. lin. 10. note [deserved* * The Chinese are the most ceremonious and complaisant people in the world: this affected civility extends to the very lowest ranks of their people, among whom it hath good effects. "I was one day," says P. Le Fontenay, "in a very narrow and deep road, where in a short time there happened a great stop of carts. I expected they would have fallen into a passion, have given one another abusive language, and perhaps have come to blows, as is common in Europe; but was much sur-prized to see them salute each other, speak mildly as if they had been old acquaintance, and lend their mutual assistance to make way."

Nor is it unusual for the bride to remain afterwards with her friends some years before the marriage is compleated. "The rites ordain," saith an ancient Chinese author, "that maidens should be early married. Fifteen years of age is the common time of betrothing, and twenty of consummating the marriage."—It may be observed however that the Chinese at present seldom defer the marriage of their children so long as this.

Nobility is not hereditary in China, the sons of the greatest Mandarines having generally their own fortunes to make: yet titles of honour are sometimes bestowed on persons of distinguished merit by the Emperor, who entails them for five or six, or eight or ten generations, in proportion to the service done to the public; and these titles they are careful to give themselves in their letters, and to inscribe on the fronts of their houses. There is indeed one family, which hath flourished for above 2000 years in an uninterupted succession, being the most ancient not only in China, but in the world, and that is the family of Confucius, the great Chinese philosopher; which is descended from a nephew of his (his own son dying childless) and is to this day distinguished by great honours and immunities. Besides these, there are some hereditary honours belonging to such as are of the blood royal, or allied to the present reigning family, which chiefly consist in wearing a yellow girdle, accompanied with some small titular distinction, and a trifling pension; these are extremely numerous, and many of them are so poor that they chuse to conceal their distinction, that they may not disgrace it.

Page 76. lin. 5. note [How can that be† † The women in China are so closely shut up from all commerce with the men, that their nearest relations have hardly access to them. To have admitted a stranger into the company of his niece, had been a piece of indecency worthy the cognizance of the magistrate. This being the case, all their matches are commonly brought about by the intervention of relations. Vid. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 304. ?] Page 91. lin. 10. note [money* * The absurd custom of giving money to the servants of others, prevails in China, as well as in England: but with this difference, that while the English do it with an aukward shame, which shews them conscious of doing wrong, the Chinese express no reserve about it. At their grand entertainments, between the first and second course, each of the guests causes one of his servants to bring him, on a kind of salver, several little bags of red paper, containing money for the cook, the stewards, for those, who served at table; and when there are plays acted (as is often the case) for the comedians. Every domestic carries his salver to the master of the house, who after some difficulty consents to accept of it, and gives it to be distributed among them. At other times, any message or present from a Mandarine must be attended with a present to the servants. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 302.

Any furniture made of this sells at a vast price. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. p. 10, 118, &amp;c. ] Page 113. lin 13. note [bed† † Though the Chinese never shew their bedchambers to strangers, their beds, especially those of the Mandarines, are curious and handsome: the wood-work of them is painted, gilt and carved; the curtains vary according to the season, in winter they are of double sattin, in summer, either of plain white taffatee, or very thin gause.—In the northern provinces, where they use stoves to convey the heat by funnels all over the house, it is usual to have their beds upon the warm stoves, and those who are afraid of lying on the hot bricks, hang a sort of hammock over them, made of cords or rattan. P. Du Halde, vol. 1. pag. 285. .] Page 119. lin. 18. note [family* * The governor of each city, or district, is obliged by his office to visit the corpse of every one that dies a violent death, whether by his own hands or that of others; and to make the strictest scrutiny into the cause and circumstances of it. According to some writers, he must transmit minutes of the examination to the Emperor, or at least to the superior tribunals. Let. edif. xj. 278.

Du Halde, a Mandarine says of his adversary, "though he were gold or precious stones, he should not escape the edge of my sword." Vid.
