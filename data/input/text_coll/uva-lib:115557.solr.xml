The Summer Quarter of the University is an integral part of the University Year, the Courses in the College of Arts and Sciences being the same in character method and in credit value as in the other quarters of the year. In the Department of Education many professional courses for Elementary and high school teachers are given to meet certificate requirements which are not offered in the regular session. The Summer Quarter is divided into two terms for the accommodation of those who can give only six weeks to the work but who desire University credit. The First Term will begin June 21st, and will close July 31st, with lectures five times a week. The Second Term will begin August 2nd, and will close September 3rd, with six lectures a week. Students may enter for either term or both. A separate registration card must be filled out for each Term. The normal amount of work for college credit which a student may take, is three courses; but in a few exceptional cases, by special permission of the Director and the approval of the instructors in all the courses taken, permission may be obtained to take more work. In all cases an additional fee of $5.00 will be charged for each extra advanced course, and $3.00 for each extra elementary course. The University of Virginia Summer Quarter is conducted for teachers and students in high schools, academies and colleges and for those who desire professional training for primary and grammar grade work. It also offers many courses for college credit, and others to meet the needs of students preparing for college entrance or who have conditions to absolve. It takes as its peculiar province, not the ordinary summer institute, but the solid and substantial training of high school teachers, college teachers, college students, and teachers of any grade who wish to procure professional work. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS.âThere are no formal examinations for admission to the Summer Quarter. Students, both men and women, will be admitted to such courses as the respective instructors find them qualified to pursue with advantage. If a student wishes regular admission with a view to taking a degree, and does not expect to register in the regular session of the University, he should present a full statement with, as far as possible, official credentials of all work which he has done in high school or college. These credentials should be sent in advance to the Director of the Summer Quarter. Suitable blank forms will be furnished upon request. LOCATION.âCharlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The sanitary arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about six hundred and fifty feet above sea level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete. The average monthly mean temperature from 1901 to 1911, taken from the records of the weather station at the University Observatory, was: June, 71.4; July, 76.8. There are three golf links, a well-conducted country club and many other attractions for summer visitors. EXCURSIONS.âUnder the directorship of a competent guide, there will be excursions to neighboring points of interest such as Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson; the Natural Bridge; Luray Caverns; the Grottoes of the Shenandoah; the battle fields in Virginia; and any other points to which a sufficiently large number may care to go. The proximity to Washington and Richmond and Old Point Comfort (three hours' ride to each) should make a visit exceptionally interesting. On designated clear nights parties will leave Cabell Hall at 8 o'clock to visit the McCormick Astronomical Observatory, where they will be shown the stars through the large telescope in the Observatory. ENTERTAINMENTS, AND LECTURES.âA Musical Festival and other entertainments will be announced during the session of the Summer School. The whole course includes about twenty numbers and the price of a season ticket is $4.00 making the cost about the same as moving pictures. Among the attractions already engaged are The Gamble Concert Party, Merle Alcock, Contralto of the Metropolitan Opera Company; Mme. Matzenauer, "The World's Greatest Contralto;" William Simmons, Baritone, Music League of America; The Dietrichs, in a program of Music and Magic; Irma Seydel, Violinist of Boston; two plays by the Player's Club of the University, Franceska Kaspar Lawson, Soprano, Washington, D. C.; and two Out-of-Door Performances by the Frank McIntee Company. BOARD AND ROOMS.âBoard and room may be had at prices ranging from $7.00 per week, where several stay in the same room, upward, according to accommodation and proximity to the University, the average being $7.00 to $9.00 per week. Most of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the University grounds. The University Commons furnishes board for $30.00 for the full term of 41 days. One hundred single furnished rooms and one hundred and twenty-five furnished double rooms in the University dormitories will be reserved in the order of application. The price for each term will be $7.00 for the full term of six weeks for a single room, and $10.00 for a double room. All checks for rooms should be made payable to E. I. Carruthers, Bursar. Every double room must be occupied by two persons. No reduction will be made for parts of a term. Applications for rooms must be accompanied with the full amount of the fee, which will be returned for good reason and room released if application is made before June 10th. No rooms will be rented to any person who does not register and pay the fee in the Summer School. Rooms that are reserved will not be held later than July 1st. No room will be open for occupancy before June 19th. Roomers must provide themselves with necessary bed clothes, towels, etc. Rooms will be in charge of Mrs. Josie Rodes, an experienced matron and chaperon. Some members of the faculty will be located in each set of dormitories. No cooking allowed in rooms. The rooms on Dawson's Row will be reserved for men. The location of these dormitories in the University grounds and the social advantages resulting from bringing so many teachers close together make this arrangement a very desirable one and the rooms are eagerly sought. The University Commons, conducted by Mrs. S. I. Carter, will be open for summer students and will provide table board for three hundred and fifty persons at the very low price of $5.50 for a single week. $20.00 a month, or $30.00 for the first term of forty-one days and $25.00 for the second term from July 31 to September 3rd. A lunch counter will be run in connection with the Commons, open from 9:30 a. m. to 11 p. m. Application for dormitory rooms should be sent promptly with retaining fee. For list of boarding houses, rates, etc., see page 44, or write to Secretary Summer School, Box 149, University, Virginia. FEES FOR VIRGINIA TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.âTuition will be entirely free to all Virginia teachers in all the regular courses, both elementary and advanced, leading to the professional certificates. No student, however, will be permitted to take more than three advanced courses or four elementary courses without the payment of $5.00 for each additional advanced course and $3.00 for each extra elementary course. To meet local expenses the State Board of Education has fixed a registration fee of $1.50 for a six weeks' term for all of the Summer Schools of the State, and this fee will be charged here. There are a few special courses offered to meet certain demands but not necessary for certificate credit, for which fees will be charged to all who take them. The fee for each is designated in the catalogue. Small fees in laboratory courses will also be charged all students who register in them. Students from Virginia who are not teachers or definitely preparing to teach next session will be charged the same tuition as nonVirginia students. Teachers whose residence is in Virginia but who are teaching outside of Virginia will be charged the same fee as non-Virginians. FEES FOR NON-VIRGINIA STUDENTS.âA single registration fee of fifteen dollars for each term will be charged each student who registers from outside of Virginia. This fee will entitle the student to enter any of the courses outlined in the catalogue (except a few special courses which are so designated). No student, however, will be permitted to take more than three advanced courses or four elementary courses without special permission in writing from the Director and without paying an extra fee of $5.00 for each extra advanced course, or $3.00 for each elementary course. Note.âTeachers outside of Virginia are not limited in the choice of their courses to the regulations under which Virginia certificates are issued, unless they desire to teach in Virginia and apply for a license issued in this State. In this case only State certificates from other states issued by a State Superintendent or a State Board of Examiners, and approved in advance by the Department of Public Instruction of Virginia, will be recognized as a proper basis for professional credit. Teachers from other states will receive credit for all work done in accordance with the certificate regulations of those States from which they come. Most Southern States accept the work of the University Summer School for certificate credit or renewal. Medical Fee.âA small medical fee of 50 cents will be charged each person who registers the first term, which will entitle him or her to free medical attendance by Dr. W. E. Bray, the Summer School Physician, hospital phone, 548; residence phone, 565; office hours at the hospital 11:30 to 12:30 and 4:30 to 5:00. Greatly reduced charges, if it should be necessary, will be given at the University Hospital, under the following regulations: The same arrangement may be made for the second term. Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the Summer School Physician; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, and for special treatment of the eye, ear, nose, and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of students, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the Summer School Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. TIME AND PLACE OF RECITATIONS AND LECTURES.â Recitations will begin in all courses Tuesday, June 22nd, at 8:30 a. m. There will be no classes on Saturdays in the first term except on June 26th, and July 10th, when classes will meet at the usual hours to make up for registration and examination days. The length of recitation periods will be one hour, ten minutes of which will be allowed for transfer from one room to another. DAILY GENERAL ASSEMBLY.âDaily from 11:30 to 12:25 there will be a period in which the students may have the privilege of attending a gathering of the entire body. At this time there will be devotional exercises, music, short addresses on timely topics by prominent speakers invited for this purpose, or some other interesting exercise. SUNDAY VESPER SERVICES.âExperience has shown that no Sunday service held here during the summer has been more attractive or more appreciated than what has sometimes been called the Sunset Service. Holding this service at this hour enables all the faculty and the students of the summer school to unite in one common service without at all interfering with their attending the churches of their choice in the city. The service, which is always kept within one hour, begins at seven o'clock. When weather permits, the service is held out of doors on the North Rotunda steps. Otherwise in Cabell Hall. REGISTRATION.âMonday, June 21st, will be devoted to the registration of students. All students who can possibly do so should register on this day. Those who fail to register before June 22nd, will be permitted to attend classes and register as promptly as possible at other hours. The Registrar's office, located in Peabody Hall, will be open continuously from 8:30 a. m. to 5:00 p. m. Students should consult freely with members of the Faculty in case of difficulty in choosing courses. No certificate will be granted to students who fail to register before Tuesday, June 29th, except a certificate of attendance. No student will be enrolled in any course without a registration card naming the course in question and properly signed by the Registrar and the Bursar. THE GENERAL LIBRARY.âThe General Library is open to the corps of instructors and the students of the Summer School, from 9 a. m. to 1:30 p. m.; 3 to 5, and from 7:30 to 10 p. m. The collection contains about seventy thousand volumes. All books withdrawn from the library must be charged at the desk. Usually books are lent for one week but there are exceptions, and the loan expires on the date stamped in the book. Prompt return not later than the date on which the loan expires is expected and borrowers will be fined ten cents for each day delinquent. Students are expected to give prompt attention to all communications from the librarian. REST AND STUDY ROOMS.âMadison Hall, the beautiful building of the Young Men's Christian Association, and during the summer session headquarters for the Y. W. C. A., will be open to students and Faculty of the Summer School, from nine o'clock in the morning until ten at night. Students will have access to the current periodicals in the reading room. The other rooms will be used for rest, for study, for recreation, and for social gatherings. North of the building there are nineteen tennis courts which will be equipped for the use of the students. THE YOUNG WOMEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. Crowded schedules and a sense of a packed six weeks of work make the program of the Y. W. C. A. take whatever form of service is most notably needed. Sometimes it is recreation, and hikes, breakfasts, bacon bats, and games spring into life! Sometimes the desire of the student for spiritual growth calls into existence Bible classes, where, under strong leadership, the principles of religion and life are discussed. Sometimes, the desire for coÃ¶perative worship is expressed, and the simple vesper service meets the needs of many. Special lecturers on Social Morality, Recreation, and Club Leadership are available when needed. The Y. W. C. A. Secretary not only looks after all the "activities" of the Association, but acts as a friend to every student. Madison Hall is of value only as it is of serviceâwhether through its reading room, social center, or information bureau; so it is hoped that every woman in attendance during the summer school may find something she needs or wants from the Y. W. C. A. The Secretary in charge will be Miss Louise Maddrey. All those interested please see Miss Maddrey at Madison Hall on arrival. She will need every interested available student. STUDENTS' MAIL.âIn order to insure safe and prompt delivery of mail, every student should have all mail directed to, University, Virginia, giving always the street and number of his or her boarding place or the number and location of his or her room in the University. The local address should be filed at the post office promptly upon arrival. TEACHERS' POSITIONS.âThe University Appointment Committee receives demands for teachers each year. This committee is glad to have well qualified teachers who are in attendance upon the Summer School file their applications. There is no charge for this service. THE SUMMER SCHOOL NEWS.âThe News is a college newspaper, edited and managed by students of the Summer School. It contains all official and student organization announcements, campus news and notes, editorial comment, etc. Its object is to acquaint individuals with the life of the whole student body, and to unify the interests of all. RURAL LIFE WEEK.âThe time between July 12th and 17th will be devoted to the study of rural life problems in general, and to the Community Centre in particular. A special effort will be made to secure a large attendance of farmers, farmers' wives, and community leaders, and distinguished speakers from all sections of the United States will participate in the Conferences. The Conference this year will be in charge of Mr. Henry E. Jackson, Special Agent in Community Organization, U. S. Bureau of Education who will have the active coÃ¶peration of Mr. Geo. W. Guy, Executive Secretary of the CoÃ¶perative Education Association of Virginia. FOURTH OF JULY PAGEANT.âEach year an elaborate pageant is given in connection with the Fourth of July Celebration. An extensive celebration will be a feature this year. REGULATIONS CONCERNING CREDIT.âThe instructor giving each course will keep the class grades and attendance, hold the examination, and average the class grade with the examination grade, returning to the Director the general average grade of each student in each course. Absences or delayed entrance will be counted against the student. All examinations must be held under the Honor System. A certificate for each course completed with an average grade of 75 per cent will be signed by the instructor and the Director of the Summer School, and mailed to the student. Each student who wishes certificates sent, should file with the registrar not later than July 20th, a large self-addressed stamped envelope for mailing them. Credit Allowed by Other States than Virginia.âApplication has been made to other Southern States for credit equal to that accorded by the Virginia State Board of Education. Credit is now allowed toward the extension of certificates by many Southern States. All persons wishing to arrange for credits with their respective school authorities should correspond with the Director of the Summer School. University of Virginia College Credit.âBelow are stated the conditions upon which credit in the University of Virginia may be granted for work done in the Summer School. (a) The student must satisfy the entrance requirements of the University of Virginia and matriculate before he can receive credit in the College for any work done in the University of Virginia Summer School. (b) The Dean of the College will accept the completion of the courses in the Summer School in lieu of the entrance examinations in the same subject, provided that in his judgment the courses are equivalent to those required for entrance to the University of Virginia, and provided, that the certificates of courses completed be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned. (c) The Dean of the College will accept certificates of completion of summer courses in the University of Virginia, provided that such summer courses be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned as the full equivalent in character and scope of the corresponding courses in the University. All courses numbered from 1 to 100 in this catalogue have been approved by the professors concerned and will be accepted by the Dean for such credit as is indicated in the description of each course. (d) Students who satisfy entrance requirements will not only receive credit at the University of Virginia for college courses taken in the Summer School, but the summer school work is recognized by standard colleges everywhere, so that students have no difficulty in securing transfer of credits. (e) That graduate courses completed in the Summer Quarter, if approved by the Committee on Graduate Studies, shall be credited just as if they were taken in the regular session; that residence work aggregating three summer quarters of twelve weeks each shall be considered as fulfilling the residence requirements for the master's degree. The following courses offered this Quarter will be given M. A. credit: Biology 7 and 8; Education 13, 14, 18, 20 and 23; English 29, 30, 31, 33, 34 and 35; Government 84; Latin 48. The Courses of Instruction are designated as follows: Courses numbered less than 100 may be credited toward the bachelor's degree in the University of Virginia. Courses numbered from 100 to 299 are courses for which college credit is recommended, though not given in the University of Virginia because corresponding work is not offered in this University during the regular session. These courses are, however, accepted by other standard colleges which offer similar work, and in which transfer of credit may be obtained. Their credit value is expressed in semester hours. Each course of one hour for thirty lectures has a credit value of two semester hours. One hundred and twenty semester hours are usually required for the baccalaureate degree. The amount of College Credit in this University for each course is indicated in connection with that course and is expressed in session-hours. One course of thirty recitations of one hour each has a credit value of one session-hour. Sixty-three session-hours, three of which may be in physical education, distributed according to the group requirements printed in the general catalogue of the University are required for the baccalaureate degree. The normal amount of credit which may be obtained in a summer session is three session-hours for each term or a total of 6 session-hours for the quarter. In exceptional cases students may be permitted to take more work. Appropriate credit will be allowed for work completed in recognized standard colleges. Students who desire credit towards a degree must meet the entrance requirements of this University before receiving such credit. Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the honor system and the honor pledge is required. VIRGINIA STATE CERTIFICATES.
