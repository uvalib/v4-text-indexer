      <field name="fulltext">THE FEATHER MANTLE (Hagoromo: a woman play) This play begins on a perfect spring day: sweeping blue sky, mild air, pines along the beach, and sunlit sea. The world we know appeared, they say, when sky and earth split apart; now, though, heaven and earth seem still conjoined at ease, one lightly-breathing vastness. As on such a day the earthbound heart rises of itself into free space, so an angel, too, may, as in The Feather Mantle, descend. No one knows for certain who wrote The Feather Mantle, or when, but it makes a fine introduction to the whole n? repertoire. Many of the marks of a god play can be found in it, and one of these is thanks given for our Sovereign's reign. This thanks is rendered for all harmony and delight, to the Lord who shall reign for ever and ever; whose reign endures, indeed, even through the trials enacted in the plays that follow. (If his reign did not so endure, then return to communion and illumination would hardly be possible.) This Sovereign is not only secular and historical; he is also the focal point and power center of the world. It is the angel's warm, feminine charm that puts The Feather Mantle in the class of woman plays, for true god plays avoid such coloring. This very charm, though, makes The Feather Mantle more perfectly representative, for love is the heart of Japanese poetry—especially if to love between man and woman, one joins love for the fleeting graces of nature herself. And who indeed is this charming celestial maiden? She proves to be the laurel tree that grows in the moon, and the very moon itself, giver of every gift. Her garment is less a human mantle than sky, mist, and cloud. The flowers in her hair are doubtless actually growing in the green spring hills. She really does have all of nature's fleeting graces, of which the moon is the sign, and might well move one to love. In n?, mention of the full moon is likely to be coupled, as here, with the Buddhist term True Semblance (shinnyo). True Semblance can loosely be said to mean Reality, but this reality is no absolute to be grasped at and held. True Semblance can be owned or defined no more than the angel's loveliness. As the moon, the angel invokes her own 'true ground,' the Bodhisattva Seishi. This is because Shinto deities, the natural powers of the world, were widely held to be local manifestations of the universal Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Such a local manifestation is the projected image, and the name of this mode of understanding is honji suijaku, true ground and projected image. Seishi stands to the right of the Buddha Amida, Lord of Infinite Light, and is Amida's all-illuminating wisdom. Thus the angel, with all her graces, is actually wisdom manifest. Versions of the story of The Feather Mantle are to be found all over the world. The pattern is that a band of celestial maidens (in ancient Japanese accounts the number is eight) come down to earth to enjoy some particularly wholesome pleasure, such as bathing in a spring or drinking fresh milk. There, a man surprises them. All escape back to heaven but the last one, who is detained by the man and often has to marry him. Much later, though, she does fly home again, and the man, who by some failing has let her escape, can never follow. What the angel does during her visit to earth is to transmit certain music called the Suruga Dance from East Country Pleasures. East Country Pleasures is Azuma-asobi, a body of songs and dances from the region far to the east of Miyako, the capital. There is a tradition that an angel did indeed give the Suruga Dance to mankind on a beach in the province of Suruga. From the standpoint of n?, however, one might imagine that it is music itself that she teaches, and that the whole repertoire is an unfolding of this music.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ISSEI A small pine stands down front. Caught in its branches is a length of cloth that represents the mantle. Sideman and two Sideman's Seconds enter, carrying fishing poles; they stand down front, to one side of the pine. When all three sing together, they are face to face; when Sideman speaks alone, he faces front. ISSEI Sideman and Side Second Swift winds blow by Mio down the curving shore small craft row and fishermen call o'er the sea lanes! NANORI Sideman I'm a fisherman known on the pine barrens of Mio as Hakury?. SASHI Sideman and Side Second Boundless leagues of lovely hills, and clouds suddenly rise; one lone tower's bright moon marks first the rain's clearing.' Yes, a time it is of mild calm! Spring again has touched pine barrens wave on lingering wave the morning mists, moon loitering in sky meadows endless the gaze roves on: a scene to quiet, to absorb the heart! SAGEUTA I'll not forget how mountain trails we took to Clearview Cove, and spied afar Mio's pine barrens: come now, friends, there's where we'll go come now, friends, there's where we'll go! AGEUTA Wind-billowed, the clouds float high waves then to you the clouds float high waves then to you are they, men, no fishing done, will you hurry home? Wait! It's spring a while, and mild blows the morning breeze, yes, the pines' song everlasting, waves are silent in the morning calm and fishermen crowd forth in teeming craft fishermen crowd forth in teeming craft! Sideman's Seconds sit slightly upstage of Sideman's spot. Sideman lays down his pole at stagehand stop, takes fan in hand, and comes out to main spot. * Sideman I've just come up to the pine barrens of Mio, and I'm gazing at the view of the shore, when from the void blossoms fall, music resounds, and wondrous fragrances pervade all space. This can hardly be common. And in fact I see here, hung on this pine tree, a beautiful mantle. A closer look now: color and scent are marvelous indeed. This is no ordinary mantle. I'll take it home with me to show my friends, and to keep as an heirloom in my house. Carrying the mantle in both hands, he starts toward Sideman's spot. But Doer calls to him as she comes through curtain, and starts down bridgeway. She wears the z?-onna mask and an angel's glittering crown. MONDO Doer I'm sorry, but that mantle's mine! Why have you taken it? Sideman is now at Sideman's spot.) Sideman I just happen to have run across it, so I'm taking it home with me. Doer But it's an angel's feather mantle! It isn't supposed to be given to a human being! Do please leave it where it was! Sideman As I understand it, then, this is an angel's mantle. Why, in that case, it's obviously a wonder in these latter days, and I ought to have it as a treasure for the whole land! I'm not going to give it back. Doer Oh no! Without the feather mantle, flying is over for me; I'll never be able to return to Heaven! Please, please give it back! Sideman Hakury? will not heed this gracious plea, but grows stubborn: heartless I've always been, I, a fisherman. The celestial feather mantle he hides from her. He turns front, away from Doer, who is by now at main spot. No indeed, says he, and turns to go. Doer In her plight now the angel, like a wingless bird, Sideman moving to rise, has no mantle; Doer on earth, is caught in the nether world. Sideman Either way, alas! . . . she laments, Doer but as Hakury? will keep the mantle, Sideman helpless, Doer hopeless AGEUTA Chorus tears run, shining jewel headdress, flowers in her hair droop and wilt: the five signs of an angel's fall are here before my very eyes— oh pitiful! She gazes up to her right into the sky. SHIMO-NO-EI Doer To the fields of Heaven backward I gaze, but mists rise, cloudways blur, the path is lost!' SAGEUTA Chorus My home so dear, the sky, oh when shall I pass yonder move the clouds and enviously I look on! AGEUTA The kalavinka's voice I loved the kalavinka's voice I loved to hear, now fades and wild geese cry down the skyways, going home— and oh, this longing! Plovers, gulls, with waves offshore come and go breezes of spring blowing through the sky, they too quicken yearning blowing through the sky, they too quicken yearning! She gazes up at sky, and weeps. MONDO Sideman I can see now you're suffering terribly. I'll give you back your mantle. Doer Oh, I'm so happy! Then do bring it to me! She presses toward Sideman. Sideman A moment, though. He retreats an equal distance. I'll return your mantle if you'll be kind enough to do right here and now the angel dance I've heard tell of. Doer I'm so happy! Yes, I will get home to Heaven! And for joy I'll indeed dance, right here and now. You shall pass my dance on to the downcast folk of your world. But I can't do anything without my mantle. Please give it back to me first. Sideman Oh no, if I return your mantle you won't dance, you'll head straight up to Heaven. Doer No, suspicion's for the human realm; in Heaven there's no falsehood. Sideman I'm so ashamed! Why then, says he, by all means; and gives her back the mantle. Side gives mantle to Doer, then goes to sit at Sideman's spot. MONO-GI-ASHIRAI Doer withdraws to stagehand spot, where she puts on the mantle. She then comes out to main spot. KAKEAI Doer The maiden, in mantle clothed, does Rainbow Skirts and Cloak of Wings; Sideman the celestial feather mantle moves to the winds, Doer moist with rain the blossom sleeves, Sideman as music plays Doer and she dances on! SHIDAI Chorus The Suruga Dance from East Country Pleasures the Suruga Dance from East Country Pleasures: Sparely, this is how it began! KURI Now, to speak of the long-faring sky: ages past, in the Twin Gods' time, when they laid out the world in each one of its ten directions, the sky had no end, and that it why they dubbed it long-faring. SASHI Doer As for the Palace of the Moon, with glittering ax hewn for all eternity: Chorus robed in white or black the angel throng made two bands, each of thrice five, and all moon long, night by night, a celestial maid with task assigned carries out her role. Doer Of these I am one: celestial maiden Chorus of the moon laurel tree, I've split in two, to visit and myself pass on to your world here the Suruga Dance of the East Country! KUSE Mists of spring trail on long-faring moon laurel flowers bloom! Yes, crown of blossoms in full hue surely means spring! Oh lovely! Though no Heaven, here too we've sweet grace. Winds of the skies, blow shut the clouds' passageways! The maiden lingers, pine barrens' spring hues to see on Mio Cape, and the moon so Clearview Cove, snows of Fuji— which excels? Peerless this spring dawn, the waves, the pining wind so mild, the tranquil shore! Sky and earth, why, what parts them? Zoned with light are Inner Shrine and Outer, whose gods' offspring rule here still; the very moon's spotlessly clear our sunrise land, Japan! Doer In this our Sovereign's reign celestial feather mantles seldom descend: Chorus caressed, the rock yet wears not away, oh happy news! Songs of the East: with voices join in sweet concert drone-pipes, flutes, harps and zitherns swelling out past the Lone Cloud; red sinks the sun, so mirroring Mount Sumeru; green in the waves Float Isle Moor gale-swept, where blossoms fall, yes, whirling snow the white cloud sleeves are lovely indeed! Pausing in her dance movements, Doer sits at main spot and joins palms in reverence. EI Doer Hail to thee, Seishi, oh thou True Ground of the Moon, daughter of Heaven! Chorus A dance, then, from the East Country Pleasures. JO-NO-MAI Doer rises and, between these two passages of text, dances a jo-no-mai dance. She goes on dancing, however, as text resumes. NORIJI Doer Now, the mantle blue that's Heaven's lofty sky, Chorus now, the mantling mist that rises in spring, Doer hue and fragrance both delight! The maiden's train Chorus sweeps and sways, all rustling, flowers nod in her hair; celestial feather sleeves billow, coil and turn, the dancing sleeves! HA-NO-MAI Between these two passages, she dances a ha-no-mai dance. Again, she continues dancing as text resumes. NORIJI As on and on the dances go as on and on the dances go, she who's named moon palace lady high in the dark sky this thrice fifth night becomes again face of True Semblance, the full moon, and rains riches: prayers fulfilled, the realm replete, the seven treasures overflowing, these on our land bestows; and so time runs, the celestial feather mantle wind-borne billows down the shore; pine barrens of Mio, Float Isle's clouds, Mount Ashitaka, yes, and Fuji's towering peak fade out, mist-veiled into high Heaven she is lost from view.</field>
