      <field name="fulltext">Twelfth Annual Report on Historical Collections, University of Virginia Library, For the Year 1941-42 SINCE the preceding report in this series was published, the United States has become a belligerent in the Second World War. The general recognition of Sunday, December 7, 1941, as a memorable date in American history was confirmed by the President of the United States the following day in his message to Congress. The formal declaration of war by Congress followed promptly in half an hour. Living, like many earlier neutrals, in a fool's paradise, the American people were rudely awakened from their delusion of peaceful escape from a world at war. The true significance of the much used term "total war," however, was not readily understood. That lesson was to be learned partially during the series of defeats in the first six months of belligerency, until the marshalling of our resources and power could begin to bear weight against the enemy. The Japanese attack ended abruptly the period of disunity and false security. Whatever followed was "after Pearl Harbor." In organizing and administering American intellectual resources for total war it was evident at once that archivists and directors of manuscript and other research collections would play an essential part. In national and state archives and in some historical societies were official records of World War I which might profitably be consulted on problems common to both wars. The creation of new bodies of war records would present problems of preservation and accessibility which the archivist should endeavor to anticipate. In the field of historical manuscripts and imprints the past twenty years had witnessed a growing appreciation of recent and contemporary materials, many of which acquired new interest as part of the background of America's involvement in the world conflict. The Survey of Federal Archives and the Historical Records Survey had provided a wealth of information on the location and content of archival and other source materials throughout the country. On the basis of British experience under conditions of aerial warfare, Americans took thought of their own cultural resources, both for their protection and for their utilization to sustain public morale. What, then, did custodians of these resources have to offer by way of plans and procedure for the war effort on Monday, December 8, 1941? In some respects archivists could give a good account of their efforts at preparedness before Pearl Harbor. The challenge presented to them by Dr. Waldo G. Leland in his presidential address to the Society of American Archivists fourteen months earlier on "The Archivist in Times of Emergency" had been met by the Society and action taken through several committees charged with problems of protection, administration, and collection of records in times of stress. In October, 1941, at Hartford, Connecticut, Dr. Leland again addressed the Society then "actively engaged in preparations to cope with a situation that from day to day becomes more ominous." He called attention to the undertakings of historians and archivists in the first World War through the unofficial National Board for Historical Service, whose activities ranged from research, publications, and lectures on the background and issues of the war (in co-operation with the Creel Committee on Public Information) to the collection and preservation of war records.1 1. Waldo G. Leland, "Historians and Archivists in the First World War," The American Archivist, V, no. 1 (Jan., 1942), 1-17. Shortly after the war Dr. Leland had written a detailed report on "The National Board for Historical Service," American Historical Association, Annual Report for 1919 (2 vols., Washington, 1923-24), I, 161-89. The far reaching effects which these activities had had upon the outcome of the war and the peace settlement (despite the failure of the United States to join the League of Nations) were suggestive of opportunities for similar programs that might be expanded if another war came. Encouraging factors were the advancement and broadening of American scholarship since the first World War, the establishment of the National Archives, and the development of new techniques for the use of research materials. The forethought which the president of the Society of American Archivists had urged upon its members and the work of the committees mentioned above during the year before Pearl Harbor brought timely results in the early months of the war. In December "The Care of Records in a National Emergency"2 2. In Bulletins of the National Archives, no. 3 [Washington,] Dec., 1941, a joint report to the Society of American Archivists by its Committee on the Protection of Archives against Hazards of War and its Committee on the Emergency Transfer and Storage of Archives. was published, which discussed hazards likely to affect archives, selection of archives for protection, buildings and storage facilities, and problems of evacuation. The Committee on the History and Organization of Government Emergency Agencies functioned through certain members of the National Archives staff. Their task was to gather valuable information on these agencies of the first World War so that the government might have the benefit of their experience in the present crisis. The first product of this undertaking was a "List of Federal World War Agencies, 1914-20," issued in February, 1942,3 3. Processed by the National Archives, dated December, 1941. preliminary to a detailed handbook on the same subject. Dr. Leland's address of the preceding October aroused further interest in what had been done to record the contemporary history of governmental departments and special bureaus most directly concerned with the conflict. In April, 1942, a study was published on "Historical Units of Agencies of the First World War," by Elizabeth B. Drewry.4 4. Processed by the National Archives; revised and printed in Bulletins of the National Archives, no. 4, July, 1942. It was based upon records in the National Archives, many of which had been salvaged from poor storage places or at least had not been accessible previous to their transfer to this institution. The significance of these and other war records is well expressed by the author's observation that "there seems reason to believe that as the historians of the future regard the two world wars they may look upon the first as a prelude to the second and may be able to trace a continuous flow of ideas and policies from one to the other. The conclusions reached, regardless of their nature, will be based on the information furnished by the records of the two wars."5 5. Bulletins, no. 4, op. cit., 4. See also Edward G. Campbell, Old Records in a New War (processed by the National Archives, April, 1942). A few other examples of preparedness in the fields of archives and library collections during the ominous months of 1941 may be cited as exceptional during this period of stalemate in public opinion. The classification and earmarking of manuscript and printed materials for evacuation from the Library of Congress were completed before Pearl Harbor, thanks to the vision of Archibald MacLeish, and in less than a month afterward the exodus of the most valuable collections had begun.6 6. Archibald MacLeish, "The Library of Congress Protects Its Collection," American Library Association, Bulletin, XXXVI, no. 2 (Feb., 1942), 74-75. Likewise the treasures of the Folger Library were removed from Washington. The National Archives staff made preparations to move certain selected bodies of records into the central and safest part of their building which is rated as the most bomb-proof structure in the capital. During the early months of 1941 the Archives Department of the Illinois State Library issued memoranda to state and local custodians of official records to aid them in determining which series should be given first consideration for protection against destruction in time of war. Before Pearl Harbor the Illinois Archives had likewise established priorities for possible evacuation of records in its custody and the publication of its plan provided helpful suggestions for other states.7 7. Margaret C. Norton, "Establishing Priorities for State Records: Illinois Experience," The American Archivist, V, no. 1 (Jan., 1942), 18-27. The efforts of the Historical Records Survey, which since 1936 had been providing numerous series of guides and inventories to archival and manuscript resources throughout the country, were directed increasingly in 1941 to vital statistical and other records needed directly in the defense program. The reduction in relief labor, however, caused by defense and later by war activities depleted the personnel of the Historical Records Survey. In the spring of 1942 the project was liquidated, thus ending one of the most interesting and productive undertakings in the realm of scholarship, both for its long-time results and for its immediate relation to the problem of nation-wide unemployment. The attempts at economic and social planning during the 1930's, in spite of all criticism, just and unjust, had provided some valuable experience which carried over from the domestic depression to the international crisis. But whether Americans by taking thought could add one cubit to their stature was still subject to a variety of interpretations as late as December 6, 1941. In the federal government the National Resources Planning Board embraced the field of cultural activities through its Committee on Conservation of Cultural Resources, beginning in April 1941. In the early autumn of that year a detailed survey was made of all materials, cultural, scientific, and historical, in the custody of federal agencies in the District of Columbia. This survey provided the basis for a code drafted later in co-operation with the Federal Public Buildings Administration for protection of buildings and their contents against air attack.8 8. Report of the Committee on Conservation of Cultural Resources for the Fiscal Year 1942 (processed, [Washington,] Sept. 8, 1942), 2-5. A fortnight after war was declared a letter was sent to a selected person in each state asking him to call a meeting as soon as possible and to serve as chairman of a suggested State Committee on Conservation of Cultural Resources composed of archivists, librarians, museum directors, architects, structural engineers, and others to make plans and execute them with reference to the protection of all such resources. The national office of the CCCR provided instructions for the guidance of the state committees and in February published a preliminary handbook on The Protection of Cultural Resources against the Hazards of War. It advised a compromise between maximum use and maximum protection of these materials in the light of European experience in strengthening morale through the services of libraries, archival institutions, and museums. It pointed out that "the imposition of a complete blackout on such institutions in many cases not only deprives a nation of sources of information vital to its military program but dries up the wells from which the national spirit is strengthened and replenished."9 9. The Protection of Cultural Resources against the Hazards of War . . . Prepared by the Committee on Conservation of Cultural Resources. National Resources Planning Board . . . (Washington, 1942), 1. In most states this appeal met with prompt response. State committees were organized, ways and means discussed, and preliminary plans put into execution. Emphasis varied considerably from tentative plans to detailed programs of surveys of buildings, evaluation of materials, and transfer of certain treasures elsewhere for safety. The Florida Committee secured the cooperation of the state university's Extension Division in giving short training courses on air raid protection problems to custodians of cultural materials. In Minnesota affiliation with the Office of Civilian Defense facilitated publicity and gave additional weight to the Committee's protective program. The Virginia CCCR was especially perturbed about exposure to air attack of certain tidewater county records in the area between Norfolk and Richmond. A microfilm project of the Virginia State Library somewhat reduced this hazard by borrowing many of the older records for copying. A similar undertaking was outlined in the State of Washington for microfilming vital public records in target areas along the coast, beginning in Tacoma and Everett, where necessary equipment was obtained. The Defense Council of New York issued a Handbook of Civilian Protection (1942) with a section on protection of records, rare books, and art treasures, by Richard B. Morris. In Massachusetts a Committee on Protection of Valuable Objects pioneered in this field in 1941 in advance of the CCCR. These examples indicate widespread and rapid development, during the early months of America at war, of a movement which had little chance of support before Pearl Harbor. In mid-December 1941 the writer gave some attention to the question of what might be done in Virginia for the preservation of materials pertaining to the present war. During 1917-18 many states had engaged in collecting source materials and in compiling military service records for war histories, under the auspices of permanent historical agencies or of commissions specially created for this purpose. Virginia, however, like a number of other states, did not launch such a project until after the war—in this instance not until 1920, when the Virginia War History Commission was established. By that time many of the contemporary records had been lost or were difficult to find, and only a small fraction of public interest in activities relating to the war had survived. What could be done to meet this situation more promptly and more effectively in World War II? The writer drafted a proposal for a war records commission composed of certain historians, archivists, and librarians, to be set up as an agency of the Virginia Defense Council, to collect Virginia materials on the war and to promote the work of city and county committees with respect to local records. The chairman of the Defense Council approved of the idea but the term of the Council expired with the beginning of the new gubernatorial administration in January, 1942, and the next defense organization was decentralized, with a new personnel. Meanwhile informal discussion during the meeting of the American Historical Association in Chicago between the writer and several persons from other states revealed that they too had the idea of a war records project in mind or were receptive to the suggestion. In view of what the National Board for Historical Service, an unofficial agency with private funds, had done along this line during and immediately after World War I, it seemed desirable that a nation-wide effort to promote the collection and preservation of war materials should be made again. The matter was presented to the Council of the American Association for State and Local History at its meeting in Chicago and at a luncheon session of the Society of American Archivists. Both of these organizations later approved the idea and expressed their willingness to co-operate in its promotion. The first step to put the proposal into action was made possible by the Social Science Research Council. In February, 1942, at the request of its Committee on the Control of Social Data (Dr. Roy F. Nichols, chairman), the writer began a study of the problems relating to war records in the several states—to determine what might be done advantageously during the war period as well as afterward, what types of materials should be saved, and what kind of organization, state and local, might function best in relation to existing institutions. A broader question given consideration was how both public and professional interest in war records could be utilized to foster and augment longtime programs for the discriminating collection of research materials in times of peace as well as of war. A survey was made of state and local war records activities of a generation ago from which certain conclusions were drawn and applied to the present situation. Advice and suggestions were sought from a large number of librarians, archivists, and social scientists on the scope, emphasis, and best procedure in implementing current projects. The report submitted by the writer to the SSRC included a specific "Plan for the Collection and Preservation of World War II Records," which was approved in June and later was authorized to be printed. During the course of this study the question of whether an agency could be found or created to promote this proposed war records work throughout the nation was answered and the answer incorporated into the "Plan." The Committee on Conservation of Cultural Resources enlarged its program to assume this responsibility as the result of a special conference held in Washington in April. At another meeting early in September broad objectives looking to the post-war period were discussed, along with detailed ways and means of encouraging the inception and growth of specific projects. By the end of the summer a few states had already completed plans and launched projects on their own initiative—Pennsylvania under the auspices of the State Historical Commission, Ohio by means of a War History Commission appointed by the governor, and Minnesota through a State War History Committee of the Defense Council.10 10. Ohio War History Commission, Communikay, I, no. 1, July 15, 1942-(Columbus, Ohio), in progress; Minnesota Defense Council Bulletin, II, no. 1, July 31, 1942-(St. Paul, Minn.), in progress, succeeding War History Letter, no. 1-6, July, 1942. In the realm of federal governmental records pertaining to the war a project was launched in the spring of 1942 to provide a type of data greatly desired by scholars and officials but seldom put in writing. The daily routine of operations of any agency is recorded in considerable detail, but why decisions are made and how they are carried out are seldom recorded. Such information on matters of policy during times of emergency is especially essential to administrators in appraising and controlling new situations as they suddenly arise and to research students later in getting behind the more prosaic day by day routine. An examination of federal records of World War I, to ascertain how certain problems common to both wars had been met in the first instance, showed a lack of data on the reasons for actions taken and on steps leading to final decisions. Accordingly, at the request of the President of the United States and with the advice of scholars and officials concerned with these questions, the Director of the Bureau of the Budget appointed a Committee on Records of War Administration and set up a research staff headed by Dr. Pendleton Herring of Harvard University. This committee proceeded to enlist the co-operation of the various war agencies in designating in each case a responsible official with the necessary assistants to assemble the important documents and write up those aspects of its work not ordinarily put in writing but essential to an understanding of the course of events. The research staff of the committee is concerned mainly with the interrelation of these agencies in the leading economic and social manifestations of the war effort. This unique undertaking also includes the all important war activities of the White House. Here Director Fred W. Shipman of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library has begun to spend a considerable portion of his time on the presidential records, supplemented by data direct from the President himself. Some of the permanent agencies of the federal government likewise took action in the historical field during the first nine months of the war. Of special interest are the projects of the War and the Navy Departments. In July the Historical Section of the Army War College was designated as the advisory and co-ordinating office for all historical activities within the department. The commanding generals of the Army Ground Forces, the Army Air Forces, and the Services of Supply were directed by the Secretary of War to "appoint an historical officer [and the necessary assistants]. . . to record the administrative activities of their respective headquarters during the current war, and [through their subordinate organizations] . . . to insure complete coverage of administrative events of historical significance." The Office of the Quartermaster General had already begun such a project at the end of May in its Historical Branch with a staff of professional historians. They proceeded to examine the files of every subdivision of the Quartermaster General's Office for pertinent material and to obtain supplementary data by personal interviews with officers and others directly involved in important events. The staff also made plans to cover the records of the principal field installations at home and abroad.11 11. Vernon G. Setser, "The Historical Project of the Quartermaster Corps," The Quartermaster Review, XXII, no. 2 (Sept.-Oct. 1942) 52, 103-04. The Navy Department approved a history of naval operations during the war, to be written by Professor Samuel E. Morison, and a survey of documentary sources concerning fleet operations, preliminary to their systematic collection, classification, and preservation. In the Treasury Department a project for a history of the War Savings Staff's activities was initiated by George Fort Milton. The National Research Council's Division of Medical Sciences formulated plans for a medical history of the war, with Dr. John F. Fulton in charge. It will include, among others, volumes on pathology, medicine, surgery, hospital organization, individual operations and engagements, industrial medicine, civilian defense, and public health, with supplementary volumes from the War and Navy departments.12 12. Army Medical Bulletin, no. 60 (January, 1942), 29-32; John F. Fulton, "Prospectus of a Medical History of the War ...," War Medicine, II (Sept., 1942), 847-59. From the preceding discussion of current war records of the federal government it is clear that the field of administrative history will be greatly advanced by these investigations. Likewise desirable correlation of this field with that of archives with respect to record-keeping, which has been explored recently,13 13. Cf. Eleventh Annual Report on Historical Collections, University of Virginia Library, for the Year 1940-41 (University, Va., 1941), 5-6. is more evident than ever before. Urgent war problems demand prompt and well advised answers which depend no less upon efficient record administration than upon intelligent officials. Moreover it will hardly be denied that this assertion, though more pointed during times of emergency, is equally sound under normal conditions. The overwhelming flood of non-current records released to the National Archives by governmental agencies in Washington, to make room for war files produced at an unprecedented rate, has intensified the archival problem of destruction of useless papers along with that of preservation of those of permanent value. So serious has this situation become that the National Archives has inaugurated a records administration program to advise departments and agencies on controlling this Frankenstein at the source of its growth. The invention and steady improvement of mechanical means of producing records during the last half-century have swelled the tide of papers in all governmental offices. At the root of the difficulty is lack of efficient records management. The Civil Service Commission has a special committee appraising the situation and the Navy Department has set an example for others to follow by establishing an Office of Records Co-ordination, with Emmett J. Leahy in charge. In an able discussion of the whole problem Mr. Leahy has pointed out the need for "eliminating useless paperwork" and for segregating great masses of papers which are only of temporary value. When they have served their purpose, whole files can be quickly destroyed without waste of time by custodians in the office or by archivists later. The solution is to be partially found also in a unified and well controlled filing system, in improved and intelligently directed personnel, and in the use of microphotography with proper recognition of its limitations.14 14. Emmett J. Leahy, "Records Administration and the War," Military Affairs, VI, no. 2 (Summer, 1942), 97-108. See also W. Grant Boyer, A Proposed Program of Records Administration and Archival Service for the Tennessee Valley Authority (Knoxville, Tenn., T.V.A., 1941). Frequent mention of the National Archives in the foregoing discussion suggests its constructive and ever broadening influence in the whole field of records. In September, 1941, upon the resignation of Dr. R. D. W. Connor, first archivist of the United States, to return to the University of North Carolina as professor of American history and jurisprudence, Dr. Solon J. Buck was appointed archivist. "The task of Dr. Connor's successors," wrote Dr. Buck, "is to build further upon the foundation securely laid by him."15 15. Seventh Annual Report of the Archivist of the United States for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1941 (Washington, 1942), vii. In view of his experience and notable accomplishments as administrator, historian, and bibliographer, the selection of Dr. Buck was hopefully anticipated and widely acclaimed. Among plans put into operation during 1941 is the finding mediums program which, like certain other practices in the National Archives, may be applied with modifications in some state archives. This program involves "the assignment of all material in the custody of the Archivist to registered record groups [somewhat comparable to the European fonds], the preparation of preliminary checklists and preliminary inventories for all material as soon as possible after its transfer, and the preparation of final inventories for record groups or parts . . . [thereof]." Detailed cataloguing is deferred until preparation of the final inventory; the accession is no longer used as a unit for cataloguing. In compiling inventories for publication, priority is given to those records concerned with problems of war and defense during World War I or with any other questions pertinent to the present emergency.16 16. Ibid., 10-11, 28-31. Whether or not the National Archives building was originally conceived as large enough to contain all non-current records of the federal government for many years to come, the ideas of those who have given thought to the matter have undergone considerable modification. The tremendous bulk of records in the District of Columbia, however much it may be reduced by proper destruction of useless papers by departments and agencies, will necessitate storage space close at hand. Plans for such facilities, now deferred for the duration, will make such a building an adjunct to the National Archives, from which certain bodies of records infrequently consulted may be removed. Papers in the "warehouse" would not be in dead storage, however, but only less accessible than those in the National Archives. (Such a warehousing project has already been adopted as a joint undertaking of certain libraries in the metropolitan area of Boston.) With regard to federal records outside the District of Columbia, the National Archives is developing plans for a select number of regional depositories. In most cases such records are of greatest value in the study of problems pertaining to the region or state or locality which in turn command the interest of scholars and officials in the particular area. Although these regional depositories would contain large bodies of material, the plan itself is indicative of the trend away from over-centralization, motivated not merely by congestion and overworked personnel and machinery in our leading libraries, but also by the belief that the cultural life of America may be better nurtured by research collections, regional, state, and even local.17 17. This idea was put into practice when the Historical Records Survey discontinued its regular work in April, 1942. Each state office took inventory of its unpublished material and sought state depository libraries for these files so that they might be conveniently available for state and local use. The administrative files of the national HRS office in Washington were sent to the National Archives. Somewhat related to this movement is the new policy of the Library of Congress whereby its acquisition of research materials in the field of American history will be restricted to collections of national significance. Although it may often be difficult to draw a sharp line to exclude manuscript records or imprints of somewhat less than national import, one may assume that this policy will serve to enrich certain state and regional institutions to which such collections are directed after being rejected in Washington. Since 1900 the Library of Congress has become increasingly our national library in ways that reflect credit on our American democracy. In more recent years especially, this institution with its modern techniques and well deserved prestige has worked with other leading libraries in furthering their common purpose and in helping all libraries to help themselves. The success of the national union catalogue, for example, has led to the establishment of regional and metropolitan finding mediums of this kind. Now an author catalogue of all printed cards representing books in the Library of Congress is to be lithographed from those cards in a series of volumes, so that more libraries and persons may enjoy the benefits provided at present only by the depository catalogues maintained in relatively few libraries.18 18. The Library of Congress Catalog of Printed Books, Lithographed from a Depository Catalog of Printed Cards Issued to July 1st, 1942 [A Prospectus] . . . [Ann Arbor, Mich.? 1942] To be published by subscription under the auspices of a Committee of the Association of Research Libraries. The Experimental Division of Library Co-operation of the Library of Congress, set up on a temporary basis in 1941, expired in April, 1942.19 19. Eleventh Annual Report on Historical Collections, University of Virginia Library, op. cit., 6-7. During the year Herbert A. Kellar, in charge of this Division, travelled throughout the United States to discuss with librarians, archivists, and scholars what might be done to solve their common problems with regard to ever increasing acquisitions, adequate controls for maximum availability and use of materials, more liberal policies of exchange and reproduction, and the improvement of reference tools within practical limits. It is hoped that the findings and conclusions of Mr. Kellar's study may be published as an aid toward the solution of these problems. Another nation-wide project may be mentioned at this point. When the American Imprints Inventory was discontinued in the spring of 1942, its invaluable file of author cards arranged chronologically by place of imprint was given to the Library of Congress. For the duration, however, the inventory is deposited in the Library of the Wisconsin State Historical Society. The collection of state, national, and foreign materials on the present world conflict by the Library of Congress has been under way since the outbreak of the war in September, 1939. These are only a few examples of how our national library serves increasingly the whole country in the realm of scholarship. War-time efforts of research libraries and archival institutions have curtailed but by no means replaced all their normal peacetime activities. Nor is it desirable that most phases of our cultural life should be discontinued during a war in which it is generally agreed that "ideas are weapons" for fighting and for laying the foundations of a new peace. When total war becomes a reality, no institution can justify complete detachment from these critical times. During 1917-18 the publications of some of our historical societies gave not the slightest evidence of being in a world at war. In the light of cultural developments during the twenty years between wars, it may be pertinent to take stock on this score again at the close of the present conflict and to draw some comparisons. The development of state archival departments or agencies has become an important subject among the perennial functions of the Society of American Archivists, inherited from the old Public Archives Commission. A model state archives act, drafted by a committee of the Society in 1940,20 20. "The Proposed Uniform State Public Records Act," in The American Archivist, III, no. 2 (Apr., 1940), 107-15. has been of great service in preparing plans and promoting legislation to this end in various states. In Florida an Archives Department has been established in connection with the State Library; the archivist is Dr. Dorothy Dodd. In New Jersey the State Library and the Public Record Office have been consolidated, with Mr. James E. Downes as state librarian. In Pennsylvania, through a joint committee of the state Library Association, Federation of Historical Societies, and Historical Association, a study of archival and public record problems is in process. There has long been a need for an adequate building for the Pennsylvania Historical Commission which has custody of some of the state's records. To aid in promoting the movement for a state archives department, Leon DeValinger, Jr., State Archivist of Delaware, was invited to address the Pennsylvania Federation of Historical Societies on methods and practices in his state. Pennsylvania's neighbors, Maryland and Delaware, have made great strides in recent years in administration of state archives and their relations with local record offices.21 21.

In the field of county archives the Illinois State Library has continued its constructive program of advising on the best methods of protection and preservation. It has urged transfer of county records to the state archives only when local facilities are inadequate and hazardous. It has encouraged the growth and improvement of local archival establishments because the intrinsic value of the records is enhanced by their significance to the life of the community which they represent. This argument is another illustration of the issues involved in the question of centralization vs. decentralization. In the field of historical manuscripts several new programs have been launched. At Princeton University, with the aid of a committee of authors, publishers, and scholars headed by Carl Van Doren, Librarian Julian P. Boyd is building up a collection of manuscripts and imprints known as the Princeton Archives of American Civilization. At present Dr. Boyd and the Committee are concentrating on literary materials, including original drafts and printer's "copy" of works of contemporary writers. In September, 1942, Cornell University began a Collection of Regional History to preserve historical materials of all kinds pertaining to New York State and related areas. Whitney R. Cross is curator of the collection. The interest of certain members of the faculty in agricultural history, folklore, and the history of education is aiding in the advancement of this project. The Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Company has established an Archives Department with Herbert O. Brayer in charge, to administer its official records dating from 1869 and to increase their research value. This is an encouraging move in the field of business archives and history which other corporations may well emulate. As a war measure an inventory was taken of the archives of Harvard University and the most valuable old records were placed in the vault of the new Houghton Rare Book Library. Hamilton College has begun a contemporary recording of its year by year development, not only in manuscript and printed form but also by means of the phonograph and the news reel. These two undertakings exemplify an opportunity which most educational institutions have overlooked. Even universities with large research collections have often neglected their own official records, scattered in various buildings and departments without uniform control to assure their preservation. The records of student organizations and activities are less likely to survive, except in the files of the college newspaper. A well co-ordinated effort at contemporary recording and preservation of older records with adequate archival administration may appropriately be regarded as a responsibility of the college and university library.22 22. Cf. W. E. Hemphill, "A Bibliography of the Unprinted Official Records of the University of Virginia," Sixth Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library, for the Year 1935-36 (University, Va., 1936), 9-27. When the Alderman Library building was completed in 1938, this inventory served as an argument for centralizing the University archives in the Rare Books and Manuscript Division. The fragmentary character of some of the recent records listed in this bibliography suggests the need for periodic checks of contemporary files. The contributions of a few other historical libraries should be mentioned here because their significance is more far reaching than the area of their immediate operation. The Hayes Memorial Library is compiling a comprehensive card bibliography of American history for the period of its special interest, 1865-1900, in three separate parts: a subject catalogue of printed materials, a catalogue of manuscript collections and archives, and a guide to the resources of all libraries and other depositories of importance for research in this field. The Hayes Library prints in its Annual Report "Abstracts of Unpublished Dissertations Accepted . . . [during the Year] Relating to American History . . . " of this same period. Well known are its grants-in-aid to scholars. In the enrichment of its collections under the able directorship of Dr. Curtis W. Garrison it has laid considerable stress on southern materials.23 23. . . . The Hayes Memorial Library, Fremont, Ohio, Fourth Annual Report, 1940-41 . . . ([Fremont?], 1941), 5 ff., 20-55; James H. Rodabaugh, "Bibliography of American History, 1865-1900," The Library Journal, LXVII, no. 8 (April 15, 1942), 342-43. Like this library with its nucleus of President Hayes and the Hayes family papers, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library finds its special concern with the twentieth century emanating from the Roosevelt papers and the President's collections on shipping and maritime history. Most of the acquisitions of this library are of great national and international significance, but the choicest fruits will be relished first by the next generation of historians. Such is also the case with many of the treasures flowing into the Hoover War Library. One may well question whether we shall have soon again two successive presidents of the United States contributing so much to historical scholarship. The initial success of the American Association for State and Local History in bringing to a focus the problems of this field and in providing for exchange of information and opinion was set forth in the preceding report of the writer.24 24. Eleventh Annual Report on Historical Collections ..., op. cit., 10. The Association's subsequent progress has justified the most hopeful expectations, as evidenced in its first annual meeting at Hartford, Connecticut, opening in joint session with the Society of American Archivists. Three publications during the past year in a series of Bulletins reveal an emphasis upon practical problems which the authors discuss from their own experience. In the first Dr. Edward P. Alexander describes a variety of activities through which a society may advance the historical appreciation of the community.25 25. "What Should Our Historical Society Do?", I, no. 1 (Washington, D. C., October, 1941). Sylvester K. Stevens in the second issue writes on "Local History and Winning the War;" and Loring McMillen discusses "Using Volunteers in the Local Historical Society's Program."26 26. I, no. 2 (January, 1942); I, no. 3 (August, 1942). The Association is co-sponsor with the National Genealogical Society of a series of inexpensive facsimiles of source materials, selected for their national significance.27 27. The State and Local History News, published bimonthly by the Association, provides a helpful digest of current activities in this field. In Virginia, as earlier reports in this series have indicated, increasing interest in the collection, preservation, and publication of historical sources has been most clearly manifested in activities of the three oldest cultural institutions supported by the state— the College of William and Mary, the Virginia State Library, and the University of Virginia. What they and other institutions in the state have done, however much restricted to the present bounds of the Old Dominion, has been basic to the flowering of southern historiography which is sometimes associated with the so-called southern renaissance in literature and the humanities since the first World War. During the past year the College of William and Mary Library under Dr. E. G. Swem has been concentrating on materials pertaining to its own history in anticipation of its two hundred and fiftieth anniversary in 1943. Hollins College was engaged in a similar undertaking in writing its centennial history as part of its celebration of 1942. Washington and Lee began a program to augment its R. E. Lee Collection and to compile a check list of all known Lee manuscript items. Professor Allen W. Moger was appointed archivist. Some encouraging evidence of local historical work noted a year ago28 28. Eleventh Annual Report on Historical Collections, 12. deserves further comment. The Clarke County Historical Association has accumulated a collection of some three hundred negatives of portraits in Virginia. Beginning with their own county and the neighboring area, the Association's special committee ranged farther afield to include certain important public collections in the state. With written permission from the owner, the Association will supply at cost any order for photographs from these negatives.29 29. Everard K. Meade, "Clarke County Historical Association Collection of Negatives of Portraits," Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, L, no. 2 (April, 1942), 155-62, including a list of negatives. In April, 1942, the Albemarle County Historical Society published the second volume of its Papers, edited by the writer of this report. It has in preparation a reprint of recollections of James Alexander, founder of the Charlottesville Jeffersonian Republican, who in the 1870's wrote a series of articles for this paper describing in detail the town and its inhabitants as he found them when he became a resident in 1828. The quarterly meetings of the Albemarle society included a summer program at Monticello on Jefferson's home and gardens. In connection with materials on local history in Virginia should be mentioned the last publications of the Historical Records Survey. These consisted of an inventory of the records of Prince George County, an . . . Index to Marriage Notices in the [Baptist] Religious Herald, Richmond, Virginia, 1828-1938 (2 vols.), and an Index to Marriage Notices in the [Episcopal] Southern Churchman, 1835-1941 (2 vols.). When the HRS project was discontinued, its unpublished materials were deposited in the Archives Division of the Virginia State Library. The University of Virginia Library has in progress a guide to its manuscript collections to be published at some future date impossible to set at present. It will include all materials acquired before the year 1940-41, when the first annual list of accessions was published.30 30. Eleventh Annual Report on Historical Collections, 17-52. Work has been begun on a calendar of the Lee Papers during the period of the American Revolution. A small beginning has been made in compiling a list of literary manuscripts in the McGregor Library's collection. Another McGregor project for which plans are under way is a bibliography of books in this collection relating to description and travel in America, because the library is especially rich in Americana of this character. A main entry catalogue of all Virginia maps in the Alderman and McGregor libraries is also in progress. The universality of Thomas Jefferson and his writings is impressed upon us anew during times of stress in democratic government. During the present crisis the urge to pay tribute to the Sage of Monticello is intensified by the desire to commemorate the bicentennial of his birth in 1943. The Thomas Jefferson Memorial Commission appointed by Congress has been considering what cultural activity might appropriately honor him and make a permanent contribution to the advancement of scholarship. Numerous institutions are engaged in special bibliographical and historical studies on Jeffersoniana. The Library of Congress, for example, has arrangements with the Massachusetts Historical Society for microfilming all Jefferson papers in the latter's custody. It is peculiarly fitting that the University of Virginia Library should be the center for information on the location of all known Jefferson material. The checklist here, which includes letters received as well as written by him, has been steadily augmented during the past year. Substantial additions were made possible by the co-operation of the Henry E. Huntington Library, the American Antiquarian Society, the American Philosophical Society, and the Missouri Historical Society at St. Louis. Since the inception of this project several years ago by John C. Wyllie, director of rare books and manuscripts (now on leave in war service), the project has been carried forward chiefly by Mrs. Helen Bullock. A by-product of her research is an essay on the history of "The Papers of Thomas Jefferson," to explain their fortuitous division into various collections and their present location.31 31. Published in The American Archivist, IV, no. 4 (October, 1941), 238-49. In the opinion of the present writer, the publication of this checklist would be a most valuable project for the Jefferson Memorial Commission to sponsor, and a greater contribution to scholarship than another printed collection of Jefferson's Works. The University of Virginia Library also has plans, near completion, for a similar card checklist of the writings of Madison and Monroe. In accordance with the acquisition policy outlined in the report of last year, both the Alderman Library and the McGregor Library closely associated with it have been enriched, as evidenced partially in the list accompanying this report. Most of the printed items, however, are not included in this list. A variety of material on the present war gravitates to other divisions of the Alderman Library. The writer has been encouraged to devote a considerable portion of his time to the study of World War I records as preserved in the several states and to plans for the promotion of similar activities on a national scale during World War II, as described earlier in this report.32 32. See above, 6-8. In October, 1941, the writer gave the Goldwin Smith lecture at Cornell University on "The University Library's Opportunities for Collecting Research Materials." Field work for the collection of Virginia manuscripts and imprints has also been drastically reduced because of rationing and other transportation difficulties. War conditions have brought several changes in personnel in the Division of Rare Books and Manuscripts. With the departure of Mr. Wyllie in November, 1941, to join the American Field Service with the British Army in Egypt, Mr. Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., in charge of manuscripts, became acting director. When he became an ensign in the United States Navy in September, 1942, he was succeeded by Miss Louise Savage. Early in 1942 Mr. George H. Reese, in charge of rare books, was commissioned a lieutenant, junior grade, and was very shortly sent to Iceland. His position in the library was filled by Mr. J. Wilson McCutchan, while Mr. Harris H. Williams was placed in charge of manuscripts. Dr. William D. Hoyt, Jr., in charge of newspapers, was succeeded by Mrs. Helen Bullock. Several publications were issued by the Library during the year. In the McGregor series, the purpose of which is to make manuscripts or imprints of special interest in its collections widely available, was published Thomas Jefferson and His Unknown Brother Randolph . . . (1942), twenty-eight letters exchanged between them during the years 1807 to 1815, with an historical introduction by Professor Bernard Mayo. Three publications appeared in the University of Virginia Bibliographical Series. Number Two is an Annotated Geological Bibliography of Virginia (1942), by Professor Joseph K. Roberts, with a chapter on the "Rise and Development of Geological Thought in Virginia" and biographical sketches of Virginia geologists.33 33. Printed by the Dietz Press, Richmond, Va., copyright by Prof. Roberts. Number Three is Early English Books at the University of Virginia, a Short-Title Catalogue, (1941), compiled by Dr. C. William Miller of the English Department. New Market, Virginia, Imprints, 1806-1876: a Check-List (1942), edited by Lester J. Cappon and Ira V. Brown, is Number Five in this series. It was done with the co-operation of the Historical Records Survey and the American Imprints Inventory, which provided data on these imprints in various libraries throughout the nation. For over a century printing in New Market was carried on almost exclusively by the Henkel Family. Theirs was the first German press in the South. Many of their early imprints are rare and extremely interesting examples of early typography in the Valley of Virginia. This check-list includes an historical introduction by Mr. Brown, graduate student in history at the University. In conclusion, the writer wishes to express hearty thanks on behalf of the University of Virginia Library, to the many friends of the University who have contributed to the enrichment of its research collections. The list of acquisitions printed herewith was compiled by Mrs. Bullock. For her painstaking work, the valuable assistance of Mr. Williams, and helpful counsel of Mr. Berkeley, the writer is deeply indebted. A special word of appreciation is accorded to Librarian Harry Clemons, under whose kindly direction all the staff have the daily pleasure of working. Lester J. Cappon, Consultant in History and Archives 15 September 1942</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EXPLANATORY NOTES Each entry describes the papers of a single acquisition, all the manuscripts in such a group being usually the papers of the single individual or family whose name is given. The word "records" is added in the case of the papers of an organization, and "collection" for groups of manuscripts assembled by a collector from various sources. Birth and death dates of persons are given in parentheses following the name. Dates not in parentheses indicate inclusive years of the manuscripts, with an occasional added date in parentheses to show the period covered by the bulk of the material. Thus 1725 (1900)1928 means that while the earliest manuscript is dated 1725, the majority of papers fall in the period after 1900; 1805-(1850)1910 means that the body of the material ends in 1850, with a few scattered items up to 1910; and 1791 (1840-1860) 1902 means that the bulk of the papers fall between 1840 and 1860. The first ten issues of the Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library . . . are referred to, after the first citation, as Archivist Report. In 1941 the series was renamed, for various reasons, the Annual Report on Historical Collections, University of Virginia Library; last year's report in this series is abbreviated as the Eleventh Annual Report on Historical Collections . . . . In addition to the usual abbreviations, "MS" for manuscript, "ALS" for autograph letter signed, etc., the abbreviation "incl." has been used for "including." Titles of persons have been omitted except when the first name is unknown. The numbers given at the end of each entry are accession numbers, included for their convenience as a finding aid in the Library. The names of depositors of manuscripts on loan to the University are not included; it should be understood that while the majority of such manuscripts are accessible for research, all are subject to such restrictions as the depositor has made, and none may be reproduced without consent of the owner.</field>

Gift and purchase. Additions to the McGregor Library Collection of maps include: A Map of the [Most] Inhabited part of Virginia containing the Whole Province of Maryland with Part of Pensilvania, New Jersey and North Carolina. Drawn by Joshua Fry and Peter Jefferson in 1751. "Engrav'd and Publish'd according to Act of Parliament by Thos. Jefferys Geographer to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales at the Corner of St. Martins Lane, Charing Cross, London." 31 by 50 inches. Scale: 30 miles to 2 7/8 inches. Philadelphia and Curratuk Creek are 0° Longitude. This copy, one of two known, of the first edition of the map drawn by Joshua Fry and Peter Jefferson, father of Thomas, was recently purchased by the Tracy W. McGregor Library. The title is within a scroll, including an engraving of a tobacco warehouse and wharf. Below the title and engraving is the following dedication: "To the Right Honourable, George Dunk Earl of Halifax First Lord Commissioner and to the Rest of the Right Honourable and Honourable Commissioners for Trade and Plantations. This map is most humbly Inscribed to their Lordship's, By their Lordship's Most obedient and most devoted humble servt., Thos. Jefferys." The first edition differs in important respects from later ones; the mountains and rivers (the New and the Ohio particularly) and the western section being inaccurately and incorrectly located. These errors are corrected in the 1755 and later editions. The major error, however, is the placing of the base of Lake Erie far south of its actual site; on the 40° Latitude in this instance. Some of the rivers and boundary lines are colored. Nothing is known of its provenance. A new accurate map of the English plantations in America and of the Louisiana and River Mississippi.
