      <field name="fulltext">DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. Edwin Anderson Alderman, Ph.B., D.C.L., LL.D. President Richard Heath Dabney M.A., Ph.D. Dean ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. Required for Admission to the Department.âA candidate for admission to the Department of Graduate Studies must have a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank; or, in case the institution he attended does not confer such a degree, he must present a certificate of graduation in a course of study accepted by the Academic Faculty as fully equivalent to that ordinarily required for the degree in question. Required for Admission as Applicant for a Degree.âIn order to be recognized as an applicant for a master's or doctor's degree, any candidate who has not received a baccalaureate degree from this university must secure from the Registrar of the University a blank form, which, when properly filled out, he must file with the Dean of this department, together with a catalogue of the institution from which he graduated. If that institution has (1) a faculty of at least eight professors giving their full time to college or university work; (2) entrance requirements equal to those of this university, and (3) a course of four full years in the liberal arts and sciences, the candidate will not be required to take any undergraduate courses except such as the Committee on Rules and Courses or the professors in charge of the graduate courses he elects may consider necessary for their successful prosecution. If, however, the institution in question does not meet the three conditions mentioned above, the candidate's preparation will be carefully considered by the Committee on Rules and Courses, which will prescribe such undergraduate courses as are deemed necessary to supply his deficiences. Admission of Women.âThe candidate must hold a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank. REGULATIONS. Grade.âThe grade of a student in any course, either for a term or for the session, is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Grade Required for Passing.âFor passing in any course a grade of seventy-five per cent is required. Absence from Examination will not be excused except for sickness on the day of examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, is entitled to a special examination on a date to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge. Change of Subjects of Study after registration can be made only with the consent of the Dean and of the professors concerned. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES. The Master's Degrees. A candidate who has received a baccalaureate degree from this university, or who has fulfilled the conditions above specified under Entrance Requirements, is entitled to a master's degree upon his successful completion of four graduate courses, chosen in accordance with the restrictions detailed below: No C course which a candidate has offered as part of the work credited for a baccalaureate degree may be counted for a master's degree. No C course may be counted toward a master's degree unless preceded by B work in the same subject aggregating at least 6 session-hours; or, in case only one 3 session-hour course is offered in that subject, by one B course in that subject and a second B course in the same Group, chosen with the approval of the professor in charge of the C course in question. A candidate must take at least two graduate courses during the last year of his work for a master's degree, and no candidate may receive this degree until at least one year after he has received his baccalaureate degree, except by special consent of the Academic Faculty. The degree of Master of Arts is conferred upon a Bachelor of Arts who has successfully completed four graduate courses, chosen with the approval of the Academic Faculty. These four courses must be in at least three distinct subjects, and in three different Academic Schools, except by special order of the Academic Faculty. Three of the subjects must be cognate, which means that they must be selected from kindred groups of subjects, such as, for example, languages and literature, or mathematics and natural science, or history, economics, and government, or philosophy, education, and biology. The degree of Master of Science is conferred upon a holder of the cultural degree of Bachelor of Science who has successfully completed four graduate courses chosen in accordance with the regulations prescribed for the Master of Arts above. The degree of Master of Science in a Special Subject, the name of which is inscribed on the diploma, is conferred upon a holder of the vocational degree of Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject who has successfully completed four graduate courses selected from among those offered in his special subject, or from among other courses which meet with the approval of the professors in charge of his special subject. Doctor of Philosophy. A candidate for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy must hold a baccalaureate degree of this university, or, if he be a graduate of some other institution, he must have fulfilled the conditions above specified under Entrance Requirements. The requirements for the degree are as follows: (1) A reading knowledge of French and German, attested by the successful completion of the B courses in these languages, or else by examinations held at the beginning of the first year of the candidate's work for the doctorate, by committees consisting of the professor in charge of the candidate's major subject and the professors of French and German, respectively. If the candidate fails on one or both of these examinations, he will be required to enter the appropriate course in one or both of these languages. No student will be regarded as a regular candidate for the doctorate until he has fulfilled this requirement. (2) The successful completion of at least three years of graduate work in three subjects, to be known, respectively, as the candidate's major, primary minor and secondary minor. These subjects must be cognate (see page 8, and must be chosen, with the approval of the Committee on Rules and Courses, from at least three Academic Schools. The major must be pursued for at least three years, the primary minor for at least two years, and the secondary minor for at least one year. No C course may be counted toward the doctor's degree unless preceded by B work in the same subject aggregating at least 6 session-hours; or, in case only one 3 session-hour course is offered in that subject, by one B course in that subject and a second B course in the same Group, chosen with the approval of the professor in charge of the C course in question. Any student taking a D course in any subject may be required by the professor, with the approval of the Academic Faculty, to attend such lectures or courses in any of the Academic Schools as the professor may deem necessary. Graduate work done in other universities may be accepted in lieu of resident work, provided sufficient evidence is furnished by examination, written or oral, or both, that such work has been of a grade similar to that required here, and has been satisfactorily performed, and provided also that the candidate takes in this university at least one graduate course in his primary minor, and does at least one year's resident work in his major subject. A candidate who is a professor in a chartered college or university, of the subject selected by him as major, may be allowed by the Academic Faculty to spend only two years in resident work. In all cases the work of the last year of candidacy shall be done in residence, unless the Academic Faculty shall for special reasons direct otherwise.

An unrivalled background is provided for it by the buildings and environment of Charlottesville; the University group, with its old buildings specially designed to furnish examples of the various orders "as specimens for the architectural lecturer," its new buildings designed by Stanford White; the works of sculpture by Houdon, Ezekiel, Bitter, Borglum, Keck, Shrady, and Aitken; the concerts and exhibitions of paintings brought to the University with part of the income of the McIntire fund. Equipment.âThe School of Fine Arts has its headquarters in the building at the south end of West Range, which has been specially adapted to its use. It comprises a lecture, concert, and exhibition hall, architectural draughting rooms, dark rooms and offices. A large studio for freehand drawing and painting is located in Cabell Hall. For concerts requiring large seating capacity Cabell Hall itself is available, and also the new classic open-air amphitheatre given to the University by Paul Goodloe McIntire, of the Class of 1879. Since the foundation of the School the University has already acquired the nucleus of an important collection of works of art, to supplement the considerable number of fine portraits and other paintings in its possession. As a gift from Hon. John Barton Payne it has received a large collection of etchings, engravings and lithographs, including numerous and important examples of the work of Rembrandt, Whistler, Haden, Turner, Legros, Zorn and other masters, and admirably illustrating the history and processes of the graphic arts. An important canvas ascribed to Rubens has just been presented by John Armstrong Chaloner, Esq. For the current work in Art and Architecture there is generous provision of casts, books, photographs and lantern slides. The casts include geometrical models, motives of ornamentation, architectural elements, elements of the figure, and a number of full figures from the antique, as well as fine modern figures. Beside the books on the history of art and on construction kept at the University Library, an exceptional departmental collection of works valuable for reference in architectural design and detailing, is housed in direct connection with the draughting rooms. Among the numerous important sets of folios are the Grands Prix de Rome, MÃ©dailles des Concours d'architecture, Monuments antiques, Fragments antiques, Edifices de Rome moderne, The Georgian Period, Work of McKim, Mead, and White, etc., etc. These are supplemented by some three thousand photographs, and by a collection of five thousand lantern slides, as well as by a number of envoi drawings by former holders of the Roman Prize and the Rotch Travelling Scholarship. For Music, the school has two concert grand pianos for its use in the classroom and for ensemble recitals, a double bass and kettle drums for the use of students in the orchestra, lantern slides illustrating ancient instruments and a comprehensive library of chamber music, orchestral scores and parts, operas, and piano classics, as well as books of reference on musical subjects and collateral reading, which latter are kept in the University Library.

Latin D: Latin C1 or C2 prerequisite.âA three-year course for those who desire to specialize in classical philology, especially those who choose Latin as their major for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. If the candidate's major be Latin, a respectable familiarity with Greek is required. If the candidate's major be Romanic, the technical Greek requirement is waived as far as practically possible, and he is guided into the history of the Roman popular vernacular and into an acquaintance with the authors illustrating the Vulgar Latin in literature.
