      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION. The writer is a native born son of Southwest Virginia, and has always felt a great pride in his country, and since reaching maturity has been interested in the history of this section. In the schools but little has been taught in regard to the history of this portion of Virginia, as but a small part of its history has been preserved. Our historians have been citizens of Eastern Virginia or of other States; and while our people have been making history from the earliest settlement, scarcely any effort has been made to preserve it, and as a result other parts of our country whose history has been preserved have in many instances received credit that properly belongs to the people of this section of Virginia, and being impressed with this fact, and prompted by a desire to preserve the past history of our people, he determined, a few years since, to collect the history of Southwest Virginia, in so far as it was possible, and to rescue the same from oblivion, and in doing this work he has given such time only as he could spare from his professional duties. If an apology is needed for his effort in thus attempting to preserve this history it will be found in the remark of Lord Macaulay, wherein he justly observed: "A people which takes no pride in the noble achievements of remote ancestors will never achieve anything worthy to be remembered with pride by remote descendants." There can be no question that this section of Virginia has been robbed of much of the honor due her for the early settlement of the vast extent of country to the west and south thereof, and that the noble deeds of her sons have been ascribed to others; and a knowledge of this fact has rendered necessary the preservation of the deeds of the worthy citizens that this section has produced, not only to gratify the pride of our citizens, but to remind them of the obligations they are under, and to supply them with examples of patriotism which they may seek to emulate. The writer feels his inability to properly perform this task, but hopes that the gleanings he has gathered may suffice in some more skillful hands to weave for the founders and builders of our country an enduring garland of glory, and he asks a kind indulgence of the reader for such errors, omissions, and imperfections as may be found in this work. In the words of Judge Haywood: "Let no one censure his motives, for they are pure. There will indeed be much room to blame the defective performance of the author, but this he will hear with the greatest pleasure if the person dissatisfied will, for the benefit of his country, either produce a more perfect work or contribute to the merits of this." In the preparation of this work he has obtained information from various persons and places, but in nearly every instance has required documentary evidence for all statements made, and has given references where the statement is liable to be questioned, and in quoting original papers has done so without changing the same in any particular. In the course of the preparation of this work he has received assistance from a number of persons, for which he feels deeply grateful. He desires to mention in this connection the following persons: Miss Lucy Landrum, his stenographer, who has faithfully labored in preparing his manuscript for the printer; W. G. Stanard, secretary of the Virginia Historical Society; the secretary of the New York Historical Society, Hon. J. L. Bristow; Fourth Assistant Postmaster-General, C. A. Dunnington; Congressional Library, Washington, D. C.; Thomas E. Nimmo, State Library, Richmon, Va.; Mrs. Margaret C. Pilcher, Nashville, Tenn.; Prof. T. D. Davidson and many others. L. P. Summers, Abingdon, Va. June 13, 1903.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">History of Southwest Virginia, 1746-1786, Washington County, 1777-1870. CHAPTER I. 1001-1716. The history of Virginia, from the earliest times until the date of the formation of Washington county by the General Assembly of Virginia, is interesting and instructive, and is necessary to a thorough comprehension of that part of our history subsequent thereto. In the year 1001, the American Continent was discovered by Leif Erickson, a Northman, who sailed west from Greenland, and landed on the coast of America in 41¼ north latitude. He named the land of his discovery Vineland. This discovery was made in the spring of the year, and the luxuriant growth of vegetation that adorned the land suggested the name—Vineland. This continent was visited by the Northmen at intervals from the time of the discovery of Erickson until as late as 1347. The visits of the Northmen to America have often been questioned, and were generally doubted, until discoveries made in recent times. An examination of the records and documents to be found in the archives of the Antiquarian Society of Copenhagen put to rest this question. So eminent an authority as Humboldt, after an examination of the record, says: "The discovery of the northern part of America by the Northmen cannot be disputed." No practical benefit resulted from the adventures of the Northmen, and in view of the fact that those people ceased to visit the newly discovered country after 1347, and actually forgot the explorations of their people, they are to be given but little credit for their early discoveries. From the time of the last visit of the Northmen, in 1347, until the year 1492, the continent of America was unknown to the inhabitants of the rest of the world; they had never before heard of such a land; the curtain of oblivion shut out from the vision of mankind the garden spot of God's creation. 1492. In the year 1492, Christopher Columbus, a native of Genoa, Italy, bearing the flag of Spain, after surmounting innumerable difficulties, sailed west in search of a new land and discovered what afterwards proved to be San Salvador, one of the Bahama Islands. He took possession of the newly discovered land in the name of the King and Queen of Spain. Columbus did not visit the mainland of the American Continent until many years thereafter. Nothing could be more pleasant than to study the life and daring adventures of Columbus and other Spanish, Portuguese, and French explorers, but their efforts are in no way associated with the history of the country that we purpose to deal with in this book; this pleasure, therefore, must be deferred to another time. Columbus! His name should be ever revered, and his fame is as imperishable as the continent that he gave by discovery to the world. 1497. John Cabot, in the year 1497, sailing the flag of England, commissioned so to do by Henry VII, discovered Newfoundland and Labrador, and declared that he had found a new world. 1498. The following year John and Sebastian Cabot, under a new commission from the King of England, fitted out an expedition under the charge of Sebastian Cabot, and, sailing in a northwardly course, sought a route to the East India Islands, but the inclemency of the weather and the insurpassable barrier of ice forced the abandonment of the original purpose of the expedition. The course of the voyage was consequently changed, and, as a result, Virginia was discovered in the year 1498. John and Sebastian Cabot were the first to discover the Eastern coast of America, and England laid claim to all the vast territory between the 34th and 68th parallels of north latitude from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans, basing her claim on this discovery. 1539. De Soto, by a commission from the King of Spain, in the years 1539 and 1540, extended his discoveries from the north of Florida inland to the head waters of the present Holston and Clinch rivers and thence to the Mississippi river. 1584. Eighty-five years intervened between the time of the discoveries of John and Sebastian Cabot and the first permanent settlement made in all the vast territory claimed by England by reason of their discoveries, and the honor attending this event justly belongs to Sir Walter Raleigh, a young nobleman, a participant in the French Protestant wars, who in 1493 applied to Queen Elizabeth for assistance in fitting out an expedition for the purpose of planting a Colony in America. In answer to his application the Queen gave him a commission creating him Lord of all that portion of the American continent claimed by England. The first expedition sent out by Raleigh was composed of two ships, and their object was to make discoveries. This expedition sailed in April, 1584, and, on the 13th day of July of the same year, entered Ocracoke inlet within the present limits of North Carolina. Here they remained until September, 1584, at which time they sailed for England, and upon their arrival Elizabeth gave the country the name of Virginia. Immediately upon their return seven ships carrying one hundred and eighty men set sail for the New World and landed at Roanoke Island in the year 1585. This company, charmed with the prospects, decided to settle on the island. Many of the company, not being accustomed to labor and not being inclined to work, were greatly disappointed in their hopes, became disheartened and, at the first opportunity, returned to England. Sir Richard Grenville left fifteen men on the island to guard the rights of England. Sir Ralph Lane, one of the returning colonists, introduced the use of tobacco into England, he and the other colonists having learned from the Indians to smoke it. 1587. In 1587 Raleigh sent out another expedition to settle Roanoke Island. This expedition was composed of women and children as well as men. Upon reaching their destination in safety they found the tenements and fort in ruins and the beasts of the forest feeding on the vegetation where the former settlements had been located. They found, also, scattered about the former settlement, the bones of the fifteen men left by Sir Richard Grenville. This Colony was in charge of John White. Soon after the landing, on August 18th, 1587, a child was born to Annias and Virginia Dare, to whom was given the name of "Virginia Dare." This was the first white child born of English parents in America. Soon after the birth of Virginia Dare, John White returned to England for supplies for the Colony, leaving behind him eighty-nine men, seventeen women and eleven children. He was delayed on his return voyage and when he arrived at Roanoke Island after an absence of three years no trace of the Colony could be found except the word Croatan carved on a tree. It is said, but not verified, that some of this Colony found shelter among the Indians on the coast of North Carolina. This story of the first settlement in this part of America remains one of the saddest tragedies in our history. 1606. One hundred and fourteen years had passed since the discovery of America by Columbus, when King James the First of England granted to a company* * Stith—Henning's Statutes at Large, page 60. of wealthy merchants a patent of that part of America lying between the 34th and 45th degrees north latitude and all islands within one hundred miles of the coast. This grant was divided between the London and Plymouth companies. The London Company sent out an expedition composed of one hundred and five colonists under the command of Captain Christopher Newport, an experienced seaman. Although this expedition sailed in 1606, it did not reach the mouth of Chesapeake bay until May 15, 1607. † † Indian name "Powhatan River." James river and Capes Henry and Charles were discovered and named for the king of England and his sons. The colonists continued the voyage up the James river about fifty miles, when they landed and began the erection of houses and the making of all necessary arrangements for a permanent settlement. Thus was founded Jamestown, and thus occurred, according to a noted historian, "The most important event in profane history," and thus the foundation stones of the greatest commonwealth and republic the world has ever known were laid by men whose posterity were destined to kindle a spirit of political and religious liberty such as can be extinguished only with the Anglo-Saxon race. This settlement at Jamestown may be regarded as the starting point of all Virginia histories. The first Colony in Virginia began under circumstances having a tendency to discourage the thoughtful, and reasonably so, because of the fact that of the one hundred and five colonists only twelve were laborers, the remaining ninety-seven being thriftless and dissolute. All power was vested in a body of councillors composed of Bartholomew Gosnold, John Smith, Edward Winfield, Christopher Newport, John Ratcliffe, John Martin and George Kendall. Edward Winfield was chosen the first Governor of the Colony of Virginia, and thus began civil government in America. Shortly after the settlement Captains Newport and Smith decided to explore the country, traveled up the James river as far as the falls and visited Powhatan, the king of the Indians, whose capital was near the present site of the city of Richmond. After a short stay at the Indian village, Newport and Smith returned to Jamestown. Newport soon left for England, and immediately thereafter trouble arose among the colonists. Winfield was succeeded by Ratcliffe, and Ratcliffe by Captain Smith, who, by his excellent management of the Colony, won the title of the "Father of Virginia." Late in the autumn Captain Newport returned from England, bringing about seventy new colonists, two of the number being women (Mrs. Forrest and Annie Bergess), and a considerable quantity of supplies. Among the new colonists were several gold refiners, who, discovering earth near Jamestown having a resemblance to gold, pronounced the same gold of the best quality, and, thereupon, the entire Colony forsook all commendable enterprises and wasted their time and energies in loading one of Newport's vessels with this earth, which proved, upon its arrival in England, to be worthless. Another ship returning to England would have been loaded with a similar cargo, but Captain Smith objected, and it was loaded with cedar wood. This was the first valuable cargo exported from this part of America to England. The Colony, having thus wasted their energies and consumed their supplies, would, no doubt, have perished during the winter that followed, had not Captain John Smith exercised the energies of his resourceful mind in feeding and protecting them. The best friend Captain Smith found in this New World was Pocahontas, the daughter of Powhatan, the chief of the Indians. The colonists charged that Smith intended to marry Pocahontas and make himself king of Virginia. 1608. In the year 1608 Captain Smith, in a small open barge, explored the Chesapeake bay and its tributaries. 1609. In the month of May, 1609, a new and very beneficial charter was granted the London Company, and the Colony began to prosper. The new charter conferred on the company the powers of the king, the local authority of the Governor was greatly increased and Lord Delaware was made Governor for life. Captain Smith, in this year, divided the Colony and sent a part thereof to make a settlement at the falls of the James river, near Richmond, and another part thereof to Nansemond. In this year Captain Smith was forced to return to England in consequence of serious injuries received from the explosion of his powder flask. At the time of his departure the Colony numbered four hundred and fifty persons, all abundantly supplied. Thus terminated the career in America of the man who faithfully earned the title of the "Father of Virginia." The Colony thereafter, for a time, was without a competent ruler, and such was the profligacy and viciousness of the ruler they had, and the people, that in a short time the condition of the Colony was changed from prosperity to abject want, and by the spring of 1610 there remained but sixty persons in the Colony, and these were on the verge of starvation. At this time Gates and Somers arrived from the West Indies, and all the Colony, crowding aboard their ships, had actually sailed for Newfoundland, but they were not out of the James river when they were met by Lord Delaware, with three ships, many new settlers and a large quantity of provisions, in fact everything requisite to relieve the situation. Lord Delaware prevailed upon the colonists to return to Jamestown, where under his splendid management the Colony prospered again. Unfortunately, in the year 1611 Lord Delaware was forced by bad health to return to England, and the government was placed in the hands of Sir George Percy, a man wanting in authority. In a short time the Colony was again reduced to abject want. Percy was succeeded by Sir Thomas Dale, a man of practical ideas, and again the Colony prospered. He was a soldier by profession, and his authority, exercised rightly, met the demands of the hour. During his administration the Colony was augmented by the arrival of three hundred emigrants from England. From the founding of the Colony at Jamestown in 1607 until the latter part of the administration of Sir Thomas Dale all property had been held in common, but he directed a division of property among the colonists, and from this time we may certainly trace an improvement in the conditions of the people. Every man thereafter was dependent upon his individual exertions for his livelihood. Laziness was punished by flogging and irons. Mutineers and deserters were punished with death. The lands of the colonists were divided and allotted to the members of the Colony, and then, for the first time, the right of property in lands was recognized in America. Several new settlements were made during this time on both sides of the James river. The administration of the affairs of the Colony was entrusted successively to Sir Thomas Gates, George Yeardly and Captain Argall, and to George Yeardly again in 1619. The administration of George Yeardly marks an epoch in the history of mankind. Beyond question his inspiration was human liberty and representative govenment. He believed the colonists should have a hand in the government of themselves. He called a legislative assembly to meet at Jamestown on July 30th, 1619, to be composed of two representatives from each of the eleven boroughs into which the Colony was divided, and this assembly was called the House of Burgesses. Thus was planted the germ from which sprang representative government in America, and thus to Virginia may be credited the honor of being the first State in the world* * Bancroft. "composed of separate boroughs diffused over an extensive surface in which the government was organized on the principle of universal suffrage." All freemen, without exception, were entitled to vote. In the following year, 1620, a Dutch ship landed at Jamestown and sold to the planters about twenty Africans to be held as slaves, and thus began slavery in America. On the 24th day of July, 1621, the London Company gave to the Virginia colonists a written Constitution, granting all the rights and liberties theretofore granted by George Yeardly, and, about the same time, a shipload of English maidens, about one hundred in all, arrived at Jamestown. There was great rejoicing, and general prosperity prevailed; the colonists were no longer numbered by hundreds, but by thousands. 1622. Sir Francis Wyatt became Governor in the year 1622, and this year witnessed, on March 22d, the massacre of three hundred and forty-seven men, women and children by the Indians, but the Colony continued to grow and prosper. The London Company was dissolved by the King in the year 1625, and from this time the crown of England dictated the policy of the Colony. Events passed rapidly in Virginia for the next twenty years. One governor after another came and went, but none of them was of sufficient importance to be mentioned. 1634. In the year 1634 the territory of Virginia was divided into eight shires or counties similar to those in England. For each shire lieutenants were appointed to look after the military affairs, and sheriffs and justices of the peace were commissioned to hold courts in each of the counties, or shires. Thus was constituted and thus began the county court system that continued with but little change until 1870. 1646. The Virginia Colony in the struggle between Charles I of England and his Parliament sympathized with the King and did not hesitate, upon the death of Charles I, to recognize his son, Charles II, as king. Cromwell sent a force to subdue the Colony in 1650, but the attempt was futile and the Virginians submitted only upon condition that they be permitted to retain their government and the rights and privileges previously bestowed by the kings of England; which was readily agreed to. Richard Bennett was elected Governor, but was shortly thereafter succeeded by Edward Diggs. The next Governor of Virginia was Samuel Mathews, a Virginia planter of forty years' standing. 1660. Upon the restoration of Charles II in 1660, Sir William Berkley again became the Governor of Virginia. 1666. The next event of importance in the history of Virginia arose in the Colony from the dissatisfaction aroused by the acts of the British Parliament and the conduct of Sir William Berkley. A large portion of the people of Virginia, under the leadership of Nathaniel Bacon, rebelled, and drove Sir William Berkley from Jamestown and forced the commissioning of Bacon as a general. These troubles ceased with the death of Bacon. This is known as Bacon's rebellion, and it partook of the spirit that prompted Patrick Henry and the people of Virginia, a hundred years later, to aspire to liberty and independence. For a period of nearly fifty years but little of interest occurred in the history of Virginia save the succession of governors. 1698. The seat of government was removed from Jamestown to Williamsburg in 1698. The reason assigned for the removal was that Williamsburg was healthier, and the situation more convenient. 1710. Alexander Spotswood became the Governor of Virginia in 1710, and with prudence governed the Colony for twelve years. He faithfully guarded the interests of the people of Virginia and, during his administration, inaugurated many new enterprises for their good. He was the first Postmaster-General for the Colonies and established many postoffices. Under his administration the mails were regularly carried from Williamsburg to Philadelphia. The one undertaking of this accomplished gentleman and officer that is especially interesting to the people of Western Virginia is the expedition undertaken by him, when, on the 1st day of August, 1716, he set out from Chelsea upon the famous expedition to the Blue Ridge mountains. The Virginia Colony of one hundred and five souls in 1607 had grown to nearly one hundred thousand. Twenty-four counties are to be found in the Colony, and the hardy pioneer was fast pushing his way to the base of the Blue Ridge mountains, but of the country beyond the Blue Ridge mountains nothing was known except the indefinite accounts of Indian traders. Governor Spotswood determined to explore this unknown region and, leaving the home of his son-in-law at Chelsea, in August, 1716, accompanied by a gay and gallant band, he began his journey through a dense wilderness inhabited by beasts of prey and the cruel savage, and after thirty-six days of incessant toil and fatigue, the Governor and his party, on September 5, 1716, reached the summit of one of the highest peaks of the Blue Ridge mountains, at Swift Run Gap, Augusta county, Virginia. What a spot! What an occasion! What have been the feelings experienced by these gallant knight when for the first time the beautiful Shenandoah was presented to their vision! The of the occasion must have been full compensation for all the toil and perseverance expended in the effort. Governor Spotswood, in commemoration of this expedition into the heart of the savage wilderness, presented each of the company with a small golden horse-shoe set with jewels, and this was the origin of the order, "Knights of the Golden Horse-Shoe." The inscription upon the golden horse-shoe was "Sic jurat transcendere montes." (Thus he swears to cross the mountains), and it is stated that these mementoes were given to all who would accept them, promising to comply with the terms of the inscription. Spotswood Crossing the Blue Ridge. Governor Spotswood and his company descended the western side of the mountain into the valley, and, finding a ford, they crossed the Shenandoah river and "took possession of the country for King George the First of England." They crossed the Shenandoah river on September 6th and called it the Euphrates. Thus the first passage of the Blue Ridge into the Valley of Virginia was made by Governor Spotswood at this time, but, as early as 1710, a company of adventurers found and went to the top of the highest mountain with their horses, but did not pass over it into the valley, by reason of the lateness of the season. Abraham Wood had visited the New River section in the year 1654. 1738. In the year 1738 the House of Burgesses of Virginia passed a bill for the formation of two countries west of the Blue Ridge mountains, and accordingly Orange county was divided and that part of Orange county west of the Blue Ridge mountains was formed into two counties, called Frederick and Augusta counties. Thus was opened to settlement a magnificent country of which Washington county is a part, and as the history of Washington county is inseparably connected with the early history of Augusta county, I will here take leave of the general history of Virginia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II Indians Living in Close Proximity to Southwest Virginia. The discovery of America by Columbus in 1492 can be attributed to the pious zeal of the Queen of Spain to extend the benefits of the religion of Rome to all mankind, and to the search for gold. It is a matter of history that the Queen of Spain, to enable Columbus to explore the western seas, sacrificed many of the jewels pertaining to her queenly estate. And the Queen of Spain was but one of many emissaries of the church, who, in their zeal, were ready to brave the unknown seas and to make any sacrifices to serve their master. With Columbus came a number of priests, and with every ship that sailed from the coast of Spain, France, Portugal and Italy, the missionaries of the cross were to be numbered among the passengers, bound for America, determined to explore the New World, hunt out the inhabitants thereof, and convert them to their master. Thus, within a few years after the discovery of America, priests were to be found in almost every part of the New World, exploring the country and teaching the Indians their blessed religion. The priesthood of Rome in those early days were educated, energetic, observing men, as they have ever been, and it is to this source that we must look for the earliest history of our country and of the Indian inhabitants for many years previous to the coming of the Anglo-Saxon race. These early visitors to this portion of America preserved a history of their times, and it is to be found in the archives of the governments of France, Spain and Portugal, and of the Church of Rome. This investigation will not permit any inquiry extending beyond the limits of that portion of Southwest Virginia included within the bounds of Washington county. In the year 1539 Hernando De Soto landed at Tampa, Florida, with orders from the Court of Spain to form a settlement on the seashore and to explore Florida to its westernmost limits. The Spanish government at that time contended that Florida included all that part of America extending from the Gulf of Mexico on the south to Virginia on the north, and from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific. Pursuant to his authority De Soto, at the head of a thousand men, exploring the country, traveled in a northerly direction to the home of the Appalaches, a tribe of Indians living on the banks of a river in Georgia called by the Indians Witchlacooche; thence, continuing in a northerly direction, they passed near the present site of Columbia, S. C., where they struck the Santee river, thence passing up the Saluda branch of the Santee, they came, for the first time, to a country uninhabited, and found it difficult to obtain food sufficient to sustain themselves, but sending out companies of men to search for Indians, after some time a party of men returned to camp accompanied by a few Indians, who, being questioned, informed De Soto that to the north of them there lived a powerful tribe of Indians on the Hogoheegee river (Tennessee river), to which place they traveled. This tribe of Indians was called, at that time, Cafitachique and was governed by a queen. The historian of this expedition, Louis Hernandez De Beidma, says: "We remained ten or twelve days in the Queen's village, and then set off to continue our explorations of the country." De Soto marched thence ten days in a northerly direction through a mountainous country where but little food was to be found until he reached a province called Xuala, which was thinly settled. He then ascended to the source of the Great river,* * The Indians always spoke of the Tennessee river as the Great river. which he supposed was the St. Esprit. This information was furnished by De Biedma to the King and council of the West Indies in 1544 and is now in existence and fully authenticated. To any one who will take the time and trouble to investigate this matter it will be evident that De Soto and his followers explored the country from Florida to the Queen's village, which must have been on the Tennessee river near the present site of Knoxville, Tennessee. Thence ascending the same to its sources they were, as early as 1540, beyond question, visitors to the territory now included within the boundaries of Washington county. The course pursued and the time required, it has been aptly said, confirm this opinion. But a small part of the account of this trip of exploration has been herein copied, but space will not permit much to be said. The reader must not conclude from what has been said that De Soto and his followers met with no resistance from the inhabitants of the country through which they passed, for this same account details the incidents connected with many desperate battles between the invaders and the invaded, and at no part of the journey did De Soto meet such magnificent specimens of mankind or find greater resistance than upon his arrival at the Queen's village on the Tennessee and in his progress thence to the sources of the Great river. De Biedma tells us that the inhabitants of Xuala were a hardy race, living in log houses daubed with clay and very comfortable in the winter season, but that during the summer months they usually reposed in the open air, spending much of their time in hunting. According to this same authority they used sharped-edged stones, slings, bows, arrows and clubs in war and peace. Many evidences of the instruments used by the Indians and the places of their manufacture are to be found in Southwest Virginia at this date. The inhabitants of Xuala lived, as did all the Indian inhabitants south of the Potomac and Ohio rivers, in towns, but the towns of the inhabitants of Xuala differed from those of most other tribes of Indians in this, that their towns generally were so built as to combine the requisites of a town and a fort. These forts were circular and varied in size from three hundred to six hundred and a thousand feet in diameter. They were sometimes built of stone, and in other instances of earth. The embankments were from six to ten feet high and in many cases surrounded by ditches of requisite width and depth. They were used as towns as well as forts. Many fragments of carved stone and earthenware are to be found near those old forts. The remnants of these forts or towns can be found in Southwest Virginia at this time. In Castle's Woods, Russell county, as well as on the farm of T. P. Hendricks and at other places in this county, the evidences of former Indian towns are clearly perceptible. A stone fort of great size formerly stood in Abb's Valley, Tazewell county, and what is spoken of as a remarkable fort is to be found on the farm formerly owned by a Mr. Crockett near Tazewell C. H., having evident traces of trenches and something like a drawbridge. An Indian town stood upon the Byars farm in the upper end of this county, and the Indian name thereof is preserved: "Kilmackronan." These forts and other evidences of Indian occupancy must be attributed to the men occupying Xuala at the time of the visit of De Soto in 1540, for they cannot be the product of the Cherokees. since an examination of the age of trees found growing on these forts is sufficient to show that they were there before the coming of the Cherokees, and, for this better reason, these forts were not built after the manner of the Cherokees. From a perusal of the preceding pages it is evident that the land of the Xualas of three hundred and sixty years ago was none other than Southwest Virginia and East Tennessee, and that it was peopled by a hardy, ingenious, war-like race. It is proper to state here that many historians repudiate the idea that De Soto visited Southwest Virginia in 1540, but it is the opinion of this writer that he did visit this section at that time, and this opinion is given after a careful perusal of all available authorities. We know nothing further of the people who inhabited Xuala, or Southwest Virginia in 1540. A tradition existed among the Cherokees that these people were driven from Southwest Virginia by the Cherokees some time in the ages preceding the coming of the white man, but no authentic information exists by which their exit can be noted. Captain Henry Batte with a company of rangers, by direction of Governor Berkley, crossed the Blue Ridge mountains at Wood's Gap now in Floyd county, in 1671 and came near to the habitations of a tribe of Indians living on a river flowing westward, said by the Indian guides to be the makers and venders of salt to the other Indian tribes, and resembling, in many particulars, the inhabitants of Xuala as described by De Biedma, and it is more than probable that the early inhabitants of Southwest Virginia were not driven from their homes until after 1671. As far as I can ascertain, the Indian inhabitants of Southwest Virginia have been Xualans, Cherokees and Shawnese. Some time between the years 1671 and 1685 the Xualans were driven from Southwest Virginia by the Cherokee tribe of Indians, and this tribe is closely identified with the settlement of Southwest Virginia. Adair, an early writer, says that this tribe of Indians derive their name from Chee-ra "fire," which is their reputed lower heaven. The origin of this tribe is not known, but a tradition existed among them that when they crossed the Alleghanies they found a part of the Creek Nation inhabitating this country, and it may be that the Creek Indians were the inhabitants of ancient Xuala. The Cherokees were the mountaineers of aboriginal America; they loved their homes, were brave to a fault, and were never happy except when engaged in war. This nation and many of their villages will be frequently mentioned in connection with the early exploration and settlement of Southwest Virginia, for many times did our ancestors suffer from their vigor and enterprise. This tribe of Indians gave names to most of the rivers in Southwest Virginia, and it may be proper to here detail the aboriginal names of the rivers of Southwest Virginia. The Holston river from its source to the junction of the French Broad, was called the Hogoheegee, and from thence to the mouth of the Little Tennessee river it was known as the Cootcla. The early maps of this section of America made by the French explorers gave to the Holston river the name of the Cherokee river; to the Clinch they gave the name of Shawanon, and to the same river the English gave the name of Shawanoa, and the Indian name for the Clinch river was Pellissippi. The Cherokees were not long permitted to enjoy the fruits of their conquest, for as early as 1672 the confederacy of the Six Nations conquered the Illinois and Shawnese Indians, the latter tribe being a part of the Six Nations. In 1685 they added to their conquests the Miamis and carried their victorious arms to the Mississippi and south as far as Georgia, a vast territory twelve hundred miles in length and six hundred miles in breadth, and, in doing so, destroyed whole nations of Indians of whom no record was found by the English. The Cherokees were driven south of the Tennessee, and settled upon the Savannah and in the territory south of the Tennessee, and there made their homes until moved by the Anglo-Saxon settlers about one hundred years thereafter. Thus the vast extent of territory lying south and east of the Ohio river and including Southwest Virginia was conquered, but not occupied, by the confederacy of the Six Nations, and its inhabitants were driven into other countries. It thus became a vast wilderness, never thereafter to be occupied until the coming of the white man, except by roving bands of Indians while hunting, or in passing from their habitations in the south to the Indian towns and villages in Ohio. This vast park was filled with the finest game in great quantities, and, for more than one hundred years previous to its settlement by the Anglo-Saxon, it was jointly used, as if by common consent, as a hunting ground by the Cherokees, Shawnese and Six Nations, but the Cherokees were compelled to admit the superior title of the Six Nations to the sovereignty of the soil, which they did by frequent gifts of game killed within the territory. Some writers, in explanation of the absence of the Indians from this section of America at the time of the early explorations of the white man, give the following as a tradition of the Cherokees and Shawnese: "that in so favored a land, where man's natural wants are so fully satisfied, there could be no community of peace and happiness, that with such ease to the body and disquiet to the soul the councils of man must always overflow with the vanities of argument and the pride of innate egotism; so the tradition was, that once of old there was a delegated assemblage of the chiefs of the Indian tribes for a conference with the Great Spirit, at which conference the Great Spirit detailed certain great calamities that had befallen them in the paradise of Hogoheegee, which were traceable to the causes named above, and thereupon the Great Spirit ordered all their nations to remove beyond certain boundaries, out of this Eden, which the Great Spirit informed them was too easy of life for their content and happiness and their future security." Thereupon this vast empire was consigned to the peaceful dominion of nature, and all the lands upon the waters from the Holston to the headwaters of the Kentucky and Cumberland rivers were without permanent inhabitants. The first cause above assigned was the true cause of the uninhabited condition of Southwest Virginia, the enmity between the Cherokees and Shawnese. This enmity was such as to deter both tribes from any considerable aggressions on this territory, the middle ground between the nations. Many battles were fought between these two nations, and, even so late as the summer of 1768, a desperate battle was fought between the Cherokees and Shawnese near Rich Mountain,* * Bickley's History of Tazewell County. in Tazewell county, Virginia. Early in the summer of 1768 about two hundred Cherokee Indians camped near a lick in that part of Southwest Virginia to spend the summer in hunting. They were soon disturbed by the appearance of several hundred Shawnese Indians, their deadly enemies. The Shawnese chief immediately sent orders to the Cherokees to leave the lick and the hunting grounds, but his messenger was sent back with a defiant answer by the Cherokees and both parties began to prepare for battle. The Cherokees retired to the top of Rich Montain and there threw up, before night, a breastwork consisting of an embankment running along the top of the mountain about eighty yards and then turning off down the mountain side, the embankment being three or four feet high and running east and west. The battle was opened the evening of the first day, but after some fighting the Shawnese withdrew and made preparations to begin the attack the following morning. It is said that long before day the fiendish yells of the warriors might be heard echoing over the rugged cliffs and deep valleys of the surrounding country. Day came, and for the space of half an hour, a deathlike stillness reigned on the mountain top and side. With the first rays of the rising sun a shout ascended the skies as if all the wild animals in the woods had broken forth in all their most terrifying notes. The sharp crack of rifles and the ringing of tomahawks against each other, the screams of women and children and the groans of the dying now filled the air around. Both parties were well armed and the contest was nearly equal, the Shawnese having most men, while the Cherokees had the advantage of their breastworks. Through the entire day the battle raged, and when night closed in, both parties built fires and camped on the ground. During the night the Cherokees sent to two white men then in the vicinity for powder and lead, which they furnished. When the sun rose the next morning the battle was renewed with the same spirit in which it had been fought on the previous day. In a few hours, however, the Shawnese were compelled to retire. The loss on both sides was great. A large pit was dug and a common grave received those who had fallen in this the last battle fought between the red men in this section of America. The battle-ground, breastwork and great grave are still to be seen. At the time of the earlier explorations of Southwest Virginia the nearest permanent Indian settlements were to be found south of the Tennessee river. Many vestiges of an earlier and numerous population were found in Southwest Virginia and, in many instances, are still to be seen, indicating a state of civilization far in advance of that found among the Indians of that day. The first hunters and explorers in their many expeditions throughout all this vast territory never found a single wigwam or Indian village. It was nothing more than the common hunting ground of the Cherokees and Shawnese. Along the valley of what is known as Southwest Virginia lay the usual route of travel between the Southern and Northern Indians, whether engaged in peaceful intercourse or warlike expeditions, and by this same path they traveled when on the chase or their migrations. Several considerations prompted the Indians to adopt this course in their travelings, viz.: such as the ease with which the mountains could be crossed, the abundance of game, the absence of swamps and large streams of impassable water and the absence of hostile inhabitants, and these same considerations led to the early settlement of this section and the adoption of this route of travel by the early Scotch, Irish and English settlers of Kentucky and Tennessee. One of these routes or Indian trails was nearly on the present McAdam road passing Roanoke, Va., thence to New River near Inglis' Ferry, thence, following the same McAdam road, to Seven Mile Ford, thence to the left of the present main road and following near to the present location of the same by Abingdon until it strikes the North Fork of Holston river a few miles above the Long Island of Holston river, crossing the same at the old ford of the North Fork and on into Tennessee until it connected with the great warpath of the Creeks. Near Wolf Hills, now Abingdon, another route or trail came in from the northwest. This trail from the northwest pursued nearly the route traveled by the early settlers to Kentucky, crossing the mountains at Cumberland Gap. A more minute description of this trail will be given in another and more appropriate place in this book. This trail crossed the first above described Indian trail at a point on West Main street where the Russell road leaves Main street. The statement has been often made that an Indian trail followed the northwest bank of the North Fork of Holston river through this county, but I am not satisfied that such was a fact. Bickley, in his history of Tazewell county, says the principal Indian trails through Tazewell county led through the Clinch Valley, but after the whites began to settle, these Indian trails all led from the Ohio river. One of these trails led up the Indian Ridge (now on the boundary between Virginia and West Virginia) till opposite the Trace Fork of Tug river; it then crossed over to that branch and, keeping into the lowest gap of the hills, led into Abb's Valley. Another trail, afterwards much used by the whites, left the Indian Ridge and struck Tug river at the mouth of Clear Fork creek, thence up that creek till it fell over on a branch emptying into the Dry Fork of Tug river. It then followed that stream to its head and passed through Roark's Gap, near Maxwell's, in Tazewell county. Another trail came up the Louisa Fork of Sandy river, leading into the settlements on Clinch river, now in Russell and Tazewell counties. It is worthy of notice that these trails always crossed the mountains and ridges at the lowest gaps to be found, and frequently, built in these gaps, are to be found monuments of rock piled up oftentimes to considerable height. Several of these monuments may be seen in this county, in Little Moccasin Gap, on the Byars farm on Middle Fork, on the Mahaffey farm on South Fork, and another in Roark's Gap, in Tazewell county. Ramsey, in his Annals of Tennessee, states that the first described Indian trail after leaving Seven Mile Ford bore to the left and followed the Middle and South Forks of Holston river until it crossed the North Fork of Holston river at the Old Ford above Long Island in Tennessee. In making this statement the historian may be correct, and some evidences yet remain that might be given to sustain this statement, notably a small Indian mound and the vestiges of an old Indian village (Kilmackronan), on the north and south sides of the Middle Fork of Holston river, where the same passes through the farm formerly owned by Captain James Byars near Glade Spring, and a small Indian mound on the farm formerly owned by J. G. Mahaffey about six miles southeast of Abingdon. But we cannot admit this statement to be correct, because the route as described is inconsistent with the habits of the Indians, besides, it does not conform to the course pursued by the early settlers of this section of Virginia. The Indian in traveling (almost without a single exception, as far as I can ascertain) followed that course of travel which would, as far as possible, avoid the crossing of water, and of course he followed the highlands near the headwaters of the creeks and rivers. It is evident to every man conversant with the topography of this county that he would have passed through this county near Glade Spring, Meadow View and Abingdon. It is generally accepted as true that the early hunters and explorers in this, as well as other sections of Virginia and the United States, followed, almost without a single deviation, the trails made and used by the Indians. And to this cause may be attributed the fact that many of the public roads of this section when first established were located over the steepest hills and ridges to be found in our country. In other words, the Indian made his trail over the hills to avoid the waters; the white man adopted the Indian trail as his road because it was already open, and possibly, to some extent, for the same reason as the Indian, to avoid crossing water. We know that the early hunters and settlers traveling through and settling in this section, after leaving Seven Mile Ford passed through the Byars farm near Glade Spring, thence near Meadow View and through the location of Abingdon of the present day, and into Tennessee. Another statement made by Ramsey as to this same Indian trail is frequently challenged, and for very good reason. Ramsey states that this Indian trail crossed the North Fork of Holston river above Long Island as above stated, while from all present indications this trail crossed the South Fork of Holston river at Long Island. At least evidences of an Indian trail and ford are to be seen near Long Island at this time, and it is not reasonable to believe that the Indians would cross the North Fork of the Holston river and then the Holston river proper to reach his towns and home, when he could cross the South Fork of Holston once and reach his home. While Southwest Virginia and East Tennessee were unoccupied by the Indians at the time of the early settlements, still it may not be amiss to give briefly a description of the Indian tribes that preceded our forefathers and afterwards gave them so much trouble in their first undertakings. As to the remote Indian inhabitants of this section of the American Continent, nothing authentic is known beyond the evidences of their occupancy to be gathered from tumuli scattered throughout the country and the remains found in close proximity thereto. These remains indicate the existence, at some distant time, of a dense population, civilized to a great extent, and it is not improbable that at a time in the past all this section was the seat of a civilization that would have compared favorably with that of Greece and Rome. The Cherokee Indians knew nothing further of these vestiges than that their forefathers found them here, and they considered them the evidences of a numerous population far advanced in civilization. The modern Indian held in great veneration these evidences of an extinct tribe, and never used them save for religious purposes. The piles of stones often found scattered throughout the country, generally to be found in the gaps of the mountains and ridges, are believed to be the work of modern Indians. The modern Indian was of an exceedingly superstitious turn, as all barbarians or heathen nations have been. It has been for all time not uncommon to find, in heathen countries, similar heaps of stone erected by the inhabitants at some particular spot, as an offering to an evil spirit, who, according to their superstitions, would afflict or bless the passer-by. A pile of stone, such as indicated, may be seen near the main turnpike road as it passes through Little Moccasin Gap. The Indian tribes that molested the early settlers in this section were the Cherokees and the Shawnese. Adair, an early Indian trader, and later historian, in describing the Indian and his passion for revenge, says: "I have known them to go a thousand miles for the purpose of revenge, in pathless woods, over hills and mountains, through large cane swamps full of grape-vines and briars, over broad lakes, rapid rivers and deep creeks and all the way endangered by poisonous snakes, if not by the rambling and lurking enemy, while, at the same time, they were exposed to the extremities of the heat and cold, the vicissitudes of the season, to hunger and thirst, both by chance and their religiously scanty method of living when at war, to fatigue and other difficulties. Such is their revengeful temper that all these things they contemn as imaginary trifles, if they are so happy as to get the scalp of their enemy." And this record is preserved by a man who spoke from his experience with the Cherokee Indians, the one tribe that gave the early settlers of this section more trouble than all the Indian tribes combined. CHEROKEES. The Cherokee tribe of Indians, at the time of the settlement of Southwest Virginia, inhabited one of the most attractive sections of the American Continent, occupying the banks of the Catawba, Savannah, Yadkin and Tennessee rivers on the east and south and several of the feeders of the Tennessee on the west. There were no fortresses to be found among them. Their settlements were rude huts scattered irregularly along some water way convenient to good pasture land and hunting and fishing grounds. They usually had small clearings which were cultivated by the women and children in Indian corn and beans. But little of the history of the Cherokees can be gathered from their traditions. The existence of this tribe of Indians was noted by the historian of the expedition of De Soto when traveling in the South, and it is said that they came originally from east of the Alleghany mountains. Their principal town or capital city was Choto, located about five miles from the ruins of Fort Loudon, in Tennessee. They were the mountain people of America and loved their homes and their liberties. They frequently aided the early settlers of this portion of America in their wars with the French and English, a company of Indians from this tribe having participated in the siege of Fort Du Quesne under Captain Pearis, but much oftener did they carry death into the homes of the early settlers of the Carolinas and Virginia. This tribe, previous to 1769, were numerous and exceedingly quarrelsome and arrogant. At this time they quarreled with the Chickasaw Indians and undertook an invasion of their country, but were overwhelmed by the Chickasaws after a great battle at the Chickasaw old fields. This overwhelming defeat occurred at the same time that Arthur Campbell, William Edmiston, and many other hardy pioneers first pitched their tents on the waters of the Holston and Clinch, and there can be no doubt that this occurrence contributed much to the rapid settlement of this section of Virginia. For thirty years following the advent of the first settlers into this country the Cherokees killed and scalped the inhabitants at every opportunity. The population of this tribe in 1735 was considerable. Adair says that they had sixty-four populous towns, and their fighting men numbered above six thousand. In the year 1776 the number of warriors pertaining to this tribe was two thousand four hundred and ninety-one. This tribe of Indians now occupy a part of the Indian Territory. It will be remembered that the Cherokees used principally the valleys of the Holston in their hunting expeditions and seldom visited the valleys of the Clinch. SHAWNESE. But little can be said of this Indian tribe save that it was known as a wandering nation. At times in their history they occupied territory in almost all sections of the country east of the Mississippi river and south of the Lakes, but at the time when this tribe gave trouble to our ancestors their homes were on the Wabash and Miami rivers, where they built many villages. Their principal town, called "Piquo," was the birthplace of the great Tecumseh. This tribe had a tradition respecting their origin. They believed their fathers crossed the ocean from the East under the guidance of a leader of the Turtle tribe, one of their original subdivisions, and that they walked into the sea, the waters of which parted, and thus passed over on the bottom to this land. This tribe of Indians were responsible for many of the murders and outrages suffered by the early settlers on the Clinch and many times on the Holston, the Indians coming by the trails through Cumberland Gap and the trails coming into Tazewell county previously described. The population of this tribe in 1735 did not, according to Adair, exceed four hundred and fifty souls. This tribe of Indians assisted the British in the wars of 1776 and 1812, and in the latter struggle did effective service for their British allies. In 1817 they ceded their lands in Ohio to the United States and were soon confined to a small reservation west of the Mississippi river.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III Early Explorations of Southwest Virginia by the White Man. From the time of the first settlement at Jamestown in 1607, the English Colony had grown rapidly and had expanded until their western borders were in view of the Blue Ridge. With the usual vigor and enterprise of the Anglo-Saxon, we find, in the year 1641, a number of the citizens of Virginia petitioning the House of Burgesses for permission to undertake the discovery of a new river of land west and southerly from the Appomattox, and, in March, 1642, we find the House of Burgesses passing an act granting such permission. The act is as follows: "Forasmuch as Walker Austin, Rice Hoe, Joseph Johnson and Walter Chiles, for themselves and such others as they shall think fitt to joyn with them, did petition in the Assembly in June 1641 for leave and encouragement to undertake the discovery of a new river of unknowne land bearing west southerly from Appomattake river, Be it enacted and confirmed, that they and every one of them and whom they shall admit shall enjoy and possess to them, their heirs, executors, administrators or assigns all profit whatsoever they in their particular adventure can make unto themselves by such discovery aforesaid, for fourteen years after the date of the said month of January, 1641, provided there be reserved and paid into his Majesty's use by them that shall be appointed to receive them, the fifth part of Royal Mines whatsoever; provided also, that if they shall think fit to employ more than two or three men in the said discovery they shall then do it by commission from the Governor of the Councill."* * 1 Hen. Stat., p. 262. It is well to preserve this the earliest known evidence of the desire of any man to hunt out the very country we now occupy. The names of a portion of these first daring spirits, Austin, Johnson and Chiles, afterwards became familiar to our own country, and while no evidence is at hand to establish the fact, yet it is more than probable that these men by their efforts made possible the future success of Walker, Draper, Inglis, Wood, and others. The record of the next effort to reach this portion of the wilderness by the enterprising citizens of Eastern Virginia is to be found in an act of the House of Burgesses of Virginia passed in July, 1653, more than a hundred years before a permanent settlement was effected on the waters of the Clinch or Holston rivers. The Act is as follows. Passed July, 1653: "Whereas, an act was made in the Assembly, 1642, for encouragement of discoveries to the westward and southward of this country, granting them all profits arising thereby for fourteen years, which act is since discontinued and made void, it is by this Assembly ordered that Colonel William Clayborne, Esq., and Captain Henry Fleet, they and their associates with them, either jointly or severally, may discover, and shall enjoy such benefits, profits and trades for fourteen years as they shall find out in places where no English ever have been and discovered, nor have had particular trade, and to take up such lands by patents proving their rights as they shall think good: nevertheless, not excluding others after their choice from taking up land and planting in these new discovered places, as in Virginia now versed. The like order is granted to Major Abram Wood and his associates." The three gentlemen, William Clayborne, Henry Fleet and Abraham Wood, mentioned in this act, each represented a shire in the Virginia House of Burgesses, and were intent, no doubt, upon the acquisition of wealth and the development of the country. We have no information that leads us to believe that any of the persons named in the preceding act, with the exception of Colonel Abraham Wood, at any time made an effort to accomplish the purpose of that act. Dr. Hale, in his book entitled "Trans-Alleghany Pioneers," makes the following statement: "The New river was first discovered and named in 1654 by Colonel Abraham Wood, who dwelt at the falls of the Appomattox, now the site of Petersburg, Va." Being of an adventurous and speculative turn, he got from the Governor of Virginia a concession to explore the country and open up trade with the Indians to the west. There is no record as to the particular route he took, but as the line of adventure, exploration and discovery was then all east of the mountains, it is probable that he first struck the river not far from the Blue Ridge and near the present Virginia and North Carolina lines." I do not know from what source Dr. Hale obtained this information, and I give it for what it is worth. It is reasonable to believe that Colonel Wood made this trip, and, to support this view, three circumstances may be mentioned. First. The House of Burgesses of Virginia had authorized Colonel Wood, along with others, in July of the preceding year, to discover a new river of unknown land where no English had ever been or discovered. Secondly. A gap in the Blue Ridge, lying between the headwaters of Smith river, a branch of the Dan, in Patrick county, and of Little river, a branch of New river, in Floyd county, is to this day called Wood's Gap. Thirdly. The present New river was known at first as Wood's river. It is known that at the time Thomas Batts and a company of men acting under the authority of Colonel Wood visited this section in the year 1671, Wood's Gap and New river had been previously visited and named by Colonel Wood. In the year 1671, Thomas Batts and several other persons traveled from the falls of the Appomattox, the present site of Petersburg, Va., acting under a commission from Governor Berkley, to explore the country west of the Blue Ridge mountains and the South Sea. It is worthy of notice that at the time this expedition was undertaken it was believed that the waters flowing westward beyond the Appalachian mountains emptied into the South Sea. This was the first effort made to explore the country west of the Blue Ridge, of which any record has been preserved. A journal of this expedition was made by Thomas Batts, one of the company. The first entry in this journal is as follows: "A commission being granted the Hon. Maj. Gen. Wood for ye finding out of the ebbing and flowing of ye waters behind the mountains in order to the discovery of the South Sea: Thomas Batts, Thomas Wood, Robert Fallen, accompanied by Perachute, a great man of the Appomattox Indians, and Jack Nesan, formerly servant to Majr. Genl. Wood, with five horses, set forward from Appomattox town in Va., and about eight of the clock in the morning being Fryday Septr. 1st. 1671, and traveling about forty miles, took up their quarters and found they had traveled from Okenechee path due west: They traveled for twenty-five days, a part of the time through that portion of Virginia, near the present line between this State and North Carolina, but when they reached the foot of the Alleghany Mountains where the same merges into the Blue Ridge, now in Floyd Co. Va., they turned to the north west at a low place in the said mountain known as Wood's Gap; and after some time they came to a river which Genl. Wood had named Wood's River.* * Now New River. This river for many years thereafter was known as Wood's River, and many of the early patents in that section of the country describe the lands as located upon Wood's River." The entry in this diary of date the 16th of Sept. says: "About ten of the clock we set forward and, after we had traveled about ten miles, one of the Indians killed a deer; presently after they had a sight of a curious river like the Thames agt. Chilcey (Chelsea), which having a fall yt made a great noise, whose course was N. and so as they supposed, ran W. about certain pleasant mountains which they saw to the westward. At this point they took up their quarters, their course having been W. by N. At this point they found Indian fields with cornstalks in them. They marked the trees with the initials of the company, using branding irons, and made proclamation in these words: `Long live King Charles ye 2nd. king of England, France, Scotland, Ireland and Virginia and all the terrytories thereunto belonging, defender of the faith.' "When they came to ye river-side they found it better and broader than they expected, fully as broad as the Thames over agt, Maping, ye falls much like the falls of the James River in Va., and imagined by the water marks it flowed there about three feet. It was then ebbing water. They set up a stick by the water, but found it ebbed very slowly." At this point their Indian guides stopped, and refused to go any farther, saying that there dwelt near this place a numerous and powerful tribe of Indians that made salt and sold it to the other tribes, and that no one who entered into their towns had ever been able to escape. Thereupon the trip was abandoned and they started on their return to their homes without having accomplished the object of the exploration, to-wit: the finding of the South Sea. But the journal adds that when they were on the top of the hill they took a prospect as far as they could see and saw westwardly over certain delightful hills a fog arise, and a glimmering light as from water, and supposed they might be from some great bog. Many writers suppose that this exploring party, after reaching the New river, descended the same to the falls of the Kanawha, but it is more than probable that after they reached the river they ascended the same, and the stopping point mentioned in the diary was in Southwest Virginia, and near where the New river first enters Virginia. Upon the return of this company to their homes Governor Berkley was very much interested in their report, but strange as it may seem to the reader, no further attempts were made by authority of the Government of Virginia for forty years to explore the country west of the mountains. It will be seen from the journal of Thomas Batts that he and his associates, and, beyond a doubt, Colonel Abraham Wood anticipated, by more than half a century, Governor Spotswood and his Knights of the Golden Horse-Shoe, in the exploration and discovery of the country west of the Blue Ridge mountains. The next effort made to explore the region west of the mountains, of which we have any account, occurred in 1716, forty-five years after the journey made by Thomas Batts, above described, and sixty years subsequent to the visit of Colonel Abraham Wood. In the month of August, 1716, Governor Alexander Spotswood, with several members of his staff, left Williamsburg by coach and proceeded to Germania, where he left his coach and proceeded on horseback. At Germania this party was supplemented by a number of gentlemen, their retainers, a company of rangers, and four Meherrin Indians—about fifty persons in all. They journeyed by way of the upper Rappahannock, and on the thirty-sixth day out, being September 5, 1716, they scaled the Blue Ridge at Swift Run Gap, now in Augusta county. John Fontaine, a member of this company, has left a journal of this expedition, and therein thus describes what occurred when they reached the summit of the Blue Ridge: "We drank King George's health and all the royal family's at the very top of the Appalachian mountains." The company then descended the western side of the mountain, and, reaching the Shenandoah river, they encamped upon its banks. Fontaine thus preserves an account of what occurred: "The Governor had graving irons, but could not grave anything, the stones were so hard. I graved my name on a tree by the riverside, and the Governor burried a bottle with a paper enclosed on which he writ that he took possession of this place in the name and for King Geo. 1st. of England. We had a good dinner, and after it we got the men together, and loaded all their arms, and we drank the King's health in champaign and fired a volley, the Princess's health in Burgundy and fired a volley, and in claret and fired a volley. We drank the Governor's health and fired another volley. We had several sorts of liquers, viz. Virginia Red Wine and White Wine, Esquebaugh, brandy, shrub, rum, champaign, cavory, punch water, cider, etc. "We called the highest mountain Mount George and the one we crossed over Mount Spotswood." Governor Spotswood, from the fertility of the soil, gave the name of Euphrates to the river (now Shenandoah), and he believed the same emptied into the great lakes and flowed northward. The Governor, upon his return to Williamsburg, instituted the Order of the Golden-Shoe, and presented to each of the gentlemen accompanying him a small horse-shoe made of gold inscribed with the motto: Sic jurat transcendere montes, "Thus he swears to cross the mountains." Governor Spotswood, in a letter written in 1716, says: "The chief aim of my expedition over the great mountains in 1716 was to satisfy myself whether it was practicable to come to the lakes." The country thus described was a part of Sussex county, the western boundary of which was undefined. Spotsylvania was formed from Sussex in 1720, Orange from Spotsylvania in 1734, all of said counties including the territory now within the bounds of this county. All this information is necessary to a history of Washington county, because Washington county was formed from the territory we are now dealing with, and, for the better reason, that the promoters of our early settlements and the founders of our early government came from the Valley of Virginia. In the year 1726, two men named Mackey and Sallings explored the Valley of Virginia. John Peter Sallings, one of the two explorers of the valley above mentioned, was captured by the Indians and passed through this immediate section as early as 1726. Withers, in his history entitled "Border Warfare," thus describes the captivity of Sallings: "Sallings," he says, "was taken to the country now known as Tennessee, where he remained for some years. In company with a party of Cherokees, he went on a hunting expedition to the salt licks of Kentucky and was there captured by a band of Illinois Indians, with whom the Cherokees were at war. He was taken to Kaskaskia, and adopted into the family of a squaw, whose son had been killed. While with these Indians he several times accompanied them down the Mississippi river, below the mouth of the Arkansas, and once to the Gulf of Mexico. The Spaniards in Louisiana, desiring an interpreter, purchased him of his Indian mother, and some of them took him to Canada. He was there redeemed by the French Governor of that province, who sent him to the Dutch settlement in New York, whence he made his way home after an absence of six years. The earliest visit to this section of Virginia by an Anglo-Saxon of which we have any record or knowledge was made by Dority, a citizen of Eastern Virginia, who in the year 1690 visited the Cherokee Indians in their home, south of the Little Tennessee, and traded with them. There can be no reasonable doubt that from a very early period, long preceding the making of a permanent settlement by the white man in this section, many of the citizens of Virginia living east of the mountains carried on, in many instances, an active trade with the Indians living south of the Little Tennessee and in Kentucky. This section was uninhabitated by the Indians for many years previous to the explorations of the white man, and the wilderness was full of game of almost all kinds. Their flesh was valuable, and the skins and furs taken in one season by a single hunter would bring many hundreds of dollars, and thus many daring hunters were induced to visit this section long before any white man thought of settling the lands. In confirmation of this idea Mr. Vaughan, of Amelia county, Va., who died in the year 1801, was employed about the year 1740 to go as a packman with a number of Indian traders to the Cherokee nation. The last hunter's cabin he saw as he traveled from Amelia county, Va., to East Tennessee was on Otter river, a branch of Staunton river, now in Bedford county. The route he traveled was an old trading path following closely the location of the Buckingham road to a point where it strikes the Stage Road in Botetourt county; thence nearly upon the ground which the Stage Road occupies, crossing New River at Inglis' Ferry; thence to Seven Mile Ford on the Holston; thence to the left of the road which formed the old Stage Road; thence on to the North Fork of Holston, above Long Island in Tennessee, crossing it where the Stage Road formerly crossed it, and on into the heart of Tennessee. This hunter's trail, or Indian trace, was an old path when he first saw it, and he continued to travel the same until 1754, trading with the Indians. In the year 1730, John and Isaac Van Meter obtained from Governor Gooch, of Virginia, a patent for forty thousand acres of land to be located in the lower valley, and this warrant was sold in 1731 to Joist Hite, of Pennsylvania, who, in 1732, brought his family and sixteen other families and located a few miles south of the present site of Winchester, Va., and this is generally believed to be the first settlement by a white man west of the Blue Ridge. Emigration to this new land was rapid, and soon reached beyond the confines of Hite's possessions. About the time of the Hite settlement John Lewis, Peter Sallings and — Mackey made settlements in the valley. Lewis settled on Lewis' creek near the present site of Staunton, Sallings, at the forks of James river and Mackey, at Buffalo Gap. Within less than one year the population of the country near the settlement made by Lewis was considerable, so rapid was the migration to the new land. The early settlers in this portion of Virginia had to contend with titles obtained by individuals and companies for large tracts of land, and such grantees were usually favorites of the King or of the King's councillors. On the 6th of September, 1736, William Gooch, Lieutenant-Governor of Virginia, issued a patent for the "Manor of Beverly," covering one hundred and eighteen thousand and ninety-one acres of land lying in the county of Orange between the great mountains and on the River Sherando, and on September 7, 1736, William Beverly, of Essex, became the owner of the entire grant. This patent covered most of the fine lands in the Valley of Virginia near Staunton and Waynesboro, and soon thereafter Governor Gooch granted Benjamin Borden five hundred thousand acres of land situated south of Beverly Manor and on the waters of the James and Shenandoah rivers. Each of the grants above described was to become absolute, provided the patentees succeeded in settling a given number of families thereon in the time named in the grant, and as a result the patentees, Hite, Beverly and Borden, solicited and obtained settlers from America and Europe. Benjamin Borden, upon the receipt of his grant, immediately visited England, and in 1737 returned with a hundred families, among whom were the McDowells, Crawfords, McClures, Alexanders, Walkers, Moores, Matthews and many others, the founders of many of Virginia's distinguished families. In 1738, the counties of Frederick and Augusta were formed out of Orange. The territories embraced within these two counties included all of Virginia west of the Blue Ridge and was, almost without exception, a howling wilderness occupied by the Indians and wild beasts. It is evident from the statement contained in the act establishing Augusta county that there had been a rapid and considerable increase of the population in the valley. The act establishing the county of Augusta provided that the organization of the county should take place when the Governor and Council should think there was a sufficient number of inhabitants for appointing justices of the peace and other officers and creating courts therein. While the act establishing Augusta county was passed in 1738, the county was not organized until 1745. The first court assembled at Staunton on December 9, 1745, at which time the following magistrates were sworn in, having been previously commissioned by the Governor of Virginia—viz.: James Patton, John Buchanan, George Robinson, James Bell, Robert Campbell, John Lewis, John Brown, Peter Scholl, Robert Poage, John Findley, Richard Woods, John Christian, Robert Craven, John Pickens, Andrew Pickens, Thomas Lewis, Hugh Thompson, John Anderson, Robert Cunningham, James Kerr and Adam Dickenson. James Patton was commissioned high sheriff, John Madison, clerk, and Thomas Lewis, surveyor of the county. It is worthy of note that James Patton, the first sheriff of Augusta county, was the first man to survey and locate lands within the boundaries of Washington county as originally formed, and the land by him acquired composed a considerable part of the best lands within this county. The idea of offering the dissenters from the Church of England inducements to settle the lands west of the mountains had often been suggested and earnestly advocated by many of the prominent men in the Virginia Colony, but no move in that direction was taken until about the time of the first settlement of the lower Valley, at and after which time the Governor and Council of Virginia, with but little hesitancy, permitted the erection of dissenting churches in the Valley, and encouraged the immigration of settlers whenever possible. The result of this action was a flood of settlers, emigrants from Scotland and Ireland, who came by way of Pennsylvania, mostly Scotch-Irish Presbyterians in belief. They passed into and settled in the Valley, and in a few years the Valley from Harper's Ferry to New river was populated with a progressive, liberty-loving people second to none on earth. Colonel James Patton, who came from the north of Ireland in 1736, was one of the first and most influential settlers of the Valley of Virginia. In the year 1745, he secured a grant from the Governor and Council of Virginia, for one hundred and twenty thousand acres of land west of the Blue Ridge, and he and his son-in-law, John Buchanan, who was also deputy surveyor of Augusta county, located lands on the James river, and founded and named Buchanan and Pattonsburg, villages that were built on the opposite sides of the James river, now in Botetourt county. In the year 1748, Dr. Thomas Walker, who afterwards, on the 29th day of September, 1752, qualified as a deputy surveyor of Augusta county; Colonel James Patton, Colonel John Buchanan, Colonel James Wood and Major Charles Campbell, accompanied by a number of hunters, John Findlay being of the number, explored Southwest Virginia and East Tennessee, and located and surveyed a number of very valuable tracts of land by authority of the grant to Colonel James Patton. We give below a list of the first surveys made on the waters of the Holston and Clinch rivers. This information is derived from the surveyor's records of Augusta county at Staunton, Va. Each of the above surveys is signed by Thomas Lewis, surveyor of Augusta county, and in the left-hand corner of the plot, recorded with each survey, are written the letters J. B., the initials of John Buchanan, deputy surveyor of the county. It is evident from this record that John Buchanan surveyed the several tracts of land first located in Washington county, and that he was on the waters of the Indian or Holston river surveying as early as the 14th day of March, 1746. It will be observed from an inspection of this list of surveys that on April 2, 1750, there was surveyed for Edmund Pendleton 3,000 acres of land lying on West creek, a branch of the South Fork of Indian river, which tract of land now lies in Sullivan county, Tennessee. This tract was patented to Edmund Pendleton in 1756 upon the idea that the Virginia line, when run, would embrace these lands. It is worthy of note that these early explorers and the many hunters and traders who had previously visited this section called the Holston river the Indian river, while the Indians gave it the name of Hogoheegee, and the French gave it the name of the Cherokee river. All of the lands surveyed in this county previously to 1748 are described in the surveys as being on the waters of the Indian river. These explorers returned to their homes delighted, no doubt, with the excellent lands they had visited, but nothing resulted from their efforts save the acquisition of a knowledge of the country. At the time Dr. Walker and his associates made their trip of exploration above described they were followed as far as New river by Thomas Inglis and his three sons, Mrs. Draper and her son and daughter, Adam Harman, Henry Leonard and James Burke, pioneers in search of a home in the wilderness. Lands were surveyed for each of them, which lands are described in the respective surveys as lying on Wood's river, or the waters of Wood's river. Here Date. Name. Location. Local Name. Acres.

The name given to this new settlement was "Draper's Meadows." The surveys, with accompanying plats for these, the first settlers on any of the waters flowing into the Mississippi, are exceedingly interesting and instructive. These first settlers were immediately followed by a large number of other persons. The Alleghany mountains having been crossed and the waters flowing into the Mississippi reached, the pioneer rapidly sought to bring the wilderness under his dominion. The first company of settlers at Draper's Meadows were at once increased by new arrivals, and numerous tracts of land west of New river and near what were afterwards known as the Lead Mines occupied. Among the early settlers in that section of Southwest Virginia were the Crocketts, Sayers, Cloyds, McGavocks and McCalls. James Burke, with his family, settled in 1753 in what has since been known as Burk's Garden, and Charles Sinclair in Sinclair's Bottom. Stephen Holston built his cabin within thirty feet of the head spring of the Middle Fork of Indian, since called Holston river, some time previous to 1748, and thus Burke, Sinclair and Holston gave names to the localities of their early settlements. A colony of people called "Dunkards" settled on the west side of New river near Inglis' Ferry, and in the year 1750 Samuel Stalnaker, with the assistance of Dr. Walker and his associates, erected his cabin on the Holston nine miles west of Stephen Holston's cabin. It is worthy of mention in this place that in this year, 1749, the commissioners appointed by the Legislatures of Virginia and North Carolina continued the boundary line between Virginia and North Carolina to a point on Steep Rock Creek,* * Now Laurel Fork of Holston river. in this county. Dr. Walker and his associates had met Samuel Stalnaker on the waters of the Holston in April, 1748, between the Reedy Creek settlement and the Holston river, at which time it is evident, from a journal kept by Dr. Walker, that Stalnaker told Walker and his associates of the Cumberland Gap, and made an engagement with Dr. Walker to pilot him upon a trip to Kentucky at a subsequent date. The French had established settlements on the waters of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, and claimed, by right of discovery and occupancy, as territory belonging to the French crown, all the lands west of the Alleghany mountains, and were actively asserting their right to all of this territory at all times and by every possible means. It is claimed that the French had established a fort near the Broad Ford of the Tennessee river, and had opened and operated mines in the territory now included in Eastern Kentucky; and it is well known that the French traders were to be found in nearly all of the Indian villages east of the Mississippi river and west of the Alleghany mountains. The English Government and the American Colonies denied the pretensions of the French crown, and looked with jealousy upon every movement made by France in the direction of the accomplishment of her claim. As a result, on the 12th day of July, 1749, the Governor and Council of Virginia granted to the "Ohio Company" 500,000 acres of land, to be surveyed and located south of the Ohio river, and to forty-six gentlemen, styling themselves the "Loyal Company," leave to take up and survey 800,000 acres of land in one or more surveys, beginning on the bounds between this State and North Carolina and running to the westward and to the north seas to include the said quantity, with four years' time to locate said land and make return of surveys. The "Ohio Company" employed Christopher Gist, one of the most noted surveyors of that time, to go, as soon as possible, to the westward of the Great Mountains, and to carry with him such a number of men as he thought necessary, in order to search out and discover the lands upon the river Ohio and other adjoining branches of the Mississippi, down as low as the Great Falls thereof, now Louisville, Kentucky. He was also directed to observe the passes through the mountains, to take an exact account of the soil and products of the lands, the width and depth of the rivers, the falls belonging to them, the course and bearings of the rivers and mountains, and to ascertain what Indians inhabitated them, with their strength and numbers. Pursuant to his instructions, he set out from the old town on the Potomac river, in Maryland, in October, 1750, and spent many days on the lands south of the Ohio river, in the present State of Kentucky; he finally came to the Cumberland mountains at Pound Gap, at which gap he crossed and passed down Gist's river to Powell's and Clinch valleys. On Tuesday, the 7th day of May, 1751, he came to New river and crossed the same about eight miles above the mouth of Bluestone river. On Saturday, the 11th, he came to a very high mountain, upon the top of which was a lake or pond about three-fourths of a mile long northeast and southwest, and one-fourth of a mile wide, the water fresh and clear, its borders a clean gravelly shore about ten yards wide, and a fine meadow with six fine springs in it. From this description it is evident that Gist visited Salt Lake mountain, in Giles county, Va., as early as 1751, and found the lake as it now is. It is evident from this journal that the traditions that we so often hear repeated about this lake are nothing more than mythical, and that this lake existed as it now is at the time of the earliest explorations of the white man. Colonel Gist then passed south about four miles to Sinking Creek and on to the settlements. In the meantime the "Loyal Company" were not idle, but, having employed Dr. Thomas Walker for a certain consideration, sent him on the 12th day of December, 1749, in company with Ambrose Powell, William Tomlinson, Henry Lawless and John Hughes, to the westward in order to discover a proper place for a settlement. A journal of this trip will be found in the Appendix to this work, and the reader will find a perusal of this journal exceedingly interesting, as Dr. Walker and his associates passed directly through what might reasonably be termed the centre of Washington county. It will be necessary, in speaking of this journal of Dr. Walker's, to call the reader's attention to only a few incidents connected with the trip, which we will do as briefly as possible. On March 15, 1750, they came to the "Great Lick," now the present site of the city of Roanoke, Va., at which place they bought corn of Michael Campbell for their horses, at which time Dr. Walker remarks: "This Lick has been one of the best places for game in these parts, and would have been of much greater advantage to the inhabitants than it has been if the hunters had not killed the buffaloes for diversion and the elks and deer for their skins." It has been the prevailing opinion that there were no buffaloes east of the Blue Ridge, and while the Great Lick, or Roanoke City, is west of the Blue Ridge, it is altogether probable that buffaloes in their range did oftentimes travel beyond the mountains; at any rate it is known that Colonel Byrd killed buffaloes in 1729 on the boundary line between Virginia and North Carolina and south of Roanoke. They thence went up the Staunton river, now called the Little Roanoke river, to William Inglis'. Dr. Walker, at this point, notes the fact that William Inglis had a mill which is the furthest back, except one lately built by the sect of people who called themselves of the Brotherhood of Euphrates, or "Duncards," who are the upper inhabitants of the New river and lived on the west side of the same. It is well to note at this point that the present village of Blacksburg is near the locality occupied by William Inglis in 1750. The Dunkards spoken of by Dr. Walker lived on the west side of New river opposite Inglis' Ferry, several miles above the crossing of the Norfolk and Western railroad. Their next stopping point was on a small run between Peak Creek and Reed Creek, or between Pulaski city and Max Meadows of the present day. They next camped near James McCall's on Reed Creek, and on the 22d of March they reached a large spring about five miles below Davis' Bottom, on the Middle Fork of Holston river, where they camped; they moved thence down the Middle Fork of Holston, where they again camped, and Ambrose Powell and Dr. Walker went to look for Samuel Stalnaker and found his camp, he having just moved out to settle. They assisted Stalnaker in building his house, and spent the Sabbath about one-half a mile below him. On Monday, the 26th, they left the frontiers of civilization, Stalnaker's settlement being the farthest west at that time. Their trip was not eventful until the 30th, on which day they caught two young buffaloes, and on the 31st they traveled down the Reedy creek to the Holston river at the foot of Long Island, where they measured an elm tree twenty-five feet in circumference three feet from the ground. They crossed the North Fork of the Holston about one-half a mile above the junction of the North and South Fork rivers at a ford. At this point they discovered evidences of Indians. They found, in the fork between the North and South Forks of Holston river, five Indian houses built with logs and covered with bark, around which there were an abundance of bones and many pieces of mats and cloth. On the west side of the North Fork of Holston river they found four Indian houses, and four miles southwest of the junction of the North and South Forks of Holston river they discovered an Indian fort on the south side of the main Holston river. On April 2d they left the Holston river and traveled in a northwest direction toward Cumberland Gap, passing over Clinch mountain at Loony's Gap, it is thought. They reached the Clinch river above the present location of Sneedsville, in Hancock county, Tennessee, and on the 12th day of April they reached Powell's river, ten miles from Cumberland Gap. It is well to note at this point that Ambrose Powell, one of Dr. Walker's companions, cut his name upon a tree on the bank of this river, which name and tree were found in the year 1770 by a party of fifteen or twenty Virginians on their way to Kentucky on a hunting expedition, from which circumstance the Virginia Long Hunters gave it the name of Powell's river, which name it still retains. On the 13th they reached Cumberland Gap, which gap Dr. Walker afterwards named Cumberland Gap in honor of the Duke of Cumberland, the son of George II, and the commander of the English forces, on the 16th of April, 1746, at Culloden, where he defeated, with great slaughter, the Highland forces, refusing quarter to the wounded prisoners. On the 17th of April he reached the Cumberland river and named it at that time. On the 23d a part of this company was left to build a house and plant some peach stones and corn. On the 28th Dr. Walker returned to his company and found that they had built a house 12×8 feet, cleared and broken up some ground and planted corn and peach stones. This was the first house built by an Anglo-Saxon in the State of Kentucky, and it was used and occupied as late as 1835. The location of this house is on the farm of George M. Faulkner, about four miles below Barboursville, Ky. They thence traveled in a northeast direction, crossing Kentucky river and New river and striking the waters of the Greenbrier, and on the 13th day of July Dr. Walker reached his home. On this journey they killed thirteen buffaloes, eight elks, fifty-three bears, twenty deer, four wild geese and about a hundred and fifty turkeys, and could have killed three times as much meat if they had wanted it. It is to be recollected that this trip and the building of the cabin in the wilderness of Kentucky was all in the interest of the "Loyal Company." About this time the "Ohio Company" entered a caveat against the "Loyal Company," and the Loyal Company got into a dispute with Colonel James Patton, who had an unfinished grant below where this company were to begin, and no further progress was made by the company until June 14, 1753. In the year 1748, Mr. Gray, Mr. Ashford Hughes and others obtained a grant from the Governor and Council for 10,000 acres of land lying on the waters of the New river, which grant was soon afterwards assigned to Peter Jefferson (father of Thomas Jefferson), Dr. Thomas Walker, Thomas Merriweather and David Merriweather, which lands were surveyed and principally settled in the early days of the settlement of this section. About the same time the Governor and the Council of Virginia granted to John Lewis, of Augusta, and his associates 100,000 acres of land to be located on the Greenbrier river, and thus the English Government sought to displace the French in their efforts to settle and hold the lands west of the Alleghany mountains. On the other hand, the movements of the English were closely watched by the French, who were equally determined to defeat them in their aspirations. A company of French soldiers in 1752 were sent south as far as the Miami river to notify the English traders among the Indians to leave the country, which they refused to do, and thereupon a fight ensued between the French and Indians, in which fourteen Miami Indians were killed and four white prisoners were taken, and thus began the contest which resulted in the loss to France of all her possessions in Canada and east of the Mississippi river. In April of the year 1749, the house of Adam Harmon, one of the first settlers near Inglis' Ferry, on New river, was visited by the Indians, and his furs and skins stolen. * * Dr. Hale's "Trans-Alleghany Pioneers. This was the first Indian depredation committed on the white settlers west of the Alleghany mountains. In the month of November, 1753, the House of Burgesses of Virginia passed an act for the further encouraging of persons to settle on the waters of the Mississippi, which act we here copy in full: 1. Whereas, it will be the means of cultivating a better correspondence with the neighboring Indians if a farther encouragement be given to persons who have settled on the waters of the Mississippi, in the county of Augusta; and, whereas, a considerable number of persons, as well his majesty's natural born subjects as foreign Protestants, are willing to come into this Colony with their families and effects and settle upon the lands near the said waters in case they can have encouragement for so doing; and, whereas, the settling of that part of the country will add to the security and strength of the Colony in general and be a means of augmenting his majesty's revenue of quit rents; 2. Be it therefore enacted by the Lieutenant-Governor, Council and Burgesses of this present General Assembly, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same, That all persons being Protestants who have already settled or shall hereafter settle and reside on any lands situated to the westward of the ridge of mountains that divide the rivers Roanoke, James and Potowmack, from the Mississippi in the county of Augusta, shall be and are exempted and discharged from the payment of all public county and parish levies for the term of fifteen years next following, any law, usage, or custom to the contrary thereof, in any wise notwithstanding.* * Hen. S., p. 356. The English Government were exceedingly anxious to encourage the settlements on the waters of the Mississippi and thereby strengthen their frontiers and fortify their claim to the lands lying west of the Alleghany mountains, and, in keeping with this desire, the Governor and Council of Virginia, on June 14, 1753, renewed the grant to the "Loyal Company" and allowed them four years' farther time to complete the surveying and seating of said land, and on the 6th day of July following Dr. Thomas Walker, their agent, proceeded with all convenient speed to survey said land and to sell the same to purchasers at three pounds per hundred acres, exclusive of fees and rights. The basis of the operations of Dr. Walker was in Southwest Virginia, and by the end of the year 1754 he had surveyed and sold 224 separate tracts of land containing 45,249 acres, which surveys were made in the name of the several purchasers from him, and many of the said tracts of land were actually occupied by settlers. During this time James Patton was actively at work surveying and selling lands to settlers under his grant from the Governor and Council, and the tide of emigration was fast settling towards Southwest Virginia, when the French-Indian war of 1754-1763 came on, which war began in all its fury about this time, and thereby Dr. Walker, agent for the "Loyal Company," and James Patton and others were prevented, for the time being, from further prosecuting their enterprises in surveying and settling this portion of Virginia. In the spring of 1754, numbers of families were obliged, by an Indian invasion, to remove from their settlements in Southwest Virginia, and these removals continued during the entire war. It will be well here to note the fact that the lands held by Stephen Holston, James McCall, Charles Sinclair and James Burke, the earlier settlers of this portion of Virginia, were held by them under what were known at that time as "corn rights—that is, under the law as it then stood, each settler acquired title to a hundred acres for every acre planted by him in corn, but subsequent settlers, as a general rule, held their lands under one of the above-mentioned grants. Stephen Holston, who settled at the head spring of the Middle Fork of Holston some time prior to 1748, did not remain long at this place, but sold his right to James Davis, who, on the 19th of March, 1748, had John Buchanan, deputy surveyor of Augusta county, to survey for him at this point a tract of land containing 1,300 acres, to which he gave the name of "Davis' Fancy," and the descendants of James Davis occupy a portion of this land to this day. Stephen Holston, when he had disposed of his rights to Davis, constructed canoes, passed down the Holston, Tennessee and Mississippi rivers to Natchez, Mississippi, and thence returned to Virginia, and settled in Culpeper county, where he lived in 1754; afterwards, in 1757, he was captured by the Indians, but, making his escape, he returned to the waters of the Holston, and served under Colonel Christian upon the expedition to Point Pleasant in 1774, and in the expedition against the Cherokees in 1776. Many of his descendants are to be found in East Tennessee at this time. At the beginning of the year 1753 two families resided on Back creek; James Reed, at Dublin, Va. (from whom Reed creek derived its name); two families on Cripple creek; James Burk, in Burk's Garden; Joseph and Esther Crockett, at the head waters of the South Fork of Holston river; James Davis, at the head waters of the Middle Fork of Holston river, and a family of Dunkards, by the name of McCorkle, on the west bank of New river near Inglis' Ferry. Of these facts we have record evidence. Many other families resided west of New river, of whom we have no record. And thus closes the record of the first efforts made to explore and settle Southwest Virginia by the white man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. Southwest Virginia. 1754-1770. Thus matters stood at the beginning of the year 1754. Governor Dinwiddie, in this year, dispatched George Washington on a mission to the French commander on the Ohio. Washington, accompanied by Christopher Gist, arrived at the French headquarters, which were situated near the present city of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, where he delivered the dispatches from Governor Dinwiddie, informing the French commander that war was inevitable unless he immediately withdrew from the country. The French commander denied the right of Governor Dinwiddie to give him orders in the premises, and declared his purpose to destroy every settlement made by the Virginians in the west. To form some idea of the spirit of the American colonies in regard to the French settlements on the Ohio and their apprehensions therefrom, Governor Dinwiddie wrote to Earl Granville, in 1754, that the French intended to build forts, not only on the Ohio, but on Greenbrier, Holston and New rivers, and the French and Indians, he says, are now making incursions among our inhabitants in Augusta county, driving them from their homes. Washington returned to Williamsburg and reported the result of his trip, whereupon the Governor of Virginia proceeded to raise a regiment under Colonel Joshua Fry and Lieutenant-Colonel George Washington. This regiment immediately proceeded to the west, and at Redstone, Western Pennsylvania, they encountered a force, composed of Indians and French, which they attacked, killing ten and capturing the rest. They proceeded to the Great Meadows, halted, and built a fort, to which they gave the name of "Fort Necessity." On the 3d day of July, 1754, a force of French and Indians, numbering about a thousand, under the command of Count de Villiers, vigorously assaulted the fort and attempted to take it. The siege lasted for nine hours, at the end of which time the French leader sent in a flag of truce offering to receive the surrender of the fort upon honorable terms, which offer was accepted, and the Virginians marched out next morning. In the spring of 1755, the American colonies attacked the French at Nova Scotia, Crown Point, Niagara and on the Ohio river. The attack on the French and Indians on the Ohio was commanded by General Braddock, who had arrived from England early in that year with two royal regiments—the Eighteenth and Forty-fourth. Virginia sent 800 men to join Braddock, and the Virginia troops were commanded by Captains Waggoner, Cock, Hogg, Stevens, Poulson, Perrony, Mercer and Stewart. Braddock marched from Alexandria, Virginia, on the 20th of April, 1755, with 2,200 men, and on the 9th of July he reached the Monongahela river, where his troops fell into an ambuscade. Braddock was mortally wounded, and his army put to flight, with a loss of 777 men killed and wounded, and had it not been for the coolness and courage of Washington and his Virginia troops the entire army would have been destroyed. The army retreated a hundred and twenty miles into the settlement, and the whole frontier of Western Virginia was thus left open to the ravages of the French and Indians. The French and Indians crossed the Alleghany mountains into the valley and to New river, killing and scalping, in the most horrible manner, men, women, and children without distinction, and thus ended the first year of the war. On the 21st day of March, 1755, the County Court of Augusta county appointed George Stalnaker constable on the waters of the Holston and New rivers, and he built a stockade fort at Dunkards' Bottom, the name of which was, according to some writers, Fort Frederick, but there is some doubt about it. In the month of February, 1755, William Wright, an ensign, who was stationed at Fort Lewis, near Salem, Virginia, by Major Andrew Lewis, accompanied by twenty men, marched to the head waters of the Holston river for the purpose of protecting the settlers, but his movements were so slow that he failed to accomplish anything, and, upon his return, he was reprimanded by the Governor of Virginia. The New river settlers were not permitted to escape the ravages of the Indians and the French, for on the 8th day of July, 1755, the day before Braddock's defeat, a considerable party of Shawnese Indians fell upon this settlement and wiped it out of existence. Colonel James Patton, Casper Barrier, Mrs. George Draper and a child of John Draper were killed. Mrs. William Inglis and her two children, Mrs. John Draper and Henry Leonard were taken prisoners. Mrs. Inglis was taken to Ohio, thence to Bone Lick, Kentucky, whence she and an old Dutch woman made their escape, and, after many days, returned to her home on New river. This invasion occurred on Sunday, the 8th day of July, 1755. Colonel Patton, accompanied by William Preston, was on a visit to the New river settlement, and was detained by sickness at the house of William Inglish. William Preston, William Inglis and John Draper were away from the house at the time. Mrs. John Draper, who first discovered the Indians, ran to the house, secured her infant child, and attempted to make her escape by the opposite side of the house, but she was detected by the Indians, and, having one of her arms broken, the child fell to the ground. She then took the child in the other arm and continued her flight, but was soon overtaken, the child taken from her, and its brains dashed out upon a log by the Indians. Colonel Patton, at the time of the attack, was seated at a table writing, with his broad sword beside him. He immediately arose, and killed two of the Indians before he was shot by others beyond his reach. The Indians then plundered the premises and began a hasty retreat. On their retreat they passed the house of an old man by the name of Philip Barger, whom they killed by severing his head from his body, and carried it off in a bag. It was several days before efforts were made to overtake the enemy and rescue the prisoners, as Vause's Fort was the nearest point from which help could be obtained. Mrs. Inglis and the other prisoners were carried by the Indians to Ohio. Mrs. Inglis was absent from her home about five months, when, in the month of December, 1755, she reached the house of Adam Harmon on New river, whence she was taken to a small fort at Dunkards' Bottom, on the west side of New river, where she was found on the next day by her husband and her brother. The other captives, with but few exceptions, were either rescued or redeemed and returned to their homes after many years. The body of Colonel James Patton was buried at Draper's Meadows. Colonel John Buchanan sent a company of men to pursue the Indians, but they did not succeed in overtaking them, and thus occurred the first Indian massacre of the white inhabitants of Southwest Virginia. About ten miles west of where Christiansburg now stands, and near the former residence of Captain Jacob Kent, about two and a half miles east of Lafayette and on the head waters of the Roanoke river, there stood a small fort that in those days was known as Vause's Fort, and this was the nearest place of refuge for the settlers on New river. In the fall of the year 1755, about a hundred French and Indians came upon the New river, and assaulted and captured this fort and killed or carried into captivity twenty-four persons, not a single person escaping. This was a private fort, constructed by the settlers for their own protection, and was built of logs and easily captured. As best I can ascertain, at the time of this invasion James Burk, who had settled in Burk's Garden in the year 1753, was captured with his entire family; they were all either killed or carried into captivity. A register of the persons who were killed, wounded, and taken prisoners in the years 1754, 1755, and 1756 on the New river, Reed creek, and Holston rivers has been preserved, and is as follows: 1754, Stephen Lyon, Holston River, killed.

Wm. Preston diary in L. C. Draper Manuscript. Feb. In July of this year, Richard Pearis, who was located on the Holston river carrying on a trade with the Cherokee Indians, addressed a letter to the Governor of Virginia requesting a grant for the lands on the Long Island in the South Fork of the Holston river. In reply the Governor encouraged Pearis to believe that he could obtain a grant, and wrote him as follows: "I am surprised the inhabitants on Holston river should submit to be robbed by a few Indians. Let the Chickasaw know that I greatly approve of his conduct and have a real esteem for him." This last sentence in the Governor's letter had reference to a Chickasaw warrior who had resented the murder of one of the white settlers. At the time of which we write the Virginia colonists, and the Cherokee and the Chickasaw Indians were exceedingly friendly, and through the agency of Richard Pearis, who was a great favorite with the Indians, the Governor of Virginia subsequently sought to enlist the Cherokee and the Chickasaw Indians in the war against the French and the Northern Indians. SANDY RIVER EXPEDITION. For the purpose of avenging the massacre of the settlers upon the New river, the Governor of Virginia enlisted a hundred and thirty Cherokee Indians, to whom were joined four companies of the Rangers of West Augusta, for the purpose of invading and destroying the Shawnese towns at the mouth of the Big Sandy and on the Ohio river. The command of this expedition was given to Major Andrew Lewis. This force consisted of two hundred and sixty-three white men, commanded by Captain Peter Hogg, with forty men; Captain William Preston, with thirty men; Captain John Smith, with thirty men; Captain Samuel Overton, with forty men; Captain Obadiah Woodson, with forty men; Captains Robert Breckenridge, Archibald Alexander, John Montgomery and — Dunlap commanding eighty-three volunteers, and Captain Richard Pearis commanding a hundred and thirty Cherokee and Chickasaw Indians. This force was rendezvoused at Fort Lewis, near Salem, Va., whence they marched in Feb. 1756, for the Indian towns. They traveled from Fort Lewis, near Salem, to the New river, which they crossed at the Horseshoe Bend; they thence descended the New river to the mouth of Wolf creek, thence up Wolf creek to its source, thence to Bluestone river, thence to the head of North Fork of Sandy, which they reached on the 28th day of February, 1756; thence down the Sandy to the Great Burning Springs, at which point they saw the rawhides of several buffaloes hung upon bushes to dry. At this time provisions became very scarce and a famine was threatened, but this little army was saved by the bravery and firmness of Major Lewis. The army then proceeded from the Burning Springs to the banks of the Ohio, where they remained for two days. Seeing no evidences of Indians, they began to retrace their steps, and by the time they had reached the Burning Springs on their return, the hunger of the men had become so great that the hides of the buffaloes, which had been hung upon the bushes, were cut into tugs, and the men devoured them as the only means of preserving life. It is said that from this circumstance the Tug Fork of Sandy river received its name. Thus this expedition ended disastrously for the settlers. The Indians were correspondingly elated and immediately advanced upon the settlements east of the Alleghany mountains, committing many murders and carrying off many prisoners. The Governor and Council of Virginia agreed to build a number of forts for the protection of the western settlements, and, among the number, Fort Vause, which had been destroyed by the Indians a short time previous. The building of the fort was to be under the supervision of Captain Peter Hogg, and was to be at least one hundred feet square in the clear, with stockades at least sixteen feet long, and was to be garrisoned by seventy men. Immediately upon the erection of this new fort, many of the settlers returned to their homes at and near the fort. About this time companies of Rangers were organized for the purpose of running down and capturing marauding Shawnese Indians wherever they should be found. A journal of one of these expeditions has been preserved, which we here publish as a relic of the past. An extract of a Journal "Concerning a march that Capt. Robert Wade took to the New River" in search of Indians, Saturday, 12th of August, 1758: Capt. Robert Wade marc't from Mayo fort, with 35 men, in order to take a Range to the New River in search of our Enemy Indians. We marcht about three miles that Day to a Plantation, Where Peter Rentfro formerly Lived and took up Camp, where we continued safe that night—Next morning being Sunday, we continued to march about three or four miles, and one Francis New returned back to the Fort, then we had 34 men besides the Capt— We marcht along to a place called Gobeling Town, where we Eat our Brakefast—&amp; so continued our march till late in the afternoon, and took up Camp at the Foot of the Blew Ledge where we continued safe that night—Next morning being Monday, the 14th, Inst. we started early and crossed the Blew Ledge and Fell upon a branch of the Little River, called Pine Creek,— We followed the sd: Creek down to Little River, and crost the Little River &amp; went to Francis Easons' Plantation where we continued that night. Our hunters brought a plentiful supply of Venison—Next morning being tuesday the 15 Inst. we marct. down to Richard Rattlecliffs' plantation on the Meadow Creek, where we continued that night—Next morning being Wednesday the 16th. Inst, we Sent our Spyes and hunters to Spy for Enemy Signs, &amp; to hunt for provisions. But the body of the Company Tarryed there— At Night they came in with a plenty of Venison, but could not discover any fresh sign of the Enemy—Next morning Thursday the 17th Inst, we sent out hunters as usual, &amp; in the afternoon some of them came in &amp; informed us that they had seen signs of Indians at Drapers' Meadow, that had been a catching of horses that Day, and that they had gone a straight course for Blackwater—upon that we began to get in Readyness to persue them next morning— but one of our men not coming in that night disappointed us— next morning Being Fryday the 18th. Inst. Some of the men were sent to Look for the man that was Lost—&amp; the Rest remained there, for we counted it imprudent to Leave the Place before we knew what had become of the lost man—so we tarryed Till the Day was so far Spent that we could not make anything of a march that Day. So the Capt. said that he and some more men would go to view the sign, and See what they could Discover. The Capt. and Wm. Hall and Adam Hermon, and two or three more went off &amp; Left the men under my Command and ordered that we should be in Readyness for a march as soon as he returned—Soon after the Captain was Gone, the man that was Lost Came in &amp; Informed us that he had been lost in a Creek of the Little River—But when the Captain came to the place where the sign was Seen, he Tels us that he saw a Shoe track among them, which caused them to believe that it had been white men after their horses—So the Captain nor none of the men, that was with him returned that night, But went a hunting—Next morning being Saturday 19th Inst. the Captain not coming gave us a great deal of Uneasyness—tho we Bore it with so much patience as we could 'till about noon, for we lay under great apprehensions of Danger—I ordered the men to keep a Verry Sharp Look out, and Likewise to be in order to march next morning, by Sun Rise,—I was Determined to stay that night &amp; if the Capt: did not come, to march off after him—Soon after we had come to a conclusion about it Some of the men Spyed five Indians Very near to us, for the place where we was, was grown up with weeds so that we could not Se them, nor they see us 'till thay came Verry near us—I was a Lying down in the house when I heard the news—I Rased up and presented my Gun at one of the Indians, But I heard some of our Company that was in another house, Cry out, Don't Shoot— I Stopt at that and askt them what they were &amp; I beleive they said Cheroke, but Stood in amaise, &amp; Reason they had, for I suppose there was 20 Guns presented at them, we went up to them &amp; Examined them—they said they were Cherokees, I made signs to them to show me their Pass, But they had none,—They had with them 5 head of horse Kind &amp; Skelps, that appeared to be white mens—4 of the horses appeared as tho' they had been Lately taken up, but the other was very poor—The Indians began to make ready to go off, but I made Signs to them that they must not Go that night, But they seemed very intent to go—but we would not agree to it—Some of the Company insisted to fall upon them and Kill them, for they said they believed they were Shawnees, &amp; that they were Spyes—and was doubtful that they had a superior number Some where nigh—But I said I was determined to keep them till the Capt: came, without they would go by forse, and if they would we would fire upon them—2 of the men went off after the Capt: who soon met some of the Company, who told them that they had been hunting &amp; that the Capt: would soon be in; who accordingly came soon after &amp; we informed him how things had happened in his absence &amp; in what manner the Indians appeared; that they had no pass and that they had white Skelps—After Capt: heard the opinion of the people, he past sentence of Death upon them; but there was one Abraham Dunkleberry, hunter that we let off who said they were Cherokees, yet he agreed that they were Rogues; which seemed to put the Capt: to a stand, but we had their Guns taken from them &amp; a guard kept over them that night—next morning Being Sunday 20th Inst upon what Dunkleberry had said the Capt: let them have their Guns &amp; let them go off—which displeased some of the Carolina men—so much that they swore if they were not allowed to kill them, they would never go Ranging again, for they said it was to no purpose to Rang after the Enemy, &amp; when they had found them, not to be allowed to kill them—which you must think is very hard for us to be compel to Rang &amp; then let the Enemy have Liberty to Kill some of us, before we Dare to Kill them—at that Rate we may all be Kill'd, and never Kill an Indian, for if there is enough of them to overcome us, then they are Enemy, But if we are too numerous for them they are friends. Upon consideration of their having no pass, nor white man, &amp; be reason of their steal of horses, they did not appear any waise Like friends, so the Captain told them to be Easy, and after Dunkleberry was gone, we would go after them and Kill them. So Dunkleberry packt up his skins to go off &amp; we marcht after the Indians—w overtook them and past them, Because the Capt: said they were in such order that we could not kill them all, but would wate for better opportunity—They were going toward the New River—so th men that had been acquainted Knew of 2 fords &amp; they Emagined they would cross at the upper ford—But we lade an Ambushkaide at each ford, the Capt: &amp; myself and a partie of men at the upper ford, and a partie of men at the Loer ford &amp; the Capts: orders were to fire at them as they Crost the River—But after we had placed ourselves and sat awhile 2 or 3 of the men came from the Loer Ford &amp; informed us that two of the Indians had Crost at the Loer ford, and they did not fire at them because they were not altogether. So the Capt. and the men went towards the Loer Ford &amp; as we went along we saw 4 of the Indians; we did not fire at them; the Capt: concluded to ly by awhile and let them all get together &amp; then follow them and kill them—soon after the other Indians followed them, the Capts: orders was for 12 of the best men to follow them and Kill them and the remainder of the Company to go to the Dunker Fort which was about half a mile below us &amp; the Capt: took such men as he Lik'd and set down to conclude how we should follow them—the way the Capt proposed was to Dog them till night and then ly By till the Brake of Day and then Fall upon them and Kill them—he said if we fired upon them in the day, some would get away—but we did not approve of his skeems, and told him the Ill Consequence that attended it, but he still insisted upon that way of proceeding—At length we desired him to go down to the fort with the rest of the men, &amp; let us go after the Indians, to which he consented, and went off to the fort and we after the Indians— The men that followed them were Adam hermon, Daniel Hermon, Wm. Hall, Ric'd Hall, Jun'r, Tobias Clapp, Philip Clap, Joseph Clapp, Benj. Angel, David Currie, Ric'd Hines, James Lyon &amp; my self—13 of us—We followed them and overtook them at a peach orchard—jest as they were leaving it, we watched our opportunity, and fired at them and followed them up till we Killed 4 of them, and wounded the other—we Skelpt them that we killed, &amp; then followed the other—he bled verry much, he went into the river and to an Island—but we could not find where he went out— some of the men left looking for him, and some went after the Indian horse—but myself and 4 or 5 more, we Sercht the Island till late in the afternoon, &amp; when we came to the Fort the Capt. and men were a handling the Indians' goods &amp; after a while the Capt: told me we were all to be sworn—so we Tarried there that night— Next morning being Monday 21st Inst. we packed up in order to march homeward, for signs of Indians was plenty &amp; we had but little amunition but before we left the fort, we were Sworn—the words of the oath Do not remember exactly, but the Intent of the thing was not to tell that we ever heard them say that they were Cherokees without required to swere—so left the fort and marcht till dark &amp; took up Camp at a Plantation upon a Branch of the Little River. We continued there that night—next morning, being Tuesday the 22nd inst. we marcht from that place to Blackwater—we eat dinner with them marcht off again Rob Joneses Plantation on the head of Pig River, and Tarryed there that night, next morning being Wednesday 23d. inst. they delayed time in the morning, and we had nothing to eat, the Company had some rum to drink, but myself and four more left the Company and went across to Goblingtown &amp; came to Mayo Fort—that night—the Captain and the Rest of the men tells us that they came to Hickey's fort and that night and next day to Mayo fort—I remember no more worth making a remark of so Courteous Reader I Rem'n Yrs. &amp;., John Echols. Captain Wm. Preston and Captain Wm. Byrd each organized a company of Rangers. A number of the men that enlisted under them afterwards settled in Washington county and their names were as follows: Capt. Wm. Preston's Co. Capt. Wm. Byrd's Co. Wm. Johnston, Michal Morrison, Sergt., Benj. Estill, John Crank, George Martin, Thomas Brumley, John Johnston, John Donnelly, Fifer, Jas. Clendenen, Richard Staunton, Sergt., John Vance, John Lemons, Solomon Kendrick, Richard Chapman, Christopher Ackland, Francis Farmer, Robert Rutherford. Henry Dooley, Drury Puckett, Sergt., John Ross. On the 29th of July, 1756, a Council of War assembled at Staunton, by direction of the Governor of Virginia, to determine at what points forts should be built along the frontier for the protection of the settlers. The Council was composed of Col. John Buchanan, Samuel Stalnaker and others, of which Council Wm. Preston acted as clerk. There can be no doubt that Captain Samuel Stalnaker represented the Holston settlement and that it was at his request that the stockade fort was built at Dunkards' Bottom, on New river, and at Davis' Bottom, at the head waters of the Middle Fork of Holston river. In the year 1757, Dickenson's Fort, situated on the Cow Pasture river, in Augusta county, was raided by the Indians, and several children, playing under the walls outside the fort, and a number of men were captured. So careless were the commanding officers that the Indians reached the very gates of the fort before they were discovered. At the time of this raid upon Dickenson's Fort, the Indians captured a boy who was destined in after years to play such a part in the history of Washington county as would justly entitle him to the appellation of "Father of Washington County," so intelligent and active were his efforts in the settling of our county and in the protection of its earlier inhabitants; and this boy was Arthur Campbell, who had volunteered as a militiaman for the protection of the frontiers. On the day of the raid he, with others, had gone to a thicket near by in search of plums, when the party was fired upon from ambush by Indians, and Campbell was wounded and captured. He was carried by the Indians to Ohio and thence to the Lakes, where he was detained for a number of years, when he succeeded in making his escape to an English force and returned to his home. Upon his return he addressed a letter to the Governor of Virginia, detailing the circumstances of his capture and detention, and thereby made such an impression upon the Governor that he was afterwards granted a thousand acres of land in consideration of his services. Governor Dinwiddie was so much in earnest about enlisting the Cherokee and other Southern Indians in the war against the French and Northern Indians, that, in the year 1756, he dispatched the Hon. Peter Randolph and Wm. Byrd to their country as commissioners, to negotiate formal treaties with them. The commissioners returned to Williamsburg and, either before or at that time, a treaty was made with the Indians, by which it was stipulated that the Indians were to send reinforcements to aid the Colonies, in consideration of the agreement of the Government to build a fort in their country. On the 24th day of April the Governor directed Major Andrew Lewis to enlist sixty men who could use the saw and axe, and to proceed to the Cherokee country with all speed and erect a fort as agreed upon. Major Lewis did not start for the Indian country until June of that year, and on the 20th day of August, wrote the Governor that he might expect a reinforcement of a hundred and fifty Cherokees and fifty Catawba Indians at an early date. Major Lewis, with his force, passed down the waters of the Holston to the southern bank of the Tennessee river, at the head of navigation, about thirty miles from the present city of Knoxville. He there built a fort, which he called Fort Loudon, in honor of the Governor of Virginia. In September of that year, Major Lewis addressed another letter to the Governor of Virginia, in which he stated that the Indians were very much pleased with their fort, and that the Governor might expect a reinforcement of four hundred Indians. This letter also contained a request from the Indians that the Governor would send a small garrison of white men to hold the fort during the absence of their warriors. By the 18th day of September, 1756, Captain Samuel Overton and his men, who had accompanied Major Lewis, had returned to their homes, leaving Major Lewis in the Indian country to bring in the reinforcements. In the fall of that year Major Lewis returned from the Cherokee country, accompanied by seven warriors and three women, greatly to the surprise of the Governor. The French in the meantime had bought off the Indians. Fort Loudon was then estimated to be more than a hundred miles from the nearest settlement, was at a place at all times difficult to reach, even in times of peace, and beyond the reach of help from the settlements in the event of war with the Cherokee Indians. This fort was by order of the Earl of Loudon, then Governor of Virginia garrisoned by two hundred troops from Britain. The Indians allured artisans into Fort Loudon by donations of land, which they caused to be signed by their own chief and by Governor Dobbs of North Carolina. There was a rapid increase of the number of settlers, as a result, at and in the vicinity of Fort Loudon. In the year 1756 the New River Lead Mines were discovered by Col. John Chiswell, at which time operations were begun. Col. Chiswell had been engaged in mining operations near Fredericksburg, Va., for some time previous to this time, and was an intimate friend of Col. Wm Byrd. About this time the lead mines were discovered, and four hundred acres of land, including the mines, were surveyed on October 1st, 1781, and a patent was issued to Chas. Lynch, trustee for the lead mine company, by Beverly Randolph, Governor of Virginia, on the 7th day of May, 1791, in consideration of £3 10s. sterling, paid by Chas. Lynch, and of pre-emption Treasury warrants Nos. 2393 and 2356. As far as I can ascertain this property was owned originally by Col. Wm. Byrd, Col. John Chiswell and John Robinson, afterwards Treasurer of Virginia. Col. John Chiswell, some time previous to 1775, killed a man in Cumberland county, Virginia, and while awaiting trial he committed suicide.* * Ninth Henning's Statutes, pages 73-237. At the beginning of the Revolutionary War, the Legislature of Virginia directed the Committee of Safety for Fincastle county to lease these mines, at a reasonable rent, and if they could not lease them, to impress them for † † Vol. 14 Call's Rep., page 17. † 2 H. &amp; M. Rep., page 22. the use of the State. The committee, acting according to their authority, took possession of the lead mines, whether by lease or by impressment I cannot say, and the State of Virginia, through her agents, Chas. Lynch and Capt. Calloway, operated these mines during the Revolutionary War, and paid rent therefor to the representatives of John Robinson and Wm. Byrd, and to John Chiswell, the son of Col. John Chiswell. A considerable village had grown up around Fort Loudon by the year 1760. British arms were successful at every point in the contest with the French and Indians in 1758-1760. Canada was conquered and the French expelled from it in 1759, and Fort Du Quesne was capturned by General Forbes and the French expelled from the Ohio Valley. The result of the expulsion of the French from Canada and the Ohio Valley proved very disastrous to the western settlements of the Southern Colonies. "The scene of action was only changed from one place to another, and the baneful influence of those active and enterprising enemies that had descended the Ohio soon manifested itself in a more concentrated form among the upper Cherokees, the interior position of whose country furnished facilities of immediate and frequent intercourse with the defeated and exasperated Frenchmen, who now ascended the Tennessee river and penetrated to their mountain fastnesses. An unfortunate quarrel with the Virginians helped to forward their intrigues and opened an easier access into the towns of the savages. The Cherokees, as before remarked, had, agreeably to their treaties, sent a number of their warriors to assist in the reduction of Du Quesne. Returning home through the back parts of Virginia, some of them, who had lost their horses on this expedition, laid hold on such as they found running at large and appropriated them. The Virginians resented the injury by killing twelve or fourteen of the unsuspecting warriors and taking several more prisoners. This ungrateful conduct from allies, whose frontiers they had defended and recovered, aroused at once a spirit of deep resentment and deadly retaliation. . . . . . . The flame soon spread through the upper towns. The garrison at Fort Loudon, consisting of about two hundred men under the command of Captains Demere and Stuart, was, from its remote position from the white settlements, the first to notice the disaffection and to suffer from it. The soldiers, as usual, making excursions into the woods to procure fresh provisions, were attacked by them and some of them killed. From this time such dangers threatened the garrison that every one was confined within the small boundary of the fort." . . . . . . . . . . "All communication with the settlements across the mountains from which they received supplies was cut off, and the soldiers, having no other sources from which provision could be procured, had no prospect left them but famine or death. Parties of the young warriors rushed down upon the frontier settlements, and the work of massacre became general along the borders of Virginia and North Carolina."* * Haywood. The Governor of North Carolina undertook to pacify the Indians, and negotiated a treaty with six of their head men, but this treaty did not express the sentiments of the Indians and they paid no attention to it. Numerous companies of Rangers were organized to patrol the frontiers and punish the Indians for any depredations they might commit, and every means was exhausted to bring about peace, but the Indians were not disposed to listen to any terms of accommodation and continued their depredations wherever and whenever possible. The Governor of Virginia directed Col. William Byrd to proceed to Fort Loudon with a body of backwoodsmen from Virginia, numbering about six hundred men, and to relieve the garrison. Col. Byrd organized his force and began the march, but was greatly hampered by lack of men and supplies. Notwithstanding the fact that Col. Byrd was an experienced campaigner, he occupied most of his time in building block-houses and roads, and accomplished nothing in the way of relieving Fort Loudon. He crossed New river to the lead mines and immediately proceeded to build a fort about two miles south of the present site of Max Meadows on the McAdam road near the home of James McGavock, to which he gave the name of Fort Chiswell, in honor of his friend, Col. John Chiswell, who was at that time working the lead mines which had been discovered some time previously. From Fort Chiswell Col. Byrd marched to the Long Island in the South Fork of Holston river, opening a road from Fort Chiswell to Long Island. At this point, Col. Byrd and his men spent the winter of 1760. During the winter Col. Byrd erected a fort upon a beautiful level on the north bank of the South Fork of the Holston river, nearly opposite the upper end of Long Island, to which fort he gave the name of Fort Robinson, in honor of John Robinson, the partner of himself and Col. John Chiswell in the ownership of the lead mines. This fort was built upon an extensive plan. The walls were sufficient in thickness to withstand the force of a small cannon shot. There were proper bastions, and the gates were spiked with large nails so that the wood was entirely covered.* * Fort Patrick Henry, 1776. At the time this fort was built, it was supposed that the Long Island was in Virginia, the boundary line between Virginia and North Carolina not having been run farther west than Steep Rock. And thus to Virginians may be assigned the honor of having erected Fort Loudon and Fort Robinson, the first Anglo-American forts within the present State of Tennessee. While engaged in building Fort Robinson Col. Byrd was joined by five hundred men from North Carolina under the command of Col. Waddell. As a result of the course pursued by Col. Byrd, great dissatisfaction arose among his men, and Col. Byrd resigned, and was succeeded in the command of the force, now numbering about twelve hundred men, by Col. Stephens. In the meantime, the distant garrison at Fort Loudon, consisting of two hundred men, was reduced to the dreadful alternative of perishing by hunger or submitting to the mercy of the enraged Cherokees. The Governor of South Carolina, hearing that the Virginians had undertaken to relieve it, for awhile seemed satisfied and anxiously waited to hear the news of that happy event, but so remote was the fort from any settlement and so difficult was it to march an army through a barren wilderness, where every thicket concealed an enemy, and to carry, at the same time, sufficient supplies along with them, that the Virginians had not succeeded in giving them assistance. Provisions being entirely exhausted at Fort Loudon, the garrison was upon the point of starving. For a whole month they had no other subsistence than the flesh of lean horses and dogs and a small supply of Indian beans, procured stealthily for them by some friendly Cherokee women. The officers had long endeavored to encourage the men with the hope of succour; but now, being blockaded night and day by the enemy and having no resource left, they threatened to leave the fort and die at once by the hands of the savages, rather than perish slowly by famine. In this extremity the commander was obliged to call a council of war to consider what was proper to be done. The officers were all of the opinion that it was impossible to hold out longer. They therefore agreed to surrender the fort to the Cherokees on the best terms that could be obtained from them. For this purpose, Capt. Stuart, an officer of great sagacity and address and much beloved by those of the Indians who remained in the British interest, procured leave to go to Chota, one of the principal towns in the neighborhood, where he obtained the following terms of capitulation, which were signed by the commanding officers and two of the Cherokee chiefs. "That the garrison of Fort Loudon march out with their arms and drums, each soldier having as much powder and ball as his officer shall think necessary for the march, and all the baggage he may choose to carry; that the garrison be permitted to march, unmolested, to Virginia or Fort Prince George, as the commanding officer shall think proper, and that a number of Indians be appointed to escort them and hunt for provisions during the march; that such soldiers as are lame, or by sickness disabled from marching, be received into the Indian towns and kindly used until they recover, and then be allowed to return to Fort Prince George; that the Indians do provide for the garrison as many horses as they conveniently can for the march, agreeing with the officers and soldiers for payment; that the fort, great guns, powder, ball and spare arms be delivered to the Indians without fraud or further delay, on the day appointed for the march of the troops.* * Haywood. "Agreeably to this stipulation, the garrison delivered up the fort and marched out with their arms, accompanied by Oconostota, Judds' friend, the Prince of Chota, and several other Indians, and that day went fifteen miles on their way to Fort Prince George. At night they encamped upon a plain about two miles from Taliquo, an Indian town, when all their attendants, upon one pretext or another, left them; which the officers considered as no good sign, and therefore placed a strict guard around their camp. During the night they remained unmolested, but next morning about break of day a soldier from an outpost came running in and informed them that he saw a number of Indians, armed and painted in the most dreadful manner, creeping among the bushes and advancing in order to surround them. Scarcely had the officer time to order his men to stand to their arms, when the savages poured in upon them a heavy fire from different quarters, accompanied by the most hideous yells, which struck a panic into the soldiers, who were so much enfeebled and dispirited that they were incapable of making any effectual resistance. Captain Demere, with three other officers and about twenty-six privates, fell at the first onset. Some fled into the woods and were afterwards taken prisoners and confined among the towns in the valley. Captain Stuart and those that remained were seized, pinioned and brought back to Fort Loudon. No sooner had Attakullakulla heard that his friend, Mr. Stuart, had escaped, than he hastened to the fort and purchased him from the Indian that took him, giving him his rifle, clothes and all he could command by way of ransom. He then took possession of Capt. Demere's house, where he kept his prisoner as one of his family and freely shared with him the little provisions his table afforded, until a fair opportunity should offer for rescuing him from the hands of the savages, but the poor soldiers were kept in a miserable state of captivity for some time and then redeemed by the province at great expense. "While the prisoners were confined at Fort Loudon, Oconostota formed the design of attacking Fort Prince George. To this bold undertaking he was the more encouraged, as the cannon and ammunition surrendered by the garrison would, under direction of French officers who were near him, secure its success. Messengers were therefore dispatched to the valley towns requesting their warriors to meet him at Stickoee. "By accident, discovery was made of ten bags of powder and a large quantity of ball, that had been secretly buried at the fort to prevent their falling into the enemy's hands. This discovery had nearly proved fatal to Captain Stuart; but the interpreter had such presence of mind as to assure the incensed savages that these warlike stores were concealed without Stuart's knowledge or consent. The supply of ammunition being sufficient for the siege, a council was held at Chota, to which the captive Stuart was taken. Here he was reminded of the obligations he was under for having his life spared, and as they had determined to take six cannon and two cohorts against Fort Prince George, the Indians told him he must accompany the expedition, manage the artillery and write such letters to the commandant as they should dictate to him. They further informed him that if the officer should refuse to surrender, they had determined to burn the prisoners, one by one, before his face and try whether he could be so obstinate as to hold out while his friends were expiring in the flames. "Captain Stuart was much alarmed at his present situation and from that moment resolved to make his escape or perish in the attempt. He privately communicated his design to Attakullakulla and told him that the thought of bearing arms against his countrymen harrowed his feelings, and he invoked his assistance to accomplish his release. The old warrior took him by the hand, told him he was his friend and was fully apprised of the designs of his countrymen, and pledged his efforts to deliver him from danger. Attakullakulla claimed Captain Stuart as his prisoner and resorted to stratagem to rescue him. He told the other Indians that he intended to go a hunting for a few days and to take his prisoner with him. Accordingly they departed, accompanied by the warrior's wife, his brother and two soldiers. The distance to the frontier settlements was great and the utmost expedition was necessary to prevent surprise from Indians pursuing them. Nine days and nights did they travel through a dreary wilderness, shaping their course by the sun and moon, for Virginia. On the tenth they arrived at the banks of the Holston river, where they fortunately fell in with a party of three hundred men, sent out under the command of Col. Byrd for the relief of Fort Loudon. On the fourteenth day the Captain reached Col. Byrd's camp on the frontiers of Virginia. His faithful friend Attakullakulla was here loaded with presents and provisions and sent back to protect the unhappy prisoners till they should be ransomed and to exert his influence with the Cherokees for the restoration of peace."* * Haywood. It will be observed that Fort Loudon was defended by twelve great guns. It cannot be explained how the cannon had been transported to Fort Loudon as early as 1756. They could not have been brought down the Ohio and up the Tennessee, for the French were in possession of the mouth of the Tennessee. The only plausible explanation that can be given is that these cannon were carried across the mountains from Augusta county when reinforcements were sent to Fort Loudon, and then along Indian trails upon pack horses. It is possible that these cannon were brought from Fort Lewis to the head waters of the Holston and carried down the same in boats or canoes to the mouth of the Holston, and thence up the Little Tennessee to Fort Loudon. It is sad to contemplate the fate of the occupants of this the first Anglo-American fort established in Tennessee. It does not appear that the fort at Long Island was permanently occupied at this time. About this time, large numbers of hunters from Eastern Virginia, allured by the report of the abundance of game and the prospect of gain in the western wilderness, organized themselves into companies, and hunted throughout Southwest Virginia, East Tennessee and Eastern Kentucky. The first company of hunters who visited this section, as far as I can ascertain, was a company organized by Elisha Wallen (from whom Wallen's Creek and Wallen's Ridge received their names, as well as Wallen's Station in Lee county), accompanied by Scaggs, Blevins, Cox and others. They remained eighteen months, during which time they hunted in Clinch and Powell's Valleys in Virginia, and Carter's Valley in Tennessee, and went as far as Laurel mountain in Kentucky. About the same time Daniel Boone, accompanied by several hunters, visited the Holston and camped the first night in what is now known as Taylor's Valley. On the succeeding day, they hunted down the South Fork of Holston river and traveled thence to what was thereafter known as Wolf' Hills, where they encamped the second night, near where Black's Fort was afterwards built. It is interesting to note at this point that Daniel Boone and his companion, immediately after nightfall, were troubled by the appearance of great numbers of wolves, which assailed their dogs with such fury that it was with great difficulty that the hunters succeeded in repelling their attacks and saving the lives of their dogs, a number of which were killed or badly crippled by the wolves. The wolves had their home in the cave that underlies the town of Abingdon. The entrance to this cave is upon the lot now occupied by the residence of Capt. James L. White, and it was from this incident that Abingdon received its first name, Wolf Hills. Boone and his companion remained at Abingdon for a short while, during which time they disagreed and separated, Boone taking the Indian trail leading to Long Island, and Nathaniel Gist, his companion, following the Indian trail to Cumberland Gap. They did not meet again upon this trip. On Boon's creek in East Tennessee was found a tree upon which was found the following inscription: "D. Boon cilled a bar on this tree in the year 1760"; and near Long Island in Tennessee a tree was found in recent years upon which was the following inscription: "D. Boon killa bar on this tree 1773." A block containing the last inscription was taken from this tree and is now in possession of Mrs. James W. Preston, of Abingdon, and establishes the fact that Daniel Boone was upon the waters of the Holston as early as 1760, and again in 1773. A treaty of peace was concluded between the French and English at Fontainbleau, in 1762, by which the English acquired Canada and that portion of the Mississippi Valley east of that river, but Daniel Boone and Boone Trees. peace was not concluded with the Indians until the next year. The Indians had become accustomed to bloodshed and greatly detested the Anglo-American settlers. They were greatly exasperated by the cession of Canada to the English and at the French for deserting them. The Indians detested the Anglo-American settlers for the very evident reason that they asserted title to all the lands lying upon the western waters, were building forts at various places upon the frontiers and manning them with British troops, and because their settlers were occupying the favorite hunting grounds of the Indians. The Indians, being deprived of the more moderate counsel of their French allies, therefore became more brutal and savage in their conduct towards the settlers, and so active and intelligent were the Indians in conducting their campaigns against the settlements that all the land lying along the waters of the Mississippi was depopulated by July, 1763, except a small settlement at Draper's Meadows, on New river. The condition of the country at that time is best described by a letter of Col. Wm. Preston, which letter is here published. The letter is dated Greenfield, 27th July, 1763. The writer says: "Our situation at present is very different from what it was when we had the pleasure of your company in this country. All the valleys of Roanoke river and along the waters of the Mississippi are depopulated, except Captain English with a few families on the New river, who have built a fort, among whom are Mr. Thompson and his family, alone remaining. They intend to make a stand till some assistance be sent them. Seventy-five of the Bedford militia went out in order to pursue the enemy, but I hear the officers and part of the men are gone home, and the rest gone to Reed creek to help in the family of James Davis and in two or three other families there that dare not venture to travel. "I have built a little fort in which are eighty-seven persons, twenty of whom bear arms. We are in a pretty good posture of defence, and with the aid of God are determined to make a stand. In five or six other places in this part of the country they have fallen into the same method and with the same resolution. How long we may keep them is uncertain. No enemy have appeared here as yet. Their guns are frequently heard and their footing observed, which makes us believe they will pay us a visit. My two sisters and their families are here and all in good health. We bear our misfortunes so far with * * * and are in hopes of being relieved I have a thousand things * * * Captain Christian can't wait * * * I give you joy." (The asterisks indicate parts of the letter torn out.) In the year 1760, a party of Indians, numbering eight or ten, crossed the Blue Ridge and murdered a number of people in Bedford county, took several women and children prisoners and returned by way of New river. A man in the New river settlement, while searching for stray horses, discovered the Indians encamped about six miles from the New river fort, of which information was given to William Inglis, who gathered sixteen or eighteen men and proceeded to attack the Indians, about daybreak the next morning. A considerable battle followed, in which one white man and seven Indians were killed, the rest of the Indians making their escape. Capt. Inglis and his men secured all the provisions and plunder of the Indians. The western settlements for ten years enjoyed comparative peace from the Indians. The only trouble they had to contend with was from parties of thieving Indians that occasionally visited the settlements. The British Government previously to 1763 claimed the lands lying west of the Alleghany mountains by right of the discovery of John Cabot made in 1497, and at no time recognized the claims of the Indian inhabitants to these lands. In the treaty concluded with France in 1762, while France ceded to England all her rights in this territory, still no provision was made for extinguishing the Indian title thereto, and the Indians denied the right of France to cede England these lands. In March, 1764, a company of Indians visited the home of David Cloyd, about five miles west of the present Fincastle, Va., and tomahawked Mrs. Cloyd, killed John Cloyd, destroyed the entire household, and carried off a large sum of money that belonged to David Cloyd. Mrs. Cloyd lived until the next morning and told all the circumstances connected with the raid. Before dying she told how an Indian had taken up a cob and wiped the blood from her temples, exclaiming "Poor old woman!" This company of Indians were pursued by a company of militia under Capt. James Montgomery, and one of the Indians was killed on John's creek about thirty miles from Cloyd's house, with £137 18s. on his person. A dispute arose among the militia as to the ownership of the money and it was deposited in the hands of Capt. James Montgomery until the matter should be decided. We here insert a copy of the court records, which best explains the matter. In Augusta County Court, August Term, 1766. David Cloyd Plaintiff, vs. Recover goods taken by Indians. James Montgomery, Defendant. We agree that a party of Indians made an Irruption into the Colony, attacked the Plaintiff's House, rifled it and bore off upwards of £200 in gold and silver and several household goods and negroes. We agree that a party of the militia pursued the enemy and overtook them on John's creek, a branch of the James river, at the distance of 30 or 35 miles from the Plaintiff's House, and attacked and killed one of the number. We agree that upon searching the Indian's Budgett a quantity of gold, some dollars and pieces of small silver were found, which upon being weighed amounted to the sum of £137 18s. We agree that the money found in the budgett of the Indians consisted of the same coins which the Plaintiff was known to have in his house when plundered by the Indians. We agree that after the money was recovered from the Indians a dispute arose among the militia to whom the money of right belonged, whether it should be delivered to the Pltff. who was deemed to have been the owner of it before it fell into the hands of the Indians, or whether the militia were entitled to it as having recovered it from them, upon which dispute that sum of money was lodged in the hands of the Defendant to be by him kept till that point should be settled. We agree that the Plaintiff made an offer of 30 shillings to each of the men who had assisted in the pursuit of the Enemy. We agree that a part of the Company of Militia made an offer to the Plaintiff of delivering up his negroes and household goods if he would allow them the money. We agree that the Defendant paid the sum of money out of his hands to the Militia and that several of them returned their dividends to the Plaintiff amounting to the sum of £106.17.2. We agree that the Plaintiff paid to several of the captors who returned him their dividends the sum of 30s. the premium by him before offered for their service. We agree that if the law be for the Plaintiff that Judgment be entered for him for the sum of £31.0.10, if the Law be for the Defendant we agree that Judgment be entered for him. Gabriel Jones, Atty. for Pltff. Peter Hogg, Atty. for Deft. We have no further account of Indians invading Southwest Virginia, until the year 1764, at which time a party of Indians came up Sandy and on to New river, where they divided, one party going towards the settlements at Roanoke and Catawba, the other to the settlement on Jackson river. The company of Indians that went towards the Roanoke settlement were accidentally discovered by Captain Paul and a company of twenty men, at midnight, on the New river, near the mouth of Indian creek. Capt. Paul's men fired upon the Indians, killing three and wounding many others; the rest fled and escaped. It is hard to depict the effect of these terrible scenes upon the settlers of Western Virginia. Among the prisoners rescued by Capt. Paul was a Mrs. Green, who knew Capt. Paul and recognized his voice. She was mistaken for an Indian squaw by one of Capt. Paul's men, who was in the act of tomahawking her, when she called the name of Capt. Paul, which saved her alive. She was asked why she made no resistance; to which she replied, "I would as soon die as not; my husband is murdered, my children slain, my parents are dead; I have not a relative in America, everything dear to me is gone. I have no wishes, no hopes, no fears. I would not rise to my feet to save my life." The English Government was exceedingly anxious to secure peace with the Indians, and this year Col. Boquet published a royal proclamation forbidding the whites to settle or hunt west of the Alleghany mountains; which read as follows: "And we do strictly enjoin and require all persons whatsoever, who have, either willfully or inadvertently, seated themselves upon any lands within the Countries above described (West of the Alleghany mountains), or upon any other lands which not having been ceded to, or purchased by us, are still reserved to said Indians as aforesaid, forthwith to remove themselves from said settelments." This proclamation was issued in October, 1764, but it failed to accomplish the object in view, and thereupon, in the year 1765, two armed movements were made into the Indian Territory, the one to Lake Erie and the other to the Muskingum. Two treaties were made with the Indians in the autumn of this year, one at Niagara and the other at the Muskingum. The treaty signed at the Muskingum was negotiated by Col. Boquet with the Delaware and Shawnese Indians. At the time of the signing of this treaty, Col. Boquet received from the Indians two hundred and six prisoners, ninety Virginians from West Augusta and one hundred and sixteen Pennsylvanians. And thus was concluded at the end of ten years of hard fighting the French-Indian war, which began in 1754. If the British Government was candid in the promulgation of the proclamation of 1763, she thereby admitted the claims of the Indians, and accomplished nothing as a result of the ten years' war with the French and Indians just closed. After the publication of this proclamation, the citizens of the Colonies became criminals when they, in any way, trespassed upon any of the lands on the waters of the Mississippi. Nevertheless, the frontier hunters and the western settlers proceeded with their explorations as if that proclamation had never been issued, and some historians go as far as to say that even the leading public men of that day did not consider this proclamation binding, but as only intended to appease the apprehensions of the Indians, but in this opinion we cannot join. Whatever may have been the intention of the proclamation, it is certain that its effect was to greatly retard the settlements of the lands west of the mountains. The "Loyal Land Company" on the 25th day of May, 1763, petitioned the Governor and Council for a renewal and confirmation of the grant made to them for 800,000 acres of land by the Governor and Council of Virginia in 1749, but their petition was denied, upon the ground that they were restricted by his Majesty's instructions from renewing or confirming the grant. From this action of the Governor and Council of Virginia, it may be well said, all the surveys made upon the waters of the Holston and Clinch rivers by James Patton, Dr. Thomas Walker and others and all the patents issued therefor were void, for the reason that the King of England had no right to grant to any of his subjects lands belonging to the Indians. Nevertheless, Dr. Walker, agent for the "Loyal Land Company," and the devisees of Col. James Patton, immediately proceeded to survey and sell lands upon the waters of the Holston and Clinch rivers, under their grants, as if they had never been restrained from so doing by the proclamation of 1763 and by the action of the Governor and Council of Virginia, and by the 16th day of December, 1773, Dr. Walker, as agent for the "Loyal Company," had actually surveyed and disposed of to purchasers 1,756 tracts of land containing 156,164 acres; and this, in addition to the lands surveyed in the years 1753-'54—making a total of 201,554 acres out of the 800,000 acres granted. In the year 1766, Dr. Walker, as agent for the "Loyal Company," caused advertisements to be distributed through several of the States, north and south, requesting all persons who had contracted for any of the company's land and were driven off their settlements in the former war, to return and claim the same or it would be sold to others. The Legislature of Virginia, in the fall of the year 1778, confirmed the acts of Dr. Walker in the premises to the extent stated, but declined to allow the company any further time or to survey any further lands under this grant. At the same session of the General Assembly of Virginia William Preston and William Thompson, executors of James Patton, deceased, were authorized to complete the grant of 120,000 acres of land made by James Patton, under his grant, and to execute deeds to the purchasers therefor. Nathaniel Gist, a noted Indian trader, in the year 1761, purchased from the Cherokee Indians the Great Island lying in the Holston river, known as Long Island, and claimed the same, under his grant from the Indians, and in the year 1777 he petitioned the Legislature of Virginia to confirm the title thereto to him. What action the Legislature took upon this petition cannot be ascertained, but it may be presumed that the Legislature declined his request, as on the 24th day of June, 1776, the General Assembly of Virginia, with the approval of the Governor, "Resolved, That no purchase of lands within the chartered limits of Virginia shall be made under any pretense whatever, from any Indian tribe or nation, without the approval of the Virginia Legislature." This island was a favorite resort of the Indians, and seemed to have been anxiously sought after by Richard Pearis and Nathaniel Gist, probably two of the best Indian spies and hunters we read of in our early history. From the conclusion of the French-Indian war in December, 1764, until February 13, 1770, nothing of importance occurred beyond the visits of the Long Hunters and the surveyors for the land companies, a few settlements being made. In the year 1765, John Campbell, who afterwards became clerk of the County Court of Washington county, visited the waters of the Holston with Dr. Walker, and purchased for his father, David Campbell, and himself, from John Buchanan, a large tract of land near the head waters of the Holston river, containing 740 acres, called "Royal Oak,"* * Near Marion, Va. and, being the same tract of land surveyed for John Buchanan on the 14th day of October, 1747. Among the settlers that came this year (1768) was Joseph Martin, a daring and enterprising backwoodsman. He was accompanied by a band of from twenty to thirty men, and led them to Powell's Valley, now in Lee county, Va., where they erected a fort upon the north side of a creek, near two fine springs of water, which fort and creek were thereafter called Martin's Fort and Martin's Creek. The shape of the fort was a parallelogram which enclosed about one-half an acre of ground. There were some five or six cabins built about twenty feet apart, with strong stockades between them, and in these stockades there were port-holes. Here they cleared the land and planted corn and other vegetables. In the latter part of the summer of this year the Indians broke them up, and the settlers returned to the waters of the Holston. Martin's Fort was not occupied after the Revolutionary War. Several years thereafter John and Arthur Campbell, accompanied by their sister, Margaret, came out and settled at Royal Oak, and in the year 1769 David Campbell, the father, with his wife and sons, James, David, Robert and Patrick, and his daughters, Mary, Martha, Sarah and Ann, came out and settled at the same place. In the year 1766, a party of hunters visited the Clinch Valley, and two of their number, Carr and Butler, decided to remain. They built a cabin at a place afterwards known as "Crab Orchard," about three miles west of Tazewell Courthouse. In the year 1769, Carr separated from Butler and settled on a beautiful piece of land two miles east of Tazewell Courthouse. While many prospective settlers visited this section previously to 1769, but few permanent settlements were made because of the fact that the Indians claimed, and the English Government admitted their right to all the lands lying west of the mountains, but the frontiers were lined with prospective settlers anxious for an opportunity to take possession of and settle the new land. Great numbers of emigrants were impatiently waiting along the frontiers for an opportunity to make a rush for new homes on the waters of the Mississippi. The British Government recognized the fact that it could not much longer restrain the people and protect the Indians in their rights, and early in the spring of 1768 Sir William Johnson was directed by the home government to negotiate a treaty with the Delaware and the Shawnese Indians. John Stuart, the superintendent of Indian affairs, about the same time was directed to negotiate a treaty with the Southern Indians, extinguishing their rights to the much-desired land. Sir William Johnson, pursuant to order, appointed a Congress for the meeting of the Six Nations with the commissioners of Virginia, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, at Fort Stanwix, near Oswego, New York, on October 24, 1768. The Congress met pursuant to order, and on November 5, 1768, a treaty was negotiated with the Indians, by which they conveyed unto the British Sovereign, Lord King George III, all of a certain tract of land situated in North America at the back of the British settlements, the deed being in the words and figures following, to-wit: To all to whom these presents may come, or may concern: We the Sachems &amp; Chiefs of the Six United Nations and of the Shawnese, Delawares, Mingoes, of Ohio and other dependent Tribes, on behalf of ourselves and the rest of our several Nations, the Chiefs and Warriors who are now here convened by Sir William Johnson, Baronet, His Majesty's Superintendent of our Affairs, send greeting. Whereas His Majesty was graciously pleased to propose to us in the year 1765, that a Boundary line should be fixed between the English and us, to ascertain and establish our limits and prevent those encroachments of which we have so long and so loudly complained, and to put a stop to the many fraudulent advantages which had been so often taken of us in Land affairs, which Boundary appearing to us as a wise and good measure, we did then agree to a part of a line and promised to settle the whole finally whensoever Sir Wm. Johnson should be fully empowered to trade with us for that purpose. And whereas his said Majesty has at length given Sir William Johnson orders, Sir William Johnson has convened the Chiefs and Warriors of our respective Nations, who are the true and absolute proprietors of the lands in question and who are here now to a very considerable number, and whereas many uneasinesses and doubts have arisen amongst us, which have given rise to apprehension that the line may not be strictly observed on the part of the English, in which case matters might be worse than before, which apprehensions together with the dependent state of some of our Tribes, and other circumstances which retarded the settlement and became the subject of some debate, Sir Wm. Johnson has at length so far satisfied us as to induce us to come to an agreement concerning the line, which brought to a conclusion. The whole being explained to us in a large assembly of our people, and before Sir William Johnson, and in the presence of his Excellency the Governor of New Jersey, the Commissioners for the Provinces of Virginia and Pennsylvania, and sundry other gentlemen, by which line, so agreed upon, a considerable tract of country along several provinces is to be thus ceded to his Majesty which we are induced to and do ratify and confirm to his said Majesty, from the expectation and confidence we place in his royal goodness, and he will graciously comply with our humble request, as the same is expressed in the speech of the several Nations addressed to his Majesty through Sir William Johnson, on Tuesday the first of the present month of November, wherein we have declared our expectations of the continuance of his Majesty's favor, and our desire that our ancient engagements be observed and our affairs attended to by the officer who has the management thereof, enabling him to discharge all these matters properly for our interest. That the lands occupied by the Mohocks around their villages, as well as by any other Nation affected by this our cession, may effectually remain to them and to their posterity, and that any engagements regarding property that they may now be under, may be prosecuted and our present grants deemed valid on our parts, with the several other humble requests contained in our speech. And whereas at the settling of the said line, it appears that the line described by his Majesty's order, was not extended Northward of Oswego, or to the Southward of Great Kanawha River, we have agreed to continue the line to the Northward, on the supposition that it was omitted by reason of our not having come to any determination concerning its course at the Congress held in 1765, inasmuch as the "line to the Northward became the most necessary of any for preventing the encroachments at our very towns and residences, and we have given this line more favorable to Pennsylvania for the reasons and considerations mentioned in the treaty. We have likewise continued it South to Cherokee River,"* * Holston river. because the same is and we do declare it to be our true bounds with the Southern Indians, and that we have undoubted right to the country as far south as that River, which makes our cession to his Majesty much more advantageous than that proposed. Now therefore know ye, that we, the Sachems and Chiefs beforementioned, native Indians and proprietors of the lands hereinafter described, for and in behalf of ourselves and the whole of our Confederacy, for the consideration hereinbefore mentioned and also for and in consideration of a valuable present of the several articles in use and among the Indians, which, together with a large sum of money, amounting in the whole to the sum of £10,460 7s 3 pence, sterling, to us now delivered and paid by Sir William Johnson, Baronet, his Majesty's Sole Agent and Superintendent of Indian Affairs, for the Northern Department of America, in the name and on behalf of our Sovereign Lord, George Third, by the grace of God, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, the receipt whereof we do hereby acknowledge, we the said Indians have for us, our heirs and successors, granted, bargained, sold, released and confirmed, and by these presents, do grant, bargain, sell, release and confirm, unto our said Sovereign Lord, King George Third, all that tract of land situated in North America at the back of the British settlements bounded by a line which we have now agreed upon, and do hereby establish as the boundary between us and the British Colonies in America, beginning at the mouth of the Cherokee or Hogohegee River, where it empties into the River Ohio, and running from thence along the Southern side of the said River to Kittanning, which is above Fort Pitt, from thence by a direct line to the nearest fork of the West Branch of the Susquehanna, thence through the Alleghany Mountains along the Southern side of the said West Branch until it comes opposite to the mouth of a creek called Tiadgton, thence across the West Branch, and along the South Side of that creek and along the North side of the Burnett Hills to a creek called Awandae, thence down the same to the East side of that River to Oswego, from thence East to the Delaware River, and up that River to opposite where Tianadhera flows into the Susquehanna, thence to Tianahedra and up the West side thereof, and the West side of its West Branch to the head thereof, and thence by a direct line to Canada Creek, where it empties into the Wood Creek at the West End of the carrying place, beyond Fort Stanwix, and extending Eastward from every part of the said line as far as the lands formerly purchased so as to comprehend the whole of the lands or settlement, except what is within the Province of Pennsylvania, together with the hereditaments, and appurtenances to the same belonging or appertaining in the fullest and most ample manner, and all the Estate, Right, Title, Interest, Property, possession, Benefit and claim and demand, either in law or equity, of each and every one of us, in and of the same, or any part thereof, to have and to hold, the whole lands and premises hereby granted, bargained, sold, released and confirmed as aforesaid with the hereditaments and appurtenances thereunto belonging, under the reservations made in the Treaty, unto our Sovereign Lord, King George Third, his heirs and successors to and for his and their behoof forever. In witness whereof, we the Chiefs of the Confederacy, have hereunto set our marks and seals at Fort Stanwix, the 5th day of November, 1768, in the 9th year of his Majesty's reign. Signed, Sealed and delivered, In presence of Sir William Franklin, Gov. N. J. Fred Smith, Chief Justice, Thos. Walker, Commiss'r from Va. Richard Peters, Of the Council, James Tilghman, His Texanasore, or Abraham, [L. S.] Mark. His Conaquieso, [L. S.] Mark. His Sugnaregsora, [L. S.] Mark. His Blunt or Chenughita, [L. S.] Mark. His Tigaya, [L. S.] Mark. His Gostrave, [L. S.] Mark. This Congress was attended by 3,200 Indians of the different tribes composing the Six Nations, and thus the title of the Northern Indians to all the territory included within Washington county was extinguished. The Confederacy of the Six Nations claimed, by right of conquest, title to the lands thus ceded. About the year 1685 this Confederacy of Indians overran and conquered all the country southwards from the Ohio as far south as Georgia and as far west as the Mississippi. An immense territory, 1,200 miles long and 600 miles broad. It will be observed from an inspection of this deed that Dr. Thomas Walker was the Virginia Commissioner at this Congress, and he was beyond question interested in the successful negotiation of this treaty, not only in behalf of Virginia, but to a greater extent in behalf of the "Loyal Land Company," of which he was a part owner and the agent. Nothing was of greater importance to the "Loyal Land Company" than the extinguishment of the title of the Indians to the lands on the western waters, out of which they had a grant for 800,000 acres of land, and from the prosecution of their work in surveying, settling and selling the same, they had been restrained and prohibited by the King's proclamation in 1763, and by the action of the Governor and the Council of Virginia. About the same time John Stuart, Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the South, concluded a treaty with the Cherokee Indians in the absence of Dr. Walker, by which the British Crown acquired the right to all the land lying east of a straight line passing by Chiswell's mine, on the eastern bank of the Great Kanawha* * New River. River, and from Chiswell's mine on the eastern bank of the river in a straight line to the confluence of the Great Conhoway in Ohio. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs communicated the result of the treaty to the Governor of Virginia by letter, which letter is as follows: Hard Labor, Oct. 17, 1768. Sir: I have the honor to acquaint you in obedience to his Majesty's commands, on the 13th curr't, I met at this place all the principal Chiefs of the upper and lower Cherokee Nations, and on the 14th by his Majesty's royal authority concluded the Treaty with said Indians, ratifying the cession of land lying within the Provinces of South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia by them to his Majesty and His heirs forever, and confirming the Boundary line marked by the Lords Commissioners of Trade and Plantations, according to the several agreements entered into with said Indians. The line now ultimately confirmed and ratified by said Treaty was as follows: From the place called Towahilie, on the Northern Branch of the Savannah River, a North 50 degrees East course in a straight line, to a place called Dewisses corner, or yellow water, from Dewisses, or yellow water, a North 50 degrees East course in a straight line to the south bank of Reedy River, at a place called Wanghoe, or Elm Tree, where the line behind Carolina terminates. From a place called Wanghoe, or Elm Tree, to the South Bank of Reedy River, a course in a straight line to a mountain called Tagon Mountain where the great ridge of the mountains becomes impervious. In a straight line to Chiswell's mine on the Eastern Bank of the Great Conhoway River, to a N. B. E. course, and from Chiswell's mine on the Eastern Bank of the Great Conhoway in a straight line to a North course to the confluence of the Great Conhoway with the Ohio. As soon as possible after my return to Charlestown I shall send you extracts of my conference and an authentic copy of the above mentioned Treaty concluded with said Chiefs. I acquainted the Chiefs that I expected their Deputies to set out immediately from this place with my Deputy to meet your Commissioners at Colonel Chiswell's Mine in order to finish marking the Boundary line, as agreed upon, but they objected, and desired that that service might be deferred till the spring of next year. The reasons they urged for this delay are as follows: That when they set the 10th of November for the time of meeting your Commissioners to proceed upon that important service, they understood that they had no more to mark than from the mountains where the line behind North Carolina was, to Chiswell's Mine on the Conhoway, as they considered the river from there to its confluence with the Ohio as a natural Boundary. But as the line is to run in a straight line, almost due North from the Mine, to the mouth of the river, the advanced season of the year will render that service impracticable until the Spring, as the line now ultimately agreed upon runs through a large extent of mountainous country, uninhabited, where in the winter the cold will be extremely intense, and there will be no shelter for men, nor food for horses at that season. The reasons appeared to me so just and good, that I was obliged to acquiesce in them, and I send this letter by Express to prevent, as much as possible, any disappointment that may result from this alteration. I hope you will receive it in time to prevent your Commissioners from setting out. The Chiefs have appointed the 10th of May next for meeting your Commissioners at Chiswell's Mine, which I hope will prove agreeable and their reasons for altering the time satisfactory to you. I reproached the Cherokees severely for the murder of five emigrants from your provinces, who were going to the Mississippi, which was committed in the summer last. They confessed it and said the perpetrators were a party of Chilhowie people who urged in their own defence, that their relations had been killed in Augusta County, in the province, in 1765, for which they had never received any satisfaction although repeated promises had been made either of putting the guilty persons to death, or making a compensation in goods from your province, which they believed, because I had confirmed them. That they nevertheless were disappointed, and being tired with waiting, took that satisfaction which they could not obtain from our justice. All the warriors declared that they disapproved of the action, but that the Chilhowie people were authorized by the custom of their country to act as they did, and their idea of never having received any satisfaction was undeniable; that in any other instance nothing should prevent their executing strict justice according to Treaties. It is not only extremely disagreeable to myself, but very detrimental to his Majesty's service, to be obliged to fail in any promise I make to Indians. The compensation of 500 Indian dressed Deer skins value in goods for every person murdered, which on the faith of Gov. Fauquier's repeated letters, I engaged them to receive, early in the Spring, was extremely moderate, and this you will acknowledge if you will compare it with the sum expended by the Province of Pennsylvania, on a late similar occasion. And I must confess that this disappointment will render me extremely cautious in making promises on any future occasion. I am to meet the Chiefs of the Upper and Lower Creek Nations at Silver Bluff on Savannah River, the first of November, to ratify the cessions to his Majesty in the two Floridas and Georgia, and expect to be at Charlestown by the time the bearer can return there. I have the honor of being, very respected Sir, Your most obedient and very humble servant, John Stuart. It will be observed from a perusal of the above letter that the superintendent contemplated the running of the line, as fixed by the treaty, immediately, but the Indians insisted upon postponing the time for running this line till the 10th day of May, 1769. This treaty gave great dissatisfaction to the Colony of Virginia and to Dr. Walker, the agent for the "Loyal Land Company," for, at the time the treaty was negotiated, hundreds of settlers had fixed their homes on the lands west of the line as fixed, and not only had many settlers occupied portions of these lands, but Dr. Walker as agent for the "Loyal Land Company," and Col. James Patton's representatives, had actually surveyed and sold large and numerous tracts of land lying in the present counties of Pulaski, Wythe, Smyth and Washington, and west of the line fixed by this treaty. The result of this treaty gave the Indians an excuse for depredating on the settlers, and the settlers were forced to the necessity of denying the rights of the Cherokee Indians to the lands thus settled. The settlers on Holston denied the right of the Cherokees to the lands included within this county, and under the claim that the lands belonged to the Confederacy of the Six Nations, they held possession of their lands and continued their settlements. Dr. Thomas Walker acted as the Virginia representative in the making of the treaty at Fort Stanwix in the fall of the year 1768 and, by December of that year, had communicated the result to the emigrants along the borders, and no longer could the settlement of this country be postponed. In the winter of 1768 and the early part of the year 1769, a great flood of settlers overran Southwestern Virginia and advanced as far south as Boone's Creek in East Tennessee. The one settler who ventured farthest into the wilderness was Captain William Bean, who, with his family, settled on Boone's Creek, early in the year 1769. His son, Russell Bean, was the first white child born in Tennessee. When Col. William Byrd visited the Long Island in 1760, two men, by name Gilbert Christian and William Anderson, accompanied his regiment. In this year, 1769, Christian and Anderson determined to explore this western wilderness, and, in company with Col. John Sawyers and four others, they crossed the North Fork of the Holston river at Cloud's Fort in Tennessee and explored the wilderness as far as Big Creek, now a part of Hawkins county, where they met a large body of Indians, at which point they determined to return to their homes. About twenty miles above Cloud's Fort, on the North Fork, they found a cabin on every spot where the range was good, where only six weeks before nothing was to be seen but a howling wilderness. When they passed by before, on their outward destination, they found no settlers on Holston, save three families on the head springs of that river. Just preceding this inrush of settlers, a young Englishman by the name of Smith visited this section of Virginia and describes the country, as he found it, in such an excellent manner that I here copy in full his remarks upon the appearance of the country, as well as the daily journal which he kept. When he had reached the summit of the mountains above New river, he thus speaks of the view presented: "Language fails in attempting to describe this most astounding and almost unbounded prospective. The mind was filled with a reverential awe, but at the same time the ideas, and I had almost said soul, were sensibly enlarged. The reflection on our own littleness did not diminish our intellectual faculties nor consequences, and the mind would boldly soar over the vast extent of the earth and water around, and even above the globe itself, to contemplate and admire the amazing works of the great Creator of all. In short, the strong, mighty, pointed and extended sensations of the mind at this astonishing period are far beyond the power of human language to describe or convey any idea of. On the northwest you will observe with great astonishment and pleasure the tremendous and abrupt break in the Alleghany mountains, through which pass the mighty waters of New river and the Great Kanawha. On the west you can very plainly discover the three forks or branches of the Holston, where they break through the great Alleghany mountains, forming striking and awful chasms. And still beyond them you may observe Clinch river, or Pellisippi; that it is almost equal to all three branches of the Holston. Throughout the whole of this amazing and most extensive perspective there is not the least feature or trace of art or improvements to be discovered. All are the genuine effects of nature alone, and laid down on her most extended and grandest scale. Contemplating them fills the eye, engrosses the mind and enlarges the soul. It totally absorbs the senses, overwhelms all the faculties, expands even the grandest ideas beyond all conception and causes you almost to forget that you are a human creature." He then proceeds to give the details of his journey through this section of Virginia: "We descended the mountain, and halted for the night on the side of a large rivulet, which we conjectured to be either Little river itself, or some of the waters of it, having crossed the Blue ridge at a most disagreeable and dangerous gap in the afternoon. Next morning we set out early and traveled down the north side of the rivulet, which we found to be Little river, until we arrived at New river and at last came to the ford. The New river is broad, deep and rapid, frequently impassable and always dangerous. However, we crossed it in safety, though with great difficulty and hazard of being carried down with the stream, and we looked out for a convenient spot on the west side, where we now are, to remain for the night. The low ground on New river is narrow, but exceedingly rich and fertile; the high land is also very fine in many places, but excessively broken, rocky and mountainous. The timber on the high land is very large and lofty, and that on the low ground is almost equal to the prodigious heavy trees on the Roanoke river. The extreme roughness of this country and the difficulty of access to it, the roads, or rather paths, being not only almost impassable, but totally impossible ever to be rendered even tolerable by any human efforts, will not only greatly retard the settlement of this country, but will always reduce the price and value of the land, be it ever so rich and fertile. In the morning our horses and ourselves being very much refreshed, we set out again on our journey, and, after traveling ten or twelve miles, crossed a pretty large water course named Peaks' creek, and soon afterwards a large branch of Reed creek. In the afternoon we crossed another great ridge of the Alleghany mountains at a gap, and in the evening came to the waters of the Middle Fork of the Holston, where we halted for the night, having traveled this day nearly fifty miles and over a vast quantity of excellent land. Next morning we pursued our journey and traveled down the side of the Middle Fork of the Holston, which we crossed no less than three times this day, and at night came to Stalnaker's, where a few people, indeed all the inhabitants, had also erected a kind of wretched stockade fort for protection against the Indians; but they had all left it a few days before our arrival and returned to their respective homes. Here we remained for two days at the old Dutchman's house for rest and refreshment for ourselves and horses, which we had really very much need of, and also to make inquiry concerning our future route. The land on the Holston is certainly excellent and fertile in the highest degree; the climate also is delightful. But the value of the estates here cannot be considerable for many years—perhaps centuries to come; for the same roughness that has been mentioned to affect those on New river. Here we gained intelligence of a nearer way to Kentucky than that commonly made use of, which had very lately been discovered, viz.: by crossing Clinch river about sixty miles from Stalnaker's, going over the great ridge of the Alleghany, or Appalachian mountains, at a gap which had been used only by a few of the best hunters, and falling down on the waters of the Warrior's branch, a river that runs into Kentucky. With this route pretty exactly laid down, we set out from the Dutchman's house on the third morning after our arrival, and, after traveling over a vast quantity of exceedingly strong, rich land covered with lofty timber, we reached the banks of the North Branch of the Holston, crossed the river, and put up for the night, having traveled that day more than thirty miles. The ford of this branch of the Holston is, if possible, worse than any we have hitherto met with, and is indeed extremely dangerous, but we were so familiarized to danger and fatigue as to regard anything of that nature but little. On the next morning we set out on our journey by the route which we had been directed to pursue, and at noon arrived at the summit of a vast chain of mountains which separates the north branch of the Holston from the Clinch river. Here we had the pleasure of enjoying an extensive, wild and romantic view, particularly that stupendous ridge of the Alleghany, or Appalachian mountains, which is the chief and most lofty of the whole. It was rendered more interesting to me by reflecting that I must cross it on my journey, our route being directly over it. We made no unnecessary delay, however, on this commanding spot, but descended the mountain and pursued with all the expedition we could; and we arrived on the banks of Clinch river late that evening, so that we could not venture to cross the ford that night. In the morning we undertook the hazardous task of fording Clinch river, and accomplished it after several plunges, as usual, over our heads: neither did we halt to dry our clothes until noon, when we rested at the side of a savannah (meadow); here we remained for two hours, and then arose exceedingly refreshed, and pursued our journey. On the evening we had reached half way up the stupendous westernmost ridge of the Alleghany mountains, the last, greatest and loftiest of the whole. Here we remained all night, concluding to attempt the steepest and most difficult ascent in the morning. We always alighted, and led our horses up these prodigious and perilous ascents. We pursued our journey up the mountain next morning, but the sun was several hours high before we could possibly reach the summit. This ridge of the Alleghany mountains is indeed of a most stupendous and astonishing height, and commands a prospect proportionately extensive. I took a retrospective view, with satisfaction and pleasure, of the vast chain of mountains beyond Clinch river, which I had crossed, and I looked forward, with interested anxiety and eagerness, toward the great ridge of mountains which I had still to pass over. The summit of this ridge is the most lofty of all the Alleghany, is nearly a mile wide, and consists of excellent strong, rich land of a deep red or a dark reddish-brown color, with very large, tall timber; and there are springs of water almost on the very summit of the mountains. When we rested that night we were on the waters of Warrior's branch." We give no more of this diary, for our traveler has now passed beyond the limits of the original bounds of Washington county. The Governor of Virginia, upon the receipt of the letter from John Stuart, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, immediately set about to undo what had been done by the treaty at Hard Labor, S. C. He thereupon commissioned Colonel Andrew Lewis and Dr. Thomas Walker to visit the Indians and secure a new line from them. On the 5th day of January, 1769, they began their journey to South Carolina for the purpose of seeing the Indians and negotiating with them. Dr. Walker and Colonel Lewis returned to their homes in the month of February and made a report to Lord Botetourt, which report we here copy in full, as it is very interesting, and explains fully what was done: My Lord,—On receiving your Excellency's instructions, we began our journey to Charlestown, South Carolina; on the fifth day of January, we waited on his Excellency, William Tryon, Esq., at Brunswick, by whom we were kindly received and promised all the assistance in his power; on the next day we went to Fort Johnson, near the mouth of Cape Fear River. On the 8th, Gov. Tryon wrote us that some Cherokee Indians were at Brunswick, that Judds Friend and Salue, or the Young warrior of Estitoe, were two of them, and that they would wait up at Fort Johnston. His Excellency was again invited to go with them. On their arrival we informed them we were going to their father, John Stuart, Esq., on business relative to the Nation, and should be glad to have their company, and they readily agreed to come with us. On the 9th the officer we had engaged was ready to sail, and we embarked with the two Cherokee Chiefs, two Squaws and an Interpreter. On the 11th, we waited on Mr. Stuart, delivered your Lordship's letter and full information of our business. In answer Mr. Stuart told us that the Boundary between the Cherokees and Virginia was fully settled and ratified in Great Britain, and that any proposal of that kind would be very alarming to them, but after some time agreed that we might mention it to them, which we did on the 13th of Jan'y. The Indian Chiefs appeared much pleased, and agreed to wait on Mr. Stuart with us, and in his presence, Judds Friend spoke as follows: Father,—On an invitation from Governor Tryon, we left our country some time since; Our two elder Brothers, Col. Lewis and Doctor Walker, from Virginia, who had matters of importance to mention to us, that equally concerned our people as well as theirs. His news gave us great joy, and we lost no time in waiting on them, and with great pleasure took passage with them in order to wait on you on the business which was much concerning us, as well as their people, and to convince you that we like their talk, we now take them by the hand giving them a welcome, and present them with this string of Wampum. Father,—They tell us that by running the line lately mentioned, as a boundary between our people and Virginia, a great number of their people will fall within the bounds of our country, which would greatly distress these our poor Brothers; which is far from our intention. And to evidence to you, that we are on all occasions, willing to testify our brotherly affection towards them, we are heartily willing to join in any such negotiations as may be thought necessary and most expedient for fixing a new Boundary, that may include all those people settled in our lands in the bounds of Virginia, and we now give them in the presence of you our Father, this string of Wampum as an assurance that those people shall remain in peaceable possession of those lands, until a treaty is held for fixing a new Boundary, between them and our people. Gives a string of Wampum. We then delivered the following Talk to the Warriors, to be by them communicated to their Nation. To the Chiefs of the Cherokees: Brothers,—On the 20th day of December last, being in Williamsburg, we received instructions from Lord Botetourt, a great and good man, whom the great King George has sent to preside over his Colony of Virginia, directing us to wait on your father, John Stuart, Esq., Supt. Indian Affairs, in order to have a plan agreed upon for fixing a new Boundary between your people and his Majesty's subjects in the Colony of Virginia. On our way to the place, to our great joy, we met with our good brothers, Judds Friend and the Warrior of Estitoe, who with great readiness took a passage with us from Governor Tryon, to this place where we had the happiness to wait upon your father, Mr. Stuart, and with joint application, represented to him the necessity of taking such measures as may effectually prevent any misunderstanding that might arise between his Majesty's subjects of the Colony of Virginia and our brothers the Cherokees, until a full treaty be appointed and held for the fixing a new Boundary that may give equal justice and satisfaction to the parties concerned, and that his Majesty's subjects, now settled on the lands between Chiswell's Mines, and the Great Island of Holston River, remain in peaceable possession of said lands, until a line is run between them and our good brothers the Cherokees, who will receive full satisfaction for such lands as you, our brothers, shall convey to our Great King for the use of his subjects. Your Father, Mr. Stuart's, message to you on this head makes it needless for us to say any more on this subject. He will let you, at a proper time, know both the time and place where this great work shall be brought into execution. We have the pleasure to inform you that your two great Warriors now present, have heartily concurred with us in every measure and make no doubt of such measures giving great satisfaction to the whole Nation. Gave a string of Wampum. Jan. 16th. In answer to which, Judds Friend and the Warrior of Estitoe spoke as follows: Father: and our Brothers from Virginia,—We have heard your Talks, which we think very good, and shall with all convenient speed return to our Nation, and when our Chiefs are assembled shall lay these Talks before them. Brothers,—We are sorry to have it to say, that for some time bad blood and evil actions prevailed amongst us, which occasioned a stroke from our Elder Brothers; but now we have the satisfaction of telling you that our hands are good and straight, and you may depend on their continuing so, and, that you may depend the more on what we say, we take off these black beads from the end of this string, that nothing may remain but what is pure and white, and now put the black beads in your hands, which we call the remains of our evil thoughts, and desire you may now cast them away, that they may never be had in remembrance more. Brothers,—We shall with great pleasure comply with the request that you have made with regard to the lands you have mentioned, and shall wait with impatience for a general meeting, that we may have opportunity for convincing our Elder Brothers of our friendly disposition towards them, as we may be of real use to them, for to us it is of little or none, as we never hunt there; the deer do not live in the mountains, and you, in the meantime, may depend that your people shall enjoy peaceable possession until we make a Treaty with the Great King. Brothers,—We hope the measures now taken will be productive of many advantages to our people, as well as those who by living so much nearer to us, will have it in their power to supply us with goods, for we are often imposed upon greatly, as we have no trade at present but with this Province, and we hope you, our Brothers, will signify to your Governor, whom we believe to be that great and good man you mention, our great desire to have a trade with Virginia, that after this business is happily finished, which we make no doubt of on the part of our Nation, we may enjoy a friendly intercourse and have an advantageous trade with our Brothers, the Inhabitants of Virginia. Brothers,—We have often joined you in war against your enemies and you may always depend on our assistance on any future occasion. Gives a string of Wampum. After we had given Mr. Stuart the reasons for thinking it absolutely necessary that the new Boundary should be agreed upon, he desired us to commit these reasons in writing and sign them: which we did in the following words: Sir,— His Excellency, the Right Honorable Norborne, the Lord Botetourt, Governor in Chief of the Colony of Virginia, and the King's Council of that Dominion, having ordered us to wait on you and assist in settling the Boundary line between that Colony and the Cherokee Indians, we beg leave to inform you that the line proposed to be marked from Chiswell's Mines to the confluence of the Great Kanawha and the Ohio, would be a great disadvantage to the Crown of Great Britain, and would injure many subjects of Britain that now inhabit that part of the frontier, and have in making that settlement complied with every known rule of government and the laws of that Colony. Lands were first granted on the waters of the Mississippi by Sir William Gooch of Virginia, and the Council about the year 1746, in consequence of instructions from England, and many families settled on the lands so granted. In the year 1752, the Legislature of Virginia passed an act to encourage settlers on the waters of the Mississippi. By that act they were exempted from the payment of taxes for ten years. To this act his late Majesty, of glorious memory, gives assent. The next year another act was passed, by which five years' indulgence was added, and in that or the succeeding year Robert Dinwiddie, Esq., Governor of Virginia at that time, received instructions from King George 2nd. to grant lands on these waters, exempted from the payment of the usual right money and free from Quit-rents for ten years. Under these encouragements was that part of the Colony settled. Whilst the inhabitants were settling on these lands, the Cherokee Indians were frequently at their habitations, and never that we, either of us, ever heard made the slightest complaint of our settling, or laid any claim to the lands we settled, until November, 1763, after the King's proclamation issued in that year. The Six Nations both claimed the lands that were settled on the branches of the rivers Kanawha and Monongahely and were paid a proper consideration for them at Lancaster, in 1744, when they executed a deed of cession to his late Majesty. We flatter ourselves that the above is sufficient to convince you of the justice and legality of making those settlements. The Boundary line that has been proposed would include many of the inhabitants above mentioned within the limits of the Cherokee Hunting Grounds. For all such lands and improvements, the justice of the crown would be an inducement to make some satisfaction to the owners which would be expense to the crown and injure the inhabitants much and totally ruin many of them, and the evil would be increased by the loss of the Quit-rents paid for these lands, and would also give the Cherokees a large tract of country that was never claimed by them and now is the property of the crown, as Sir William Johnson actually purchased it of the Six United Nations of Indians at a very considerable expense, and took a deed of cession from them at Fort Stanwix, near the head of Mohock's River, on the 5th day of November last. The interest of the crown and the inhabitants of Virginia will be most served by fixing the Boundary with the Cherokees in 36° 30m. North Latitude, that Boundary being already marked by proper authority as far as Steep Rock Creek, a branch of the Cherokee River, and is the proper division between Lord Granville's Proprietary and the Dominion of Virginia, and includes but a small part of the lands now claimed by the Cherokees, they having often disclaimed the lands lying between the Ohio and a ridge of mountains called Sheep Ridge, that divides the waters of the Cumberland River from those of the Cherokee River. This boundary will give room to extend our settlements for ten or twelve years, will raise a considerable sum by the Rights, much increase the Quitrents, and enable the Inhabitants of Virginia to live thus manufacturing such material as they raise. Andrew Lewis, Thomas Walker. Feb. 2nd. 1769. Thus it will appear that Colonel Lewis and Dr. Walker succeeded in securing from the Indian chiefs the assurance that the settlers on the land in Southwest Virginia should remain in peaceable possession of their homes until a treaty could be held fixing new bounds between them. Acting upon this assurance, emigration to the land continued, and during this year James Bryan settled near the present residence of Captain Kendrick, Moab, Va., and erected Bryan's Fort, William Cocke settled upon Spring creek, then called Renfro's creek, and erected Cocke's fort, near the present residence of C. L. Clyce. Anthony Bledsoe settled in the lower end of this county about thirty miles east of Long Island, on the Fort Chiswell road, and afterwards built Bledsoe's Fort. Amos Eaton settled seven miles east of Long Island, where Eaton's Fort was afterwards built, and by the beginning of the year 1770 there were many settlers upon Holston. The first settlers of the Liberty Hall neighborhood were the Edmistons, Moores and Buchanans. The first name was written Edmiston until sixty or seventy years ago. All the land from Liberty Hall to some distance east of Friendship was held by William Edmiston under a grant from Charles II, King of England, and under the King's proclamation of 1763, Edmiston being an officer in the French-Indian war of 1754-1763. Fort Edmiston was built by the settlers as a protection against the Indians, who made frequent inroads on the settlements. As nearly as can be learned, it was built about 1765. The site was about three hundred yards east of Liberty Academy. The old Keys' dwelling, now owned by William Snodgrass, stands on the site of the old fort. A soldier by the name of Edmiston died at the fort and was the first person buried in the old Moore graveyard. The Indians made frequent attacks on the fort and, in one, captured and carried off a Miss Steele. The Indians were followed by parties from the fort, and she was recaptured on Walker's mountain. She was traced by means of twigs, which she had presence of mind enough to break off along the road. Several persons from the fort were in the battle at King's Mountain, among whom were the eight Edmistons and William Moore. Several of the former were killed. They were the ancestors of the Edmondsons of this day. Fort Edmiston was one of the first forts erected in this section. Fort Thompson, six miles northeast of Liberty Hall, on the Huff, formerly the Byars place, was erected about the same time. It was named for Captain James Thompson, who owned the property at that time, and it remained many years after the revolution. Tradition says Fort Edmiston ceased to exist about the year 1800. The first settlers in Widener's Valley were John Widener, Paulser Rouse and John Jones. They came from Germany, a few years prior to the Revolutionary War, or about 1767. They first settled in Pennsylvania, but afterwards came to this country and settled temporarily near Fort Thompson. After remaining there a short time, they removed to the valley. John Widener located near W. M. Widener's mill, and Jones and Rouse in the lower end of the valley. In order to raise money to get away from Germany, John Widener pawned or bartered his son Mike, a boy twelve or fourteen years old. John Widener found employment in Pennsylvania, and earned money enough to redeem Mike. Mike then followed his father to the New World. He arrived just about the commencement of the revolution, joined Washington's army, was a brave soldier, acted as interpreter when the Hessians were captured, and appears to have been a favorite of Washington's, who called him "Mikey." After the revolution Mike followed his father and settled in the valley on what is now known as the Lilburn Widener farm. Mike died at the age of eighty-four. Joel Widener, now living, is a grandson. The present generation are all descendants of John and Mike. Several families of Rouses, descendants of Paulser, still live in the valley. At the time of these early settlements there were a good many Indians hunting and fishing in and near the valley. They were very peaceable, however. Two large Indian camps were established —one on the Middle Fork at a point east of the New Bridge; the other in the lower end of the valley. Of the latter many evidences still remain. John and Michael Fleenor settled in Poor Valley; Casper Fleenor in Rich Valley, on the head waters of what is now called Gasper's creek, and Nicholas Fleenor settled at the Lilburn Fleenor place in Rich Valley, below, Benhams. The four persons named were of German descent and brothers, and are the ancestors of many of our best citizens. At this point it may be appropriate to give a description of the early forts erected by the settlers in the West. My readers will understand by this term, not only a place of defence, but the residence of a small number of families belonging to the neighborhood. As the Indian's mode of warfare was an indiscriminate slaughter of all ages and both sexes, it was as requisite to provide for the safety of the women and children as for that of the men. The fort consisted of cabins, block-houses and stockades. A range of cabins commonly formed one side, at least, of the fort. Divisions or partitions of logs separated the cabins one from another. The walls on the outside were ten or twelve feet high, the slope of the roof being turned wholly inward. Very few of these cabins had plank floors; the greater part were earthen. The block-houses were built at the angles of the fort. They projected about two feet beyond the outer walls of the cabins and stockades. Their upper stories were about eighteen inches, every way, larger in dimension than the under one, leaving an opening at the commencement of the second story to prevent the enemy from making a lodgement under their walls. In some forts, instead of block-houses, the angles of the fort were finished with bastions. A large folding gate, made of thick slabs nearest the spring, closed the fort. The stockades, bastions, cabins and block-house walls were furnished with port-holes at proper heights and distances. The whole of the outside was made bullet-proof. It may be truly said that "necessity is the mother of invention," for the whole of this work was made without the aid of a shingle, nail, or spike of iron, because such things were not to be had. In some places less exposed a single block-house, with a cabin or two, constituted the whole fort.* * Dodridge. In this same year Daniel Boone, John Finley, John Stuart and a few others, as well as numerous other companies of hunters who are of no importance in the history of this country, explored Kentucky and hunted throughout Southwest Virginia, East Tennessee and Eastern Kentucky. In the year 1769 there occurred a circumstance that greatly aided the early settlers of Southwest Virginia and Eastern Tennessee in settling this country and in conquering their Indian neighbors, the Cherokees. The Cherokee Indians were exceedingly overbearing in their disposition and they sought a quarrel with the Chickasaw Indians and invaded their country. When they had reached the Chickasaw Old Fields, they were met by the Chickasaw warriors. After a terrible battle the Cherokees were defeated with great loss and retreated to their own villages. The very flower of the Cherokee Nation were destroyed in this battle, and, the number of their warriors being greatly reduced, for seven years the early settlers were permitted to pursue their course in peace. All of the incidents above related occurred while the lands, now included in Washington county, were a part of Augusta county, but in the year 1769, the House of Burgesses of Virginia passed an act for the division of Augusta county, and all that part of Augusta county lying south and west of the North river, near Lexington, Va., was given the name of Botetourt county, and thus a new county was formed, which included all that part of Virginia in which we live and about which I write. The act establishing Botetourt county provided that from and after the 31st day of January next ensuing, 1770, the said county and parish of Augusta be divided into two counties and parishes by a line beginning at the Blue Ridge, running north 55 degrees west to the confluence of Mary's creek, or the South river, with the north branch of James river, thence up the same to the mouth of Carr's creek, thence up said creek to the mountain, thence north 55 degrees west as far as the courts of the two counties had it extended, and further. Whereas the people situated on the wates of the Missisippi in the said county of Botetourt will be very remote from their courthouse and must necessarily become a separate county as soon as their numbers are sufficient, which probably will happen in a short time, be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid that the inhabitants of that part of said county of Botetourt which lies on the said waters shall be exempted from the payment of any levies to be laid by the said county court for the purpose of building a courthouse and prison for said county. It will thus be seen that the organization of the county of Botetourt was intended to be temporary only.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Capt. Robert Wade marc't from Mayo fort, with 35 men, in order to take a Range to the New River in search of our Enemy Indians. We marcht about three miles that Day to a Plantation, Where Peter Rentfro formerly Lived and took up Camp, where we continued safe that night—Next morning being Sunday, we continued to march about three or four miles, and one Francis New returned back to the Fort, then we had 34 men besides the Capt— We marcht along to a place called Gobeling Town, where we Eat our Brakefast—&amp; so continued our march till late in the afternoon, and took up Camp at the Foot of the Blew Ledge where we continued safe that night—Next morning being Monday, the 14th, Inst. we started early and crossed the Blew Ledge and Fell upon a branch of the Little River, called Pine Creek,— We followed the sd: Creek down to Little River, and crost the Little River &amp; went to Francis Easons' Plantation where we continued that night. Our hunters brought a plentiful supply of Venison—Next morning being tuesday the 15 Inst. we marct. down to Richard Rattlecliffs' plantation on the Meadow Creek, where we continued that night—Next morning being Wednesday the 16th. Inst, we Sent our Spyes and hunters to Spy for Enemy Signs, &amp; to hunt for provisions. But the body of the Company Tarryed there— At Night they came in with a plenty of Venison, but could not discover any fresh sign of the Enemy—Next morning Thursday the 17th Inst, we sent out hunters as usual, &amp; in the afternoon some of them came in &amp; informed us that they had seen signs of Indians at Drapers' Meadow, that had been a catching of horses that Day, and that they had gone a straight course for Blackwater—upon that we began to get in Readyness to persue them next morning— but one of our men not coming in that night disappointed us— next morning Being Fryday the 18th. Inst. Some of the men were sent to Look for the man that was Lost—&amp; the Rest remained there, for we counted it imprudent to Leave the Place before we knew what had become of the lost man—so we tarryed Till the Day was so far Spent that we could not make anything of a march that Day. So the Capt. said that he and some more men would go to view the sign, and See what they could Discover. The Capt. and Wm. Hall and Adam Hermon, and two or three more went off &amp; Left the men under my Command and ordered that we should be in Readyness for a march as soon as he returned—Soon after the Captain was Gone, the man that was Lost Came in &amp; Informed us that he had been lost in a Creek of the Little River—But when the Captain came to the place where the sign was Seen, he Tels us that he saw a Shoe track among them, which caused them to believe that it had been white men after their horses—So the Captain nor none of the men, that was with him returned that night, But went a hunting—Next morning being Saturday 19th Inst. the Captain not coming gave us a great deal of Uneasyness—tho we Bore it with so much patience as we could 'till about noon, for we lay under great apprehensions of Danger—I ordered the men to keep a Verry Sharp Look out, and Likewise to be in order to march next morning, by Sun Rise,—I was Determined to stay that night &amp; if the Capt: did not come, to march off after him—Soon after we had come to a conclusion about it Some of the men Spyed five Indians Very near to us, for the place where we was, was grown up with weeds so that we could not Se them, nor they see us 'till thay came Verry near us—I was a Lying down in the house when I heard the news—I Rased up and presented my Gun at one of the Indians, But I heard some of our Company that was in another house, Cry out, Don't Shoot— I Stopt at that and askt them what they were &amp; I beleive they said Cheroke, but Stood in amaise, &amp; Reason they had, for I suppose there was 20 Guns presented at them, we went up to them &amp; Examined them—they said they were Cherokees, I made signs to them to show me their Pass, But they had none,—They had with them 5 head of horse Kind &amp; Skelps, that appeared to be white mens—4 of the horses appeared as tho' they had been Lately taken up, but the other was very poor—The Indians began to make ready to go off, but I made Signs to them that they must not Go that night, But they seemed very intent to go—but we would not agree to it—Some of the Company insisted to fall upon them and Kill them, for they said they believed they were Shawnees, &amp; that they were Spyes—and was doubtful that they had a superior number Some where nigh—But I said I was determined to keep them till the Capt: came, without they would go by forse, and if they would we would fire upon them—2 of the men went off after the Capt: who soon met some of the Company, who told them that they had been hunting &amp; that the Capt: would soon be in; who accordingly came soon after &amp; we informed him how things had happened in his absence &amp; in what manner the Indians appeared; that they had no pass and that they had white Skelps—After Capt: heard the opinion of the people, he past sentence of Death upon them; but there was one Abraham Dunkleberry, hunter that we let off who said they were Cherokees, yet he agreed that they were Rogues; which seemed to put the Capt: to a stand, but we had their Guns taken from them &amp; a guard kept over them that night—next morning Being Sunday 20th Inst upon what Dunkleberry had said the Capt: let them have their Guns &amp; let them go off—which displeased some of the Carolina men—so much that they swore if they were not allowed to kill them, they would never go Ranging again, for they said it was to no purpose to Rang after the Enemy, &amp; when they had found them, not to be allowed to kill them—which you must think is very hard for us to be compel to Rang &amp; then let the Enemy have Liberty to Kill some of us, before we Dare to Kill them—at that Rate we may all be Kill'd, and never Kill an Indian, for if there is enough of them to overcome us, then they are Enemy, But if we are too numerous for them they are friends. Upon consideration of their having no pass, nor white man, &amp; be reason of their steal of horses, they did not appear any waise Like friends, so the Captain told them to be Easy, and after Dunkleberry was gone, we would go after them and Kill them. So Dunkleberry packt up his skins to go off &amp; we marcht after the Indians—w overtook them and past them, Because the Capt: said they were in such order that we could not kill them all, but would wate for better opportunity—They were going toward the New River—so th men that had been acquainted Knew of 2 fords &amp; they Emagined they would cross at the upper ford—But we lade an Ambushkaide at each ford, the Capt: &amp; myself and a partie of men at the upper ford, and a partie of men at the Loer ford &amp; the Capts: orders were to fire at them as they Crost the River—But after we had placed ourselves and sat awhile 2 or 3 of the men came from the Loer Ford &amp; informed us that two of the Indians had Crost at the Loer ford, and they did not fire at them because they were not altogether. So the Capt. and the men went towards the Loer Ford &amp; as we went along we saw 4 of the Indians; we did not fire at them; the Capt: concluded to ly by awhile and let them all get together &amp; then follow them and kill them—soon after the other Indians followed them, the Capts: orders was for 12 of the best men to follow them and Kill them and the remainder of the Company to go to the Dunker Fort which was about half a mile below us &amp; the Capt: took such men as he Lik'd and set down to conclude how we should follow them—the way the Capt proposed was to Dog them till night and then ly By till the Brake of Day and then Fall upon them and Kill them—he said if we fired upon them in the day, some would get away—but we did not approve of his skeems, and told him the Ill Consequence that attended it, but he still insisted upon that way of proceeding—At length we desired him to go down to the fort with the rest of the men, &amp; let us go after the Indians, to which he consented, and went off to the fort and we after the Indians— The men that followed them were Adam hermon, Daniel Hermon, Wm. Hall, Ric'd Hall, Jun'r, Tobias Clapp, Philip Clap, Joseph Clapp, Benj.

      <field name="fulltext">Hard Labor, Oct. 17, 1768. Sir: I have the honor to acquaint you in obedience to his Majesty's commands, on the 13th curr't, I met at this place all the principal Chiefs of the upper and lower Cherokee Nations, and on the 14th by his Majesty's royal authority concluded the Treaty with said Indians, ratifying the cession of land lying within the Provinces of South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia by them to his Majesty and His heirs forever, and confirming the Boundary line marked by the Lords Commissioners of Trade and Plantations, according to the several agreements entered into with said Indians. The line now ultimately confirmed and ratified by said Treaty was as follows: From the place called Towahilie, on the Northern Branch of the Savannah River, a North 50 degrees East course in a straight line, to a place called Dewisses corner, or yellow water, from Dewisses, or yellow water, a North 50 degrees East course in a straight line to the south bank of Reedy River, at a place called Wanghoe, or Elm Tree, where the line behind Carolina terminates. From a place called Wanghoe, or Elm Tree, to the South Bank of Reedy River, a course in a straight line to a mountain called Tagon Mountain where the great ridge of the mountains becomes impervious. In a straight line to Chiswell's mine on the Eastern Bank of the Great Conhoway River, to a N. B. E. course, and from Chiswell's mine on the Eastern Bank of the Great Conhoway in a straight line to a North course to the confluence of the Great Conhoway with the Ohio. As soon as possible after my return to Charlestown I shall send you extracts of my conference and an authentic copy of the above mentioned Treaty concluded with said Chiefs. I acquainted the Chiefs that I expected their Deputies to set out immediately from this place with my Deputy to meet your Commissioners at Colonel Chiswell's Mine in order to finish marking the Boundary line, as agreed upon, but they objected, and desired that that service might be deferred till the spring of next year. The reasons they urged for this delay are as follows: That when they set the 10th of November for the time of meeting your Commissioners to proceed upon that important service, they understood that they had no more to mark than from the mountains where the line behind North Carolina was, to Chiswell's Mine on the Conhoway, as they considered the river from there to its confluence with the Ohio as a natural Boundary. But as the line is to run in a straight line, almost due North from the Mine, to the mouth of the river, the advanced season of the year will render that service impracticable until the Spring, as the line now ultimately agreed upon runs through a large extent of mountainous country, uninhabited, where in the winter the cold will be extremely intense, and there will be no shelter for men, nor food for horses at that season. The reasons appeared to me so just and good, that I was obliged to acquiesce in them, and I send this letter by Express to prevent, as much as possible, any disappointment that may result from this alteration. I hope you will receive it in time to prevent your Commissioners from setting out. The Chiefs have appointed the 10th of May next for meeting your Commissioners at Chiswell's Mine, which I hope will prove agreeable and their reasons for altering the time satisfactory to you. I reproached the Cherokees severely for the murder of five emigrants from your provinces, who were going to the Mississippi, which was committed in the summer last. They confessed it and said the perpetrators were a party of Chilhowie people who urged in their own defence, that their relations had been killed in Augusta County, in the province, in 1765, for which they had never received any satisfaction although repeated promises had been made either of putting the guilty persons to death, or making a compensation in goods from your province, which they believed, because I had confirmed them. That they nevertheless were disappointed, and being tired with waiting, took that satisfaction which they could not obtain from our justice. All the warriors declared that they disapproved of the action, but that the Chilhowie people were authorized by the custom of their country to act as they did, and their idea of never having received any satisfaction was undeniable; that in any other instance nothing should prevent their executing strict justice according to Treaties. It is not only extremely disagreeable to myself, but very detrimental to his Majesty's service, to be obliged to fail in any promise I make to Indians. The compensation of 500 Indian dressed Deer skins value in goods for every person murdered, which on the faith of Gov. Fauquier's repeated letters, I engaged them to receive, early in the Spring, was extremely moderate, and this you will acknowledge if you will compare it with the sum expended by the Province of Pennsylvania, on a late similar occasion. And I must confess that this disappointment will render me extremely cautious in making promises on any future occasion. I am to meet the Chiefs of the Upper and Lower Creek Nations at Silver Bluff on Savannah River, the first of November, to ratify the cessions to his Majesty in the two Floridas and Georgia, and expect to be at Charlestown by the time the bearer can return there. I have the honor of being, very respected Sir, Your most obedient and very humble servant, John Stuart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Chiefs of the Cherokees: Brothers,—On the 20th day of December last, being in Williamsburg, we received instructions from Lord Botetourt, a great and good man, whom the great King George has sent to preside over his Colony of Virginia, directing us to wait on your father, John Stuart, Esq., Supt. Indian Affairs, in order to have a plan agreed upon for fixing a new Boundary between your people and his Majesty's subjects in the Colony of Virginia. On our way to the place, to our great joy, we met with our good brothers, Judds Friend and the Warrior of Estitoe, who with great readiness took a passage with us from Governor Tryon, to this place where we had the happiness to wait upon your father, Mr. Stuart, and with joint application, represented to him the necessity of taking such measures as may effectually prevent any misunderstanding that might arise between his Majesty's subjects of the Colony of Virginia and our brothers the Cherokees, until a full treaty be appointed and held for the fixing a new Boundary that may give equal justice and satisfaction to the parties concerned, and that his Majesty's subjects, now settled on the lands between Chiswell's Mines, and the Great Island of Holston River, remain in peaceable possession of said lands, until a line is run between them and our good brothers the Cherokees, who will receive full satisfaction for such lands as you, our brothers, shall convey to our Great King for the use of his subjects. Your Father, Mr. Stuart's, message to you on this head makes it needless for us to say any more on this subject. He will let you, at a proper time, know both the time and place where this great work shall be brought into execution. We have the pleasure to inform you that your two great Warriors now present, have heartily concurred with us in every measure and make no doubt of such measures giving great satisfaction to the whole Nation. Gave a string of Wampum. Jan. 16th. In answer to which, Judds Friend and the Warrior of Estitoe spoke as follows: Father: and our Brothers from Virginia,—We have heard your Talks, which we think very good, and shall with all convenient speed return to our Nation, and when our Chiefs are assembled shall lay these Talks before them. Brothers,—We are sorry to have it to say, that for some time bad blood and evil actions prevailed amongst us, which occasioned a stroke from our Elder Brothers; but now we have the satisfaction of telling you that our hands are good and straight, and you may depend on their continuing so, and, that you may depend the more on what we say, we take off these black beads from the end of this string, that nothing may remain but what is pure and white, and now put the black beads in your hands, which we call the remains of our evil thoughts, and desire you may now cast them away, that they may never be had in remembrance more. Brothers,—We shall with great pleasure comply with the request that you have made with regard to the lands you have mentioned, and shall wait with impatience for a general meeting, that we may have opportunity for convincing our Elder Brothers of our friendly disposition towards them, as we may be of real use to them, for to us it is of little or none, as we never hunt there; the deer do not live in the mountains, and you, in the meantime, may depend that your people shall enjoy peaceable possession until we make a Treaty with the Great King. Brothers,—We hope the measures now taken will be productive of many advantages to our people, as well as those who by living so much nearer to us, will have it in their power to supply us with goods, for we are often imposed upon greatly, as we have no trade at present but with this Province, and we hope you, our Brothers, will signify to your Governor, whom we believe to be that great and good man you mention, our great desire to have a trade with Virginia, that after this business is happily finished, which we make no doubt of on the part of our Nation, we may enjoy a friendly intercourse and have an advantageous trade with our Brothers, the Inhabitants of Virginia. Brothers,—We have often joined you in war against your enemies and you may always depend on our assistance on any future occasion. Gives a string of Wampum.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sir,— His Excellency, the Right Honorable Norborne, the Lord Botetourt, Governor in Chief of the Colony of Virginia, and the King's Council of that Dominion, having ordered us to wait on you and assist in settling the Boundary line between that Colony and the Cherokee Indians, we beg leave to inform you that the line proposed to be marked from Chiswell's Mines to the confluence of the Great Kanawha and the Ohio, would be a great disadvantage to the Crown of Great Britain, and would injure many subjects of Britain that now inhabit that part of the frontier, and have in making that settlement complied with every known rule of government and the laws of that Colony. Lands were first granted on the waters of the Mississippi by Sir William Gooch of Virginia, and the Council about the year 1746, in consequence of instructions from England, and many families settled on the lands so granted. In the year 1752, the Legislature of Virginia passed an act to encourage settlers on the waters of the Mississippi. By that act they were exempted from the payment of taxes for ten years. To this act his late Majesty, of glorious memory, gives assent. The next year another act was passed, by which five years' indulgence was added, and in that or the succeeding year Robert Dinwiddie, Esq., Governor of Virginia at that time, received instructions from King George 2nd. to grant lands on these waters, exempted from the payment of the usual right money and free from Quit-rents for ten years. Under these encouragements was that part of the Colony settled. Whilst the inhabitants were settling on these lands, the Cherokee Indians were frequently at their habitations, and never that we, either of us, ever heard made the slightest complaint of our settling, or laid any claim to the lands we settled, until November, 1763, after the King's proclamation issued in that year. The Six Nations both claimed the lands that were settled on the branches of the rivers Kanawha and Monongahely and were paid a proper consideration for them at Lancaster, in 1744, when they executed a deed of cession to his late Majesty. We flatter ourselves that the above is sufficient to convince you of the justice and legality of making those settlements. The Boundary line that has been proposed would include many of the inhabitants above mentioned within the limits of the Cherokee Hunting Grounds. For all such lands and improvements, the justice of the crown would be an inducement to make some satisfaction to the owners which would be expense to the crown and injure the inhabitants much and totally ruin many of them, and the evil would be increased by the loss of the Quit-rents paid for these lands, and would also give the Cherokees a large tract of country that was never claimed by them and now is the property of the crown, as Sir William Johnson actually purchased it of the Six United Nations of Indians at a very considerable expense, and took a deed of cession from them at Fort Stanwix, near the head of Mohock's River, on the 5th day of November last. The interest of the crown and the inhabitants of Virginia will be most served by fixing the Boundary with the Cherokees in 36° 30m. North Latitude, that Boundary being already marked by proper authority as far as Steep Rock Creek, a branch of the Cherokee River, and is the proper division between Lord Granville's Proprietary and the Dominion of Virginia, and includes but a small part of the lands now claimed by the Cherokees, they having often disclaimed the lands lying between the Ohio and a ridge of mountains called Sheep Ridge, that divides the waters of the Cumberland River from those of the Cherokee River. This boundary will give room to extend our settlements for ten or twelve years, will raise a considerable sum by the Rights, much increase the Quitrents, and enable the Inhabitants of Virginia to live thus manufacturing such material as they raise.

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA—BOTETOURT COUNTY. 1770-1773. The first County Court of Botetourt county met at the house of Robert Breckenridge, near the location of Fincastle, Va., on Tuesday, the 13th of February, 1770. The justices composing the court were: William Preston, George Skillem, Richard Woods, Benjamin Hawkins, Benjamin Estill, John Bowyer, David Robinson, James Trimble John Maxwell William Fleming, Israel Christian, Robert Breckenridge. A number of the members of this court were not present on the first day of the court, but were subsequently qualified. The following officers qualified on that day: County Court Clerk, John May. Sheriff Botetourt county, Richard Woods. Deputy Sheriffs Botetourt county, Jas. McDowell and Jas. McGavock. County Surveyor, William Preston. Escheator, William Preston. Coroner, Andrew Lewis. Colonel of Militia, William Preston. The attorneys qualifying to practice in the court were: Edmund Winston, Luke Bowyer, John Aylett, Thomas Madison. On the 14th day of February, 1770, the following magistrates qualified and took their seats: John Bowman, William Christian, Robert Doach, William Herbert, Philip Love, John Montgomery, William Matthews, James Robertson, Stephen Trigg, Anthony Bledsoe, Walter Crockett, John Howard, William Inglis, Andrew Lewis, James McGavock, William McKee, Francis Smith, Andrew Woods. And on the 11th day of June, 1771, the following members of the court qualified: John Van Bebber, John Stewart, James Thompson, of Holston, Matthew Arbuckle. Botetourt county was named for Lord Botetourt, Governor of Virginia, in 1768, and the county seat was fixed at the present location of Finscastle, Va., upon forty acres of land presented to the county for a town seat by Israel Christian. Fincastle was named for the county seat of Lord Botetourt in England, and was established as a town by law in 1772. Of the members of the County Court of Botetourt county, James Robertson, Anthony Bledsoe and James Thompson had their residence upon the waters of the Holston and the Watauga. On the second day of the court, being February 14, 1770, Frederick Stern and Robert Davis were appointed constables upon the Holston river; on the 12th of June, 1770, William Pruitt was appointed a constable upon the waters of the Clinch, and Arthur Campbell was appointed surveyor of the roads from the State line to the Royal Oak, and James Davis from the Royal Oak to his house. On the 13th of March, 1770, Arthur Campbell obtained permission from the County Court of Botetourt county to erect a mill at Royal Oak, on the Holston, and there can be no question that this was the first mill erected upon any of the waters of the Holston or Clinch river. On the same day Francis Kincannon was appointed surveyor of the roads from Stalnaker's to Eighteen Mile creek; Thomas Ramsay from said creek to Beaver, or Shallow, creek, and David Looney from said creek to Fall creek. On the 10th of May, 1770, Anthony Bledsoe was appointed to take the tithables from Stalnaker's to the lowest inhabitants. The next order of the County Court of Botetourt county, of any importance in the history of this county, was made on the 14th of August, 1771, when the County Court ordered that Andrew Colvill, George Adams, George Tiller, George Baker, David Ward and Alexander Wilie, or any three of them, being first sworn to view the way from the head of Holston river to the Wolf Hill creek, both the old and the new way, make report to the next court of the conveniences and inconveniences thereof. The records of Botetourt county fail to show that this report was ever made or that the road was established, but there can be but little doubt that the road was established and used, and, if so, this was the first public road established upon the waters of the Holston or Clinch river. The foregoing is all the information that the records of Botetourt county give of any of the people living upon the waters of the Holston and Clinch rivers. The one matter of supreme importance to the inhabitants of this section of Virginia at that time was the extinguishment of the claims of the Cherokee Indians to the lands which they were settling and occupying, and, pursuant to instructions, John Stuart, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, assembled the Indian chiefs at Lochaber, S. C., October 18, 1770, and on Monday, October 22, 1770, he succeeded in concluding a treaty with the chiefs and warriors of the Cherokee Nation, by which George III, King of England, became the owner of all the lands lying east of a line beginning at a point where the North Carolina (now Tennessee) line terminates at a run, thence in a west course to Holston river, where it is intersected by a continuation of the line dividing the Province of North Carolina (now Tennessee) and Virginia, and thence in a straight course to the confluence of the Great Canaway river, the treaty being here given in full: TREATY. At a meeting of the principal Chiefs and Warriors of the Cherokee Nation with John Stuart, Esq., Superintendent of Indian Affiars, etc., Lochaber, South Carolina, Oct. 18th, 1770. Present Colo. Donelson by appointment of his Excellency, the Right Honorable Lord Botetourt, in behalf of the Province of Virginia. Alex'r Cameron, Deputy Superintendent; James Simpson, Clk of his Majesty's Council of South Carolina; Major Lacy, from Virginia; Major Williamson, Capt. Cohoon, John Caldwell, Esq., Captain Winter, Christopher Peters, Esq., besides a great number of the back inhabitants of the province of South Carolina, and the following chiefs of the Cherokee Nation: Oconistoto, Killagusta, Attacallaculla, Keyatory, Tiftoy, Terreaino, Encyod Tugalo, Scaliloskie Chinista, Chinista of Watangali, Octaciti of Hey Wassie, and about a thousand other Indians of the same Nation. John Watts, Interpreters. David McDonald, John Vans, Treaty, Monday, 22nd Oct. At a Congress of the principal chiefs of the Cherokee Nation, held at Lochaber, in the province of South Carolina, on the 18th day of October in the year of our Lord 1770, by John Stuart, Esq., his Majesty's agent for and Superintendent of the Affairs of the Indian Nation in the Southern district of North America. A Treaty for a cession! His most sacred Majesty, George the Third, by the grace of God of Great Britain, France and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, etc., by the said Nation of Cherokee Indians, of certain lands lying within the limits of the Dominion of Virginia. Whereas by a Treaty entered into and concluded at Hard Labor, the 14th day of Oct. in the year 1768, by John Stuart, Esq. his Majesty's Agent for and Superintendent of the affairs of the Indian Nations, inhabiting the southern district of North America, with the principal and ruling Chiefs of the Cherokee Nation, all of the lands formerly claimed by, and belonging to the said Nation of Indians, lying within the province of North Carolina and Virginia, running in a N. B. E. course, to Colo. Chiswell's mine on the Eastern bank of the Great Canaway, and from thence in a straight line to the mouth of the said Great Canaway river, where it discharges itself into the Ohio river, were ceded to his most sacred Majesty, his heirs and sucessors. And whereas by the above recited Treaty, all the lands lying between Holston's River, and the line above specified were determined to belong to the Cherokee Nation to the great loss and inconvenience of many of his Majesty's subjects inhabiting the said lands; and representation of the same having been made to his Majesty by his Excellency, the Rt Hon'ble Norborne, Baron de Botetourt, his Majesty's Lieutenant and Governor General of the dominion of Virginia. In Consequence whereof, his Majesty has been generously pleased to signify his Royal pleasure to John Stuart, Esq., his Agent for and Superintendent of Indian Affairs in the Southern District of North America, by an instruction contained in a letter from the Rt. Hon'ble the Earl of Hillsborough, one of his Majesty's principal Secretaries of State, dated the 13th of May, 1769, to enter into a negotiation with the Cherokees for establishing a new boundary line beg'g at the point where the No. Carolina line terminates, and to run thence in a west course to Holston's River, where it is intersected by a continuance of the line dividing the province of North Carolina &amp; Virginia, and thence a straight course to the confluence of the Great Canaway and Ohio Rivers. Dec. 12, 1770. Article 1st. Pursuant therefore to his Majesty's orders to &amp; power and authority vested in John Stuart, Esqr. Agent for and Superintendent of the Affairs of the Indian Tribes in the Southern District: It is agreed upon by the said John Stuart, Esqr. on behalf of his most sacred Majesty, George Third, by the grace of God, of Great Britain, France and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, etc., and by the subscribing Cherokee Chiefs and Warriors on behalf of their said Nation in consideration of his Majesty's paternal goodness, so often demonstrated to them, the said Cherokee Indians, and from their affection and friendship for their Brethren, the Inhabitants of Virginia as well as their earnest desire of removing as far as possible all cause of dispute between them and the said inhabitants on account of encroachments on lands reserved by the said Indians for themselves, and also for a valuable consideration in various sorts of goods paid to them by the said John Stuart, on behalf of the Dominion of Virginia that the hereafter recited line be ratified and confirmed, and it is hereby ratified and confirmed accordingly: and it is by these presents firmly stipulated and agreed upon by the parties aforesaid that a line beginning where the boundary line between the province of No. Carolina and the Cherokee hunting grounds terminates and running thence in a west course to a point six miles east of Long Island in Holston's river and thence to said river six miles above the said Long Island, thence in a — course to the confluence of the Great Canaway and Ohio rivers, shall remain and be deemed by all his Majesty's white subjects as well as all the Indians of the Cherokee Nation, the true and just boundaries of the lands reserved by the said Nation of Indians for their own proper use, and dividing the same from the lands ceded by them to his Majesty's within the limits of the province of Virginia, and that his Majesty's white subjects, inhabiting the province of Virginia, shall not, upon any pretense whatsoever, settle beyond the said line, nor shall the said Indians make any settlements or encroachments on the lands which by this treaty they cede and confirm to his Majesty; and it is further agreed that as soon as his Majesty's royal approbation of this treaty shall have been signified to the Governor of Virginia or Superintendent, this treaty shall be carried into execution. Article 2nd. And it is further agreed upon and stipulated by the contracting parties, that no alteration whatsoever shall henceforward be made in the boundary line above recited, and now solemnly agreed upon, except such as may hereafter be found expedient and necessary for the mutual interest of both parties, and which alteration shall be made with the consent of the Superintendent or such other person or persons as shall be authorized by his Majesty, as well as with the consent and approbation of the Cherokee Nation of Indians, at a Congress or general meeting of said Indians, to be held for said purpose, and not in any other manner. In testimony whereof, the said Superintendent, on behalf of his Majesty, and the underwritten Cherokee Chiefs on behalf of their Nation have signed and sealed this present treaty at the time and place aforesaid. John Stuart, (L. S.) Oconistoto, YC., (L. C.) Kittagusta, O., (L. C.) Attacallaculla, X., (L. C.) Keyatoy's mark NG., (L. C.) Unkayonla, C., (L. C.) Chuckamuntas, C., (L. C.) Kinalilaps, NG., (L. C.) Skyagusta Tucelicis, S., (L. C.) Wolf of Keewees, G., (L. C.) Skyagusta Tiftoy, (L. C.) Terrapino, (L. C.) Ency of Tugalo, (L. C.) Scaliluskey of Sugar Town, (L. C.) Thus all claim asserted by both the northern and southern Indians to any of the lands located within the present bounds of Washington county was extinguished, and the settlement of these lands was greatly expedited thereby. This portion of Virginia now opened to settlement was one vast forest overspreading a limestone soil of great fertility and excellently watered, and this, accompanied by the comparative security and quiet succeeding the French-Indian war of 1763, contributed greatly to the rapid settlement of Southwestern Virginia. In the year 1770, Col. James Knox,* * Afterwards Gen. Knox. The last named erected a fort near the present site of Knoxville, Tenn., to which was given the name of Fort Knox. accompanied by about forty hunters from the settlements on New river, Holston and Clinch, passed oved the Cumberland mountains for the purpose of hunting and trapping, and penetrated to the lower Cumberland. They were equipped with their rifles, traps and dogs, and the usual outfit of backwoods hunters, and thus originated the name Long Hunters. The usual mode of hunting followed by what were known as the Long Hunters, in those days, was for not more than two or three men to go in one company, each man having two horses, traps, a large surplus of powder and lead, a small hand vise and bellows and files and screw plates for the purpose of fixing guns, if any should get out of fix. They usually set out from their homes about the first of October and returned the latter part of March or first of April. The most noted Long Hunters were Elisha Walden, William Carr, William Crabtree, James Aldridge, William Pitman and Henry Scaggs. During the season above mentioned, large numbers of hunters visited the valleys of the Holston, Clinch and Powell's rivers, and oftentimes penetrated into the very heart of Kentucky. In the year 1771, Absalom Looney settled in Abb's Valley, Tazewell county, Virginia, and from him the valley received its name. Thomas Witten and John Greenup settled at Crab Orchard, a few miles west of Tazewell C. H.; Mathias, Jacob and Henry Harmon settled a few miles east of Tazewell C. H., and John Craven, Joseph Martin, John Henry, James King and John Bradshaw settled in Tazewell county, on the headwaters of the Clinch. In the year 1771, a company of about twenty men from near the Natural Bridge in Virginia and from the New river settlements met about eight miles below Fort Chiswell on New river, whence they traveled to the head of the Holston, and thence down the Holston Valley, and on into Kentucky, where they continued to hunt for about nine months. The Holston settlements received during this year a large number of emigrants from North Carolina. The government of North Carolina was in the hands of a class of people who were very haughty and oppressive in their manner towards the poorer classes of citizens, which caused great numbers of the people of North Carolina to organize themselves into bands called Regulators. They petitioned Governor Tryon for relief, which was denied; tumult and violence succeeded, the courts were prevented from sitting and the laws were disobeyed. The principal ground of complaint was that the people were taxed without the right to vote and send representatives to the House of Commons of North Carolina. About three thousand Regulators banded themselves together, and on the 16th of May, 1771, a battle was fought at the Alamance, between the Regulators and the forces commanded by Governor Tryon. The Regulators, being undisciplined and poorly armed, were defeated with the loss of nine killed and many wounded, the Governor's forces having lost twenty-seven killed and many wounded. And thus it is said was fought the first battle of the Revolution, and thus was shed the first blood for the enjoyment of liberty. The Regulators being thus defeated and dispersed, many of their number found homes on the waters of the Holston and Clinch rivers. At this time the settlements extended down the north side of the Holston river as far as Carter's Valley, about fourteen or fifteen miles above Rogersville, Tenn., and that portion of the country being supposed to be a part of Virginia, it was soon settled by people from the Wolf Hills in Virginia. A settlement was made on the Watauga as early as the year 1770, upon the idea that the lands were in Virginia, and that the settlers would be entitled to take up the lands given to settlers under the laws of Virginia, to-wit: To each actual settler who should erect a log cabin and cultivate one acre in corn, four hundred acres, located so as to include all improvements, with the right to buy a thousand acres adjoining at a nominal price. Most of the early settlers on the Watauga came from near the Wolf Hills and, being loyal Virginians, they did not contemplate establishing a residence in the State of North Carolina, but thought they were near the boundary between the two States. In the fall of the year 1771, Anthony Bledsoe ran the boundary line between the Colonies of Virginia and North Carolina, far enough west to ascertain that the Watauga settlement was in North Carolina, and Alexander Cameron, the British agent, immediately ordered the settlers on the Watauga to move off of the Indian lands. James Robertson and John Sevier, two of the leading members of the Watauga settlement, immediately set about to devise ways and means by which they could avoid the order of the British agent. They could not buy the lands from the Indians, because the purchase was prohibited, but there was no law prohibiting a lease of the land, and in the year 1774, the Indians leased to the settlers on the Watauga the lands in the Watauga Valley and all was peace once again. The stream of emigration that poured over the mountains extended along the Holston as far as Carter's Valley and on the lands belonging to the Indians. They were all from Virginia and of Scotch-Irish descent, their wealth consisting of strong arms and stout hearts. In the year 1772, James Moore and James Poage settled in Abb's Valley, William Wynn at Locust Hill, John Taylor and Jesse Evans on the north fork of Clinch; Thomas Maxwell, Benjamin Joslin, James Ogleton, Peter and Jacob Harmon, Samuel Ferguson and William Webb, near Tazewell C. H.; Rees Bowen, at Maiden Spring, David Ward in the Cove, and William Garrison at the foot of Morris' Knob. William Wynn erected a fort on Wynn's Branch, Thomas Witten at Crab Orchard, and Rees Bowen at Maiden Spring. The early settlers of Southwest Virginia came principally from the Valley of Virginia, western Pennsylvania and Maryland, some of them coming directly from Ireland. They were of a mixed race, and a large majority were Scotch-Irish. In studying the nationality of the early settlers of Southwest Virginia, it must be kept in mind that there was a great difference between the people inhabiting the eastern shores of Virginia and the early settlers in the mountains of western Virginia. They differed both in their ancestry and in their religion. The early settlers of Eastern Virginia were English by birth and Episcopalians in religion; while the early settlers of Southwest Virginia were Scotch-Irish by birth and Presbyterians in religious belief. The government of the Colony of Virginia, early in the eighteenth century, adopted the policy of offering inducements to the dissenters from the established church to settle and make their homes in the Valley of Virginia and in the Southwest, and thereby sought to establish a barrier between the Indian tribes and the settlers east of the mountains. In the adoption of this policy the government of the Colony of Virginia was actuated by selfish motives; they little dreamed that they were thus giving a foothold to a vigorous people, who were destined to play a strong part in the future history of their country. The people thus invited to settle the garden spot of Virginia were the sons of the men who followed Cromwell. They were men who regarded themselves, according to Macaulay, as "kings by the right of an earlier creation and priests by the interposition of an Almighty hand." King James I, when speaking of a Scotch Presbytery, said, "Presbytery agreeth as well with monarchy as God and the devil." They were Protestants and detested the Catholics, the enemies of their forefathers, and they despised the Episcopalians, their oppressors. They constituted the outposts of our earlier civilization, their homes being in the mountains. A distinguished writer, in speaking of these people, says: "That these Irish Presbyterians were a bold and hardy race is proved by their at once pushing past the settled regions and plunging into the wilderness as the leaders of the white advance. They were the first and last set of emigrants to do this; all others have merely followed in the wake of their predecessors. But indeed they were fitted to be Americans from the very start; they were the kinsfolk of the Covenanters; they deemed it a religious duty to interpret their own Bible, and held for a divine right the election of their own clergy. The creed of the backwoodsmen who had a creed at all was Presbyterianism, for the Episcopacy of the tidewater lands obtained no foothold in the mountains, and the Methodists and Baptists had but just begun to appear in the west,* * The Winning of the West, Vol. I., page 138. before the Revolution broke out." Governor David Campbell, who lived and died at Abingdon, in speaking of these people, says: "The first settlers on Holston river were a remarkable race of people, for their intelligence, enterprise and hardy adventure." The greater portion of them had emigrated from the counties of Botetourt, Augusta and Frederick, and others from along the same valley and from the upper counties of Maryland and Pennsylvania, and generally, where they had any religious opinions, were Presbyterians. A very large proportion were religious, and many were members of the church. It is generally supposed that the motive actuating the early explorers and settlers of this country was the acquisition of wealth, and while such motive may have had its influence on some, we cannot believe that such was the real motive of the great body of our early settlers. The early settlers and forefathers had been persecuted in their homes across the Atlantic because of their independent spirit and their undying fealty to the doctrines taught by Calvin and Knox; and when they crossed the waters they were driven, by the intolerant spirit of the established church, beyond the lowlands to the very mountains, where they sought a place and opportunity to exercise their religion according to the dictates of their consciences. The important part played by this people in the early history of our country cannot be overestimated. Our forefathers were inspired and governed by the same sentiments that actuated the founders of our nation. The theology of Calvin, the founder of the republic of Geneva, combined with the sturdy independence of the Scotch-Irish settlers of the American colonies, gave birth to our republic. "The first voice raised in America to destroy all connection with Great Britain came from the Scotch-Irish Presbyterians.* * Bancroft's His. U. S., Vol. X., page 77. " The Hon. Wm. C. Preston, of South Carolina, a native of Washington county, in speaking of the resemblance between the constitution of the Presbyterian Church and the constitution of our country, said: "Certainly it was the most remarkable and singular coincidence that the constitution of the Presbyterian Church should bear such a close and striking resemblance to the political constitution of our country."† † Scotch-Irish Seeds, page 346. Not only were they the first to demand the separation of the colonies from the mother country, but they were the first to demand religious liberty and the separation of Church and State. Hanover Presbytery, of which the Rev. Chas. Cummings was an honored member, prepared a petition with this object in view and presented it to the General Assembly of Virginia on the 24th of October, 1776, the petition being as follows: "A memorial of the Presbytery of Hanover was presented to the House, and read: setting forth that they are governed by the same sentiments which have inspired the United States of America, and are determined that nothing in their power and influence shall be wanting to give success to the common cause: that Dissenters from the Church of England in this country have ever been desirous to conduct themselves as peaceable members of the civil government, for which reason they have hitherto submitted to several ecclesiastick burthens and restrictions, that are inconsistent with equal liberty, but that now when the many and grievous oppressions of our mother country have laid this continent under the necessity of casting off the yoke of tyranny, and of forming independent governments, upon equitable and liberal foundations, they flatter themselves they shall be freed from all the encumbrances which a spirit of domination, prejudice or bigotry hath interwoven with most other political systems: that they are more strongly encouraged to expect this, by the declaration of rights, so universally applauded for the dignity, firmness and precision with which it delineates and asserts the privileges of society and the prerogatives of human nature, and which they embrace as the Magna Charta of the Commonwealth, which can never be violated without endangering the grand superstructure it was destined to support: Therefore they rely upon this declaration, as well as the justice of the Legislature, to secure to them the free exercise of their religion, according to the dictates of their consciences: and that they should fall short in their duty to themselves and to the many and numerous congregations under their care, were they upon this occasion to neglect laying before the House a statement of the religious grievances under which they have hitherto labored, that they may no longer be continued in the present form of government: that it is well known that in the frontier counties which are justly supposed to contain a fifth part of the inhabitants of Virginia, the dissenters have borne the heavy burthens of purchasing glebes and supporting the established clergy, where there are very few Episcopalians either to assist in bearing the expense or to reap the advantage: and that throughout the other parts of the country there are also many thousands of zealous friends and defenders of the State who, besides the invidious disadvantageous restrictions to which they have been subjected annually, pay large taxes to support an establishment from which their consciences and principles oblige them to dissent, all which are so many violations of their natural rights, and in their consequences a restraint upon freedom of inquiry and private judgment. In this enlightened age, and in a land where all are united in the most strenuous efforts to be free, they hope and expect that their representatives will cheerfully concur in removing every species of religious as well as civil bondage. That every argument for civil liberty gains additional strength when applied to liberty in the concerns of religion, and that there is no argument in favor of establishing the Christian religion but what may be pleaded for establishing the tenets of Mahomet by those who believe in the Alcoran: or, if this be not true, it is at least impossible for the magistrate to adjudge the right of preference among the various sects which profess the Christian faith, without erecting a chair of infallibility which would lead us back to the Church of Rome. That they beg leave farther to represent that religious establishments are highly injurious to the temporal interests of any community, without insisting upon the ambition and the arbitrary practices of those who are favored by government, or the intriguing seditious spirit which is commonly excited by this, as well as every other kind of oppression. Such establishments greatly retard population and consequently the progress of arts, sciences and manufactures: witness the rapid growth and improvement of the northern provinces compared with this. That no one can deny the more early settlement, and the many superior advantages of our country, would have invited multitudes of artificers, mechanics and other useful members of society, to fix their habitation among us, who have either remained in the place of their nativity, or preferred worse civil government, and a more barren soil, where they might enjoy the rights of conscience more fully than they had a prospect of doing in this: from which they infer that Virginia might now have been the capital of America, and a match for the British arms, without depending upon others for the necessaries of war, had it not been prevented by her religious establishment. Neither can it be made appear that the gospel needs any such civil aid: they rather conceive that when our Blessed Savior declares his kingdom is not of this world, he renounces dependence upon State power, and as his weapons are spiritual and were only designed to have influence upon the judgment and heart of man, they are persuaded that if mankind were left in the quiet possession of their unalienable privileges, Christianity, as in the days of the Apostles, would continue to prevail and flourish in the greatest purity by its own native excellence, and under the all-disposing providence of God. That they would also humbly represent, that the only proper objects of civil government are the happiness and protection of men in the present state of existence, the security of the life, liberty and property of the citizens, and to restrain the vicious and encourage the virtuous by wholesome laws, equally extending to every individual: but that the duty they owe their Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can only be directed by reason and conviction, and is nowhere cognizable but at the tribunal of the universal judge, and that therefore they ask no ecclesiastical establishments for themselves, neither can they approve of them when granted to others, and earnestly entreating that all laws now in force in this Commonwealth which countenance religious denominations may be speedily repealed, that all and every religious sect may be protected in the full exercise of their several modes of worship, and exempted from the payment of all taxes for the support of any church whatever, farther than what may be agreeable to their own private choice, or voluntary obligations."* * Journal Va. House of Delegates, 1776. This petition preceded Jefferson resolution by many years. But few of the inhabitants of this beautiful country at the present time have even a slight idea of the dangers and privations endured by the early settlers, the dim shadows of which are vanishing like the tints in a dissolving scene. The men who worked their way from the settlements in the valley to their future The First Temples. home, groping through the forest without a road and with nothing to guide them in their course, except the trail of the Indian and the buffalo; at night resting on the ground with no roof over them save the branches of the mighty oak or the broad expanse of heaven; exploring an unknown wilderness, surrounded by insurmountable obstacles and momentarily threatened with assault from their deadly enemies, the rattlesnake, the Indian and the wild beast of the forest, but always accompanied by a trust in their God, came, "with the Bible in one hand and a cross in the other, treading the sombre shades of these dark old woods and often with a boulder of granite for a footstool, and the eternal cataracts thundering amid the everlasting solitudes for an organ, these devout men worshipped their God according to the dictates of their consciences." Each emigrant brought with him some clothes, a little bedding, guns and ammunition, cooking utensils, seed corn, an axe, a saw and the Bible. Such were the men and the manner of their coming, who cleared the forests and opened the beautiful and rich farms that are now spread out upon our hills and mountain sides and grassy plains. The early settlers in their intercourse with others were kind, beneficent and disinterested: extending to all the most generous hospitality that their circumstances could afford. That selfishness which prompts to liberality for the sake of remuneration and professes the civilities of life with an eye to individual interest was unknown to them. They were kind for kindness' sake and sought no other recompense than the never failing concomitant of good deeds, the reward of an approving conscience. There existed in each settlement a perfect unison of feeling. Similitude of situation and community of danger operated as a magic charm and stifled in their birth those little bickerings which are so apt to disturb the quiet of society.* * Dodridge. Ambition of preferment, the pride of place, too often hindrances to social intercourse, were unknown among them. Equality of condition rendered them strangers alike to the baneful distinctions of wealth and other adventitious circumstances, a sense of mutual dependence for their common security, linked them in amity and they conducted their several purposes in harmonious concert; together they toiled and together they suffered. Such were the pioneers of the Southwest; and the greater part of mankind might now derive advantage from the contemplation of their "humble virtues, their hospitable homes, their spirits potential, noble, proud and free, their self-respect grafted on innocent thoughts, their days of health and nights of sleep, their toils, by dangers dignified, yet guiltless, their hopes of cheerful old age and a quiet grave with cross and garland over its green turf and their grand-children's love for an epitaph."* The early settlers of this section of Virginia were a strong, stern people, simple in their habits, God-fearing in their practices, imbibing the spirit of freedom, such as is usually found among the inhabitants of a mountainous country, kind in their disposition towards the well-disposed and unmerciful in their dealings with their enemies. They were upright in all their dealings, fearless advocates of the right and undying lovers of their country. Dr. Dodridge, an author who wrote from his personal knowledge, says that "linsey coats and bed-gowns, were the universal dress of the women in the early times." The weed, now known among us as the "wild nettle," then furnished the material which served to clothe the persons of our sires and dames." It was cut down while yet green and treated much in the same manner in which flax is now treated. The fibrous bark, with the exception of the shortness of the fibres, seemed to be adapted to the same uses. When this "flax," if I may so term it, was prepared, it was mixed with buffalo hair, and woven into a substantial cloth in which the men and women were clothed. It is a true maxim, "Necessity is the mother of invention." "The furniture of the table, for several years after the settlement of this country, consisted of a few pewter dishes, plates and spoons; but mostly of wooden bowls, trenchers and noggins. If these last were scarce, gourds and hard-shelled squashes made up the deficiency. Iron pots, knives and forks were brought from the East, with the salt and iron on horseback." "In our whole display of furniture, the delft, china and silver were unknown. It did not then, as now, require contributions from the four quarters of the globe to furnish the breakfast table, viz., the silver from Mexico, the coffee from the West Indies, the tea from China and the delft or porcelain from Europe or Asia. Yet, a homely fare, unsightly cabins and furniture produced a hardy race, who planted the first footsteps of civilization in the immense regions of the West. Inured to hardship, bravery and labor from their early youth, they sustained with manly fortitude the fatigue of the chase, the campaign and scout, and with `strong arms turned the wilderness into fruitful fields,' and have left to their descendants the rich inheritance of an immense empire blessed with peace, wealth and prosperity."* * Bickley. "For a long time after the settlement of this country, the inhabitants in general married young. There was no distinction of rank and very little of fortune. On these accounts the first impression of love resulted in marriage, and a family establishment cost but little labor and nothing else. "A description of a wedding from beginning to end will serve to show the manners of our forefathers and mark the grade of civilization which has succeeded to their rude state of society, in the course of a few years. "In the first years of the settlement of a country, a wedding engaged the attention of the whole neighborhood, and the frolic was anticipated by young and old with eager expectation. This is not to be wondered at when it is told that a wedding was almost the only gathering which was not accompanied with the labor of reaping, log-rolling, building a cabin, or planning some scout or campaign. On the morning of the wedding day the groom and his attendants assembled at the house of his father for the purpose of reaching the home of his bride by noon, which was the usual time for celebrating the nuptials and which, for certain reasons, must take place before dinner. "Let the reader imagine an assemblage of people without a store, tailor or mantua-maker within a hundred miles, and an assemblage of horses without a blacksmith or saddle within an equal distance. The gentlemen dressed in shoepacks, moccasins, leather breeches, leggings, linsey hunting shirts, and all home-made. The ladies dressed in linsey petticoats and linsey or linen bed-gowns, coarse shoes, stockings and handkerchiefs and buckskin gloves, if any. If there were any rings, buckles, buttons or ruffles, they were the relics of olden times; family pieces from parents or grandparents. The horses were caparisoned with old saddles, old bridles or halters, and pack-saddles with a bag or blanket thrown over them; a rope or string as often constituted the girth as a piece of leather. "The march, in double file, was often interrupted by the narrowness of our mountain paths, as they were called, for we had no roads, and these difficulties were often increased by the good and sometimes the ill-will of neighbors by felling trees and tying grapevines across the way. Sometimes an ambuscade was formed by the wayside, and an unexpected discharge of several guns took place, so as to cover the wedding party with smoke. Let the reader imagine the scene which followed this discharge; the sudden spring of the horses, the shrieks of the girls and the chivalrous bustle of their partners to save them from falling. Sometimes, in spite of all that could be done to prevent it, some were thrown to the ground. If a wrist, elbow or ankle happened to be sprained, it was tied up with a handkerchief, and little more said or thought about it. "The ceremony of the marriage preceded the dinner, which was a substantial backwoods feast of beef, pork, fowls, and sometimes venison and bear meat roasted and boiled with plenty of potatoes, cabbage and other vegetables. During the dinner the greatest hilarity prevailed. The table might be a large slab of timber, hewed out with a broad-axe, supported by four sticks, set in auger holes; and the furniture, some old pewter dishes and plates; the rest, wooden bowls and trenchers: a few pewter spoons much battered about the edges were to be seen at some tables. The rest were made of horn. If knives were scarce the deficiency was made up with scalping knives which were carried in sheaths suspended to the belt of the hunting shirt. Every man carried one. "After dinner the dancing commenced and generally lasted until the next morning. The figures of the dancers were three and four handed reels, or square sets and jigs. The commencement was always a square form, which was followed by what was called jigging it off; that is, two of the four would single out for a jig, and were followed by the remaining couple. The jigs were often accompanied with what was called cutting out, that is, when either of the parties became tired of the dance, on intimation, the place was supplied by some one of the company, without any interruption to the dance. In this way the dance was often continued till the musician was heartily tired of his situation. Toward the latter part of the night, if any of the company through weariness attempted to conceal themselves for the purpose of sleeping, they were hunted up, paraded on the floor, and the fiddler ordered to play, `Hang out till to-morrow morning.' "About nine or ten o'clock a deputation of young ladies stole off the bride and put her to bed. In doing this it frequently happened that they had to ascend a ladder, instead of a pair of stairs, leading from the dining and ball room to a loft, the floor of which was made of clapboards lying loose. "This ascent, one might think, would put the bride and her attendants to the blush; but the foot of the ladder was commonly behind the door, which was purposely opened for the occasion, and its rounds at the inner ends were well hung with hunting-shirts, dresses and other articles of clothing. The candles being on the opposite side of the house, the exit of the bride was noticed but by few. "This done, a deputation of young men, in like manner, stole off the groom and placed him snugly by the side of his bride. The dance still continued; and if seats happened to be scarce, as was often the case, every young man when not engaged in the dance, was obliged to offer his lap as a seat for one of the girls; and the offer was sure to be accepted. In the midst of this hilarity the bride and groom were not forgotten. Pretty late in the night some one would remind the company that the new couple must stand in need of some refreshments. Black Betty, which was the name of the bottle, was called for and sent up the ladder; but sometimes Black Betty did not go alone. I have sometimes seen as much bread, beef, pork and cabbage sent along as would afford a good meal for half a dozen hungry men. The young couple were compelled to eat and drink more or less of whatever was offered. "But to return: it often happened that some neighbors or relations, not being asked to the wedding, took offence, and the mode of revenge adopted by them on such occasions was that of cutting off the manes, foretops, and tails of the horses of the wedding company. "On returning to the infare, the order of procession and the race for Black Betty was the same as before. The feasting and dancing often lasted several days, at the end of which the whole company were so exhausted with loss of sleep that many days' rest were requisite to fit them to return to their ordinary labors." HUNTING. "This constituted one of the greatest amusements, and, in many instances, one of the chief employments of the early settlers. The various intrigues of a skillful hunter, such as mimicking a turkey, owl, wolf, deer, etc., were soon learned, and the eye was taught to catch, at a glance, the faintest impressions left upon the earth by any animal. Marks which would be by any but a hunter overlooked were easily detected. The times and grounds on which elk, deer, etc., fed were soon learned, and then the important lesson of preventing spells or enchantments by enemies was studied, for it is a singular fact that all hunters are more or less superstitious. Frequently, on leaving home, the wife would throw the axe at her husband to give him good luck. If he chanced to fail to kill game, his gun was enchanted or spelled, and some old woman was shot in effigy, then a silver bullet would be run with a needle through it and shot at her picture. To remove these spells, they would sometimes unbreech their rifles, and lay them in a clear running stream for a certain number of days. If this failed, they would borrow patching from some other hunter, which transferred all the bad luck to the lender, etc. "Game was plenty at the time this country was first settled by the whites, and, acordingly, the woods furnished most of the meat. The elks and buffaloes were generally killed at the licks whither they repaired to salt themselves. Animals were hunted there not merely for their meat, but for their skins and furs. These served to pay for powder, lead, or anything else, being nominally the currency of the country. "Neither was hunting a mere pastime, devoid of skill, as it now is. The hunter might be considered somewhat of a meteorologist; he paid particular attention to the winds, rains, snows, and frosts, for almost every change altered the location of the game. He knew the cardinal points of the compass by the thick bark and moss on the north side of a tree, so that during the darkest and most gloomy night he knew which was the north, and so the direction of his home or camp. "The natural habits of the deer were well studied; and hence he knew at what times they fed, etc. If, in hunting, he found a deer at feed, he stopped, and though he might be open to it, did not seek to obscure himself, but waited till it raised its head and looked at him. He remained motionless till the deer, satisfied that nothing was in sight, again commenced feeding. He then began to advance, if he had the wind of it, and if not, he retreated and came up another way, so as to place the deer between himself and the wind. As long as the deer's head was down, he continued to advance till he saw it shake the tail. In a moment he was the same motionless object, till again it put down its head. In this way he would soon approach to within sixty yards, when his unerring rifle did the work of death. It is a curious fact that deer never put their heads to the ground, or raise it, without shaking the tail before doing so."* * Bickley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA—FINCASTLE COUNTY. 1773-1777. The House of Burgesses of Virginia in the fall of the year 1772, in answer to the petition of the inhabitants and settlers on the waters of the Holston and New rivers, representing their inconveniences by reason of the extent of Botetourt county and their remote situation from the courthouse, with the consent of the Governor and Council enacted a law providing that from and after the first day of December, 1772, the said county of Botetourt should be divided into two distinct counties; that is to say, all that part of said county within a line to run up the east side of New river to the mouth of Culberson creek, thence a direct line to the Catawba road where it crosses the dividing ridge between the north fork of Roanoke and the waters of New river, thence with the top of the ridge to the bend where it turns eastwardly, thence a south course, crossing Little river to the top of the Blue Ridge mountain, shall be established as one distinct county, to be called and known by the name of Fincastle; and all that other part thereof which lies to the east and northeast of said line shall be one other distinct county and retain the name of Botetourt. The act establishing Fincastle did not designate the place of holding the court of the county, but, by order of the Governor of the Colony, the Lead Mines, now in Wythe county, Virginia, was designated as the county seat of the new county.* * Hen. Stat., page 600. Pursuant to a commission from the Governor of the Colony bearing date December 1, 1772, directed to William Preston, William Christian, Stephen Trigg, Walter Crockett, Anthony Bledsoe, Arthur Campbell, Benjamin Estill, William Inglis, John Montgomery, Robert Doach, James McGavock, James Thompson, William Russell, Samuel Crockett, Alexander McKee, the first County Court for Fincastle county assembled at the Lead Mines, on New river, in the present county of Wythe, on the 5th day of January, 1773. The following members of the court being present: Arthur Campbell, William Preston, William Christian, Walter Crockett, James Thompson, William Inglis, Stephen Trigg, James McGavock. Arthur Campbell and James Thompson administered the oath to William Preston and William Inglis, and they to: William Christian, Robert Doach, James McGavock, Stephen Trigg, Walter Crockett, James Thompson, Arthur Campbell. Subsequently in the year 1773, William Campbell, James McCorkle and William Herbert were commissioned and qualified as members of the court. The following officers of the new county qualified on that day: Sheriff Fincastle county, William Preston. Deputy Sheriffs: Daniel Trigg, James Thompson, John Floyd, Henry Moore. Surveyor Fincastle County, William Preston. Deputy Surveyors: John Floyd, Daniel Smith, William Russell, Robert Preston, Robert Doach, James Douglas. Clerk Fincastle county, John Byrd. Deputy Clerks: William Christian, Stephen Trigg, Richard Madison. King's Counsel or Dept. Attorney: John Aylett, Jan. 5th, 1773. Thomas Madison, May 3rd, 1774. The following attorneys qualified in this court during the existence of the county: Ephraim Dunlop, John May, Harry Innes, John Aylett, Benjamin Lawson, Luke Bowyer, John Todd, Charles Simm, Gabriel Jones, Thomas Madison. On the first day of the court many interesting orders were entered, several of the number being here copied as entered: "The Court doth appoint the house adjoining the Court House, where the court is now held, for a prison, which house William Preston, Sheriff, doth protest against as insufficient. "Ordered that Stephen Trigg send for weights and measures for the use of the said county, as soon as possible and on as low terms as he sells goods to his best customers on." "Ordered that John Byrd do provide all necessary law books for this county, and that he bring in his charge." A number of orders were entered by the court on the first day of its existence, in regard to that section of Fincastle county lying upon the waters of the Holston and Clinch rivers. Leave was given Francis Whitney and William Kennedy to erect mills on the properties on which they lived, on the Holston river and the waters of Holston river. In this connection it is worthy of notice, that at the time permission was given to Kennedy and Whitney to erect their mills, there was but one mill on the waters of the Holston, so far as the records show, to-wit: the mill of Arthur Campbell at Royal Oak. "It is further ordered by the court that William Edmiston, George Adams, John Beaty, Joseph Drake, David Snodgrass and James Kincannon, or any three of them, being first sworn, do view the nighest and best way from the Town House (now in Smyth County, Va.,) to the Eighteen Mile creek (now Abingdon), and report." It seems that there was some contention among the settlers on Holston as to the location of this road; for, on the 2nd day of March, 1773, the above order was set aside by the court, and on that day it was ordered that John Hays, Benjamin Logan, William Campbell, Arthur Bowen and Thomas Ramsey, or any three of them, being first sworn, do view the several ways proposed for said road and make a report of the conveniences and inconveniences attending the same. The viewers thus appointed made their report to the County Court on July 6, 1773, recommending that the lower road be established, which report was confirmed and the road established, and William Campbell, William Edmiston and James Bryan were appointed overseers of the said road. The above is all the information that the records contain of the controversy in regard to the establishment of this road, but I apprehend that the action of the court in establishing the road as they did had considerable bearing in settling the future location of the county seat of Washington county at Abingdon. Upon the second day of the court it was recommended to his Excellency the Governor that he will be pleased to establish the courthouse for this county at a piece of land commonly called McCall's place, now the property of Ross &amp; Co., and the lands of Samuel Crockett, in lieu of the Lead Mines, for the several reasons following: That the said McCall's place and Crockett's lies on the Great Road that passes through the county, and that it is well watered, timbered and level. That it is more central than the mines, and that it is in the neighborhood of a great deal of good lands and meadows. That the Lead Mines are near the south line of the county, that there is no spring convenient, the place is very bare of timber and in a neighborhood where there is very little pasture, and it is certainly off the leading road. From which order Arthur Campbell dissented. While the records are to some extent indefinite as to the action of the Governor upon this petition, it is clear that the county seat was not removed from the Lead Mines during the existence of the county of Fincastle, as is evident from other records that have a bearing upon this subject. The County Court on March 2, 1774, entered the following order: "Ordered that the surveyor lay off the prison bounds, and that he include all the houses and some part of the waters." This clearly applied to the Lead Mines. The act of the Legislature of Virginia establishing Montgomery county directed that the county seat should be Fort Chiswell, and one of the first orders of that court was to appoint commissioners to contract for and superintend the erection of a courthouse. The above facts, when taken in connection with the circumstance that Fort Chiswell was at no time mentioned in the records of the County Court of Fincastle county, except in the petition above set out, are conclusive in regard to this matter. On May 2, 1773, the court ordered that Robert Davis, Alexander Wylie, Robert Buchanan, and Hugh Gallion, any three of whom being duly sworn, do view the nighest way from James Davis' (at the head spring of the Middle Fork of the Holston) to James Catherine's (near the head spring of the South Fork of the Holston), but the records of Fincastle fail to show that this road was established. The next order of importance entered by the court was on May 5, 1773, when the court ordered that Isaac Riddle, Wesley White, James Young and James Montgomery do view the nighest and best way from Eleven Mile creek, on Holston, by Jones' place at the crossing place, going to Watauga, and report. The commissioners made their report on July 6, 1773, and the road was established, and James Montgomery, James Young and Isaac Riddle were appointed overseers. On March 3, 1773, James McCarthy, Matthew Mounts, John Smith, Thomas Byrd, Nathan Richerson and Peter Lee, or any three of them, being first sworn, were ordered to view the nighest and best way from the Town House on Holston to Castle's Woods on Clinch river, and make report. The commissioners made their report on July 6, 1773, and the road was partially established, beginning at John Dunkin's in Elk Garden, thence over the mountains to Poor Valley, about five miles to the westward of the old path, and from thence by the Big Lick, through Lyon's Gap to the Town House. On March 2, 1773, the court directed John Maxwell, Robert Allison and Robert Campbell, or any three of them, to view the nighest and best way from Catherine's Mill to Charles Allison's, and so on to Sinclair's Bottom, and report. On July 6, 1773, the commissioners reported, and the court directed a road to be established from Catherine's Mill to Charles Allison's house on the condition that the people on the South Fork, or any others on same road who think it useful, do cut the same themselves. On the same day the court ordered that William Edmiston, Robert Edmiston, Alexander McNutt, Robert Buchanan, and John Edmiston, any three of whom may act, do view a road from Charles Allison's house down the South Fork to Robert Edmiston's house and report. On May 5, 1773, the County Court directed Arthur Campbell to take a list of the tithables on the Clinch river and on all its forks, as low as the Elk Garden, and on the Wolf Hill creek. And William Russell to take a list of the tithables from the Elk Garden, on the Clinch, down to the county line. And Anthony Bledsoe to take a list of the tithables from Captain Campbell's down to the county line, on the North, South, and Middle Forks of Holston river. And that Captain James Thompson do take a list of the tithables in Captain William Campbell's company. On May 4, 1773, the court directed James Hays, John Hays, Archibald Buchanan, and Robert Davis to view the nighest and best way by Robert Davis' into the leading road from Holston. At the meeting of the County Court on July 6, 1773, Jonathan Jenning was fined forty shillings for speaking of the court with contempt and saying that they were self-interested and partial. And on the same day Stephen Trigg, James McCorkle, Walter Crockett and James McGavock were directed to agree with workmen to repair the second house from the courthouse for a prison in such manner as is necessary. And on the 9th day of July, 1773, Joseph Black, Andrew Colvill, Samuel Ewen, William Blackburn, George Blackburn, Samuel Briggs, Davis Galloway, John Berry, Christopher Acklin, John Keswick, John Vance and Benjamin Logan were directed to clear the nearest and best way from Samuel Brigg's, on Eighteen Mile creek, to James Bryan's, on Eleven Mile creek. On November 2, 1773, on the petition of a number of the inhabitants, it was ordered that William Priest, Henry Willis, Joseph Martin, William Bowen and Joseph Craven, any three of whom may act, after being duly sworn, do view the best way from Maiden Springs settlement (now in Tazewell county) into the Great Road. No further orders pertaining to Washington county were entered by the court until March 2, 1774, on which day Patrick Porter was given leave to build a mill on Falling creek, the waters of Clinch river, this being the first mill erected on Clinch river, so far as the records disclose. On the same day, on the motion of Charles Allison, leave was given him to build a mill on his land, on the South Fork of Holston, near the head spring. On the same day the court appointed Andrew Miller and Thomas Ramsay commissioners to view the nighest and best way from Thomas Ramsay's, by Kennedy's mill, to the Great Road. At a meeting of the court on May 3, 1774, the court, on the petition of the inhabitants of Beaver creek, ordered Benjamin Logan to open a road from James Fulkerson's to the wagon road at Joseph Black's (now Abingdon), the best and most convenient way. On the same day the court directed Anthony Bledsoe to take a list of the tithables in Captains Looney's, Shelby's, and Cocke's companies, William Campbell in his own and Captain Arthur Campbell's companies, and William Russell in his own and Captain Smith's companies. The County Court of Fincastle county was composed of men of dignity and respectability, and they purposed to deal with the attorneys practicing at their bar in such a manner as to command the respect of the bar and the citizens of the county, and, as an evidence of the manner in which they dealt with the members of the legal profession, we here copy an order made by this court on May 3, 1774: "John Gabriel Jones, having misbehaved himself in the court, it is ordered that for his contempt he make his fine with our Lord, the King, by the payment of twenty shillings, and that he be taken," etc. On the same day a peculiar order was entered, which read as follows: "John Dougherty came into court, and, it being fully proved that his left ear had been bitten off by a person in an affray, it is ordered that the same be recorded." It is hard to perceive his object in making this proof and having it recorded unless there existed at that time, or at an earlier date, some law or custom by which criminals lost their ears. At the August term of this court it was directed that a road be built from Arthur Campbell's mill to Blue Spring, at the head of Cripple creek, by way of Rye Bottom, and on August 3d, being the same day as the above order, the court directed a road to be built from Arthur Campbell's mill to Archibald Buchanan's, on the North Fork of Holston river. In the preceding pages we have given a great deal of the records of the County Court of Fincastle county directing the opening of the first roads and granting permission to erect the first mills on the waters of the Holston and Clinch rivers, and it cannot be otherwise than interesting, for, previously to the opening of these roads, the early settlers of this country, as a general rule, were compelled to follow the Indian and buffalo trails made before their advent. The main trail down the Holston and through Washington county was, from the very earliest time of which we have any record, called the Great Road. Before the erection of the first mills on the waters of the Holston, if the early settlers wished to have meal, it could be obtained in one way only, and that by cracking the grains of corn with a hammer or by some other similar method. The first deed executed to any of the settlers on the Holston was dated January 5, 1773, and was made by Edmund Pendleton. It conveyed to Benjamin Logan and John Sharp 676 acres of land situated on Beaver creek, alias Shallow creek, and was the same land surveyed by John Buchanan for Edmund Pendleton on April 2, 1750. On the same day Edmund Pendleton conveyed to William Cocke and Robert Craig 950 acres of land situated on Spring creek, alias Renfro's creek, being the same land surveyed by John Buchanan, deputy surveyor of Augusta county, for Edmund Pendleton on April 2, 1750, and described in the survey as lying on Renfro's creek. This survey covered a considerable part of the farms now owned and occupied by C. L. Clyce, Jerry Whitaker, Allen Lester and H. B. Roberts on Spring creek. The four conveyances above described are older by more than one year and three months than any others to be found in the present bounds of Washington county, the next oldest conveyance bearing date April 14, 1774. It may be interesting at this point to know the oath required of the members of the first County Court administering justice among the settlers upon the Holston. We here copy the oath: "You shall swear that as a justice of the peace in the county of Fincastle in all articles in the commission to you directed, you shall do equal right to the poor and to the rich, after your cunning, wit and power according to law; and you shall not be of any counsel of any quarrel hanging before you, and the issues, fines and amercements that shall happen to be made, and all the forefeitures which shall fall before you, you shall cause to be entered, without any concealment or embezzling; you shall not let for gift or other causes, but well and truly you shall do your office of justice of the peace, as well within your county court as without; and you shall not take any gift, fee or gratuity, for anything to be done by virtue of your office, and you shall not direct or cause to be directed, any warrant by you to be made to the parties, but you shall direct them to the Sheriff, or bailiffs of said county, or other the King's officers or ministers, or other indifferent persons, to do execution thereof, so help you God." The oath of a justice of the County Court in Chancery was as follows: "You shall swear that well and truly you will serve our sovereign lord, the King, and his people, in the office of a justice of the county court of Fincastle in Chancery, and that you will do equal right to all manner of people, great and small, high and low, rich and poor, according to equity and good conscience and the laws and usages of this colony and dominion of Virginia, without favor, affection or partiality. So help you God."* * 5 Hen. Stat., pages 489-490. A considerable number of people had settled in the immediate vicinity of Abingdon, and eastward to the head waters of the Holston, and in the beginning of this year two congregations of Presbyterians had organized in the county—one at Sinking Spring (now Abingdon) and another at Ebbing Spring, on the Middle Fork of the Holston river, near the James Byars farm; and in the month of April, 1773, Samuel Edmiston was commissioned by the two congregations above mentioned to present a call to the Rev. Charles Cummings at the Reverend Presbytery of Hanover when sitting at the Tinkling Springs, in Augusta county. This call was reduced to writing and signed by the members of the Sinking Spring and Ebbing Spring congregations. It was presented to the Presbytery by Samuel Edmiston for the services of Mr. Cummings at Brown's meeting-house, in Augusta county, on June 2, 1773. The call with the signatures thereto is as follows: "A call from the united congregations of Ebbing, and Sinking springs, on Holston's river, Fincastle county, to be presented to the Rev. Charles Cummings, minister of the gospel, at the Reverend Presbytery of Hanover when sitting at the Tinkling Spring: Worthy and Dear Sir,— We, being in very destitute circumstances for want of the ordinances of Christ's house statedly administered amongst us; many of us under very distressing spiritual languishments; and multitudes perishing in our sins for want of the bread of life broken among us; our Sabbaths too much profaned, or at least wasted in melancholy silence at home, our hearts and hands discouraged, and our spirits broken with our mournful condition, so that human language cannot sufficiently paint. Having had the happiness, by the good providence of God, of enjoying part of your labors to our abundant satisfaction, and being universally well satisfied by our experience of your ministerial abilities, piety, literature, prudence and peculiar agreeableness of your qualifications to us in particular as a gospel minister—we do, worthy and dear sir, from our very hearts, and with the most cordial affection and unanimity agree to call, invite and entreat you to undertake the office of a pastor among us, and the care and charge of our precious souls, and upon your accepting of this our call, we do promise that we will receive the word of God from your mouth, attend on your ministry, instruction and reproofs, in public and private, and submit to the discipline which Christ has appointed in his church, administered by you while regulated by the word of God and agreeable to our confession of faith and directory. And that you may give yourself wholly up to the important work of the ministry, we hereby promise to pay you annually the sum of ninety pounds from the time of your accepting this our call; and that we shall behave ourselves towards you with all that dutiful respect and affection that becomes a people towards their minister, using all means within our power to render your life comfortable and happy. We entreat you, worthy and dear sir, to have compassion upon us in this remote part of the world, and accept this our call and invitation to the pastoral charge of our precious and immortal souls, and we shall hold ourselves bound to pray.

Montgomery, Samuel Bell, John Campbell. This call was accepted by Mr. Cummings, but no record is preserved of any installation being appointed or performed. It was intended that this call should have been presented at a session of the Presbytery in the preceding April, but, for some cause, it was delayed until the following June. Having accepted this call, he removed his family to the Holston, and settled upon three hundred acres of land on the head waters of Wolf Hill creek, which he purchased from Dr. Thomas Walker for the consideration of thirty-three pounds, and which land was conveyed to him by Dr. Walker by a deed dated April 14, 1774. We hope our readers will indulge us if we pause at this place to remark that every acre of this three-hundred-acre tract of land is to-day, 129 years thereafter, in the possession of the direct lineal descendants of the Rev. Charles Cummings. A remarkable fact. As soon as he had settled his family on the Holston, he set about the performance of the duties pertaining to his station with all the energy and intelligence of which he was capable. He purchased from Dr. Thomas Walker, for five shillings, by estimation, fifty-five acres of land, which land was deeded by Dr. Walker "to the minister and congregation of the Sinking Spring Church and their successors for the time being on April 14, 1774. This tract of land was bounded as follows: Beginning at a red oak corner to Andrew Colvill, running thence E. 10 poles to a white oak, N. 20′, E. 126 poles to a hickory; thence N. 31′, W. 48 poles to a chestnut on a high ridge, S. 53′, W. 96 poles to a chestnut and a white oak on the side of said ridge, S. 35′, E. 46 poles to a large white oak, S. 40′, W. 28 poles to a black oak near Sinking Spring, S. 36′, E. 48 poles to a white oak; thence E. 12 poles to the beginning."* * Deed Book "A," page—, Fincastle county. A considerable part of northwest Abingdon is built upon this same tract of land. The first meeting house of the Sinking Spring congregation was erected on the first rise in the present cemetery in the rear of the Martin vault, and was a very large cabin of unhewn logs. It was from 80 to 100 feet long and about 40 feet wide, and had a very remarkable appearance. Governor David Campbell, in speaking of the men who signed this call, says: "In early life I knew personally many of those whose names are signed to it, and I knew nearly all of them from character." They were a most respectable body of men, were all Whigs in the revolution, and nearly all, probably every one of them, performed military service against the Indians, and a large portion of them against the British in the battles of King's Mountain, Guilford Courthouse, and other actions in North and South Carolina. Such was the character of the first men who inhabited our county and worshipped in this, the first place of worship, on all the waters of the Holston and Clinch. Daniel Boone again visited the waters of the Holston in the fall of this year. The Boones and five other families set out from their homes on the Yadkin river, N. C., on September 25, 1773. They passed through Washington county and on into Powell's Valley (on their way to Kentucky), where they were joined by William Bryan, with forty other people. While this body of emigrants were leisurely traveling through Powell's Valley a small company, under James Boone, Daniel Boone's eldest son, left the main body and went to the home of William Russell to secure provisions, and on the 9th of October James Boone and his company, among the number being Russell's son Henry and two slaves, encamped a few miles in the rear of the main body. At this point they were, the next day, waylaid by a small company of Shawnese and Cherokee Indians, who were supposed to be at peace with the white settlers. On the morning of the 10th James Boone and his entire company were captured, and, after cruel torture, were slaughtered. After this occurrence Daniel Boone's company of emigrants broke up and returned to the settlements, and Daniel Boone and his family returned to the home of William Russell, near Castle's Woods, on Clinch river, about forty miles distant, and took up their residence in an empty cabin on the farm of Captain David Glass, seven or eight miles from William Russell's, where they spent the winter of 1773-1774. Daniel Boone had twice, previously to this time, visited the Kentucky wilderness, and had decided to settle in the beautiful country which he had visited. And thus rudely were his first efforts frustrated. The motive actuating the Indians in making this assault must have been jealousy of these, the first emigrants to Kentucky. They could not have had for their object the securing of plunder alone, for the Indians had long lived in peace with the white settlers without any effort to murder or burn. In this assault six men, including Boone's son, were slain, and their cattle and plunder secured and carried off. We have now reached the time when the eyes of all frontiersmen were fixed upon the fertile lands lying beyond the Cumberland mountains. The Kentucky wilderness was no longer visited by the hunter alone, but the explorer and the settler were seeking an opportunity to acquire a future home in the new country. A distinguished author, in speaking of the condition of the Indians at that time, says: "Recently they had been seriously alarmed by the tendency of the whites to encroach on the great hunting grounds south of the Ohio, for here and there hunters and settlers were already beginning to build cabins along the course of that stream," and in another place the same author speaks as follows: "The savages grew continually more hostile, and in the fall of 1773 their attacks became so frequent that it was evident a general outbreak was at hand. Eleven people were murdered in the county of Fincastle alone. The Shawnese were the leaders in all these outrages. Thus the spring of 1774 opened with everything ripe for an explosion. The Virginia borderers were fearfully exasperated, and were ready to take vengeance upon any Indian, whether peaceful or hostile, while the Shawnese and Mingoes, on their side, were arrogant and overbearing, and yet alarmed at the continual advance of the whites."* * The Winning of the West, Vol. I., pages 250-252. The Virginia Colony was at peace with the Cherokees, and most of the Indians' depredations during the year 1774-1775 were committed by the northwest Indians. A Mr. Russell and five of his companions were murdered by the Indians in the fall of the year 1773 in Fincastle county, and about the same time two men, by the name of Cochran and Foley, and a man by the name of Hayes, with his three companions, were murdered by the Indians, but as to the locality of these murders or the circumstances attending them we have no information.† † Wm. Preston Mss. In the course of the summer of 1774, a number of the citizens of Fincastle county were captured and killed by the northern Indians, among the number being Thomas Hogg and two men near the mouth of the Great Kanawha, and Walter Kelly, with three or four other persons, below the falls of the Great Kanawha. William Kelly and a young woman were captured on Muddy creek, a branch of Green river. Kelly was killed and the young woman carried into captivity. During this same summer a man by the name of Shockley, a scout employed by the County Court of Fincastle county, was shot and killed, and on the 7th day of August, 1774, the house of one John Lybrook, situated on Sinking creek in the present county of Craig, was attacked by the Indians. Lybrook was wounded in the arm, and only saved his life by hiding in a cave. Three of his children (one of them a sucking infant), a young woman, a daughter of one Scott, and a child of widow Snidow were killed. All the children were scalped but one, and were mangled in a most cruel manner. At the same time and in the same community, John and Jacob Snidow and a younger brother, whose name is not known, were captured and made prisoners. Two of the brothers escaped from the Indians on the following Wednesday, but the other was carried into captivity and remained with the Indians until he acquired their habits and became so fond of their manner of life that he ever afterwards lived among them. At the same time a Miss Margaret McKinsie was captured and carried into captivity, where she remained for eighteen years, at the end of which time she returned to New river and married a Mr. Benjamin Hall. The white settlers near Pittsburg were on very bad terms with the northwest Indians. On the last day of April, 1774, a small company of Indians left the camp of the Indian Chief Logan, at Yellow creek, and crossed the river to visit a man by the name of Greathouse, a place which they had been accustomed to visit for the purpose of buying rum from the whites. The Indians were made drunk with liquor, and while in this condition were cruelly murdered by Greathouse and his associates. Nine Indians in all were murdered at this time; among the number being the entire family of the Indian Chief Logan. Logan had always been the friend of the white man, and had always been exceedingly kind and gentle to women and children, notwithstanding the fact that some of his relatives had been killed by the whites some years before. Logan was a skilled marksman and a mighty hunter of commanding dignity, who treated all men with a grave courtesy and exacted the same treatment in return. He was greatly liked and respected by all the white hunters and frontiersmen whose friendship and respect were worth having. They admired him for his dexterity and prowess, and they loved him for his straightforward honesty and his noble loyalty to his friends.* * Winning of the West, Vol. I., page 256. This last stroke was more than Logan could stand. He attributed his misfortune to Captain Cresap, and he began at once to raid the settlements with small bands of Indians. This raid was upon the settlers of the Holston and the Clinch. On his first expedition he took thirteen scalps, six of the number being children. He was pursued and overtaken by a party of men commanded by a man by the name of McClure, but he ambushed and defeated them on McClure's creek, now in Dickenson county, and it was from this occurrence that the creek obtained its name. Again, during the same year, he visited the waters of Holston, within twelve miles of the present location of Bristol, and captured and murdered many families. At the house of one Roberts, whose family was cut off, Logan left a war-club, to which was tied a note, which read as follows: "Captain Cresap,—What did you kill my people on Yellow creek for? The white people killed my kin at Conestoga a great while ago, and I thought nothing of that. But you killed my kin again on Yellow creek, and took my cousin prisoner. Then I thought I must kill, too, and I have been three times to war since; but the Indians are not angry, only myself. July 21, 1774. "Captain John Logan." While the settlers at Pittsburg provoked this difficulty, it seems that the settlers on the Holston and Clinch were the principal sufferers thereby. Numerous surveyors, with their instruments, visited Kentucky during this year. Among the number were James Douglas, Hancock Taylor, Isaac Bledsoe, and John Floyd. The last named left the home of Colonel William Preston at Smithfield on April 9, 1774, accompanied by eight men. They passed down the Kanawha river to the Ohio, where they were informed by a company they met that an Indian war was probable; notwithstanding which information they continued their explorations, surveying many tracts of land on the Ohio and in the present State of Kentucky. We here give a list of a few surveys made by the men who visited Kentucky in this year. We copy this list from the fact that it is exceedingly interesting, and for the further reason that it contains the first surveys made by the white man in the present State of Kentucky: Notable Tracts of Land, Surveyed by John Floyd, Hancock Taylor and James Douglas, in 1774-1775, lying mostly in Kentucky Time.

This is a partial list only of the many surveys made in west Fincastle county, now in the State of Kentucky, by Hancock Taylor, James Douglas, and John Floyd. These men were sent to Kentucky by direction of the Governor of the Colony of Virginia, and all the lands thus located were for men or the assignees of men who took part in the French-Indian war of 1754-1763, and who acquired their rights under the King's proclamation of 1763. When the war with the Indians broke out Lord Dunmore was exceedingly anxious to give information of that fact to the surveyors, and he directed Colonel William Preston, who had charge of the defenses of Fincastle county, to communicate the fact to the surveyors. Colonel Preston authorized Colonel William Russell, who then lived on the Clinch river, to employ two faithful woodmen to go to Kentucky and convey the information to the several companies of surveyors and their assistants, and on the 26th of June, 1774, Captain Russell wrote Colonel William Preston as follows: "I have engaged to start immediately upon the occasion two of the best hands I could think of, Daniel Boone and Michael Stoner, who have engaged to reach the country as low as the falls, and to return by way of Gasper's Lick, on Cumberland, and through Cumberland Gap, so that by the assiduity of these men, if it be not too late, I hope the gentlemen will be apprized of the imminent danger they are daily in." Boone and Stoner set out immediately upon their trip, and warned Colonel James Harrod and thirty men at Harrodsburg, now Kentucky. They found another company of surveyors at Fontainebleau and on the Kentucky river they found Captain John Floyd and his men, and thence they passed to the falls of the Ohio, where they warned the surveyors at Mann's Lick, and, after an absence of sixty-one days, they reached Russell's Fort on Clinch river, having traveled 800 miles on foot. Captain John Floyd immediately set out for the settlements, and on the 13th day of August, 1774, he reached the home of Colonel Preston at Smithfield, and reported: "That on the 8th of July he and three others parted with fourteen men, who were also engaged in the surveying business, and went about twenty miles from them to finish his part of the work, and that they were to meet on the first day of August at a place on the Kentucky, known by the name of the Cabin, in order to proceed on their homeward journey. That on the 24th of July he, with his three men, repaired to the place appointed, where he found that a part, or all of the company, had assembled according to agreement, but had gone off in the greatest precipitation, leaving him only this notice written on a tree: `Alarmed by finding some people killed, we are gone down,' upon which he, with his small party, immediately set out, steering for our settlements; and after an extremely painful and fatiguing journey of sixteen days through mountains almost inaccessible and ways unknown, he at last arrived on Clinch river. He did not well understand the notice left him on the tree, whether part of the company had assembled at the Cabin, and that they had gone down to the camp in order to warn those who were at work in that neighborhood of danger, or whether the whole company had met and were departed down the Mississippi, as several in the company had before proposed returning home that way, with a view both to see the country and avoid the fatigue of returning by land. The names of some of the party not then returned are here inserted, viz.: James Douglas, Hancock Taylor and Isaach Bledsoe; Surveyors John Willis, Willis Lee, Captain John Ashby, Abraham Hempenstall, William Ballard, John Green, Lawrence Darnell, Mordecai Batson, John Sodusky, James Strother and John Ball." The northwestern Indians were greatly alarmed at the encroachments of the white settlers, who were daily surveying and settling the lands on the banks of the Ohio and in the wilderness of Kentucky. The white settlers insisted that they had a right to survey and settle these lands under the provisions of the treaty made with the confederacy of the Six Nations at Fort Stanwix in 1768, and they were greatly exasperated by the conduct of the northwestern Indians in denying their right to said lands and in murdering their people and plundering their settlements. The white settlers had long been restrained by the British Government from avenging their wrongs on the Indians, and now they clamored for war. When the news of the disposition of the Indians reached Williamsburg the Governor of the Colony and the House of Burgesses of Virginia immediately took steps to protect the western settlers. By the direction of Lord Dunmore, Lieutenant-Colonel William Christian, in the month of May, 1774, left Williamsburg for Fincastle county with instructions to use every means possible to prevent the inhabitants from leaving the settlements on the approach of the Indian war. As soon as he reached his home a council of the militia officers was held on June 25, 1774, at the Lead Mines, at which council it was resolved that Lieutenant-Colonel Christian should march with a body of militia to the Clinch settlements. The militia was at once mustered in and equipped at the personal expense of Colonel Christian, William Preston and Major Arthur Campbell, and proceeded to the Clinch settlements, where every preparation was made for war. A considerable part of this force accompanied Colonel Christian to Point Pleasant in the following August. General Andrew Lewis was directed by Governor Dunmore to organize a sufficient force to carry war into the enemy's country. The organization of this body of troops was intrusted to General Andrew Lewis and Colonel Charles Lewis, of Augusta county. As it would require some time to organize this body of troops, it was thought proper to send an advance guard into the enemy's country to restrain the Indians while the whites were preparing, and early in June about 400 men, under the command of Colonel Angus McDonald, assembled at Wheeling and immediately marched to the Indian grounds, on the Muskingum, with the loss of two men killed and eight or ten wounded. The Indians fled, and in a few days returned and sued for peace, but their pretensions were not sincere; and they were only delaying McDonald while they removed their property and their women and children beyond the reach of the Virginia troops. Thereupon Colonel McDonald burned the Indian towns and crops and retraced his steps to Wheeling. As soon as the troops had retired from the Indian country small bands of Indians invaded the western settlements at many points. Many of the people of Fincastle county were murdered, and by the first of August all the people in Fincastle county, except a few of the settlers on Holston, were gathered into small forts; and such was the unhappy situation of the people that they could not attend to their plantations, nor were the scouts employed by the county able to investigate the inroads of the enemy, as they came in small parties and traveled along the mountains with great caution. About the last of June one Knox, who went to Ohio with the surveyors in the spring, reached the settlements and reported: "That on the 13th of June one Jacob Lewis departed from the camp on Salt river in the morning to hunt, and had never been heard of since; that on the 8th of July, being at said camp, about one hundred miles from the Ohio and nearly opposite to the falls, he, with nine others, was surprised and fired upon by a party of about twenty Indians; that two men were killed on the spot, viz.: James Hamilton, from Fredericksburg, and James Cowan, from Pennsylvania, and as the enemy rushed upon them before it was possible to put themselves in any posture of defence, they were obliged to abandon their camp and make their escape to a party of thirty-five men who were in that neighborhood. Next day, the whole company, being forty-three in number, after burying the dead, set out for the settlement on Clinch river, where they arrived on the 29th, after making several discoveries of the enemy on the way." General Andrew Lewis had orders to raise four companies of militia from Fincastle and Botetourt counties, to rendezvous at Camp Union, and to march thence down the Kanawha to Fort Pitt, at the junction of the Kanawha and Ohio. Three companies of men were raised in Fincastle county and were commanded by: Captain Evan Shelby, the forces from the waters of the Holston, Captain Wm. Russell, the forces from the waters of the Clinch, Captain Wm. Herbert, the forces from the waters of New river. Captain Russell left Russell's Fort on Clinch river previously to August 13th, 1774, and Captain Evan Shelby began the march with his forces on the 17th of August, 1774, both companies joining the regiment of Colonel Christian on New river; from which place Colonel Christian, with his regiment, proceeded to Camp Union. On the 11th day of September, 1774, the army of Gen. Lewis began the march down the Kanawha, and, after the expiration of twenty-five days, they arrived at Point Pleasant and camped upon the banks of the Ohio. When the army of General Lewis left Camp Union, Colonel Wm. Christian, with four hundred men, was directed to remain and guard the provisions until the return of a company of horse that had been sent to the mouth of Elk, when he was to hurry things forward. But the companies of Captains Russell and Shelby accompanied the army of General Lewis upon its march from Camp Union to Point Pleasant and were attached to the command of Colonel Charles Lewis, of Augusta county. At the same time, Lord Dunmore raised a considerable force in the lower Valley and was to march to Fort Pitt, and thence to Point Pleasant, where he was to meet General Lewis. Instead of doing so, he marched into Ohio. General Lewis, upon his arrival at Point Pleasant, waited several days, expecting the arrival of Lord Dunmore, and, not hearing from him, he dispatched messengers, but whether he received a reply before the battle is a matter of dispute. On Sunday, the 9th day of October, the sturdy Scotch-Irish Presbyterians from Fincastle county spent the day in religious exercises, little dreaming that on the coming day they would be surprised by the Indians and win the most hotly contested battle with the Indians recorded in the annals of our history. BATTLE OF POINT PLEASANT. Early Monday morning, October 10th, James Mooney and James Hughey, of Captain Russell's company, left the camp in quest of deer. When about three miles distant from their camp, they unexpectedly came in sight of a large body of Indians, in their encampment. The Indians, when they discovered the two men, fired upon them, and Hughey was killed by a white renegade by the name of Travenor Ross. Mooney made his escape, and, returning to the camp, reported that he had seen a body of the enemy covering four acres of ground, as closely as they could stand by the side of each other. About the same time, two members of Captain Shelby's company, James Robertson and Valentine Sevier, who had been out hunting, returned to camp and reported that they had met a body of hostile Indians advancing upon the camp, and that they had fired upon them at the distance of ten steps. It being dark, the Indians were thereby halted. As no official report of this battle has been preserved, I will here give the report as obtained by Dr. Hale from a letter published in the Belfast (Ireland) News Letter, a paper published at that time. BELFAST. Yesterday arrived a mail from New York brought to Falmouth by the Harriot packet boat, Captain Lee. Williamsburg, Va., November 10th. The following letter is just received from the camp on Point Pleasant, at the mouth of the Great Kenhawa (as then spelled), dated October 17, 1774: "The following is a true statement of a battle fought at this place on the 10th instant: On Monday morning about half an hour before sunrise, two of Captain Russell's company discovered a large party of Indians about a mile from the camp, one of which men was shot by the Indians; the other made his escape and brought in the intelligence. In two or three minutes after, two of Captain Shelby's men came in and confirmed the account. "Colonel Andrew Lewis, being informed thereof, immediately ordered out Colonel Charles Lewis, to take command of one hundred and fifty of the Augusta troops, and with him went Captain Dickinson, Captain Harrison, Captain Wilson, Captain John Lewis, of Augusta, and Captain Lockridge, which made the first division. Colonel Fleming was then ordered to take command of one hundred and fifty men of the Botetourt, Bedford, and Fincastle troops, viz., Captain Thomas Buford, from Bedford; Captain Love, of Botetourt; Captain Shelby and Captain Russell, of Fincastle, which made the second division. "Colonel Charles Lewis's division marched to the right some distance from the Ohio, and Colonel Fleming with his division, on the bank of the Ohio to the left. "Colonel Charles Lewis's division had not marched quite half a mile from the camp when, about sunrise, an attack was made on the front of his division, in a most vigorous manner, by the united tribes of Indians, Shawnese, Delawares, Mingoes, Tawas, and of several other nations—in number not less than eight hundred, and by many thought to be one thousand. "In this heavy attack, Colonel Charles Lewis received a wound, which, in a few hours caused his death, and several of his men fell on the spot; in fact, the Augusta division was obliged to give way to the heavy fire of the enemy. In about a second of a minute after the attack on Colonel Lewis's division, the enemy engaged the front of Colonel Fleming's division on the Ohio, and in a short time the Colonel received two balls through his left arm and one through his breast, and, after animating the officers and soldiers, in a most calm manner, to the pursuit of victory, retired to the camp. "The loss in the field was sensibly felt by the officers in particular; but the Augusta troops being shortly after reinforced from the camp by Colonel Field, with his company, together with Captain McDowell, Captain Matthews, and Captain Stewart, from Augusta; Captain Paulin, Captain Arbuckle and Captain McClanahan, from Botetourt, the enemy no longer able to maintain their ground, were forced to give way till they were in a line with the troops, Colonel Fleming being left in the action on the Ohio. "In this precipitate retreat Colonel Fleming was killed. During this time, which was till after twelve, the action in a small degree abated, but continued, except at short intervals, sharp enough till after one o'clock. Their long retreat gave them a most advantageous spot of ground, from which it appeared to the officers so difficult to dislodge them that it was thought most advisable to stand as the line was then formed, which was about a mile and a quarter in length, and had sustained till then a constant and equal weight of the action, from wing to wing. "It was till about half an hour of sunset they continued firing on us scattered shots, which we returned to their disadvantage. At length the night coming on they found a safe retreat. "They had not the satisfaction of carrying off any of our men's scalps, save those of one or two stragglers they killed before the engagement. Many of their dead they scalped, rather than we should have them, but our troops scalped upwards of twenty of their men that were first killed. "It is beyond doubt their loss, in number, far exceeded ours, which is considerable. "The return of the killed and wounded in the above battle, same as our last, is as follows: "Killed—Colonels Charles Lewis and John Fields, Captains John Murray, R. McClanahan, Samuel Wilson, James Ward, Lieutenant Hugh Allen, Ensigns Cantiff and Bracken, and forty-four privates. Total killed, fifty-three. "Wounded—Colonel William Fleming, Captains John Dickinson, Thomas Buford, and I. Skidman, Lieutenants Goldman, Robinson, Lard and Vance, and seventy-nine privates. Total wounded, eighty-seven; killed and wounded, one hundred and forty." When Colonel Charles Lewis fell, Captain Evan Shelby succeeded to the command of the regiment, and Isaac Shelby, his son, succeeded to the command of his father's company, and late in the evening General Lewis directed Captains Isaac Shelby, Matthews, and Stewart to assail the Indians in the rear, by advancing up the Kanawha river, protected by the bank and undergrowth. In the execution of this order considerable difficulty was experienced, and possibly, failure would have been the result had it not been for the request of John Sawyers an Orderly Sergeant in Captain Shelby's company, for permission to take a few men of the company and drive the Indians from the position which afforded them protection. Permission was granted and the Indians were dislodged. The companies above mentioned having gained their rear, the Indians precipitately took their flight across the Ohio. It is generally admitted that this was one of the most hotly contested battles between the white men and the Indians that took place in the history of the early settlement of our country. The terrible conflict that took place between the white men and the Indians in this battle is hard to depict in ordinary language. De Hass thus describes the conflict: "The battle scene was terribly grand. There stood the combatants, terror, rage, disappointment, and despair riveted upon the faces of one, while calm resolution and the unbending will to do or die were marked upon the other. Neither party would retreat, neither could advance. The noise of the firing was tremendous. No single gun could be distinguished, it was one continuous roar. "The rifle and the tomahawk now did their work with dreadful certainty. The confusion and perturbation of the camp had now arrived at its greatest height. The confused sounds and wild uproar of the battle added greatly to the terror of the scene. The shouting of the whites, the continued roar of fire-arms, the warwhoop and dismal yelling of the Indians, were discordant and terrific." Colonel Christian, whom General Lewis had left at Camp Union, as soon as he had complied with the orders of General Lewis, set out for Point Pleasant, with all the troops under his command except one company of Fincastle men, whom he left under the command of Anthony Bledsoe at Camp Union to guard the supplies and take care of the sick. He marched his troops with all possible expedition, and arrived at Point Pleasant on the evening of October 10th, after the battle had been fought. Soon thereafter, Lord Dunmore negotiated a treaty of peace with the Indians at one of their towns in Ohio, by which the northwest Indians ceded all their claims to the lands lying south of the Ohio river, to the King of England. General Lewis marched his army back to Camp Union where it was disbanded. The body of militia that went from Fincastle upon this expedition were armed with rifle guns, and, being good woodsmen, were looked upon to be at least equal to any troops for the number that had been raised, in America. It is sufficient to know that the credit of having been the first to discover the approach of the Indians, and thereby, possibly, to secure the preservation of General Lewis's army, was due to the vigilance of the backwoodsmen from Fincastle. And in addition to that, it should be a matter of pride to every citizen of this section of Virginia to know that the troops from the waters of the Clinch and the Holston were among the number to receive the first assault of the enemy, and to their skill and bravery may be accredited, the successful flanking, and consequently the precipitate rout, of the Indian army. The killed and wounded among the Fincastle troops were considerable. The names of a few of the killed and wounded are given below: Robert Campbell, private, afterwards granted a pension of 10 pounds per year. James Hughey, killed. James Robinson, wounded. Mark Williams, private, killed. John Carmack, private, wounded. John Steward, wounded. John McKenney, wounded, three times. Lieutenant Vance, wounded. The following is a partial list of the men who accompanied Captain Evan Shelby on this expedition: Isaac Shelby, Captain. James Robertson, O. S. James Shelby, Henry Span, Frederick Mongle, John Carmack, George Brooks, Abram Newland, Emanuel Shoatt, Peter Forney, John Fain, Samuel Fain, Samuel Samples, Robert Handley, William Casey, John Stewart, wounded; Richard Burke, Elijah Robertson, Richard Holliway, Julius Robison, Benjamin Graham, Hugh O'Gullion, James Hughey, Basileel Maxwell, Valentine Sevier, O.

Daniel Boone, upon his return from Kentucky to Russell's Fort, on the 13th day of August, found Captain William Russell absent on the Point Pleasant expedition, and he immediately set out with a body of troops to reinforce him, but was ordered back to protect the settlers on the Clinch, where he remained for some time. The forts on Clinch river, at this time, with the number of men in each and the officers in command, were as follows: Fort Blackmore, sixteen men, Sergeant Moore commanding. Fort Moore, (twenty miles east), twenty men, Lieutenant Daniel Boone commanding. Fort Russell (four miles east), twenty men, Sergeant W. Poage commanding. Fort Glade Hollow, (twelve miles east), fifteen men, Sergeant John Duncan commanding. Elk Garden* * About six miles east of Lebanon on North Fork of Cedar Creek, on land of the Stuart Land &amp; Cattle Company. (fourteen miles east), fifteen men, Sergeant John Kinkead commanding. Maiden Spring, (twenty-three miles east), five men, Sergeant John Crow commanding. Whitlow's Crab Orchard, three men, Ensign John Campbell commanding. Boone was very diligent in protecting the settlements and was commissioned Captain for his valued services. As soon as the Indians ascertained that so many of the citizens from the waters of the Clinch were absent on the expedition to Point Pleasant, they began a series of very alarming raids. On the 8th of September, 1774, they visited the home of John Henry, on the Clinch river, now in Tazewell county, Virginia, in Thompson's Valley, he, having on the 15th day of May of the same year, settled upon a tract of land that Daniel Smith, Deputy Surveyor of Fincastle county, had surveyed for him. Henry received a dangerous wound from which he died, his wife and three children were taken prisoners, and on the same day a man was taken prisoner by another party of Indians on the Holston river. On the 13th day of September, 1774, a soldier was fired upon by three Indians on the Clinch river, but was not hurt. He returned the fire and, it is believed, killed an Indian. This company of Indians were pursued for several days, by Captain Daniel Smith and a company of militia, but they could not be overtaken. On the 23d, two negroes were taken prisoners at Blackmore's Fort, on waters of Clinch river, and a great many horses and cattle were shot down. On the 24th day of the same month, an entire family were taken and killed, at Reedy Creek, a branch of the Holston river, near the Cherokee line. On Sunday morning, the 25th, hallooing and the report of many guns were heard. These last murders were believed to be the work of the Cherokees, who appeared at that time in very bad humor. The victory gained at Point Pleasant on the 10th of October put a stop to all organized raids upon the frontier settlements, for the time being. Upon the return of the Fincastle troops from the expedition to Point Pleasant, the free-holders of Fincastle county assembled at the Lead Mines and drafted an address to the Hon. John, Earl of Dunmore, thanking him heartily for his exertions in their behalf in the late war, and expressed the wish that the late disturbances might be amicably settled. On the 14th day of April, 1774, Dr. Thomas Walker conveyed to James Piper 365 acres of land on a branch of the Holston river called Wolf Hill Creek; on the same day, he conveyed to Alexander Breckenridge 360 acres on Wolf Hill Creek, to Samuel Briggs 313 acres on Wolf Hill Creek, alias Castle's Creek, to Joseph Black, 305 acres on Eighteen Mile Creek (this being the name of the small creek that flows through Abingdon) and to Andrew Colvill, 324 acres on Wolf Hill Creek. The persons above named were the first settlers in the vicinity of Abingdon. In the spring of the year 1774, the free-holders of Fincastle county met at the Lead Mines, their courthouse, and elected two members of the Virginia House of Burgesses to represent Fincastle county, viz.: William Christian, Stephen Trigg. It may not be amiss at this point to state briefly the laws governing the qualifications required of the citizens of Fincastle county to vote and hold office, in this, the last year that the Colony of Virginia adhered to the crown of England. The freeholders of every county possessed the liberty of electing two of the most able and fit men, being freeholders and qualified to vote, to represent their county in all the General Assemblies. The electors or voters were required to own an estate of freehold for his own life or the life of another, or other greater estate in at least fifty acres of land, if no settlement be made upon it, or twenty-five acres with a plantation and house thereon at least twelve feet square, said property being in the county in which the electors offered to vote. The sheriff was required to deliver to the minister and reader of every parish in his county a copy of the writ of election, and, upon the back of every such writ, he was required to endorse the fact that said election would be held at the courthouse in his county upon a day appointed by him. And the minister or reader was required to publish the same immediately after divine services, every Sunday between the receipt of said writ and the day of election, under heavy penalty for failure to do so. It was further provided that every freeholder actually residing in the county should personally appear at the courthouse on the day fixed and give his vote, upon the penalty of forfeiting two hundred pounds of tobacco, if he failed to vote. The sheriff was required to appoint fit persons, and these persons after being duly sworn, were required to enter the names of every candidate in a distinct column, and the name of every freeholder giving his vote, under the name of the person voted for, all of which was required to be done in the presence of the candidates or their agents, and upon the close of the polls the sheriff was ordered to proclaim the names of the successful candidates. And it was further provided, that any person who should directly or indirectly, except in his usual and ordinary course of hospitality, in his own house, give, present, or allow to any person or persons, having voice or vote in such elections, any money, meat, drink, entertainment or provisions, or make any present, gift, reward, or entertainment, or any promise, agreement, obligation, or engagement, to any person, etc., shall be declared guilty of bribery and corruption,* * 8 Hen. S., page 526. and rendered incapable to sit, or vote, or to hold office." Thus it will be seen that the laws were very strict in regard to the manner of holding elections, and it cannot be doubted, that an election held under such laws would be honest and would express the will of the people. Our present law-makers might well learn a lesson from the example set them by the law-makers of the Colony of Virginia, under the rule of King George III. Early in the history of Fincastle county, the House of Burgesses enacted a law which provided, "that from and after the first day of December next, the inhabitants of the said county of Fincastle shall discharge all fees due from them to the secretary and other officers in said county at the rate of 8s and 4 pence, for every hundredweight of gross tobacco. The principle asserted by the regulators at the Alamance had spread among the American colonies, until, at the time mentioned, it seemed to permeate the whole American body politic, and, on the other hand, the British Parliament had repealed all the port duties imposed at their session in 1767, except the duty of three pence a pound on tea, which was continued for the purpose of maintaining the principle contended for by the British Parliament, to-wit: that they had the right to tax the American Colonists without giving them representation, and not for the purpose of revenue only. The American Colonists were opposed to the principle of taxation without representation, and they opposed a small tax as bitterly as they opposed the port duties of 1767. The collection of the tax was resisted at every point, and, at Boston, the cargoes of tea were thrown into the sea. Whereupon the British Parliament passed a bill closing Boston Harbor, upon which information great indignation pervaded the entire colonies. The House of Burgesses of Virginia observed the first day of the operation of the bill closing Boston Harbor, as a fast day, and declared: "That any attack made on one of our sister colonies to compel submission to arbitrary taxes is an attack made on all British America, and threatened ruin to the rights of all, unless the united wisdom of the whole be applied." And they proposed a general Congress to take such action as the united interests of the American Colonies might require. This suggestion, made by the House of Burgesses, was accepted by all the colonies and the first Continental Congress met in Philadelphia, on the 5th day of September, 1774, just one month and five days preceding the battle of Point Pleasant. The officers and men under command of Lord Dunmore, hearing of the action of the first Continental Congress, met and adopted a resolution, which was as follows: "Resolved, That as the love of liberty and attachment to the real interests and just rights of America outweigh every other consideration, they would exert every power within them for the defence of American Liberty and for the support of her just rights and privileges; not in any precipitate, riotous, or tumultuous manner, but when regularly called forth by the unanimous voice of our countrymen." THE REVOLUTION. The period with which we now purpose to deal will be ever remembered, by reason of the production of one of those masterpieces of political evolution which mould the world and fix the destiny of mankind, an event unsurpassed in the history of the world; the founding of the American Republic. In dealing with this subject, we deem it necessary to an intelligent understanding of the motives and actions of the men of that day, to give, with some particularity, the story complete, from its inception to its culmination, recognizing that a story partly told is misleading, and the true merits of a controversy are oftentimes obscured by a mutilated statement, or a half-told tale. For ten years preceding the resort of the American Colonies to extreme measures, a bitterly contested controversy constantly engaged the attention of the British Government and the American Colonies, and it has been well said by one of the fathers of our country, that the "Revolution was finished before the war was commenced." Indeed, it seems to the student of our early history at this distance from the time of the occurrences of which we are now writing, that our early fathers in leaving their homes, the highlands of Scotland, the bogs of Ireland, the fertile lands of old England, were imbued with exceedingly unfavorable feelings toward the land of their nativity. They were devoid of that affection which usually accompanies the wanderer from his native home, and it is certain that they lost no opportunity to instil their prejudices and dislikes into the minds of their children and neighbors, and to resist the operation and execution of the laws enacted by the British Parliament and the rules attempted to be enforced by the Governors of the Colonies. This spirit was evidenced in old Virginia as early as 1666, at the time of Bacon's Rebellion. This spirit, so prevalent among the English colonies in America, can be attributed to the fact that a large majority of the early emigrants were driven from their homes by the tyranny of the English Government, and, after establishing themselves in this country, their hatred was accentuated by the arbitrary conduct of the English ministry, in pursuing a contracted policy, the natural result of which was to abridge the liberties and property rights of the colonies. A large majority of the early emigrants to the American colonies were inspired by that spirit of liberty that has been so much cherished in the history of our country. They were believers in the principles which prevailed at the time of the execution of Charles the First. Many of them were the followers of Oliver Cromwell, and detested the arbitrary conduct of the King and the rulers of England, and it was from this cause that they left their native country to seek a home in the wilderness, with the determination never to submit to the oppressions of their native land. Many of the early emigrants found their homes among the high mountains and the pathless deserts of the new continent, the nursery of the spirit of freedom. Among the early emigrants to this new country were numerous "Dissenters," a class of people who worshipped God according to their own reason and conscience, men who acknowledged no authority but that which had been established by their own sanction and consent, and this applied to their religious principles as well as to their ideas of government. They did not admit the right of the British government to compel them either to attend or to support the established church. They were principally from the middle classes, and neither admitted nor countenanced any claims to honor or distinction, save such as arose from the exercise of industry, talent, or virtue. In their native country they had been tenants, and did not regard themselves superior to the lowest of their fellow citizens; in their new homes they were freeholders, and believed themselves equal to the best, and, naturally, they soon detested that idea which prevailed in the English government, in accordance with which individuals pretended to be their natural rulers and superiors. During the French-Indian war, the British Ministry proposed a union of the Colonies for the purpose of repelling the French encroachments on the western waters; and, pursuant to this proposition, the Governor and leading members of the provincial assemblies convened at Albany, N. Y., in the year 1754. This Assembly was unanimously of the opinion, that the Colonies were able to defend themselves from the encroachments of the French without assistance from the English Government. They proposed "that a Grand Council should be formed of members to be chosen by the provincial Assemblies, which Council, together with a governor to be appointed by the Crown, should be authorized to make general laws, and, also, to raise money from all the Colonies for their common defence." This proposition was received by the British Ministry with displeasure, and, in answer thereto, the ministry submitted a counter-proposition, which was as follows: "That the Governors of all the Colonies, attended by one or two members of their respective Councils, should, from time to time, concert measures for the whole of the Colonies, erect posts and raise troops, with a power to draw upon the British treasury, in the first instance, for the expense, which expense was to be reimbursed by a tax to be laid on the Colonies by an act of Parliament." It will be well to observe that thus early began the contentions between the British Parliament and the English Colonies; the British Ministry seeking to lodge the taxing power in the hands of the British Parliament, a body in which the American Colonies were not permitted to have representation, whereas, the Colonies insisted that the taxing power should be vested in their local institutions. This proposition upon the part of the British Ministry gave great dissatisfaction to the people of the Colonies, as they objected to being taxed by a body in which they had no representation, but no further action was taken in regard to the matter, until the conclusion of the war, in 1763. Previously to the year 1764, when the British Parliament desired a contribution from the American Colonies, the object was accomplished by a simple requisition upon the legislatures of the several Colonies for the sum needed and, in every instance, the requisition had been honored and the money furnished with a willing hand. But, in this year, the British Parliament sought to obtain from the American Colonies by a speedier method the taxes desired. A measure was proposed in the British Parliament by the Premier, George Grenville, in the year 1764, having for its object, "the raising of a revenue in America," the entire proceeds of which were to go into the exchequer of Great Britain. We have before mentioned the dissatisfaction produced by the proposition to have the British Parliament levy a tax upon the American Colonies, when the entire proceeds of the tax were to be used for the development and the protection of the Colonies, and the reader can well imagine the alarm and indignation that prevailed in the American Colonies at the suggestion of the British Premier, that the British Parliament should lay a tax upon the American Colonies, the entire proceeds of which were to go into the exchequer of Great Britain. Pursuant to the foregoing proposition, Mr. Grenville, on the 10th of March, 1764, reported a resolution imposing certain "stamp duties" on the colonies, with the request that it should not be acted upon till the next session of the Parliament. This gave the agents of the colonies in England an opportunity to transmit copies of this resolution to the assemblies of the several colonies. At the time of the receipt of this information the Virginia House of Burgesses was in session, and immediately appointed a committee to prepare an address to the King of Great Britain and to the two houses of the British Parliament. We here give the several addresses in full as prepared by this committee and reported to the House of Burgesses "To the King's most excellent Majesty." "Most gracious Sovereign, "We, your Majesty's dutiful and loyal subjects, the Council and Burgesses of your ancient Colony and dominion of Virginia, now met in General Assembly, beg leave to assure your Majesty of our firm and inviolable attachment to your sacred person and government; and, as your faithful subjects here, have at all times been zealous to demonstrate this truth by a ready compliance with the royal requisitions during the late war, by which a heavy oppressive debt of near half a million hath been incurred, so at this time they implore permission to approach the throne with humble confidence, and to entreat that your Majesty will be graciously pleased to protect your people of this Colony in the enjoyment of their ancient and inestimable right of being governed by such laws, respecting their internal polity and taxation, as are derived from their own consent, with the approbation of their Sovereign or his substitute; a right which, as men, and descendants of BRITONS, they have ever quietly possessed, since first, by royal permission and encouragement, they left the mother kingdom to extend its commerce and dominion. "Your Majesty's dutiful subjects of Virginia most humbly and unanimously hope that this invaluable birthright, descended to them from their ancestors, and in which they have been protected by your royal predecessors, will not be suffered to receive an injury, under the reign of your sacred Majesty, already so illustriously distinguished by your gracious attention to the liberties of the people. "That your Majesty may long live to make nations happy, is the ardent prayer of your faithful subjects, the Council and Burgesses of Virginia." The memorial to the House of Lords was as follows: "To the right honorable the Lord's Spiritual and Temporal, in Parliament assembled; the Memorial of the Council and Burgresses of Virginia, now met in General Assembly humbly represents, "That your memorialists hope an application to your lordships, the fixed and hereditary guardians of British liberty, will not be thought improper at this time, when measures are proposed subversive, as they conceive, of that freedom which all men, especially those who derive their constitution from Britain, have a right to enjoy; and they flatter themselves that your lordships will not look upon them as objects so unworthy your attention as to regard any impropriety in the form or manner of their application for your lordship's protection of their just and undoubted right as Britons. "It cannot be presumption in your memorialists to call themselves by this distinguished name, since they are descended from Britons who left their native country to extend its territory and dominion and who, happily for Briton, and as your memorialists once thought, for themselves too, effected this purpose. As our ancestors brought with them every right and privilege they could with justice claim in their mother kingdom, their descendants may conclude they cannot be deprived of those rights without injustice. "Your memorialists conceive it to be a fundamental principle of the British constitution, without which freedom can no where exist, that the people are not subject to any taxes but such as are laid on them by their own consent, or by those who are legally appointed to represent them; property must become too precarious for the genius of a free people, which can be taken from them at the will of others who cannot know what taxes such people can bear, or the easiest mode of raising them; and who are not under that restraint which is the greatest security against a burthensome taxation, when the representatives themselves must be affected by every tax imposed on the people. "Your memorialists are therefore led into an humble confidence that your lordships will not think any reason sufficient to support such a power in the British Parliament, where the Colonies cannot be represented: a power never before constitutionally assumed, and which, if they have a right to exercise it on any occasion, must necessarily establish this melancholy truth, that the inhabitants of the Colonies are the slaves of Britons, from whom they are descended, and from whom they might expect every indulgence that the obligations of interest and affection can entitle them to. "Your memorialists have been invested with the right of taxing their own people from the first establishment of a regular government in the Colony, and requisitions have been constantly made to them by their sovereigns on all occasions when the assistance of the Colony was thought necessary to preserve the British interest in America; from whence they must conclude, they cannot now be deprived of a right they have so long enjoyed and which they have never forfeited. "The expenses incurred during the last war, in compliance with the demands on this Colony by our late and present most gracious Sovereigns, have involved us in a debt of near half a million, a debt not likely to decrease under the continued expense we are at in providing for the security of the people against the incursions of our savage neighbors, at a time when the low state of our staple commodity, the total want of specie and the late restrictions upon the trade of the Colonies, render the circumstances of the people extremely distressful; and which, if taxes are accumulated upon them by the British Parliament, will make them truly deplorable. "Your memorialists cannot suggest to themselves any reason why they should not still be trusted with the property of their people, with whose abilities and the least burthensome mode of taxing (with great deference to the superior wisdom of Parliament) they must be best acquainted. Your memorialists hope they shall not be suspected of being actuated on this occasion by any principles but those of the purest loyalty and affection, as they have always endeavored by their conduct to demonstrate that they considered their connexion with Great Britain, the seat of liberty, as their greatest happiness. "The duty they owe to themselves, and their posterity lays your memorialists under the necessity of endeavoring to establish their Constitution upon its proper foundation; and they do most humbly pray your lordships to take this subject into your consideration, with the attention that is due to the well being of the Colonies, on which the prosperity of Great Britain does, in a great measure, depend." And the remonstrance to the House of Commons was this: "To the honorable Knights, Citizens and Burgesses of Great Britain in Parliament assembled: "The remonstrance of the Council and Burgesses of Virginia. "It appearing by the printed votes of the House of Commons of Great Britain, in Parliament assembled, that in a committee of the whole House, the 17th day of March last, it was resolved, that towards defending, protecting and securing the British Colonies and Plantations in America, it may be proper to charge certain stamp duties in the said Colonies and Plantations; and it being apprehended that the same subject, which was then declined, may be resumed and further pursued in a succeeding session, the Council and Burgesses of Virginia, met in the General Assembly, judge it their indispensable duty, in a respectful manner, but with decent firmness, to remonstrate against such a measure, that at least a cession of those rights, which in their opinion must be infringed by that procedure, may not be inferred from their silence at so important a crisis. "They conceive it is essential to British liberty, that laws, imposing taxes on the people, ought not to be made without the consent of representatives chosen by themselves; who at the same time that they are acquainted with the circumstances of their constituents, sustain a portion of the burthen laid on them. The privileges inherent in the persons who discovered and settled these regions, could not be renounced nor forfeited by their removal hither, not as vagabonds or fugitives, but licensed and encouraged by their Prince and animated with a laudable desire of enlarging the British dominion and extending its commerce; on the contrary, it was secured to them and their descendants, with all other rights and immunities of British subjects, by a Royal Charter which hath been invariably recognized and confirmed by his Majesty and his predecessors, in their commissions to the several Governors, granting a power and prescribing a form of legislation, according to which, laws for the administration of justice and the welfare and good government of the Colony have been hitherto enacted by the Governor, Council and General Assembly, and to them, requisitions and applications for supplies have been directed by the Crown. As an instance of the opinion which former Sovereigns entertained of these rights and privileges, we beg leave to refer to the three Acts of the General Assembly passed in the thirty-second year of the reign of King Charles II, one of which is entitled `An Act for raising a public revenue for the better support of the government of his Majesty's Colony of Virginia,' imposing several duties for that purpose, which, being thought absolutely necessary, were prepared in England and sent over by their then governor, the Lord Culpeper, to be passed by the General Assembly, with a full power to give the royal assent thereto, and which were accordingly passed, after several amendments were made to them here; thus tender was his Majesty of the rights of his American subjects; and the remonstrants do not discern by what distinction they can be deprived of that sacred birthright and most valuable inheritance by their fellow subjects, nor with what propriety they can be taxed or affected in their estates, by the Parliament, wherein they are not, and indeed cannot, constitutionally be represented. "And if it were proposed for the Parliament to impose taxes on the Colonies at all, which the remonstrants take leave to think would be inconsistent with the fundamental principles of the Constitution, the exercise of that power, at this time, would be ruinous to Virginia, who exerted herself in the late war, it is feared, beyond her strength, insomuch that to redeem the money granted for that exigency, her people are taxed for several years to come: this, with the larger expenses incurred for defending the frontiers against the restless Indians who have infested her as much since the peace as before, is so grievous, that an increase of the burthen would be intolerable; especially as the people are very greatly distressed already from the scarcity of circulating cash among them and from the little value of their staple at the British markets. "And it is presumed that adding to that load which the Colony now labors under will not be more oppressive to her people than destructive of the interest of Great Britain; for the Plantation trade, confined as it is to the mother country, hath been a principal means of multiplying and enriching her inhabitants; and, if not too much discouraged, may prove an inexhaustible source of treasure to the nation. For satisfaction on this point, let the present state of the British fleets and trade be compared with what they were before the settlement of the Colonies; and let it be considered, that, whilst property in land may be acquired on very easy terms in the vast uncultivated territory of North America, the Colonists will be mostly, if not wholly, employed in agriculture, whereby the exportation of their commodities to Great Britain and the consumption of manufacturers supplied from thence will be daily increasing. But this most desirable connexion between Great Britain and her Colonies, supported by such a happy intercourse of reciprocal benefits as is continually advancing the prosperity of both, must be interrupted, if the people of the latter, reduced to extreme poverty, should be compelled to manufacture those articles they have been hitherto furnished with from the former. "From these considerations, it is hoped that the Honorable House of Commons will not prosecute a measure which those who may suffer under it cannot but look upon as fitter for exiles driven from their native country, after ignominiously forfeiting her favors and protection, than for the posterity of Britons, who have at all times been forward to demonstrate all due reverence to the mother Kingdom and are so instrumental in promoting her glory and felicity; and that British patriots will never consent to the exercise of any anti-constitutional power, which, even in this remote corner, may be dangerous in its example to the interior parts of the British empire, and will certainly be detrimental to its commerce." The several papers above given breathe a spirit of humility and dependence that did not correctly voice the sentiments of the Virginia Colonists, and possibly thereby the British Parliament was deceived and led to believe that the American Colonies would not assert their opposition to the tax measures proposed, otherwise than by protest through their Assemblies. Most of the Colonies adopted resolutions protesting against the enactment of such a law; some offering a specific sum of money in lieu of the proposed tax, provided it was received as a voluntary donation. But no one of the Colonies was willing to admit that the British Parliament had any right to tax them, while they were denied representation therein. Mr. Grenville and his friends argued that the Colonies were already represented in the same manner as a large proportion of the inhabitants of England who had no vote in the election of members of Parliament, and this same argument is often indulged in by the advocates of a restricted suffrage at the present time. In answer to this ridiculous argument, the Colonies contended that "the very essence of representation consists in this; that the representative is himself placed in a situation analogous to those whom he represents, so that he shall be himself bound by laws which he is entrusted to enact and shall be liable to the taxes which he is authorized to impose." But the sound reasoning and the humble petitioning of the American Colonies did not influence the British Parliament, the memorials and petitions were not permitted to be read in the House of Commons, and in the month of March, 1765, the bill for laying a stamp duty in America was called up in the House of Commons, but little opposition was shown to the measure, and few indeed were the members who denied the right of Parliament to tax the Colonies. It may be worthy to note the circumstances attending the debate upon this measure in the House of Commons. Mr. Charles Townsend, an advocate of this measure, concluded his speech in advocacy of the measure in the following words; "And now, will these Americans, children planted by our care, nourished by our indulgence, till they are grown to a degree of strength and opulence and protected by our arms, will they grudge to contribute their mite to relieve us from the heavy weight of that burden which we lie under?" Colonel Barre, one of the most respectable members of the House of Commons, with strong feelings of indignation visible in his countenance and manner, thus eloquently replied; "They planted by your care! No, your oppression planted them in America. They fled from tyranny to a then uncultivated and inhospitable country, where they exposed themselves to almost all the hardships to which human nature is liable, and among others to the cruelty of a savage foe, the most subtle, and I will take upon me to say, the most formidable of any people upon the face of the earth; and yet, actuated by principles of true English liberty, they met all hardships with pleasure compared with those they suffered in their own country from the hands of those that should have been their friends. They nourished by your indulgence! They grew up by your neglect of them. As soon as you began to care about them, that care was exercised in sending persons to rule them in one department and another, who were perhaps the deputies of deputies to some members of this House, sent to spy out their liberties, to misrepresent their actions and to prey upon them. Men whose behaviour, on many occasions, has caused the blood of these sons of liberty to recoil within them, men, who were promoted to the highest seats of justice, some who, to my knowledge, were glad, by going to a foreign country to escape being brought to the bar of a court of justice in their own. They protected by your arms! They have nobly taken up arms in your defence, have exerted a valour, amidst their constant and laborious industry, for the defence of a country whose frontier was drenched in blood, while its interior parts yielded all its little savings to your emolument. And, believe me, remember I this day told you so, that same spirit of freedom which actuated that people at first will accompany them still; but prudence forbids me to explain myself further. God knows I do not at this time speak from any motives of party heat. What I deliver are the genuine sentiments of my heart. However superior to me in general knowledge and experience the respectable body of this House may be, yet, I claim to know more of America than most of you, having seen and been conversant in that country. The people, I believe, are as truly loyal as any subjects the King has, but a people jealous of their liberties, and who will vindicate them if ever they should be violated. But the subject is too delicate. I will say no more." Notwithstanding the opposition made to the passage of this bill, it passed the House of Commons, and on the 22d day of March, 1765, having met with the unanimous approval of the House of Lords, it received the royal assent. By the provisions of this bill, this law was not to go into effect until the first day of November, 1765. When the intelligence of the passage of this measure reached Virginia, the indignation and rage of the people knew no bounds. While no violence was offered, the Virginia House of Burgesses, by a series of resolutions proposed by Patrick Henry, expressed the sentiments of the people in a dignified and explicit manner, the resolutions being as follows; "Resolved, That the first adventurers and settlers of this, his Majesty's Colony and dominion, brought with them and transmitted to their posterity and all others his Majesty's subjects since inhabiting in this, his Majesty's said Colony, all the privileges, franchises and immunities that have been at any time held, enjoyed and possessed by the people of Great Britain. "Resolved, That by two Royal Charters granted by King James the First, the Colonists aforesaid are declared entitled to all the privileges, liberties and immunities of denizens and natural born subjects, to all intents and purposes, as if they had been abiding and born within the realm of England. "Resolved, That the taxation of the people by themselves, or by persons chosen by themselves to represent them, who can only know what taxes the people are able to bear and the easist mode of raising them and are equally affected by such taxes themselves, is the distinguishing characteristic of British freedom, and without which the ancient constitution cannot subsist. "Resolved, That his Majesty's liege people of this most ancient Colony have uninterruptedly enjoyed the right of being thus governed by their own assembly in the article of their taxes and internal police, and the same hath never been forfeited, or in any other way given up, but hath been constantly recognized by the King and people of Great Britain. "Resolved, therefore, That the General Assembly of this Colony have the sole right and power to lay taxes and impositions upon the inhabitants of this Colony; and that every attempt to yest such power in any person or persons whatsoever, other than the General Assembly aforesaid, has a manifest tendency to destroy British as well as American freedom." The foregoing resolutions passed the House of Burgesses in May, 1765, and formed the first opposition to the Stamp Act and the scheme of taxing America by the British Parliament. Heretofore, it had been humble petitions, now, we have reached the point where the Colonies were defiantly asserting their rights. Patrick Henry, at this time, was quite a young man, this being the first time that he had served his country in the House of Burgesses, and, while he was inexperienced, he was inspired by that spirit of liberty which was the common heritage of the early settlers of the Amercan wilderness. When these resolutions were offered in the House of Burgesses, many violent debates took place, and, after a great deal of opposition, the resolutions were adopted by a majority of, possibly, one or two votes. During the progress of the debate upon these resolutions, Patrick Henry gave utterance to the following words; "Cæsar," exclaimed the orator, "had his Brutus: Charles the First, his Cromwell, and George the Third may profit by his example." The passage of these resolutions gave impetus to the cause of American liberty and produced an alarming state of affairs among the more timid and loyal inhabitants. In Massachusetts the opposition took a different form, and, in the city of Boston, the populace indulged in every act of violence that could be imagined, in the exhibition of their dislike of the law and the law officers. The ships in the harbor placed their flags at half mast, the bells throughout the town were tolling, the ship masters who bought the stamps were mistreated and insulted and required to deliver the stamps to the people, who made a bonfire of them and of the law. Meetings were held throughout the colonies, protesting against this act of the British Parliament and asserting the inalienable right of the American people. On the second Tuesday in October, 1765, pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Assembly of Massachusetts, the first Continental Congress assembled at New York, "to consult as to the circumstances of the Colonies and to consider the most proper means of averting the difficulties under which they labored." Twenty-eight deputies, representing the States of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and South Carolina, composed this, the first Continental Congress held on American soil; Virginia, New York, North Carolina and Georgia were prevented from sending delegates to this Congress by the action of their royal Governors, by dissolving their respective assemblies before action could be taken in the premises. This Congress adopted a series of resolutions stating the griveances of the Colonies and, in positive terms, asserting the exemption of the Colonies from all taxes not imposed by their own Legislatures. They also addressed a petition to the House of Lords and to the King and Commons, and on the 25th of October adjourned. The first day of November, 1765, the date fixed for the Stamp Act to take effect, arrived, and the day in the city of Boston was ushered in by the closing of business houses and the tolling of church bells, and Governor Bernard and Justice Hutchinson, the advocates of the British Parliament in Massachusetts, were hung in effigy on Boston Neck, where the effigies were permitted to remain awhile, when they were cut down and torn to pieces, to the great delight of the people. In many places public notice was given to the friends of Liberty to attend her funeral, and a large coffin was prepared, upon which was written the word LIBERTY. This coffin was attended to the grave by an immense concourse of people, where, after the firing of minute-guns, an oration was pronounced, and the word REVIVED added to the former inscription, amidst the shouts and acclamations of the people. Throughout the Colonies the stamp papers were forcibly taken from the stamp officials and destroyed, and the business of the country proceeded as if the Stamp law had never been enacted. Upon the assembling of Parliament on the 14th day of January, 1766, upon a motion for an address to the King, William Pitt, one of the greatest of English statesmen, offered the following remarks upon the state of the country; "It is a long time, Mr. Speaker," said he, "since I have attended in Parliament. When the resolutions were taken in this House to tax America, I was ill in bed. If I could have endured to have been carried in my bed, so great was the agitation of my mind for the consequences, I would have solicited some kind hand to have laid me down on this floor to have borne my testimony against it. It is my opinion that this Kingdom has no right to lay a tax upon the Colonies. At the same time, I assert the authority of this Kingdom to be sovereign and supreme in every circumstance of government and legislature whatever. Taxation is no part of the governing or legislative power; the taxes are a voluntary gift and grant of the Commons alone. The concurrence of the Peers and of the Crown is necessary only as a form of law. This House represents the Commons of Great Britain. When in this House we give and grant, therefore, we give and grant what is our own, but, can we give and grant the property of the Commons of America? It is an absurdity in terms. There is an idea in some, that the Colonies are virtually represented in this House. I would fain know by whom?. The idea of virtual representation is the most contemptible that ever entered into the head of man; it does not deserve a serious refutation. The Commons in America, represented in their several assembles, have invariably exercised this constitutional right of giving and granting their own money; they would have been slaves if they had not enjoyed it. At the same time this Kingdom has ever professed the power of legislative and commercial control. The Colonies acknowledge your authority in all things, with the sole exception that you shall not take their money out of their pockets without their consent. Here would I draw the line; quam ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum." This address was replied to by Mr. Grenville in a speech that voiced the sentiments of that part of the people of England that wished to tax the Colonies, and, in reply, William Pitt submitted the following remarks: "Sir, a charge is brought aginst gentlemen sitting in this House, for giving birth to sedition in America. The freedom with which they have spoken their sentiments against this unhappy act is imputed to them as a crime, but the imputation shall not discourage me. It is a liberty which I hope no gentleman will be afraid to exercise; it is a liberty by which the gentleman who calumniates it might have profited.. He ought to have desisted from his project. We are told America is obstinate, America is almost in open rebellion. Sir, I rejoice that America has resisted; three millions of people so dead to all the feelings of liberty as voluntarily to submit to be slaves, would have been fit instruments to make slaves of all the rest. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . I maintain that Parliment has a right to bind, to restrain America. Our legislative power over the Colonies is sovereign and supreme. The honorable gentlemen tells us he understands not the difference between internal and external taxation; but surely there is a plain distinction between taxation levied for the purpose of raising a revenue and duties imposed for the regulation of commerce. `When,' said the honorable gentleman, `were the Colonies emancipated?' At what time, say I, in answer, `were they made slaves?' I speak from accurate knowledge when I say, that the profits to Great Britain from the trade of the Colonies, through all its branches, is two millions per annum. This is the fund which carried you triumphantly through the war; this is the price America pays you for her protection; and shall a miserable financier come with a boast that he can fetch a pepper-corn into the Exchequer at the loss of millions to the nation? I know the valour of your troops, I know the skill of your officers, I know the force of this country; but in such a cause your success would be hazardous. America, if she fell, would fall like the strong man; she would embrace the pillars of the state and pull down the Constitution with her. Is this your boasted peace? not to sheathe the sword in the scabbard, but to sheathe it in the bowels of your countrymen? The Americans have been wronged, they have been driven to madness by injustice. Will you punish them for the madness you have occasioned? No; let this country be the first to resume its prudence and temper. I will pledge myself for the Colonies, that, on their part, animosity and resentment will cease. The system of policy I would earnestly exhort Great Britain to adopt in relation to America is happily expressed in the words of a favorite poet: `Be to her faults a little blind, Be to her virtues very kind; Let all her ways be unconfin'd, And clap your padlock on her mind.' Upon the whole, I will beg leave to tell the House in a few words what is really my opinion. It is, That the Stamp Act be repealed, ABSOLUTELY, TOTALLY and IMMEDIATELY." On the 22d day of February, 1766, a bill was introduced in the House of Commons having for its purpose the repeal of the Stamp Act, which bill was carried by a vote of 275 for, to 177 against, its repeal. The joy of the people at the result of this action of the House of Commons was great. The opposition to the repeal of the Stamp Act in the House of Peers was much stronger than in the House of Commons, and it was not till the 18th day of March, 1766, that the repeal was carried, and then by a majority of only 34. On the 19th day of March, 1766, the King appeared in the House of Commons and gave his assent, and thereby the war between the English Colonies and the British Government was averted for the time being. In Virginia, this information was received with great joy by all classes of people, and the Virginia House of Burgesses voted a statue to the King. The joy that followed the repeal of the Stamp Act was of but short duration. The Colonies began to realize that, by the repeal of the Stamp Act, England had virtually surrendered nothing, as parliament still maintained the right to tax the Colonists, and, by the fall of the year 1766, discontent again pervaded the Colonies. The Virginia House of Burgesses postponed the consideration of the Act providing for a statue for the King until some succeeding session. When the new Parliament assembled in the year 1767, they received information that the Assembly of New York had refused to pass a bill providing for the support of his Majesty's troops which had been stationed among the people of that Colony. Whereupon Mr. Grenville, the leader of the Parliamentary forces favoring the taxation of the American colonies, introduced a bill the object of which was to restrain the Assembly and Council of New York from passing any act, until they had complied with the requisition of the act thus mentioned, which bill was almost immediately passed and became a law. About the same time a body of British troops arrived in Boston, and Governor Bernard immediately began to provide for their support out of the public treasury. Both of the above acts produced a great deal of discontent in the Colonies, and in the month of June, 1767, a bill was introduced by Charles Townsend in the British Parliament, imposing duties on glass, painters' colours, tea and paper, imported into the Colonies. Also, another bill authorizing the King to appoint a Board of Trade to reside in the Colonies. Also, a bill establishing a Board of Admiralty in the Colonies to be paid from the colonial revenue, but to be independent of all colonial regulations, and another bill fixing the salaries of the Governors and other officials of the American Colonies. These several bills passed the House of Commons with but two dissenting votes, and received the royal assent on the 2d day of July, 1767. It will be observed that the system of taxation proposed by Mr. Townsend and adopted by the British Parliament was, beyond question, a legal exercise of the right of Parliament to regulate the commerce of the Colonies, and this right had oftentimes, theretofore, been admitted by the American Colonists, but the people of New York and of Massachusetts were greatly irritated by the presence of the British soldiery in their respective Colonies, and acting upon the presumption that this action of the British Parliament was nothing more than a forerunner of other oppressive measures against the Colonies, numerous petitions and remonstrances were addressed to the King and Parliament, but failed to accomplish any good result. The merchants and citizens of nearly all the Colonies assembled in their different towns and bound themselves not to purchase good of any character from the British manufacturers, while these obnoxious laws continued in force. The Assembly of Massachusetts Colony addressed a circular letter to the Legislatures of the other Colonies requesting their assistance and co-operation, which letter was responded to by all the Colonies, expressing their willingness to stand with Massachusetts by what had been done and expressing their readiness to co-operate in what might further be proposed for the common security and welfare of the Colonies. Bernard, the Royal Governor of Massachusetts, communicated to Lord Hillsborough, the Secretary for the Colonies, the action of the Massachusetts Assembly; whereupon, his lordship directed Governor Bernard to require the Massachusetts Legislature, in his Majesty's name, to rescind their action, upon the penalty of being dissolved, which message the Governor immediately communicated to the Assembly, whereupon, the Assembly voted not to rescind their action, the vote being 17 yeas to 19 nays, and they declared, "if the votes of the House are to be controlled by the direction of a minister, we have left us but a vain semblance of liberty." The Governor, thereupon, dissolved the House according to his threat, and the Governors of the other Colonies dissolved their respective Assemblies upon their refusing to rescind their action endorsing the Massachusetts resolves. Lord Hillsborough, upon the receipt of this information, wrote to General Gage, the British Commander at Boston, that at least one regiment of troop would be sent to Boston to assist in preserving peace. Upon receipt of this information, a meeting was held by the people of Boston, and a committee appointed to wait upon the Governor and request him to call the Assembly together. This committee waited upon the Governor and presented their request, which was denied. Thereupon, it was determined to hold a general convention in the city of Boston, on the 22d of September, and all the towns in the province of Massachusetts were requested to send and did send delegates to this Convention. The Convention met at Faneuil Hall, Boston, and adopted several resolutions and adjourned. Soon thereafter, two regiments of troops landed in Boston and, by direction of the Governor, were quartered in the two public houses of the city, which gave great umbrage to the people and produced constant difficulties between the citizens and the soldiers. The Colony of Massachusetts was in open rebellion against the British Governor and the Parliament. At a meeting of the British Parliament in the year 1769, a measure was adopted which was intended to be a death blow to the liberties of the Colonies. This measure directed the Governor of Massachusetts to ascertain the names of all persons guilty of treason or misprisions committed since the 30th day of December, 1767, and transmit this information to one of the Secretaries of State, in order that his Majesty might issue a special commission for inquiring of, hearing and determining the said offences within the realm of Great Britain. Heretofore, the offending Americans had been tried by a jury of their own countrymen, upon all the charges that were preferred by the royal government, and, as a general rule, acquitted, but now the British Parliament proposed to have them arrested and transported across the seas for trial in England. The Virginia House of Burgesses assembled a few days after the receipt of this information and adopted a series of resolutions, "declaring their exclusive right to tax their constitutents and to petition the Sovereign, either separately or conjointly with the other Colonies, and affirming that the seizing of any person residing in the said Colony, suspected of any crime whatsoever committed therein, and sending such persons beyond the seas to be tried was highly derogatory to the rights of British subjects." These resolutions were presented behind closed doors for the purpose of preventing the royal Governor from dissolving the Assembly before their adoption. The example of Virginia was followed by the Assemblies of the several Colonies. In the fall of the year 1769, Lord Hillsborough, the British Secretary for the Colonies, addressed a circular letter to the Governors of all the Colonies, informing them that, at the next session of Parliament, the duty upon glass, paper and painters' colors would be removed. The next session of the British Parliament convened on the 9th day of January, 1770, and, on the 22d day of February, the Marquis of Rockingham introduced the subject of the repeal of these onerous duties, in the following manner. He said, "That the present unhappy condition of affairs and the universal discontent of the people did not arise from any immediate temporary cause, but had grown upon the nation by degrees from the moment of his Majesty's accession to the throne; that a total change had then taken place in the old system of English government and a new maxim adopted fatal to the liberties of the country, viz., that the royal prerogative alone was sufficient to support government, to whatever hands the administration should be committed." "The operation of this principle," said his lordship, "can be traced through every act of government during the present reign, in which his Majesty's secret advisers could be supposed to have any influence. He recommended, therefore, strongly to their lordships to fix an early day for taking into consideration the state of the country in all its relations and dependencies, foreign, provincial and domestick, for we had been injured in them all. That consideration, he trusted, would lead their Lordships to advise the Crown, not only how to correct past errors, but how to establish a system of government more wise, more permanent, better suited to the genius of the people and consistent with the spirit of the Constitution." Before a vote was reached upon this motion, the Duke of Grafton resigned the office of first Lord Commissioner of the Treasury and was succeeded by Lord North, who remained at the head of the administration until the close of the American Revolution. Among the first acts of Lord North's administration was one for the repeal of the port duties fixed by the act of 1767, with one exception, that being the duty on tea, "which the British Ministry desired to remain in force, as an evidence of the supremacy of the Parliament." It was argued by the friends of the repeal of the port duties, that to retain the duty on tea would simply continue the agitation and increase the disturbance in the Colonies without accomplishing any good results. To such arguments, Lord North answered, "Has the repeal of the Stamp Act taught the Americans obedience? Has our lenity inspired them with moderation? Can it be proper, while they deny our legal power to tax them, to acquiesce in the argument of illegality and, by the repeal of the whole law, to give up that power? No! the proper time to exert our right to taxation is when the right is refused. To temporize is to yield, and the authority of the mother country, if it is now unsupported, will in reality be relinquished for ever. "A total repeal," he continued, "cannot be thought of till America is PROSTRATE AT OUR FEET." It seems peculiar that the English ministry should have been so short sighted as to thus insult the American Colonies, at the same time that they were making to them great concessions with the avowed purpose of restoring the Colonies to peace and quietude. While the British Government lost the benefit of the import duties by the repeal of the act of 1767, still, by the retention of the duty on tea, the cause of the discontent in the Colonies remained. The insult offered to the Colonists by Lord North in his speech, and the presence of the King's troops in the province of Massachusetts and New York, kept up the agitation in the Colonies, producing mob-violence at many places. In the city of Boston a difficulty occurred between one of the King's soldiers and a citizen of the town, which resulted in the defeat of the soldier. He obtaining the assistance of a few of his comrades, the contest between the citizens and the soldiers became general, and the citizens, assembling in great numbers, compelled Governor Hutchinson to remove the soldiers immediately from the town. Similar difficulties occurred in New York and in Rhode Island. Thus matters continued until the 12th of March, 1773, when Dabney Carr, a member of the House of Burgesses of Virginia, introduced the following resolutions in the House of Burgesses; which resolutions were adopted without a dissenting voice. "Whereas the minds of his Majesty's faithful subjects in this Colony have been much disturbed by various rumours and reports of proceedings, tending to deprive them of their ancient legal and constitutional rights; "And whereas the affairs of this Colony are frequently connected with those of Great Britain, as well as the neighboring Colonies, which renders a communication of sentiment necessary. In order, therefore, to remove the uneasiness and to quiet the minds of the people, as well as for the other good purposes above mentioned. "Be it resolved, that a standing committee of correspondence and inquiry be appointed, to consist of eleven persons, to-wit: the honorable Peyton Randolph, esquire, Robert C. Nicholas, Richard Bland, Richard H. Lee, Benjamin Harrison, Edmund Pendleton, Patrick Henry, Dudley Digges, Dabney Carr, Archibald Cary and Thomas Jefferson, esquires, any six of whom to be a committee, whose business it shall be to obtain the most early and authentic intelligence of all such acts and resolutions of the British Parliament or proceedings of administration as may relate to, or affect the British Colonies in America; and to keep up and maintain a correspondence and communication with our sister Colonies, respecting these important considerations; and the result of such their proceedings, from time to time to lay before this House. "Resolved, That it be an instruction to the said committee that they do, without delay, inform themselves particularly of the principles and authority on which was constituted a court of enquiry, said to have been lately held in Rhode Island, with powers to transport persons accused of offences committed in America to places beyond the seas to be tried. "Resolved, That the Speaker of this House do transmit to the Speakers of the different Assemblies of the British Colonies on the Continent, copies of the said resolutions, and desire that they will lay them before their respective Assemblies, and request them to appoint some person or persons of their respective bodies to communicate, from time to time, with the said committee." The retention of the duty on tea and the action of the different Colonies in entering into an agreement neither to buy nor to sell, nor pay any duty upon teas imported into the Colonies, had been so rigidly observed that the East India Company suffered great inconvenience from the accumulation of their stock and the refusal of the American Colonists to purchase; and, to remedy this state of affairs, this company proposed to the British Parliament to pay double the amount of the import duties on tea if the Parliament would repeal the duties, but the object of the Parliament not being the collection of a revenue, but the subjection of the American Colonies, the offer of the East India Company remained unaccepted, and the oppression of the American Colonies continued until it was evident that the American people had determined to be free. After some time an act was passed by the British Parliament allowing the East India Company to export their teas to America free of duty, after which, large quantities of tea were shipped by the company to Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Charleston. As soon as the Americans heard of the repeal of the duty on tea and the shipments made by the East Indian Company, they determined that the tea should never be disposed of in America. When the ships bearing this tea arrived at the American ports, they were compelled to return immediately without unloading their cargo. In the city of Boston a scene of great disorder prevailed. The captain of the vessel carrying the tea made an application to the Governor for the papers necessary to enable him to return to England without unloading, which request the Governor positively refused to comply with. Of this action the people were informed, and, thereupon, a number, disguising themselves as Mohawk Indians, boarded the ship, took out three hundred and forty-two chests of tea and emptied their contents into the water. It was thought that this occurrence would precipitate the war between the Colonies and England, but such was not the case. Upon the receipt of the news of the destruction of the tea, Lord North introduced a bill for the closing of the port of Boston. The Constitution and Charter of the province of Massachusetts were taken out of the hands of the people and placed in the hands of the king, and all the officers of the Colony were made dependent upon the king. A bill was also passed levying a fine upon the city of Boston to compensate the East India Company for the tea destroyed, and another law was enacted providing that any of the king's officers, charged with the commission of murder in the execution of their duties in the Colonies, should be brought to England for trial. All of the foregoing bills had been passed and received the royal assent by the 20th day of May, 1774. The consideration of these measures by the House of Commons produced a long and heated debate, during which Colonel Barre, who had on a previous occasion ably defended the Colonies, concluded an able and patriotic speech in opposition to these measures in these words: "You have changed your ground. You are becoming the aggressors, and offering the last of human outrages to the people of America, by subjecting them, in effect, to military execution. Instead of sending them the olive branch, you have sent them the naked sword. By the olive branch I mean a repeal of all the late laws, fruitless to you and oppressive to them. Ask their aid in a constitutional manner, and they will give it to the utmost of their ability. They never yet refused it, when properly required. Your journals bear the recorded acknowledgments of the zeal with which they have contributed to the general necessities of the State. What madness is it that prompts you to attempt obtaining that by force, which you may more certainly procure by requisition. They may be flattered into anything, but they are too much like yourselves to be driven. Have some indulgence for your own likeness, respect their sturdy English virtue, retract your odious exertions of authority, and remember that the first step towards making them contribute to your wants is to reconcile them to your government." At the same time William Pitt, now Lord Chatham, gave the House of Lords his views upon the bills proposed and the condition of American affairs, in the following words: "If, my Lords, we take a transient view of those motives which induced the ancestors of our fellow subjects in America to leave their native country, to encounter the innumerable difficulties of the unexplored regions of the western world, our astonishment at the present conduct of their descendants will naturally subside. There was no corner of the globe to which they would not have fled, rather than submit to the slavish and tyrannical spirit which prevailed at that period in their native country; and viewing them in their original forlorn and now flourishing state, they may be cited as illustrious instances to instruct the world what great exertions mankind will naturally make, when left to the free exercise of their own powers. Notwithstanding my intention to give my hearty negative to the question now before you, I condemn, my Lords, in the severest manner, the turbulent and unwarrantable conduct of of the Americans, in some instances, particularly in the late riots at Boston, but, my Lords, the mode which has been pursued to bring them back to a sense of their duty is so diametrically opposite to every principle of sound policy, as to excite my utmost astonishment. You have involved the guilty and the innocent in one common punishment, and avenge the crime of a few lawless depredators upon the whole body of the inhabitants. My Lords, the different provinces of America, in the excess of their gratitude for the repeal of the Stamp Act, seemed to vie with each other in the expressions of loyalty and duty; but the moment they perceived that your intention to tax them was renewed, under a pretense of serving the East India Company, their resentment got the ascendant of their moderation and hurried them into actions which their cool reason would abhor. But, my Lords, from the whole complexion of the late proceedings, I cannot but incline to think, that the administration has purposely irritated them into these violent acts, in order to gratify their own malice and revenge. What else could induce them to dress Taxation, the Father of American Sedition, in the robes of an East India Director, but to break in upon that mutual peace and harmony which then so happily subsisted between the Colonies and the mother county. My Lords, it has always been my fixed and unalterable opinion, and I will carry it with me to the grave, that this country had no right under heaven to tax America. It is contrary to all the principles of justice and civil policy; it is contrary to that essential, unalterable right in nature, ingrafted into the British Constitution as a fundamental law, that what a man has honestly acquired is absolutely his own, which he may freely give, but which cannot be taken away from him without his consent. Pass then, my Lords, instead of these harsh and severe edicts, an amnesty over their errours; by measures of lenity and affection allure them to their duty; act the part of a generous, forgiving parent. A period may arrive, when this parent may stand in need of every assistance she can receive from a grateful and affectionate offspring. The welfare of this country, my Lords, has ever been my greatest joy, and, under all the vicissitudes of my life, has afforded me the most pleasing consolation. Should the all-disposing hand of Providence prevent me from contributing my poor and feeble aid in the day of her distress, my prayers shall be ever for her prosperity; "Length of days be in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honor! May her ways be ways of pleasantness, and all her paths be peace!" The Legislature of Virginia was in session when the Boston Port Bill arrived, and their sense of it was immediately expressed by the following order: "This House, being deeply impressed with apprehension of the great dangers to be derived to British America from the hostile invasion of the city of Boston, in our sister Colony of Massachusetts Bay, whose commerce and harbour are, on the 1st day of June next, to be stopped by an armed force, deem it highly necessary that the said 1st day of June next be set apart by the members of this House as a day of fasting, humiliation and prayer, devoutly to implore the divine interposition for averting the heavy calamity which threatens destruction to our civil rights and the evils of civil war; to give us one heart and one mind, firmly to oppose, by all just and proper means, every injury to American rights; and that the minds of his Majesty and Parliament may be inspired from above with wisdom, moderation and justice, to remove from the loyal people of America all cause of danger, from a continued pursuit of measures pregnant with their ruin. "Ordered, therefore, That the members of this House do attend at their places at the hour of ten in the forenoon, on the said 1st day of June next, in order to proceed with the Speaker and the Mace, to the church in this city, for the purposes aforesaid; and that the reverend Mr. Price be appointed to read prayers and to preach a sermon suitable to the occasion." Lord Dunmore, the Governor of the Virginia Colony at that time, immediately upon the receipt of the information as to the action taken by the Virginia House of Burgesses, dissolved the House. But the patriotic Virginians were not to be thus deprived of their right to speak their sentiments; for on the following day, eighty-nine members formed an association and adopted the following resolutions: "We, his Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the late representatives of the good people of this Colony, having been deprived, by the sudden interposition of the executive part of this government, from giving our countrymen the advice we wished to convey to them in a legislative capacity, find ourselves under the hard necessity of adopting this, the only method we have left, of pointing out to our countrymen, such measures as, in our opinion, are best fitted to secure our dear rights and liberty from destruction by the heavy hand of power now lifted against North America. With much grief we find that our dutiful applications to Great Britain for the security of our just, ancient and constitutional rights, have not only been disregarded, but that a determined system is formed and pursued for reducing the inhabitants of British America to slavery, by subjecting them to the payment of taxes imposed without the consent of the people or their representatives; and that, in pursuit of this system, we find an Act of the British Parliament, lately passed, for stopping the harbour and the commerce of the town of Boston, in our sister Colony of Massachusetts Bay, until the people there submit to the payment of such unconstitutional taxes; and which Act most violently and arbitrarily deprives them of their property, in wharves erected by private persons, at their own great and proper expense, which Act is, in our opinion, a most dangerous attempt to destroy the constitutional liberty and rights of all North America. It is further our opinion, that as tea, on its importation to America, is charged with a duty imposed by Parliament for the purpose of raising a revenue without the consent of the people, it ought not to be used by any person who wishes well to the constitutional rights and liberties of British America. And whereas, the India Company have ungenerously attempted to ruin America, by sending many ships loaded with tea into the Colonies, thereby intending to fix a precedent in favour of arbitrary taxation, we deem it highly proper, and do accordingly recommend it strongly to our countrymen, not to purchase or use any kind of East India commodity whatsoever, except salt-petre and spices, until the grievances of America are redressed. We are further clearly of opinion, that an attack made upon one of our sister Colonies, to compel submission to arbitrary taxes, is an attack made on all British America, and threatents ruin to the rights of all, unless the united wisdom of the whole be applied. And for this purpose it is recommended to the committee of correspondence, that they communicate with their several corresponding committees, on the expediency of appointing deputies from the several Colonies of British America, to meet in General Congress, at such a place annually as shall be thought most convenient; there to deliberate on those general measures which the united interest of America may, from time to time, require. "A tender regard for the interest of our fellow-subjects, the merchants and manufacturers of Great Britain, prevents us from going further at this time; most earnestly hoping that the unconstitutional principle of taxing the Colonies without their consent will not be persisted in, thereby to compel us against our will, to avoid all commercial intercourse with Great Britain. Wishing them and our people free and happy, we are their affectionate friends, the late representatives of Virginia." This association was formed on the 27th day of May, 1774, and Stephen Trigg and William Christian, the representatives of Fincastle county, in the Virginia House of Burgesses, were members of this association. Virginia had not suffered from the acts of the British Parliament as had the colonies of New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, but her statesmen of those days were actuated by principles that they loved and cherished, and, with a political wisdom which should be the admiration of all the citizens of Virginia, they were always ready and willing to resist any encroachment upon those principles, whether the encroachments were made in their own home or in the sister colonies. The 1st day of June, 1774, was observed in most of the colonies as a day of fasting and prayer, and in Virginia all business was suspended, and the citizens bore a dejected aspect, but were contemplating a brighter day, when their sorrow would be turned to joy. On the 17th day of June, 1774, the Legislature of the Massachusetts Colony adopted a resolution calling a Congress of the representatives of the colonies at Philadelphia on the 5th day of September, 1774. The royal Governor of Massachusetts immediately dissolved the Legislature as a punishment. In Virginia the representatives of the several counties met at Williamsburg on August 1, 1774, and adopted the following resolutions, which fitly expressed the sentiments of the people of Virginia: "The unhappy disputes between Great Britain and her American colonies, which began about the third year of the reign of his present Majesty and since continually increasing, have proceeded to lengths so dangerous and alarming as to excite just apprehensions in the minds of his Majesty's faithful subjects of the Colony that they are in danger of being deprived of their natural, ancient constitutional and chartered rights, and have compelled them to take the same into their most serious consideration; and being deprived of their usual and accustomed mode of making known their grievances, have appointed us, their representatives, to consider what is proper to be done in this dangerous crisis of American affairs. It being our opinion, that the united wisdom of North America should be collected in a general Congress of all the Colonies, we have appointed the following gentlemen as deputies to represent this Colony in the said Congress, to be held at Philadelphia, on the first Monday in September next, viz., Peyton Randolph, Richard Henry Lee, George Washington, Patrick Henry, Richard Bland, Benjamin Harrison and Edmund Pendleton.—and that they may be the better informed of our sentiments touching the conduct we wish them to observe on this important occasion, we desire that they will express, in the first place, our faith and our allegiance to his Majesty King George the third, our lawful and rightful sovereign; and that we are determined, with our lives and fortunes, to support him in the legal exercise of all his just rights and prerogatives. And, however, misrepresented, we sincerely approve of a constitutional connexion with Great Britain, and wish most ardently a return of that intercourse of affection and commercial connexion that formerly united both countries; which can only be effected by a removal of those causes of discontent which have of late unhappily divided us. "It cannot admit of a doubt that British subjects in America are entitled to the same rights and privileges as their fellow subjects possess in Britain, and therefore that the power assumed by the British Parliament to bind America by their statutes, in all cases whatsoever, is unconstitutional and the source of these unhappy differences. "The end of government would be defeated by the British Parliament exercising a power over the lives, the property and the liberty of American subjects, who are not and, from their local circumstances, cannot be, there represented. Of this nature we consider the several Acts of Parliament for raising a revenue in America, for extending the jurisdiction of the courts of Admiralty, for seizing American subjects and transporting them to Britain to be tried for crimes committed in America, and the several late oppressive Acts respecting the town of Boston and Province of Massachusetts Bay. "The original constitution of the American Colonies possessing their assemblies with the sole right of directing their internal policy, it is absolutely destructive to the end of their institution that their legislatures should be suspended, or prevented by hasty dissolutions, from exercising their legislative powers. "Wanting the protection of Britain, we have long acquiesced in their Acts of navigation, restrictive of our commerce, which we consider as an ample recompense for such protection, but as those Acts derive their efficacy from that foundation alone, we have reason to expect they will be restrained, so as to produce the reasonable purposes of Britain and not be injurious to us. "To obtain redress of these grievances, without which the people of America can neither be safe, free, nor happy, they are willing to undergo the great inconvenience that will be derived to them from stopping all imports whatsoever from Great Britain after the first day of November next, and also to cease exporting any commodity whatsoever to the same place, after the 10th day of August, 1775. The earnest desire we have to make as quick and full payment as possible of our debts to Great Britain, and to avoid the heavy injury that would arise to this country from an earlier adoption of the non-importation plan, after the people have already applied so much of their labor to the perfecting of the present crop, by which means they have been prevented from pursuing other methods of clothing and supporting their families, has rendered it necessary to restrain you in this article of non-exportation; but it is our desire that you cordially co-operate with our sister Colonies in general Congress, in such other just and proper methods, as they, or the majority, shall deem necessary for the accomplishment of these valuable ends. "The proclamation issued by General Gage, in the government of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, declaring it treason for the inhabitants of that Province to assemble themselves to consider of their grievances and to form associations for their common conduct on the occasion, and requiring the civil magistrates and officers to apprehend all such persons to be tried for their supposed offences, is the most alarming process that ever appeared in a British Government; the said General Gage has thereby assumed and taken upon himself powers denied by the constitution to our legal Sovereign. He not having condescended to disclose by what authority he exercises such extensive and unheard of powers, we are at a loss to determine whether he intends to justify himself as the reprepresentative of the King, or as the Commander in Chief of his Majesty's forces in America. If he considers himself as acting in the character of his Majesty's representative, we would remind him that the statute 20th, Edward III., has expressed and defined all treasonable offences, and that the Legislature of Great Britain hath declared that no offence shall be construed to be treason but such as is pointed out by that statute; and that this was done to take out of the hands of tyrannical Kings, and of weak and wicked Ministers, that deadly weapon which constructive treason had furnished them with, and which had drawn the blood of the best and honestest men in the kingdom, and that the King of Great Britain hath no right by his proclamation to subject his people to imprisonment, pains, and penalties. "That if the said General Gage conceives he is empowered to act in this manner, as the Commander in Chief of his Majesty's forces in America, this odious and illegal proclamation must be considered as a plain and full declaration that this despotick Viceroy will be bound by no law, nor regard the constitutional rights of his Majesty's subjects, wherever they interfere with the plans he has formed for oppressing the good people of the Massachusetts Bay; and therefore that the executing, or attempting to execute such proclamation, will justify resistance and reprisal." All of the American colonies, with the exception of Georgia, joined in the common cause and sent delegates to the Philadelphia Congress. The second Continental Congress of the American colonies assembled in Philadelphia on September 5, 1774, fifty-two delegates from twelve colonies present. This Congress was organized by the election of the following officers: President, Peyton Randolph, of Virginia. Secretary, Charles Thompson, of Pennsylvania. Patrick Henry, of Virginia, was the first member of this Congress to address the chair upon the issues which had brought them together. This Congress of able men and noble patriots occupied more than a month's time in serious deliberation before anything of importance was done. On the 8th of October, 1774 (two days before the battle at Point Pleasant) they adopted the following resolutions: "Resolved, That this Congress do approve of the opposition MADE BY THE inhabitants of the Massachusetts Bay to the execution of the late Acts of Parliament; and if the same shall be attempted to be carried into execution by force, in such case all America ought to support them in their opposition. "Resolved, That it is the opinion of this body, that the removal of the people of Boston into the country would be not only extremely difficult in the execution, but so important in its consequences as to require the utmost deliberation before it is adopted. But in case the provincial meeting of that Colony shall judge it absolutely necessary, it is the opinion of this Congress, that all America ought to contribute towards recompensing them for the injury they may thereby sustain, and it will be recommended accordingly. "Resolved, That this Congress do recommend to the inhabitants of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay to submit to a suspension of the administration of justice, when it cannot be procured in a legal and peaceable manner, under the rules of the Charter and the laws founded thereon, until the effects of our application for a repeal of the Acts, by which their Charter rights are infringed, are known. "Resolved, unanimously, That every person or persons whosoever, who shall take, accept, or act under any commission or authority in any wise derived from the Act passed in the late session of Parliament, changing the form of Government and violating the charter of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, ought to be held in detestation and abhorrence by all good men and considered as the wicked tools of that despotism which is preparing to destroy those rights which God, nature and compact have given to America." On the 14th, Congress agreed upon the following preamble and resolutions: "Whereas, since the close of the last war, the British Parliament, claiming a power of right to bind the people of America by statute, in all cases whatsoever, hath in some Acts expressly imposed taxes on them, and on other various pretences, but in fact for the purpose of raising a revenue, hath imposed rates and duties payable in these Colonies, established a board of commissioners with unconstitutional powers and extended the jurisdiction of Courts of Admiralty, not only for collecting the said duties, but for the trial of causes merely arising within the body of a county. And whereas, in consequence of other statutes, judges, who before held only estates at will in their offices, have been made dependent on the Crown alone for their salaries, and standing armies kept in time of peace. And it has lately been resolved in Parliament, that by force of a statute made in the 35th Henry VIII, colonists may be transported to England and tried there upon accusations for treasons and misprisions, or concealment of treasons, committed in the Colonies; and, by a late statute, such trials have been directed in cases therein mentioned. "And whereas, in the late session of Parliament, three statutes were made, one entitled `an Act to discontinue in such manner and for such time as are therein mentioned, the landing and discharging, lading or shipping of goods, wares and merchandise, at the town and within the harbour of Boston, in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, in North America,' another entitled `an Act for the better regulating the government of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, in New England,' and another entitled `an Act for the impartial administration of justice, in the cases of persons questioned for any act done by them in the execution of the law, or for the suppression of riots and tumults, in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, in New England,' and another statute was then made `for making more effectual provision for the government of the Province of Quebec, &amp;c.,' all of which statutes are impolitick, unjust and cruel as well as unconstitutional, and most dangerous and destructive of American rights. "And whereas, Assemblies have been frequently dissolved, contrary to the rights of the people, when they attempted to deliberate on grievances, and their dutiful, humble, loyal, and reasonable petitions to the crown for redress have been repeatedly treated with contempt by his Majesty's Ministers of State. "The good people of the several colonies of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New Castle, Kent and Sussex on Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, justly alarmed at these arbitrary proceedings of Parliament and the Administration, have severally elected, constituted and appointed deputies, to meet and sit in general Congress in the City of Philadelphia, in order to obtain such establishment as that their religion, laws and liberties may not be subverted: Whereupon, the deputies so appointed being now assembled in a full and free representation of these Colonies, taking into their most serious consideration the best means of attaining the ends aforesaid, do in the first place, as Englishmen, their ancestors, in like cases have usually done, for asserting and vindicating their rights and liberties, DECLARE; "That the inhabitants of the English Colonies in North America, by the immutable laws of nature, the principles of the English Constitution and the several charters of compacts, have the following RIGHTS. "Resolved, nemine contradicente, 1st. That they are entitled to life, liberty and property; and they have never ceded to any foreign power whatever, a right to dispose of either without their consent. "Resolved, n. c. 2nd. That our ancestors, who first settled these Colonies, were at the time of their emigration from the mother country, entitled to all the rights, liberties and immunities of free and natural born subjects within the realms of England. "Resolved, n. c. 3rd. That by such emigration they by no means forfeited, surrendered, or lost any of those rights, but that they were, and their descendants now are, entitled to the exercise and enjoyment of all such of them, as their local and other circumstances enable them to exercise and enjoy. "Resolved, n. c. 4. That the foundation of English liberty and all free government is a right in the people to participate in their legislative council; and as the English Colonists are not represented, and from their local and other circumstances cannot properly be represented in the British Parliament, they are entitled to a free and exclusive power of legislation in their several Provincial Legislatures, where their right of representation alone can be preserved, in all cases of taxation and internal policy, subject only to the negative of their Sovereign, in such manner as has heretofore been accustomed; but from the necessity of the case and a regard to the mutual interests of both countries, we cheerfully consent to the operation of such acts of the British Parliament as are bona fide, restrained to the regulation of our external commerce, for the purpose of securing the commercial advantages of the whole empire to the mother country, and the commercial benefits of its respective members, excluding every idea of taxation, internal or external, for raising a revenue on the subjects in America, without their consent. "Resolved, n. c. 5. That the respective Colonies are entitled to the common law of England, and more especially to the great and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage according to the course of that law. "Resolved, n. c. 6. That they are entitled to the benefit of such of the English statutes as existed at the time of their colonization, and which they have, by experience, respectively found to be applicable to their several local and other circumstances. "Resolved, n. c. 7. That these, his Majesty's Colonies, are likewise entitled to all the immunities and privileges granted and confirmed to them by royal charters, or secured by their several codes of Provincial laws. "Resolved, n. c. 8. That they have a right peacably to assemble, consider of their grievances, and petition the King; and that all prosecutions, prohibitory proclamations, and commitments for the same are illegal. "Resolved, n. c. 9. That the keeping a standing army in any of these Colonies in times of peace, without the consent of the Legislature of that Colony in which such army is kept, is against the law. "Resolved, n. c. 10. It is indispensably necessary to good government, and rendered essential by the English constitution, that the constituent branches of the Legislature be independent of each other; that, therefore, the exercise of legislative power in several Colonies by a Council appointed, during pleasure, by the Crown is unconstitutional, dangerous and destructive of the freedom of American legislation. All and each of which the aforesaid deputies in behalf of themselves and their constituents do claim, demand, and insist upon, as their indubitable rights and liberties; which cannot be legally taken from them, altered or abridged by any power whatsoever, without their own consent, by their representatives in their several Provincial Legislatures." And upon the 20th day of October, 1774, they agreed upon the following articles of association, to which each member present subscribed his name. "First, That from and after the first day of December next, we will not import into British America from Great Britain and Ireland, any goods, wares, or merchandize whatsoever, or from any other place, any such goods, wares or marchandise, as shall have been exported from Great Britain or Ireland, nor will we, after that day import any East India tea from any part of the world; nor any molasses, syrups, paneles, coffee or pimento, from the British plantations, or from Dominica; nor wines from Madeira, or the Western Islands; nor foreign indigo. "Second, That we will neither import, nor purchase any slave imported after the first day of December next; after which time we will wholly discontinue the slave trade, and will neither be concerned in it ourselves nor will we hire our vessels, nor sell our commodities or manufactures to those who are concerned in it. "Third, As a non-consumption agreement strictly adhered to will be an effectual security for the observation of non-importation, we, as above, solemnly agree and associate, that, from this day, we will not purchase or use any tea imported on account of the East India Company, or any on which a duty hath been or shall be paid, and from and after the first day of March next, we will not purchase or use any East India tea whatever, nor will we, nor shall any person for or under us, purchase or use, any of those goods, wares or merchandize we have agreed not to import, which we shall know or have cause to suspect, were imported after the first day of December, except such as come under the rules and directions of the tenth article hereinafter mentioned. "Fourth, The earnest desire we have not to injure our fellow-subjects in Great Britain, Ireland or the West Indies, induces us to suspend non-exportation, until the tenth day of September 1775, at which time, if the said Acts and parts of Acts of the British Parliament, hereinafter mentioned, are not repealed, we will not, directly or indirectly, export any merchandize or commodity whatsoever, to Great Britain, Ireland or the West Indies, except via Europe. "Fifth, Such as are merchants and use the British and Irish trade, will give orders, as soon as possible, to their factors, agents and correspondents in Great Britain and Ireland, not to ship any goods to them, on any pretence whatever, as they cannot be received in America; and if any merchant residing in Great Britain or Ireland shall, directly or indirectly, ship any goods, wares or merchandize, for America, in order to break the said non-importation agreement, or in any manner contravene the same, on such unworthy conduct being well attested, it ought to be made publick; and on the same being so done, we will not from thenceforth have any commercial connexion with such merchant. "Sixth, That such as are owners of vessels will give positive orders to their captains, or masters, not to receive on board their vessels any goods prohibited by the said non-importation agreement, on pain of immediate dismission from their service. "Seventh, We will use our utmost endeavors to improve the breed of sheep and increase their number to the greatest extent; and to that end we will kill them as sparingly as may be, especially those of the most profitable kind; nor will we export any to the West Indies or elsewhere; and those of us who are or may become overstocked with, or can conveniently spare any sheep, will dispose of them to our neighbors, especially to the poorer sort, on moderate terms. "Eighth, That we will in our several stations encourage frugality, economy and industry, and promote agriculture, arts and the manufactures of this country, especially that of wool, and will discountenance and discourage every species of extravagance and dissipation, especially all horse-racing, and all kinds of gaming, cock-fighting, exhibitions of shows, plays and other expensive diversions and entertainments. And on the death of any relation or friend, none of us, or any of our families, will go into any further mourning dress than a black crape or ribbon on the arm or hat for the gentleman, and a black ribbon or necklace for the ladies, and we will discontinue the giving of gloves and scarfs at funerals. "Ninth, That such as are vendors of goods or merchandize will not take advantage of the scarcity of goods that may be occasioned by this association, but will sell the same at the rates we have been respectively accustomed to do, for twelve months last past. And if any vendor of goods or merchandize shall sell such goods on higher terms, or shall in any manner, or by any device whatsoever, violate or depart from this agreement, no person ought, nor will any of us deal with any such person, or his, or her factor or agent at any time thereafter for any commodity whatever. "Tenth, In case any merchant, trader, or other persons shall import any goods or merchandize, after the first day of December, and before the first day of February next, the same ought, forthwith, at the election of the owner, to be either reshipped or delivered up to the committee of the county or town wherein they shall be imported, to be stored at the risk of the importer, until the nonimportation agreement shall cease, or be sold under direction of the committee aforesaid; and in the last mentioned case, the owner or owners of such goods shall be reimbursed out of the sales the first cost and charges, the profit, if any, to be applied towards the relieving and employing such poor inhabitants of the town of Boston as are immediately sufferers by the Boston Port Bill; and a particular account of all goods so returned, stored, or sold, to be inserted in the publick papers; and if any goods or merchandizes shall be imported after the said first day of February, the same ought forthwith, to be sent back again, without breaking any of the packages thereof. "Eleventh, That a committee be chosen in every county, city, and town, by those who are qualified to vote for representatives in Legislature, whose business it shall be, attentively to observe the conduct of all persons touching the association; and when it shall be made to appear to the satisfaction of a majority of such committee, that any person within the limits of their appointment has violated this association, that such majority do forthwith cause the truth of the case to be published in the Gazette, to the end that all such foes to the rights of British America may be publickly known and universally contemned as the enemies of American liberty; and thenceforth we will respectively break off all dealings with him or her. "Twelfth, That the Committee of Correspondence in the respective Colonies do frequently inspect the entries of their custom houses, and inform each other from time to time, of the true state thereof, and of every other material circumstance that may occur relative to this association. "Thirteenth, That all manufactures of this country be sold at reasonable prices, so that no undue advantages be taken of a future scarcity of goods. "Fourteenth, And we do further agree and resolve, that we will have no trade, commerce, dealings or intercourse whatever with any Colony or Province in North America, which shall not accede to, or which shall hereafter violate this association, but will hold them as unworthy of the rights of freemen and as inimical to the liberties of their country. "And we do solemnly bind ourselves and our constituents, under the ties aforesaid, to adhere to this association until such parts of the several Acts of Parliament passed since the close of the last war as imposed or continue duties on tea, wine, molasses, syrups, paneles, coffee, sugar, pimento, indigo, foreign paper, glass and painters' colors imported into America, and extend the powers of the Admiralty courts beyond their ancient limits, deprive the American subjects of trial by jury, authorize the judge's certificate to indemnify the prosecutor from damages, that he might otherwise be liable to, from a trial by his peers, require oppressive security from a claimant of ships or goods seized before he shall be allowed to defend his property, are repealed. And until that part of the Act of the 12 Geo. 3, ch. 24. entitled `an Act for the better securing his Majesty's dock-yards, magazines, ships, ammunition and stores,' by which any persons charged with committing any of the offences therein described, in America, may be tried in any shire or county within the realm, is repealed—and until the four Acts passed in the last session of Parliament, viz., that for stopping the port and blocking up the harbour of Boston—that for altering the Charter and Government of the Massachusetts Bay—and that which is entitled, "An Act for the better administration of justice, &amp;c."—and that for "extending the limits of Quebec, &amp;c.," are repealed. And we recommend it to the Provincial Conventions, and to the committee in the respective Colonies, to establish such further regulations as they may think proper, for carrying into execution this association." After the adoption of the foregoing resolutions and articles of association, the Congress drew up a petition to the king, a memorial to the people of England and an address to the people of the Colonies, and another to the French Colonists of Quebec, Georgia and Nova Scotia. This Congress adjourned on the 26th day of October, 1774, after having decided to hold another Congress at the same place on the 10th day of May, 1775, if their present grievances continued. The proceedings of this Congress have enlisted the admiration of the world for more than one hundred and twenty-five years, and the work of the fifty-two men composing this Congress will live while a Republican form of Government and free institutions exist. After the adjournment of this Congress, the Colonies were in that condition which precedes the coming of a storm. The people were willing to forgive and forget, provided their petitions were listened to and their wrongs corrected; otherwise they were ready to give their lives and property in defence of their liberty. It was now time for the English statesmen to recognize, in the resistance of the Colonies, that spirit of freedom which has ever marked the actions of the Anglo-Saxon race. At a meeting of the British Parliament on the 20th day of January, 1775, Lord Dartmouth, Secretary of State for the Colonies, laid before the House of Peers all the papers relative to the American Colonies. As soon as all papers were read, William Pitt, the undying friend of the American Colonies, arose and moved that an address be presented to the King, requesting him to direct General Gage to move his Majesty's forces from the town of Boston. He said: "America could not be reconciled, she ought not to be reconciled to this country, till the troops of Britain are removed from the Continent. Resistance to your acts was necessary, and therefore just; and your vain declarations of the omnipotence of Parliament, and your imperious doctrines of the necessity of submission, will be equally impotent to convince or enslave America. You may, no doubt, destroy their cities, you may cut them off from the superfluities, perhaps the conveniences, of life; but my Lords, they will still despise your power, for they have yet remaining their woods and their liberty. He said that the spirit which now animates America was the same that led to the revolution in England, and that the friends of liberty on both sides of the Atlantic had but one common cause. "In this great cause," he continued, "they are immovably allied; it is the alliance of God and Nature, immutable, eternal, fixed as the firmament of heaven." His Lordship admitted the right of Parliament to control the complicated machinery of commerce and navigation, but denied its authority over the property of the people of the Colonies; "property is private, individual, absolute, the touch of another annihilates it." He besought the House to rest upon that distinction, to allow the Americans to maintain their principles of taxation, and to confine the exercise of parliamentary authority to the regulation of commerce. Of the Continental Congress the noble Earl spoke in a strain of the highest eulogy. "History, my Lords," said he, "has been my favorite study, and in the celebrated writings of antiquity have I often admired the patriotism of Greece and Rome; but, my Lords, I must declare and avow, that in the master-states of the world, I know not the people or the Senate, who in such a complication of difficult circumstances can stand in preference to the Delegates of America, assembled in General Congress at Philadelphia. I trust it is obvious to your Lordships, that all attempts to impose servitude upon such men, to establish despotism over such a mighty continental nation, must be vain, must be futile." The speaker went on to say, that ministerial manœuvres would never be able to resist such a union as that of America, that the hour of danger was not to be averted by the tricks of office, that matters had now gone so far that even repealing the obnoxious Acts would not restore the lost confidence of America, unless his Majesty's armed force was withdrawn from the Continent. The Noble Lord pledged himself, that they would one day find themselves compelled to undo all their oppressive acts. He advised them, therefore, to enter at once into that course, of their own accord, which they must be ultimately forced to adopt. "To conclude, my Lords," said he, "if the Ministers thus persevere in misadvising and misleading the King, I will not say that they can alienate the affections of his subjects from the Crown; but, I affirm, they will make the Crown not worth his wearing, I will not say that the King is betrayed, but I will pronounce that the Kingdom is undone." The motion of Lord Chatham was rejected by a large majority, and the British Ministry declared their purpose never to abandon a single right until the American Colonies were whipped into obedience. The same day that William Pitt delivered the preceding address in the House of Lords, the backwoodsmen of Fincastle county met, pursuant to the resolves of the Continental Congress, at the Lead Mines, their county seat, and took action in the premises; of which the following is a correct account: "In obedience to the resolves of the Continental Congress, a meeting of the Freeholders of Fincastle County, in Virginia, was held on the 20th day of January, 1775, who, after approving of the Association framed by that august body in behalf of all the Colonies, and subscribing thereto, proceeded to the election of a Committee, to see the same carried punctually into execution, when the following gentlemen were nominated: the Reverend Charles Cummings, Colonel William Preston, Colonel William Christian, Captain Stephen Trigg, Major Arthur Campbell, Major William Inglis, Captain Walter Crockett, Captain John Montgomery, Captain James McGavock, Captain William Campbell, Captain Thomas Madison, Captain Daniel Smith, Captain William Russell, Captain Evan Shelby and Lieutenant William Edmondson. . After the election the committee made choice of Colonel William Christian for their chairman, and appointed Mr. David Campbell to be clerk." The following address was then unanimously agreed to by the people of the county, and is as follows: To the Honorable PEYTON RANDOLPH, Esquire, RICHARD HENRY LEE, GEORGE WASHINGTON, PATRICK HENRY, Junior. RICHARD BLAND, BENJAMIN HARRISON, and EDMUND PENDLETON, Esquires, the Delegates from this Colony, who attended the Continental Congress held at PHILADELPHIA: Gentlemen,—Had it not been for our remote situation and the Indian War which we were lately engaged in to chastise those cruel and savage people for the many murders and depredations they have committed amongst us, now happily terminated under the auspices of our present worthy Governor, His Excellency the Right Honorable the Earl of Dunmore, we should before this time have made known to you our thankfulness for the very important services you have rendered to your country, in conjuction with the worthy Delegates from the other Provinces. Your noble efforts for reconciling the mother country and the Colonies, on rational and constitutional principles and your pacifick, steady and uniform conduct in that arduous work entitle you to the esteem of all British America, and will immortalize you in the annals of your country. We heartily concur in your resolutions, and shall, in every instance, strictly and invariably adhere thereto. We assure you, gentlemen, and all our countrymen, that we are a people whose hearts overflow with love and duty to our lawful Sovereign, George the Third, whose illustrious House for several successive reigns have been the guardians of the civil and religious rights and liberties of British subjects, as settled at the glorious Revolution; that we are willing to risk our lives in the service of his Majesty for the support of the Protestant religion and the rights and liberties of his subjects, as they have been established by compact, law and ancient charters. We are heartily grieved at the differences which now subsist between the parent state and the Colonies, and most ardently wish to see harmony restored on an equitable basis and by the most lenient measures that can be devised by the heart of man. Many of us and our forefathers left our native land, considering it as a kingdom subjected to inordinate power and greatly abridged of its liberties; we crossed the Atlantic, and explored this then uncultivated wilderness bordering on many nations of savages and surrounded by mountains almost inaccessible to any but those very savages, who have incessantly been committing barbarities and depredations on us since our first seating the country. These fatigues and dangers we patiently encountered, supported by the pleasing hope of enjoying those rights and liberties which had been granted to Virginians, and were denied us in our native country, and of transmitting them inviolate to our posterity; but even to these remote regions the hand of unlimited and unconstitutional power hath pursued us, to strip us of that liberty and property with which God, nature and the rights of humanity have vested us. We are ready and willing to contribute all in our power for the support of his Majesty's government, if applied to constitutionally, and when the grants are made by our own Representatives, but cannot think of submitting our liberty or property to the power of a venal British Parliament, or to the will of a corrupt Ministry. We by no means desire to shake off our duty or allegiance to our lawful sovereign, but, on the contrary, shall ever glory in being the loyal subjects of a Protestant prince, descended from such illustrious progenitors, so long as we can enjoy the free exercise of our religion as Protestants, and our liberties and properties as British Subjects. But if no pacifick measures shall be proposed or adopted by Great Britain, and our enemies will attempt to dragoon us out of those inestimable privileges, which we are entitled to as subjects, and to reduce us to a state of slavery, we declare that we are deliberately and resolutely determined never to surrender them to any power upon earth but at the expense of our lives. These are our real, though unpolished, sentiments of liberty and loyalty, and in them we are resolved to live and die. We are, gentlemen, with the most perfect esteem and regard, your most obedient servants. The meeting of the freeholders of Fincastle county, on the 20th of January, 1775, in answer to the resolves of the Continental Congress was not the first meeting held for this purpose in the Colony, but it was, as far as we have any record, the first meeting in which the freeholders declared that they were deliberately and resolutely determined never to surrender their inestimable privileges to any power upon earth but at the expense of their lives. The sentiments of this meeting were definitely stated by the Committee of Safety when they declared that the freeholders of Fincastle county did not desire to shake off their allegiance to their lawful sovereign as long as they could enjoy the free exercise of their religion as Protestants and their liberties and properties as British subjects. The Committee of Safety, appointed by the freeholders of Fincastle county, was composed of fifteen men, any one of whom, by reason of his intelligence and patriotism, was competent to draft the address before given. The members of that committee living at that time on lands afterwards within the limits of the county of Washington, were seven in number, as follows: Reverend Charles Cummings, Captain William Campbell, Captain William Russell, Major Arthur Campbell, Captain Daniel Smith, Captain Evan Shelby, Lieutenant William Edmiston. Early in the year 1775, the British Parliament passed a bill restraining the trade of Virginia and that of a number of the other colonies. Several efforts were made by members of this Parliament to have measures adopted that would have a tendency to bring the Colonies and Great Britain together, but all to no purpose. In the Virginia House of Burgesses, Patrick Henry introduced a number of resolutions for arming and disciplining the militia of the Colonies, and the delegates to the former Congress held in Philadelphia were re-elected, along with Thomas Jefferson, to serve in the next Congress which met at Philadelphia in May, 1775. In the month of April, hostilities began between General Gage, commanding the British forces at Boston, and the troops of the Massachusetts Colony, and the first blood of the Revolution was shed at Lexington, Massachusetts, on the 17th day of April, 1775. In a few days this news spread, and the entire Colony was in arms. The first blow had been struck by the King's troops, and now the Colonies took up their arms in self-defence. In Virginia, Governor Dunmore, upon a plea that an insurrection existed in a neighboring county, removed the powder stored in the public magazine at Williamsburg, and placed it on board of a ship by a small body of marines, on the 9th of April, 1775. This action of the Governor provoked a great deal of discontent, and, in answer to a request from the officials of the city of Williamsburg, he promised to restore the powder whenever wanted, but declined to do so at that time, for the reason that he had heard that the people were armed, and that he did not think it prudent to put powder in their hands. This promise of the Governor did not satisfy the people, and, arming themselves, they began to assemble and march through the streets of Williamsburg, whereupon, Governor Dunmore sent them a message in which he stated that if they interfered with any of the King's officers he would declare freedom to their slaves and lay Williamsburg in ashes. This information being communicated to the surrounding country and the news from Massachusetts having reached Virginia, the people flew to arms in all directions. Patrick Henry placed no confidence in the promise of the Governor and resolved upon making an effort to recover the powder. He organized a company in his own county, and, with this company, began his march to Williamsburg. Patrick Henry was very popular with the people of the Colony and upon their hearing of his determination, fully five thousand men tendered him their services. The Governor was greatly alarmed by this occurrence and fled from the capitol and boarded a man-of-war. Apprehending the consequences of this act of Patrick Henry's, he directed the Receiver-General of the Colony to meet Mr. Henry and pay him in full for the powder that had been carried off, which he did. Thereupon, Henry and his followers dispersed to their homes. Two days after this occurrence, the Governor proclaimed Patrick Henry an outlaw. Upon the 15th day of July, 1775, the Committee of Safety for Fincastle county assembled at the Lead Mines, and adopted the following resolutions in approbation of the course pursued by Patrick Henry. At a committee held for Fincastle County, July 15th, 1775, William Christian, chairman. The committee, taking into their consideration the clandestine removal of the gunpowder from the magazine of this Colony by order of our Governor, are clearly and unanimously of opinion that his Lordship's conduct reflects much dishonor on himself, and he very justly deserves the censure so universally bestowed upon him. Resolved, That the spirited and meritorious conduct of Patrick Henry, Esq., and the rest of the gentlemen volunteers attending him on the occasion of the removal of the gunpowder out of the magazine in Williamsburg, very justly merits the very hearty approbation of this committee, for which we return them our thanks, with an assurance that we will, at the risk of our own lives and fortunes, support and justify them with regard to the reprisal they made.* * Amer. Arch., Vol. II., pp. 16-20, 16-21. Resolved, That the council of this Colony in advising and co-operating with Lord Dunmore in issuing the proclamation of the 3d of May last, charging the people of this Colony with an ungovernable spirit and licentious practices, is contrary to many known matters of fact, and but too justly shows to us that those who ought to be mediators and guardians of our liberties are become the abject tools of a detested administration. Resolved, That it is the opinion of this committee that the late sanguinary attempt and preparations of the King's troops, in the Colony of Narragansett Bay, are truly alarming and irritating, and loudly call upon all, even the most distant and interiour parts of the Colonies, to prepare and be ready for the extreme event, by a fixed resolution and a firm and manly resolve to avert ministerial cruelty, in defence of our reasonable rights and liberties. A perusal of these resolutions clearly show the spirit that animated the people of Fincastle county. The third Continental Congress assembled at Philadelphia on the 10th day of May, 1775, and elected the following officers: President, Peyton Randolph, Virginia; Secretary, Charles Thompson, of Pennsylvania. Among the first measures proposed and adopted by this Congress was one looking to the placing of the Colonies in a defensive position and, on the 7th day of June, 1775, the Congress passed a resolution fixing the 20th day of July, 1775, as a day to be observed by the twelve Colonies in humiliation, fasting and prayer. About this time, General Gage, commander of the British forces at Boston, issued a proclamation in the King's name, offering a pardon to all of the people who would lay down their arms, except John Hancock and Samuel Adams. At this time, Peyton Randolph, President of the Continental Congress, resigned his position as President of the Congress, and thereupon John Hancock was elected president—this election being in answer to General Gage's proclamation. On the 15th of June, 1775, the Continental Congress, by a unanimous vote, elected as Commander-in-Chief of all the continental forces George Washington, of Virginia, and elected the following Major-Generals: Artemus Ward, Philip Schuyler and Charles Lee, and Horatio Gates, as Adjutant-General. On the 17th of June, 1775, the battle of Breed's Hill was fought, in which battle the British suffered a loss of eleven hundred men, of whom two hundred and twenty-six were killed, eighty-nine of the number officers. The American loss was four hundred and fifty-three killed, wounded and missing. The Continental Congress, in this month, ordered twelve rifle companies to be raised in Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania, and directed the issuing of two million dollars in continental currency, for the redemption of which they pledged the property of the twelve Colonies. General Washington, immediately upon the receipt of his commission, proceeded to Massachusetts, where he took charge of the continental troops, and, by the middle of August, the rifle companies ordered to be raised in Virginia, reached Cambridge, Massachusetts, in time to take part in the capture of Boston. While we have no documentary evidence of the fact, there can be no doubt that a number of the riflemen from Fincastle county accompanied the troops from Virginia. In the meantime, on the 6th day of July, 1775, the Congress of the United Colonies adopted a memorial setting forth the causes that led to, and the necessity of, their taking up arms. On the 24th day of July, 1775, the Colonial Convention of Virginia met at Williamsburg and appointed a Committee of Safety, and passed an act for the raising of two regiments to be placed under the command of Patrick Henry, who was made commander of all the forces raised and to be raised in defence of the Colony. The two regiments were speedily raised, and assembled at Williamsburg. The Committee of Safety for Fincastle county, in answer to the resolutions of the Virginia Convention, immediately dispatched a company of choice riflemen from Fincastle county, under the command of Captain William Campbell, this company being among the first to arrive at Williamsburg. On the 3d day of September of this year, a British ship-of-war was driven ashore near Hampton, Virginia, during a storm, and, on the morning of the 4th, the people set fire to and destroyed it. The captain of the ship threatened to burn the town and actually tried to do so, but the Virginia Committee of Safety dispatched Colonel Woodford, with three companies of riflemen, to the assistance of the people of Hampton. Of the three companies thus dispatched, one was the company of Fincastle troops under Captain William Campbell.* * Amer. Arch., Vol. —, p. 296. When the British captain began his attack upon the town he was so warmly received by Colonel Woodford and his men, that he took to flight after the loss of a number of men. Thus it will be seen that troops from Fincastle county took part in the first engagement of the Revolutionary war, on Virginia soil, in which blood was shed. Upon the receipt of this information, Lord Dunmore issued a proclamation, proclaiming freedom to all the slaves who would join his standard. He thus gathered a considerable number of volunteers, of whom four hundred were slaves. Colonel Woodford and his company returned to Williamsburg. Lord Dunmore with his forces began a series of depredations upon the people living along the sea-coast, and the Virginia Committee of Safety again dispatched Colonel Woodford at the head of eight hundred men to drive him from his position at the Great Bridge. Colonel Woodford had not been long in the vicinity of the Great Bridge, when Lord Dunmore dispatched Captain Leslie, with the regular troops and slaves, to attack the troops under Colonel Woodford, and, as the result of this attempt, every man of the British troops was killed, wounded or captured; whereupon, Governor Dunmore and his troops went aboard their ships, leaving Colonel Woodford and the Colonial troops in complete control of the position formerly occupied by the Governor. The Colonial troops that assembled at Williamsburg formed two battalions, and the first battalion, to which the troops from Fincastle were attached, was officered as followed: Colonel, Patrick Henry. Lieutenant-Colonel, William Christian, of Fincastle county. Major, Frank Eppes. Lord Dunmore, after his defeat at the Great Bridge, placed all his white followers on board the ships and left his negro allies to shift for themselves. After some time his provisions began to grow scarce, when he sent a request to the citizens of Norfolk for supplies, which request was denied, and on the 1st day of January, 1776, he began to bombard the town of Norfolk, with four ships, and, under cover of the fire from these ships, a company of sailors landed and set fire to the town, which soon was a heap of ashes; an uncalled for act upon the part of the British forces. The British Parliament at its session in 1776, passed an act prohibiting all trade and intercourse with the thirteen American Colonies, and, about the same time, the King of England negotiated treaties with some of the petty princes of Germany for the use of a number of Hessian troops in the campaign against the American Colonies. When information of this act of the British Parliament reached General Washington, he decided to drive the British from Boston and proceeded to do so on the 2d of March, and, on the 4th day of March, General Thomas, with a detachment of the American troops, took charge of Dorchester Heights overlooking Boston harbor. In a few days thereafter, General Howe, with nine thousand British troops, evacuated Boston without a fight, and General Washington, at the head of the continental army, took possession on the 17th day of March, 1776. On the 6th day of May, 1776, the first constitutional convention assembled in Virginia, at Williamsburg, pursuant to the directions of the Committee of Safety, under an ordinance of the convention of 1775, which directed that, in view of the fact that the usual meeting of the General Assembly in a constitutional way had been altogether obstructed, it had become indispensably necessary for the oppressed people of this country, at a crisis so alarming, to adopt such other mode of consulting and providing for the general safety as may seem most conducive to that great end. The members of this convention were elected in the same manner in which the members of the House of Burgesses had been previously elected, and the representatives in this convention from Fincastle county, were: Arthur Campbell, William Russell, both citizens of that part of Fincastle county afterwards included in the subsequently formed county of Washington. It is hard to understand, except upon the idea that the people living upon the waters of the Holston and Clinch exceeded in number the people living on the waters of the New river in Fincastle county, how both members of this Convention should have been residents of the western part of Fincastle county. Some may say that this was done by consent, but such was not the fact, for the elections in those days were as hotly contested as any held in more recent times. It is worthy to be remembered, that in these early days every freeholder was required to vote under the penalty of two hundred pounds of tobacco for a failure, and every freeholder was required to attend and vote on the day appointed, at the Lead Mines, the county seat of Fincastle county. The Virginia convention of 1776 was one of the most important conventions ever held in the State, whether we consider the character of the members, or the work done by them. The Virginia Colony at this time was in open revolt, and Lord Dunmore, the Governor, was an exile from the State. The King by his proclamation had declared the citizens of the Colony rebels and enemies, and now the people by their representatives proceeded in an orderly manner to establish a government for themselves. The constitution and bill of rights adopted by this convention clearly defined the fundamental principles of all free government, and the Declaration of Independence, enunciated at this time, was, beyond question, the forerunner of the Great Declaration of Independence adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4th, 1776. The Bill of Rights adopted by this convention, is as follows: "1st. Whereas, George the Third, King of Great Britain and Ireland and Elector of Hanover, heretofore intrusted with the exercise of the kingly office in this government, hath endeavored to pervert the same into a detestable and insupportable tyranny, by putting his negative on laws the most wholesome and necessary for the publick good; By denying his governours permission to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation for his assent, and, when so suspended, neglecting to attend to them for many years; By refusing to pass certain other laws, unless the persons to be benefitted by them would relinquish the inestimable right of representation in the legislatures; By dissolving legislative assemblies repeatedly and continually, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions of the rights of the people; When dissolved, by refusing to call others for a long space of time, thereby leaving the political system without any legislative head; By endeavoring to prevent the population of our country, and, for that purpose, obstructing the laws for the naturalization of foreigners; By keeping among us in times of peace, standing armies and ships of war; By affecting to render the military independent of, and superior to the civil power; By combining with others to subject us to a foreign jurisdiction, giving his assent to their pretended acts of legislation; For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us; For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world; For imposing taxes on us without our consent; For depriving us of the benefits of trial by jury; For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences; For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever; By plundering our seas, ravaging our coasts, burning our towns, and destroying the lives of our people; By inciting insurrections of our fellow-subjects, with the allurements of forfeiture and confiscation; By prompting our negroes to rise in arms among us, those very negroes, whom, by an inhuman use of his negative, he hath refused us permission to exclude by law; By endeavoring to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions of existence; By transporting, at this time, a large army of foreign mercenaries, to complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy unworthy the head of a civilized nation; By answering our repeated petitions for redress with a repetition of injuries; And, finally, by abandoning the helm of government, and declaring us out of his allegiance and protection. By which several acts of misrule, the government of this country, as formerly exercised under the Crown of Great Britain, is TOTALLY DISSOLVED.* * 9 Hen. Stat., page 112. The result of this action by the Convention was the formation of a stable and efficient government for the State, and the organization of the militia of the commonwealth. This Constitution was proclaimed on the 29th day of June, 1776, on which day the Committee of Safety, designated by the convention of 1775, relinquished their authority, and Patrick Henry was elected the first Governor of the Commonwealth. At the same time the Privy Council, Treasurer, Attorney General, and the other state officers were elected by the convention. This convention, by a resolution, adopted a design for a seal for the new commonwealth. The design adopted was as follows: "To be engraved on the Great Seal, Virtus, the genius of the Commonwealth, dressed like an Amazon, resting on a spear with one hand and holding a sword with the other hand and treading on Tyranny, represented by a man prostrate, a crown fallen from his head, a broken chain in his left hand and a scourge in his right. In the exergon the word "Virginia" over the head of Virtus, and underneath the words, "Sic semper tyrannis." On the reverse a groupe, Libertas, with her wand and pileus. On the other side of her Ceres, with the cornucopia in one hand and an ear of wheat in the other. On the other side Eternitas, with globe and phœnix. In the exergon these words: Deus Nobis Hæc Otia Fecit." This declaration of the Virginia convention is said to have been the first declaration of independence recorded in the world's history. The American people, until this time, had not seriously contemplated a complete separation from England, but now that the British Parliament had refused to listen to their petition and was waging an active war against them, Richard Henry Lee, a representative from Virginia in the Continental Congress at Philadelphia, in the month of May, gave notice that on a day named he would move the Congress to adopt a Declaration of Independence. Early in this same month the Continental Congress had adopted a resolution for the purpose of ascertaining the sentiment of the American colonies on the subject of the independence of America. The motion of Mr. Lee was postponed from day to day, until the first day of July, two days after the adoption of the Virginia Constitution and Bill of Rights, when the Continental Congress resolved itself into a committee of the whole, and began the consideration of the report of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and R. R. Livingston, the committee who had been appointed on the 11th of June to prepare a Declaration of Independence. It is worthy of note that this committee, when appointed, agreed that each member should draw up a Declaration of Independence according to his own ideas, with the understanding that the one that best conformed to the wishes of the committee as a whole should be adopted as the report of the committee. It is stated that Mr. Jefferson's Declaration, being the first read, was unanimously adopted by the committee without debate, the other members refusing to submit their papers for consideration. The Continental Congress, after three days of heated discussion, adopted the report of the committee, which report has since been known as the Declaration of Independence, and is as follows: When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to such separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its power in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, would dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed; but when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies, and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these States. To prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operations till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the rights of representation in the legislature—a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly for opposing, with manly firmness, his invasion of the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise, the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without and convulsions within. He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners, refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands. He has obstructed the administration of justice by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers. He has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers, to harrass our people and eat out their substance. He has kept among us in times of peace standing armies without the consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws, giving his assent to their pretended acts of legislation. For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us, For protecting them by a mock trial, from punishment, for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these States, For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world, For imposing taxes on us without our consent, For depriving us in many cases of the benefit of trial by jury, For transporting us beyond seas, to be tried for pretended offences, For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring Province, establishing therein an arbitrary government and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies, For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws and altering fundamentally the powers of our governments. For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislature for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is, at this time, transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries, to complete the work of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on the high seas, to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands. He has excited domestick insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every stage of these oppressions, we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms; our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time, of attempts, made by their Legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us; we have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here; we have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity; and we have conjured them, by the ties of our common kindred, to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They, too, have been deaf to the voice of justice and consanguinity. We must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends. We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America in General Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority of the good people of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown; and that all political connections between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that, as free and independent States, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce and to do all other acts and things which independent States may of right do. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor. It has been said that this Declaration of Independence was the most sublime exhibition that man has ever made to man. The members composing the Congress were, in their intelligence and patriotism, the giants of our race, and the object of that Congress was the protection of our race. This Declaration of Independence was proclaimed at Philadelphia on the 8th day of July, 1776, and on the 9th it was read to each brigade of the Continental army. This declaration was received by the people at all points with the greatest enthusiasm. A part of the policy adopted by the British Ministry for the reduction of the American Colonies was the enlisting of the Indians in the service of the British Government. We have now reached that point where the history of Southwest Virginia is closely connected with the operations of the Indians in behalf of the British Government. Numerous agents of the Royal Government were sent to the different Indian tribes living along the waters of the western frontiers, and they were so far successful in their efforts to incite the Indian tribes to war, that, by the spring of 1776, the Creeks, Cherokees, Choctaws and Chickasaws were induced to take up arms in behalf of their British allies. The Cherokee Indians, who were the nearest and most accessible tribe to the white settlers, were more numerous than most of the other Indian tribes, and they were the first to take up arms at the instance of the British agents. If the British government had any friends among the backwoodsmen of Fincastle county, this action was of such a character as to alienate the affection and respect of every respectable man. In speaking of the success of the British agents in this matter, a distinguished author has said: "Their success and the constant ravages of the Indians maddened the American frontiersmen upon whom the blow fell, and changed their resentment against the British king into a deadly and lasting hatred, which their sons and grandsons inherited. Indian warfare was of such peculiar atrocity that the employment of Indians as allies forbade any further hope of reconciliation. They saw their homes destroyed, their wives outraged, their children captured, their friends butchered and tortured wholesale by Indians armed with British weapons, bribed by British gold and obeying the orders of British agents and commanders."* * Winning of the West, Part II., p. 76. About this time Colonel Arthur Campbell, of Fincastle county, in writing of this action of the British Government, in arming the Indian tribes, expressed himself as follows: "This infernal malignity of a professed Christian prince was reserved to be exhibited to the world in the reign of George III." Alexander Cameron, the British agent among the Cherokee Indians, lost no time in calling together the chiefs and warriors of this tribe of Indians, to inform them of the wishes of his government. When Cameron disclosed to the Indians his plans, they were greatly astonished, and would not, for some time, believe the statement of Cameron, that one part of the white people wished to wage war against their brothers, for a civil war was unknown between Indians speaking the same language, but he finally succeeded in enlisting the Indians by promising them presents in clothing and by telling them that they could plunder and rob the settlers, and by inducing them to believe that all the lands on the western waters would be reserved to them by the British government as their hunting grounds. This tribe of Indians had been acting for some time in a manner that clearly indicated that they were determined upon hostilities. In the spring of 1775, Andrew Greer, had gone to the Cherokee towns to purchase furs. While there, he had observed the conduct of two white traders, and was convinced that they intended to do him some injury, if possible. When he started from the Indian towns for his home, he left the main trading path and came up the Nolichucky trace and escaped injury, but, at the same time, two men by the name of Boyd and Doggett, who had been sent to the Indian towns by the Virginia authorities, were met on the trace that Greer had left, at Boyd's creek, by Indians, and were killed by them and their bodies hidden. The Virginia settlement had long been at peace with the Indians, but they were sufficiently acquainted with their character to know, that, having once tasted blood, their disposition was to indulge to excess, and now they knew they must prepare for a long and bloody war with a tribe of Indians that exceeded them in numbers. They at once proceeded to put their frontier settlements in a defensive attitude. A fort was built at Watauga, to which was given the name of Fort Lee, the old fort* * Fort Robinson. at Long Island was repaired and called Fort Patrick Henry. Another fort was erected about seven miles east from Long Island, at Amos Eaton's, on the trace leading to Fort Chiswell. A fort was erected shortly before this time at Rye Cove, about fifty miles from the North Fork of Clinch, by a man by the name of Isaac Crismen, who was, afterwards, with two members of his family, murdered by the Indians. Information of the invasion intended by the Indians was forwarded to the Committee of Safety of Fincastle county by Isaac Thomas, an Indian trader, at the instance of Nancy Ward, a noted Indian woman and a relative of several of the principal chiefs. The frontier settlement, at this day, was in Carter's Valley, the settlers obtaining their supplies from the settlement at Wolf Hill (now Abingdon). The action of the Virginia Committee of Safety, requiring a test oath of all the citizens of the Commonwealth, had driven many sympathizers of the British Government to this settlement in Carter's Valley, where they hoped to escape the consequences of their refusal to subscribe to the oath, but information of their presence was obtained by John Carter, a Virginian, who communicated the information he had obtained to the settlers near Wolf Hill. These settlers were great Whigs, and, upon receiving this information, a number of them assembled and went to Brown's settlement in Carter's Valley, and after having assembled the people, John Coulter, a member of the county court of this county, administered to them an oath to be faithful to the common cause. Early in May, the settlers in Carter's Valley and all the families below the North Fork of the Holston, in view of the threatened Indian invasion, left their homes and returned to the settlements. To add to the alarm of the frontier settlers, a letter was delivered at the house of Charles Robertson, on the 18th day of May, 1776, under circumstances that were exceedingly suspicious; which letter accompanied by the affidavit of Nathan Reed, was as follows: "Wattaga. . . . . . . This day, Nathan Reed came before me, one of the justices of Wattaga, and made oath on the Holy Evangelists of Almighty God, that a stranger came up to Charles Robertson's gate yesterday evening—who he was he did not know—and delivered a letter of which this is a true copy. Sworn before me the 19th of May, 1776. Attest, James Smith. John Carter." "Gentlemen:— Some time ago, Mr. Cameron and myself wrote you a letter by Mr. Thomas, and enclosed a talk we had with the Indians respecting the purchase which is reported you lately made of them on the rivers Wattaga, Nolichucky. We are since informed that you are under great apprenhension of the Indians doing mischief immediately. But it is not the desire of his Majesty to set his friends and allies, the Indians, on his liege subjects: therefore whoever you are, that are willing to join his Majesty's forces as soon as they arrive at the Cherokee nation, by repairing to the King's standard, shall find protection for themselves and their families and be free from all danger whatever; yet, that his Majesty's officers may be certain which of you are willing to take up arms in his Majesty's just right, I have thought fit to recommend it to you and every one that is desirous of preventing inevitable ruin to themselves and families, immediately to subscribe a written paper acknowledging their allegiance to his Majesty King George, and that they are ready and willing, whenever called on, to appear in arms in defence of the British right in America; which paper, as soon as it is signed and sent to me safe by hand, should any of the inhabitants be desirous of knowing how they are to be free from every kind of insult and danger, inform them that his Majesty will immediately land an army in West Florida, march them through the Creek to the Chickasaw nation, where five hundred warriors from each nation are to join them, and then come by Chota, who have promised their assistance, and then to take possession of the frontiers of North Carolina and Virginia, at the same time that his Majesty's forces make a diversion on the sea coast of those Provinces. If any of the inhabitants have any beef, cattle, flour, pork or horses to spare, they shall have a good price for them by applying to us, as soon as his Majesty's troops are embodied. I am yours, &amp;c., "Henry Stuart." Henry Stuart was the Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the British Government, and in this capacity he wrote this letter. This letter did not accomplish its purpose, and only had the effect of exciting the settlers to more vigorous efforts to resist the plans of the agents of the British crown. On the 8th of June Jarrett Williams, an Indian trader, returned to the Virginia settlement from the Cherokee towns and gave further information as to the intention of the Indians, which information was embodied in an affidavit given before Anthony Bledsoe, a justice of the peace of Fincastle county. The affidavit was as follows: "Fincastle, ss.— The deposition of Jarret Williams taken before me, Anthony Bledsoe, a justice of the peace for the county aforesaid, being first sworn on the Holy Evangelists of Almighty God, deposeth and saith: That he left the Cherokee nation on Monday night, the 8th inst. (July); "That the part of the nation called the Over-Hills were then preparing to go to war against the frontiers of Virginia, having purchased to the amount of 1,000 skins or thereabouts, for mockasons. They were also beating flour for a march, and making other warlike preparations. Their number, from calculation made by the Raven Warrior, amounts to about six hundred warriors; and, according to the deponent's idea, he thinks we may expect a general attack any hour. They propose to take away negroes and horses, and to kill all kinds of sheep, cattle, &amp;c.; also to destroy all corn, burn houses, &amp;c. And he also heard that the Valley towns were, a part of them, set off; but that they had sent a runner to stop them till all were ready to start. He further relates that Alexander Cameron informed them that he had concluded to send Captain Nathaniel Guist, William Faulin, Isaac Williams and the deponent with the Indians, till they came near to Nolichucky, then the Indians were to stop and Guest and the other whites above mentioned were to go to see if there were any King's men among the inhabitants; and if they found any they were to take them off to the Indians or have a white signal in their hands, or otherwise to distinguish them. When this was done they were to fall on the inhabitants and kill and drive all they possibly could. "That on Saturday, the 6th inst., in the night, he heard two prisoners were brought in about midnight, but the deponent saw only one. That the within Williams saw only one scalp brought by a party of Indians, with a prisoner; but, from accounts, they had five scalps. He also says he heard the prisoner examined by Cameron, thought he gave a very imperfect account, being very much cast down. He further says that the Cherokees had received the war-belt from the Shawnese, Mingo, Taawah and Delaware nations, to strike the white people. That fifteen of the said nations were in the Cherokee towns, and that few of the Cherokees went in company with the Shawnese, &amp;c. That they all intended to strike the settlers in Kentucky; and that the Cherokees gave the Shawnese four scalps of white men, which they had carried away with them. The said Shawnese and Mingoes informed the Cherokees that they were then at peace with every other nation; that the French were to supply them with ammunition, and that they wanted the Cherokees to join them to strike the white people on the frontiers, which the Cherokees have agreed to. "And the deponent further saith that, before he left the nation, a number of the Cherokees of the Lower Towns were gone to fall on the frontiers of South Carolina and Georgia; and further saith not. Jarrett Williams." Signed before Anthony Bledsoe. The settlers on the waters of the Holston and Clinch were greatly aroused by the information received, and the militia was organized and armed for the purpose of resisting the contemplated expedition planned by Cameron, the British agent. The reader must remember that all the settlements as low down as Carter's Valley, and including the settlement at Watauga, were governed by Virginia laws at this time, and expected and received protection from the authorities of Fincastle county in Virginia. Upon the receipt of this information the Watauga committee sent an express to Colonel William Preston, the county lieutenant of Fincastle county, detailing to him their situation and requesting the assistance of the authorities and supplies of lead and powder. Colonel Preston replied to this letter on June 3d as follows: "Gentlemen,— Your letter of the 30th ult. with the deposition of Mr. Bryan, came to hand this evening by your messenger. The news is really alarming, with regard to the disposition of the Indians, who are doubtless advised to break with the white people, by the enemies to American liberty who reside among them. But I cannot conceive that you have anything to fear from the pretended invasion by British troops, by the route they mention. This must, in my opinion, be a scheme purposely calculated to intimidate the inhabitants, either to abandon their plantations or turn enemies to their country, neither of which I hope it will be able to effect. "Our Convention, on the 14th of May, ordered 500 pounds of gunpowder to each of the counties of Fincastle, Botetourt, Augusta, and West Augusta, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . , and double that quantity of lead. . . . . . . . . . . . They likewise ordered 100 men to be forthwith raised in Fincastle, to be stationed where our committee directs for the protection of the frontier. . . . . I sent the several letters and depositions you furnished me, from which it is reasonable to believe that when all these shall have been examined vigorous measures will be adopted for our protection. "I have already advertised our committee to meet at Fort Chiswell on Tuesday the 11th instant, and have directed the candidates for commissions in the new companies to exert themselves in engaging the number of men required until then. I much expect we shall have further news from Williamsburg by the time the committee meets. I have written to Colonel Calloway the second time for 200 pounds of lead, which I hope he will deliver the bearer. This reply will, I hope, be some relief to your distressed settlement, and, as I said before, should more be wanted I am convinced you may be supplied. I am fully convinced that the expense will be repaid you by the Convention of Virginia or North Carolina on a fair representation of the case being laid before them, whichsoever of them takes your settlement under protection, as there is not the least reason that any one part of the colony should be at any extraordinary expense in the defence of the whole, and you may be assured you cannot be overstocked with that necessary article, for should it please Providence that the impending storm should blow over, and there would be no occasion to use the ammunition in the general defense, then it might be sold out to individuals, and the expense of the whole be reimbursed to those who so generously contributed towards the purchase. "I am, with the most sincere wishes for the safety of your settlement, your most obedient and very humble servant, "Wm. Preston." The information brought by Thomas to the settlement was to the effect that seven hundred warriors were to attack the white settlements in two divisions of three hundred and fifty each, led by Dragging Canoe and Oconostota. The one commanded by Oconostota was to attack the Watauga settlements, while the other, commanded by Dragging Canoe, was to attack and break up the settlements between the North and South fork of the Holston river. Battle of Long Island Flats. Upon the receipt of this news a few of the militia hastily assembled and proceeded to Amos Eaton's, the frontier house, about fifteen miles in advance of the settlement, and began to build a kind of stockade fort with fence-rails, and after some time a breast-work was completed sufficient to repel a considerable number. Thereupon expresses were sent to Thompson's Fort, now on the Huff farm, in the upper end of this county; to Edmiston's Fort, now near Lodi, Virginia; to Cocke's Fort, on Spring Creek; to Shelby's Fort, on Holston river, and to the settlements near Wolf Hills, and on the following morning about one hundred and seventy men reported at Eaton's Fort under the command of: James Thompson, William Buchanan, William Cocke, James Shelby, John Campbell, Thomas Madison. On the 19th day of July, 1776, the scouts returned to Eaton's Fort and reported that a great number of Indians were making into the settlements. Upon the receipt of this information it was debated as to the prudent course to pursue, to await the coming of the Indians in the fort or to march out and meet them in the woods and fight them wherever they could be found. Capt. William Cocke argued that the Indians would not attack them in the fort, but would pass by and assail the settlements, killing and butchering and carrying off the property, and proposed to march out and meet the enemy. The proposition made by Captain Cocke prevailed, and the entire company, consisting of one hundred and seventy men, marched from the fort in the direction of Long Island, which was about seven miles distant. This company marched in two divisions, with flankers on each side and scouts before, and had proceeded not more than five miles when they discovered about twenty Indians meeting them, upon whom they fired. The Indians returned the fire, whereupon the white men rushed upon them and put them to flight. Ten bundles and a good deal of plunder were captured by the white men, and it was thought that some of the Indians were wounded. The ground where this skirmish took place was not very advantageous for a pursuit, and the men were with great difficulty restrained from pursuing the Indians. A council was held, and it was decided to return, as the officers had good reason to believe that a large party of Indians were not a great way off. They accordingly returned, and had not marched more than a mile when they heard a noise like distant thunder, and looking around they saw the whole Indian force running upon them at full speed, whereupon they made a hasty retreat to an eminence, where they rallied, and Captain Thompson, the officer in command, ordered that the right line form for battle to the right and the left line to the left, and to face the enemy. In attempting to obey the orders of Captain Thompson, the head of the right line bore too much along the road leading in the direction of the station, and Lieutenant Robert Davis, perceiving that the Indians were trying to outflank them, took a part of the line and formed them as quickly as possible on the right, across the flat to the ridge, preventing the Indians from accomplishing their purpose. The officers and many of the men exhibited in this battle a heroism almost unexampled. When the Indians began their attack, it was with great fury, those in front halloing, "The Unacas are running. Come on and scalp them." The Indian attack was made upon the centre and the left flank of the whites at the same time, and as a result the troops were thrown into great confusion, and it was found almost impossible to form the troops in the face of the Indian attacks. Whereupon Capt. James Shelby, stepping to the front, ordered the several companies to go to the rear and reform their ranks, while he, accompanied by Lieut. Wm. Moore, Robert Edmiston, John Morrison and John Findlay, kept the Indians at bay. Gilmore, in his "Rear Guard of the Revolution," makes the statement that Edmiston, in a hand-to-hand fight, slew three or four Indians, Morrison as many more, and that Moore became engaged in a desperate struggle with a herculean Indian chieftain, and, as if by general consent, the Indians paused to await its issue. This delay, no doubt, saved much loss of life among the one hundred and seventy. It lasted for some minutes, but ended by Moore sinking his tomahawk into the brain of the Indian. The whites, in the meantime, had formed their line of battle about a quarter of a mile long and began to pour a destructive fire into the Cherokees from cover whenever possible. The Indians, having witnessed the end of the conflict between Moore and their chieftain, made a rapid advance upon Shelby and his companions, who, about this time, began to fall back to their line. Whereupon the Indians made a furious assault upon Robert Edmiston, who held a position in the centre of the line, during which assault it was afterwards charged that Edmiston used profane language, upon which charge he was tried by the Ebbing Spring Presbyterian congregation. The engagement lasted from one-half to three-quarters of an hour, when the Indians disappeared as if by magic, leaving the white men masters of the situation. Thirteen dead Indians were found on the ground, and many more might have been found if search had been made for them, for many trails of blood were seen where the dead had been carried off or the wounded escaped. It is wonderful to record the fact that no white man was killed in this battle and only four slightly wounded. The names of the white men wounded in this battle are, so far as I can ascertain, Joshua Jones and John Findlay. We here give a report of this engagement made by the captains in command to Col. William Preston, the county lieutenant of Fincastle county: "On the 19th our scouts returned and informed us that they had discovered where a great number of Indians were making into the settlements, upon which alarm the few men stationed at Eaton's completed a breast-work sufficiently strong, with the assistance of what men were there, to have repelled a considerable number; sent expresses to the different stations and collected all the forces in one body, and the morning after about one hundred and seventy turned out in search of the enemy. We marched in two divisions, with flankers on each side and scouts before. Our scouts discovered upwards of twenty meeting us, and fired on them. They returned the fire, but our men rushed on them with such violence that they were obliged to make a precipitate retreat. We took ten bundles and a good deal of plunder, and had great reason to think some of them were wounded. This small skirmish happened on ground very disadvantageous for our men to pursue, though it was with the greatest difficulty our officers could restrain their men. A council was held, and it was thought advisable to return, as we imagined there was a large party not far off. We accordingly returned, and had not marched more than a mile when a number, not inferior to ours, attacked us in the rear. Our men sustained the attack with great bravery and intrepidity, immediately forming a line. The Indians endeavored to surround us, but were prevented by the uncommon fortitude and vigilance of Capt. James Shelby, who took possession of an eminence that prevented their design. Our line of battle extended about a quarter of a mile. We killed about thirteen on the spot, whom we found, and we have the greatest reason to believe that we could have found a great many more had we had time to search for them. There were streams of blood every way, and it was generally thought there was never so much execution done in so short a time on the frontiers. Never did troops fight with greater calmness than ours did. The Indians attacked us with the greatest fury imaginable, and made the most vigorous efforts to surround us. Our spies really deserve the greatest applause. We took a great deal of plunder and many guns, and had only four men greatly wounded. The rest of the troops are in high spirits and eager for another engagement. We have the greatest reason to believe they are pouring in great numbers on us, and beg the assistance of our friends. "James Thompson, "James Shelby, "William Buchanan, "John Campbell, "William Cocke, "Thomas Madison." Several incidents are related as having taken place before and during this battle that we here give as they have been preserved, without vouching for the truth thereof. Benjamin Sharp, in a letter published in the American Pioneer, gives an incident as occurring during the battle. He says: "An Alexander Moore, a strong, athletic, active man, by some means, got into close contact with an Indian of nearly his own size and strength. My brother-in-law, William King, seeing Moore's situation, ran up to his relief, but the Indian adroitly kept Moore in such a position that King could not shoot him without hurting Moore. The Indian had a large knife suspended at his belt, for the possession of which they both struggled, but at length Moore succeeded and plunged it into the Indian's bowels. He then broke his hold and sprang off of Moore, and King shot him through the head." Several historians make the statement that William Cocke, one of the captains upon this expedition, was charged with cowardice by a number of the militia immediately after a council of the officers, had decided to return to Fort Eaton instead of pursuing the twenty Indians first discovered, and that Captain Cocke, soon after the return march had begun for Eaton's Fort, halted the line and delivered a speech in defence of his reputation. We cannot imagine the reason why the charge should have been made, but from an examination of the records of the Virginia Privy Council it appears that on December 9, 1776, the following order was entered: "It appearing from the deposition of Thomas Madison, Esq., that there are grounds to suspect Capt. William Cocke of cowardice in a late action with the Indians, it is therefore ordered that the said Captain Cocke be forthwith suspended; that the Governor be requested to write to the county lieutenant of Fincastle directing him to hold a court of inquiry touching the conduct of said Captain Cocke, and to transmit to this board a copy of the same." I cannot ascertain what disposition was made of this charge against Captain Cocke, but I am compelled to believe that he was acquitted, for he was afterwards elected to the General Assembly of Virginia from Washington county, and in a few years thereafter became one of the first United States senators from the State of Tennessee. The result of this victory was not only the destruction of a number of the Indian warriors and the wounding of their savage chief, Dragging Canoe, but it inspired the settlers with confidence in themselves and a contempt of danger from the Indians. It is said that ever afterwards the inquiry among the white settlers when in search of the Indians was not "how many of them are there," but "where are they to be found?" On the same day that the battle was fought at the Long Island Flats another body of Indians attacked Fort Lee at Watauga, in which fort were Capt. James Robertson and forty others. But the Indians were repulsed with some loss by the fire from the fort, but for three weeks skulked around the fort, during which time a man and a boy, who had ventured to leave the fort, were assailed by the Indians and captured, and the man scalped on the spot. The boy, who was a brother of Lieut. Wm. Moore, was reserved for a worse fate, he being afterwards burned at the stake by the Indians. Mrs. Wm. Bean, who lived on Boone's creek, was captured by the Indians, but was subsequently released through the influence of Nancy Ward. Colonel Russell, who was located at Fort Patrick Henry, was ordered to go, with five companies of militia, to the relief of Fort Lee, but he was so slow that Col. Evan Shelby raised a company of about one hundred men in the vicinity of Wolf Hills and proceeded to Watauga, where he found the inhabitants in their fort and the Indians gone. After the battle at Long Island Flats the Virginia militia returned to the fort and the men dispersed to their several homes to take care of their families and property. In the meantime all the frontier settlements were breaking up and the settlers fleeing from every quarter. The main road or trace was crowded with people moving with the greatest haste to escape the invading Indians. At the farm of Capt. Joseph Black, where Abingdon now stands, between four and five hundred people collected together to build a fort. The erection of Black's Fort was begun on the 20th day of July, 1776, the same day that the battle of Long Island Flats was fought, and the news of the victory of the settlers in that battle was received the next day. Upon the receipt of this news all business was suspended, while the Rev. Charles Cummings offered up a prayer of thanksgiving, in which all the people heartily joined. The defeat of the Indians at the Long Island did not end the trouble of the settlers on the Holston. About the time that the battle was fought a party of Indians came up the Clinch river burning all the property and killing and scalping all the settlers that they could find. Dividing themselves into small bodies, they invaded the settlements from the lower end of what is now the present county of Sullivan, in Tennessee, to the Seven Mile Ford, in Virginia. About the 24th of July, 1776, Capt. James Montgomery, who had settled on the south fork of Holston river, about eight miles from Black's Fort, came to the fort, he and two other families having decided to defend their own homes. He came in quest of intelligence, and was earnestly besought by the people of the fort to bring in the families, to which he agreed, and men and horses were sent to assist him. This company soon returned to the fort with the families and some of their property, and went back to bring in the rest of the property when, to their surprise, they found the houses plundered and in flames. The company thereupon hastily retreated to the fort, and spies were sent out to locate the Indians if possible, but no discoveries were made for some days, when at length the spies came in one night and reported that they had discovered a fire on the bank of the river above Montgomery's which they supposed to be the Indian camp.* * This camp was on the Mahaffey farm. Upon receipt of this information an express was sent to Bryan's Fort requesting their men to meet the men from Black's Fort at a certain place that night. The two companies met according to agreement, and the spies conducted them to the spot where they had seen the fire, when the Indians were surrounded from the river below to the river above them, with strict injunctions to the men to preserve a profound silence till the report of the captain's gun should give the signal for a general discharge; and in this position they waited for daylight. At the dawn of day, when the Indians arose and began to stir about the camp, the crack of the captain's rifle was followed by a well-directed fire from every quarter. The Indians fled across the river, exposed all the way to the fire of the whites. Eleven Indians lay dead at and around the camp, and the number that fell and sank in the river is not known. The men crossed the river and found numerous trails of blood, one of which they followed to where an Indian had crept into a hollow log, whom they drew out by his feet, and, according to his request, shot him in the head. As a result of this slaughter of Indians the settlers at Black's Fort were greatly rejoiced, and the eleven Indian scalps were attached to a long pole and fixed as a trophy over the fort gates.† † Benj. Sharp letter, published in American Pioneer. He was an occupant of the fort at the time. Several days thereafter three companies prepared to go out from the fort to visit their plantations and on other missions. The first company to leave the fort was composed of John Sharp, his two sons, and two sons-in-law. They went early and were unmolested. The second company to leave the fort on that day was composed of Arthur Blackburn, William Casey and his sister Nancy, who was about sixteen years of age, Robert Harold and several others, and about the same time a third company left the fort to visit the house of Rev. Charles Cummings to bring his books and some of his property into the fort. Both of these parties were attacked by the Indians at the same time within hearing of the fort, where an indescribable scene of disorder took place, the women and children screaming, wives clinging to their husbands, mothers to their sons and sisters to their brothers, to prevent them from going out of the fort. However, a number of them left the fort and ran to the rescue of the companies as fast as possible, but before they arrived upon the scene the Indians had done their work and gone. Of the second company to leave the fort Arthur Blackburn was shot, tomahawked, and scalped, but was found alive, brought in, and recovered from his wounds. Along with this same company was William Casey and his sister Nancy, a beautiful little girl about sixteen years of age. As Casey was running for his life to the fort he discovered the Indians in hot pursuit of his sister, and seeing Robert Harold, another young man, close by, he called to him to come and help him save Nancy. Harold obeyed, and, although there were from four to seven Indians in pursuit, these young men rushed between them and the girl, and by dexterously managing to fire alternately, still keeping one gun loaded when the other was discharged, they kept the Indians at bay till they gave up the pursuit and the girl was brought in safe. The author of this account says, "Such acts of generous bravery ought at all times be held as examples to our youth." The third company was composed of the Rev. Charles Cummings, his servant Job, William Creswell, the driver, James Piper and one other; and when they had reached a point called Piper's Hill, they were attacked by a band of Indians, and at the first fire William Creswell, who had taken part in the battle of Long Island Flats, was killed and two of the other men were wounded, James Piper having his finger shot off, but the Rev. Charles Cummings, with the remaining man, and his servant Job, held the Indians at bay until he obtained help from Black's Fort, when he brought off the wounded men in safety. William Creswell was buried near the Presbyterian church, now Sinking Spring Cemetery, where his grave may be seen at this day marked by a rude tombstone. An exact reproduction of the inscription thereon is here given: William Creswell entered this place July, 1776. It has been stated that this is the oldest known grave in this section, but such is not the fact. Poston's graveyard is situated on a high knob in close proximity to the falls of the north fork of Holston river, in this county, and in the graveyard is found a grave marked by a limestone rock upon which is inscribed, "Mary Boyd, died Feby. 17, 1773, aged 3 years. Alexander Boyd's child." Tradition says that this death occurred by the capsizing of Boyd's boat in passing over the falls, Boyd at the time emigrating to the extreme frontiers. From the period that Mr. Cummings commenced preaching in the Holston settlements up to the time of this attack the men never went to church without being armed and taking their families with them. On Sabbath morning during most of this period it was the custom of Mr. Cummings to dress himself neatly, put on his shot pouch, shoulder his rifle, mount his horse and ride off to church, where he met his gallant and intelligent congregation, each man with his rifle in his hand. The minister would then enter the church, walk gravely through the crowd, ascend the pulpit, deposit his rifle in a corner of it, lay off his shot pouch, and commence the solemn services of the day.* * Governor David Campbell's MSS. The Rev. Charles Cummings was what would be termed in our day "a fighting parson." Immediately after the occurrence above stated Mr. Cummings and about one hundred of his parishioners, under the command of Evan Shelby, hurried to the relief of the Watauga settlers who were besieged by the Indians in Fort Lee, and he accompanied Col. William Christian on his expedition against the Cherokee Indians in the fall of this year, preaching at different points in East Tennessee to settlers and soldiers whenever the opportunity offered itself, he being the first minister of the gospel to deliver the message of peace in the boundaries of the present State of Tennessee. In the year 1776 the ground now occupied by Martha Washington College and Stonewall Jackson Institute was a dense chinquapin thicket, and the lands between the thicket and Black's Fort were cultivated in flax. During the summer of the year 1776 two men and three women were pulling flax near the fort with Frederick Mongle stationed as sentinel to give the alarm should the Indians make their appearance. The Indians, who had hidden themselves in the bushes above referred to, quietly approached and wounded and scalped Mr. Mongle, but the other persons reached the fort in safety by dodging from tree to tree. The men from the fort came at once to the rescue, and, attacking the Indians, drove them off. Mr. Mongle soon died from his wounds, and his relatives claim that his grave, and not William Creswell's, was the first made in Sinking Spring Cemetery. But this contention cannot be correct, for Mongle was not killed until several weeks after the death of William Creswell. During the summer several murders were committed by the Indians. Two men, who had gone out to bring up their horses, were killed almost in sight of a neighboring fort, and of the two men who went with an express from Fort Black one was killed and the other made his escape. As a result of the trouble with the Indians Col. Wm. Christian, Capt. Wm. Campbell, and Capt. Wm. Russell returned to their homes from the regular continental army to assist in the defence of their homes from the combined attacks of the British and Indians. The Governor of Virginia at this time directed Col. Wm. Fleming, of Botetourt county, to dispatch a body of the militia of that county to the frontiers of Fincastle county for the protection of the inhabitants, and pursuant to this order Capt. Thomas Rowland was dispatched with his company to the frontiers. The following is a complete list of Captain Rowland's company: Capt. Thomas Rowland, Henry Cartmill, Martin Baker, John Wood, Thomas Bowyer, James Leatherdale, John Crawford, David Wallace, James Bryant, William Bryant, Robert Feely, Elijah Vinsant, John Moor, Thomas Eagnew, Isaac Richardson, James Nicholas, William Crawford, William Kyles, Martin McFattin, James Esprey, Samuel McFarrin, George Rutledge, William Calbert, Edward Carbin, Samuel M'Roberts, Thomas Peage, Stephen Holston, William Henry, George Givens, James Cloyd, Isaac Lawrence, William Wills, James McQuown, James Robinson, James Alcom, George Hutchinson (Botetourt parish), Rev. Adam Smyth, pastor, William Astin, William Leatherdale, Robert Woods, Edward Guilford, Joseph Bryant, William McFarrin, Jacob Kimberland, Robert Birdswell, Thomas Howell, Samuel Blair, David Harbinson, Jonathan Wood, Joseph Titus, William Richey, Joseph Kyles, Samuel McClure, Patrick Lockhart, John Mills, Henry Smith, James Gaunt, Joseph Carrol, John Jones, Henry Walker, John Burks, Thomas Arbuckle, David Lawrence, Patrick Lawrence, John Frager, William Ross. This expedition accomplished nothing of value. This muster roll is given as a matter of information to the many descendants of these men who are now living in this county. In the year 1776, at the time of the battle of Long Island Flats, a man by the name of Lewis, with his wife and seven children, lived in the bounds of the present county of Scott. He was informed by Captain John Redd, that the Indians had declared war and were on the warpath, and was advised to move into the settlements, but he swore that he was in no danger, the Indians would never find him, but, soon thereafter, the Indians visited his home and killed and scalped Lewis, his wife and seven children. Among the extreme settlers who left their homes and returned to the settlements, was a man by the name of Ambrose Fletcher, whose family consisted of himself, his wife and two children. Fletcher had settled at Martin's Fort in Powell's Valley, and fled from that point to Blackmore's Fort, on Cove creek, now in Scott county, Virginia. He and his family remained in Blackmore's Fort for a few days, when, the fort becoming very much crowded, Fletcher built a small cabin, about thirty or forty yards back of the fort, and moved into it. Shortly afterwards, Fletcher left his home to go to a canebrake to get his horse, and, on returning, he found his wife and two children tomahawked and scalped. At this time the following forts were to be found on the waters of the Holston and Clinch, so far as I can ascertain: Thompson's Fort, located on the farm now owned by Huff Bros. Edmiston's Fort, located on Snodgrass's farm at Lodi, Va. Bryan's Fort, located at Kendrick's Mill. Black's Fort, located at Abingdon, Virginia. Cocke's Fort, located on Clyce Farm on Spring creek Bledsoe's Fort, located —. Shelby's Fort, located Bristol. Eaton's Fort, located seven miles east of Long Island. Fort Patrick Henry, located at Long Island. Fort Lee, located, at Watauga. Gillespie's Fort, located —. Womack's Fort, located, near Bluff City, Tennessee. Martin's Fort, located in Powell's Valley. Priest's Fort, located in Powell's Valley. Mumps' Fort, located in Powell's Valley. Rye Cove Fort, located —. Blackmore's Fort, located Cove creek. Glade Hollow Fort, located in Russell county. Hamlin's Fort, located near Castle's Woods. Elk Garden Fort, located Russell county. Fort Bowen, located at Maiden Spring. Wynne's Fort, located Tazewell county, Wynne's branch. Crab Orchard Fort, located Tazewell county. At the same time that the Virginia settlements were suffering from the invasion of the Indians, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, were experiencing like invasions. These four frontier colonies decided to invade the Indian country and bring them to their senses, by destroying their towns and chastising their warriors. The Cherokee Indians occupied that vast country north of the upper settlements in Georgia and west of the settlements in North and South Carolina and Southwest Virginia. Their country was divided into three sections, and the number of the warriors in each was as follows: Middle Settlements and Valleys 878 In Lower Towns 356 In Over-Hill Towns 757 Total 1,991 The Georgia militia, under the command of Colonel McBury and Major Jack, invaded the Indian settlements on the Tugalo river, routed the Indians and destroyed all their towns. The militia of South Carolina, being about 1150 men, under the command of General Williamson, in the early days of August, marched into the Indian settlements and met and defeated, at Oconoree, Alexander Cameron, who was in command of a large body of Indians and white men. They burned a number of Indian towns and returned to their homes. The militia of the State of North Carolina, numbering about 2,000 men, under the command of General Rutherford, marched into the middle settlements and valleys, about the same time. Upon the approach of this army, the Indians fled. Their towns were burned, to the number of thirty or forty, and these troops returned to North Carolina. While the troops of the States of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina were invading the middle settlements and lower towns of the Cherokees, the Virginia authorities were making every preparation to invade the over-hill towns. On the 22d of July, 1776, the Virginia Council received a letter from President Rutledge, of South Carolina, informing them that hostilities had been commenced by the Cherokee Indians, and that Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina had agreed to set on foot an expedition against the lower towns and middle settlements at once, and requesting the coöperation of Virginia, asking that she carry war into the upper or over-hill towns. Thereupon, the council directed Colonel Charles Lewis to march immediately, with his battalion of minute men, to the frontiers. Upon the receipt of this order Colonel Lewis immediately marched his battalion of troops to the vicinity of New river in Fincastle county, where it was ascertained that a number of his men were unfit for an Indian expedition; whereupon, he was directed to discharge all such and to recruit others in their stead. On the first day of August, 1776, the Virginia Council ordered that a commission issue appointing William Christian, Esq., colonel of the first battalion and commander-in-chief of all the forces raised for use in the expedition against the Cherokee Indians. It was decided to send two battalions of troops upon this expedition, which were officered as follows: Commander-in-chief, William Christian. Colonel, first battalion, William Christian. Major, first battalion, Evan Shelby. Surgeon, first battalion, Joseph Starke. Colonel, second battalion, Charles Lewis. Surgeon, second battalion, George Hart. Captain James Thompson and his company formed the life guard of Colonel Christian, the commander-in-chief, upon this expedition. The following captains, with their companies, accompanied this expedition against the Cherokee Indians, so far as I can ascertain: Captain John Campbell, Captain William Russell, Captain Robert Boggs, Captain John Sevier, Captain James Thompson, Captain Isaac Bledsoe, Captain John Montgomery, Captain Daniel Smith, Captain Aaron Lewis, Captain Jacob Womack, Captain William Cocke, Captain Benjamin Gray, Captain William Preston, Captain Thomas Madison. Captain Thomas Madison was appointed commissary and paymaster upon this expedition. But little is known of the participants in this expedition. I have, therefore, gathered the names of the privates who took part in this expedition, as far as I can obtain them. Their names are as follows: Robert, Campbell, Thomas Hobbs, wounded. Thomas Berry, wounded. Christopher Watson, Matthew Allison, John Finley, Andrew Wallace, Humphrey Higgins, James Sawyers, William Crawford, James Buford, Joshua Renfro, William Hogart, Ephraim Dunlap, Michael Ocheltree, Benjamin Thomas, John Wood, Robert Finley, William Wills, Jacob Gardner, Samuel Ewing, George Caldwell, Jacob Early, James Berry, Henley Moore, Jacob Anderson, John Adair, James Robinson, William Hicks, David Getgood, Samuel Gay, Isaac Riddle, David Smith, Edward Ross, Gideon Farris, Jesse Womack, John Furnham, William Frogg, William Milum, Lance Woodward, Francis Katherine, Daniel Henderson, Amos Eaton, David Rounceval, Samuel Douglas, wounded; — Duncan, killed; George Berry, wounded; John Reburn, Abraham Crabtree, David McKenzie, Christopher Irwin, John Cochran, James Young, William Meade, David Wallace, Stephen Holston, Patrick Murphy, Isbon Talbert, James Campbell, Matthew Scott, Thomas Logwood, Robert Preston, Robert Campbell, Jacob Cogor, Daniel Kidd, John Goff, Cuthbert Jones, Samuel Campbell, William Markland, Joseph McCormick, James McCockle, Joseph Russell, Jonathan Martin, Gideon Morris, William Ingram, Robert Stewart, James Berry, Daniel Smith, William Haynes, John McClanahan, John Phelps, Abraham McClanahan, James Arnold, Hanrist Carlock, Andrew Little, Thomas Berry, John Latham, William Ramsay, James Bradley, Lambert Lane, John Rice, Joab Springer, Onsbey Carney, John Crane, Benjamin Drake, Benjamin Rice, David Irwin, George Miller, Thomas Ramsay, Thomas Fowler, Thomas Smith, George Coon, William Rice, Isaac Rounceval, James M'Farland, William Ross, Philip Love, David English, James Tuttle, Meredy Reins, Michael Gleaves, Christian Shultz, Samuel Ingram, James Newell, William Bennett, Littleton Brooks, Michael Rowland, William Mitchell, William Rice, Philip Williams, James Harris, Arthur Onsbey, William Nettles, John Harris, Jr., William Lane, David Hunter, Michael Ohair, John Walker, Ebenezer Meads, Samuel Campbell, Francis Hamilton, James Daugherty, Frederick Fraily, William Edmiston, David Carson, James M'Cain, James Steel, Robert Gambell, Daniel M'Cormack, Jonathan Jennings, George Parker, William Peoples, Valentine Little, Samuel Fair, Alexander Butler, William Brown, Leonard Helm, James Greer, Samuel Ewin, Richard Thomas, Robert Stephenson, Robert M'Elheney, Isaac Thomas, John Craig, Adam Brausteter, Michael Dougherty, James M'Carthy, William Henson, Charles Rice, Jesse Henson, Jonathan Mulhey, Moses Winters, John Harris, Sr., James Beets, John M'Farland, Nicholas Edwards, James Kelley, James Richardson, James Hamilton, George Newland, James Williams, Henry Whitner, Henry Richardson, John Muldrough, Michael Francisco, James Mason, Solomon Kendrick, William White, Charles Cocke, John Craig, Robert McNutt, Jacob Stearns, John Simpson, Thomas Price, Peter Haff, Henry Rice, William Lane, Philip Mulhey, Sr., Lewis Crane, Isaac Lindsay, Samuel Martin, James M'Clern, James Smith, Lewis Whitner, William Calvert, Samuel Eason, James M'Donald, Samuel Montgomery, William Carr, John Gibson, James Walker, Philip Mulhey, Jr., Andrew Cowan, John Adair, James Cameron, George Scott, Joseph Perrin Nicholas Edwards, John Hounshel, Adam Brausteter, James Doran, George Caldwell, Jeremiah Rush, Robert Hardwicke, Joseph M'Reynolds, Benjamin Logan, Robert Cowden, Andrew Irwin, John Gordon, Thomas Goldsby, Peter Turney, Anthony Bledsoe, John Walker, Evan Williams, Edward Piggett, Jacob Vance. On the 26th day of July, 1776, the Honorable Cornelius Harnett, president of the Council of Safety of North Carolina, informed the Virginia Council that the Cherokees entertained the design of cutting off the persons employed at the Lead Mines, whereupon, the Council ordered William Preston, the county lieutenant of Fincastle county, to raise, at once, a stockade fort for the defence of said mines and to garrison the same with a force of twenty-five men. On the first day of August, 1776, the Virginia Council gave the following instructions to William Christian, commander-in-chief, and Colonel Charles Lewis, in command of the second battalion, of the forces in the expedition against the Cherokees. "When your battalion and the battalion under Colonel Charles Lewis are completed, you are to march with them and the forces under the command of Colonel Russell, and such others as may join you from Carolina, into the Cherokee country, if these forces shall be judged sufficient for the purpose of severely chastising that cruel and perfidious nation, which you are to do in a manner most likely to put a stop to future insults and ravages and that may redound most to the honor of American arms. If the Indians should be reduced to the necessity of suing for peace, you must take care to demand of them a sufficient number of their chiefs and warriors as hostages, for the performance of the conditions you may require of them. You must insist on their delivering up all prisoners who may choose to leave them and on their giving up to justice all persons amongst them who have been concerned in bringing on the present war, particularly Stuart, Cameron and Gist, and all others who have committed murder or robberies on our frontiers. You may require any other terms which the situation of affairs may point out and you may judge necessary for the safety and honor of the Commonwealth. You must endeavor to communicate with the commanding officer of the Carolina forces and coöperate with him, making the attack as near the time of his as may be. You are from time to time to write His Excellency the Governor, giving him a full account of your operations, and requiring his further instructions. Instructions to Colonel Charles Lewis of the second battalion of minute men: You are to order the captains under your command to march their companies to their respective counties, then to discharge such of their men as are not properly qualified to serve on an expedition against the Indians, and to raise with all possible dispatch in their stead the best recruits that can be found for the service, and, having so completed their companies, to repair to the Big Island on Holston river in Fincastle county, the place of general rendezvous." And, on the 6th day of August, 1776, the Virginia Council directed the keeper of the magazine to forward to Colonel William Christian 1,000 pounds of powder, two flints to be used on this expedition. It required some time to organize and equip the forces intended to proceed against the Cherokee Indians, which work was carried on with the greatest possible expedition, until the first week in September. FINCASTLE COUNTY ORGANIZED UNDER THE STATE CONSTITUTION. The first county court of Fincastle county, under the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Virginia, assembled at the Lead Mines, (now in Wythe county), on September 3, 1776, at which time the following members of the county court and officers of Fincastle county qualified by taking the oath prescribed by an ordinance of the Virginia Convention, which oath was administered by James McGavock and Arthur Campbell. MEMBERS OF THE COUNTY COURT: William Preston, James McGavock, Arthur Campbell, John Montgomery, James McCorkle. Sheriff, William Preston, appointed by the court. Deputy Sheriff, William Sayers, Deputy Clerk, Stephen Trigg, County-Lieutenant, William Preston. Attorney-at-Law, Harry Innes. But little business of importance was transacted at this term of the court, so far as the records that have been preserved show. Thus began the first organized government under the Constitution of Virginia, in Fincastle county. In the month of September, 1776, that portion of the troops under the command of Colonel William Russell began their march to the Great Island of the Holston, at which time Anthony Bledsoe entered two wagons in the public service, to convey the baggage and provision of the troops. This circumstance is mentioned, for the reason that this was the first time, as far as can be ascertained, that a wagon was taken by the white man, as low down as the Long Island in Holston. When Colonel Russell reached the Long Island, he thought it necessary to erect a fort in a field on the land of John Latham, on Long Island, which fort was speedily erected and every preparation made for the coming of the troops under command of Colonel Christian. A company of militia was enrolled at Black's Fort (now Abingdon), and taken into the pay of the government, to guard the new fort, called Fort Patrick Henry, at Long Island, and to guard the provision and baggage wagons going to and returning from that fort. By the first day of October, Colonel Christian, with his entire army of 2,000 men, including about 400 men from North Carolina under command of Colonel Joseph Williams, Colonel Love and Major Winston, arrived at Long Island. When the army had proceeded about six miles beyond Long Island, Colonel Christian halted his army and offered a reward of one hundred pounds to any person or persons who would proceed to the Cherokee towns and bring him a prisoner, in order to obtain intelligence of the motions of the enemy; whereupon, Samuel Ewing, John Blankenship and James McCall undertook the business, and in a few days entered the town of Toquo, after crossing the Tennessee river, where they met an Indian man on horseback, whom they permitted to escape, lest it might occasion a discovery. They next visited the house of a king's man by the name of Lowry, where they were refused admittance. They then proceeded to the house of one Davis, from whom they obtained intelligence of the designs of the enemy, when they returned to the army and gave a true account of the situation of affairs in the Indian country, according to their information, and they were paid by the General Assembly of Virginia the one hundred pounds, pursuant to the agreement of Colonel Christian. Upon the receipt of this information, Colonel Christian and his army proceeded, in a very cautious manner, on their march to the Tennessee, always encamping, at night, behind breastworks, to prevent a surprise. Colonel John Sevier commanded, upon this expedition, a company of horse, the rest of the army being infantry. Sixteen spies were sent in advance of the army to the crossing of the French Broad river, a point where the Indians said the white men should never cross. After being several days out, Alexander Harlin came into camp and told Colonel Christian that 3,000 Indian warriors were awaiting his arrival at the crossing of the French Broad. Colonel Christian permitted him to go through the camp and to observe the strength of his army, when he was dismissed by Colonel Christian, with direction to inform the Indians of his determination to cross, not only the French Broad, but the Tennessee river, before he returned. The army continued its march through the wilderness, under direction of Isaac Thomas, the noted Indian trader and friend of Nancy Ward, as pilot. When they approached the crossing of the French Broad river, a king's man by the name of Fallin approached the camp with a flag of truce, to which Colonel Christian paid no attention, permitting Fallin to pass through the camp unmolested, that he might observe the strength of Christian's army. It is said that the Indians had gathered on the opposite side of this crossing determined to defend its passage to the last extremity, when a white man by the name of Starr, in the absence of Fallin, persuaded the Indians that it was folly to resist the invasion of the whites. In an earnest harangue, he told them it was folly to contend with the white man. That the Great Spirit intended he should overrun and occupy all the low lands which should be cultivated. To the red man he had given the hills and forests, where he might subsist on game without tilling the soil, which was work fit only for women. To struggle with the white man was, therefore, to fight with destiny. The only safety for the Indians lay in a speedy retreat to their mountain fastnesses."* * Rear Guard of the Revolution, p. 126. From some cause the Indians disbanded and dispersed without offering any resistance to the white men. Colonel Christian and his army crossed the river and pressed rapidly forward to the Cherokee towns along the Little Tennessee and Telico, every one of which was destroyed, except Chota, the home of Nancy Ward, the beloved woman of the Indian tribe and the friend of the white man; and Colonel Christian destroyed all grain, cattle and other provisions found in the nation. When Colonel Christian had destroyed the towns and property of the Indians and had chastised them as far as it was possible to do so, he sent out a number of men with flags of truce, and requested a talk with the Chiefs. A number of them came in immediately and proposed peace. Colonel Christian told them he was willing to grant them peace, but not until the tribe was fully represented, and, thereupon, Colonel Christian fixed a day for the concluding of peace in the following May, at Long Island in Holston river, and, in the meantime, hostilities were to cease except as to two towns on the Tennessee river, where young Moore, who had been captured at Watauga, had been burned at the stake; which proposition was accepted. Colonel John Sevier, thereupon, visited the towns in question and left the same in ashes. Colonel Christian finding nothing further to engage his attention, returned with his army to the Long Island in Holston river. This campaign lasted three months, and but a single white man was killed. This was a man whose name was Duncan, a soldier under Captain Jacob Womack. He was killed in an engagement with the Indians. This man left a wife (she was a cripple), and five small children, to whom the General Assembly of Virginia, on June 16, 1777, allowed the sum of twenty pounds for their present relief and the further sum of five pounds per annum, for the period of five years, with directions to Anthony Bledsoe and William Cocke, to lay out and expend the same for the support and maintenance of Elizabeth Duncan and her children. Several white men were slightly wounded by the Indians and by accident, upon this expedition, among the number being Samuel Douglas, Thomas Berry and George Berry, Jr. Upon the return of the army to the Long Island of the Holston, Colonel Christian reorganized the same, and, for the protection of the frontiers, left six hundred men at the island under the command of Colonel Evan Shelby and Major Anthony Bledsoe. The General Assembly of Virginia directed the Governor and Council to take such measures for the preservation and disposition of the horses and provision belonging to the government and in use upon this expedition as should appear to be most proper and conducive to the interest of the country. And, by the same act, the Governor and Council were directed to give instructions to the commanding officer of the army destined against the Cherokees, to take such steps, at the end of the campaign, as were thought necessary for the future safety and protection of the southwestern frontier of this State. Whereupon the Governor and Council of Virginia directed Captain Thomas Madison to take the necessary steps to collect all the cattle and horses on hand upon the return of the army from this expedition, and to take care of them, whereupon Captain Madison employed: William Carmack, Stephen Richards, John Fulkerson, Andrew Greer, John Nash, Peter Looney, John Cox, Jonathan Drake, Henry Hickey, Hugh Blair, John Delaney, Matthew Dean, Cornelius Carmack, Joseph Greer, Samuel Looney, William McBroom, John Carmack, Ezekiel Smith, Isaac Drake, Benjamin Drake, to herd and take care of the country cattle, from the 13th day of November, 1776, to the 11th day of June, 1777. And Colonel Christian, pursuant to the directions of the Governor and Council, stationed the six hundred men as above detailed at Long Island, and directed Captain Joseph Martin to proceed to the Rye Cove Fort, about fifty miles from North Fork of the Clinch river, with eighty men. The rest of the army were mustered out of service. Captain Martin immediately began the march to the Rye Cove. Upon this march he had to pass through a very dangerous gap, called Little Moccasin, where the trail went through a very narrow and deep gorge of the mountain and where the Indians had killed a great many white people. When Captain Martin began the march through the gap, he had his men in fine order and strung out in single file. Just as the head of the column emerged from the narrow defile, the whole column was fired upon by Indians from the top of the ridge, where they were strung out in a line as long as Captain Martin's. As soon as the Indians fired, they ran off, having failed to kill any of Martin's men But one man, James Bunch, a member of Martin's company, had five balls shot through his flesh, whereby he was rendered incapable of getting a livelihood by labor, and was allowed by the General Assembly of Virginia thirty pounds for his present relief and half pay as a soldier for three years. The Indians having all fled, Captain Martin proceeded to Rye Cove, where he remained until the first of May, 1777, when he was ordered back to the Long Island, where he remained until the treaty of peace was concluded between the Indians and the whites on July the first. In December of the year 1776, the commanding officer at Fort Patrick Henry dispatched Samuel Newell and another person to the Cherokee town for the Indian chief, the Raven of Chote. Upon their return trip they were accompanied by the Indian chief. A short time thereafter, in the month of January, 1777, Samuel Newell was again ordered to the Indian town, Chote, with letters in regard to a family that had been murdered near Fort Patrick Henry. While on his way to the town of Toquo, he was tomahawked by the Indians and scalped, and soon thereafter died in the town of Chote. His horse, gun, saddle and bridle, saddle-bags and clothes were carried off by the Indians, who murdered him. A number of the citizens of Fincastle county petitioned the General Assembly of Virginia for compensation for pasturage taken and the provisions used by Colonel Christian upon this expedition, among the number so petitioning being Amos Eaton, James Kincannon David Getgood, John Beatie, William Sayers, Ephraim Dunlop, John Latham, Evan Shelby, Abel Richardson, James McGavock, James Aylett, Robert Barnett, William Cocke, The General Assembly of Virginia at its fall session in 1776, allowed Isaac Thomas, the faithful friend of the white settlers, one hundred pounds as a reward for the services he had rendered the settlers by giving them information of the intended incursions of the Indians, and paid him for the stock and property lost at the time of the outbreak of the Indian war. The Governor and Council of Virginia directed that for the purpose of concluding a treaty of peace between the Indians and the Commonwealth of Virginia a convention should be held at the Long Island of Holston, in the month of May, 1777, and appointed Colonel William Christian, Colonel William Preston and Major Evan Shelby to act as the Virginia commissioners at said convention. The Governor and Council of North Carolina appointed Waightstill Avery, Joseph Winston and Robert Lanier, commissioners upon the part of North Carolina at said convention. The commissioners of the two States met the Indian chiefs, who had been assembled through the efforts of Nathaniel Gist, at the Long Island in May, 1777, and drafted a treaty, which treaty was submitted to the Governor and Council of Virginia on May 28, 1777, at which time the Council entered the following orders: "Having referred to the Governor of this board to direct a treaty begun with the Cherokee Indians in such manner as they think best, "Resolved, That the Governor be desired to confer with the Cherokee chiefs and warriors, from time to time during their said meeting, on the subject of all disputes now subsisting between them and this State, and in regard to the treaty of peace now under consideration, and if he receive any proposals to make a good and proper answer to them, preparatory to completion, the conference to be held at the Great Island on two days next month, and this board will attend at such conference as may be appointed, and that Dr. Walker and Colonel Christian be desired to provide from the public store, or, in their place, proper presents to be made to the Indians now here and consider what is necessary to provide for the Indians at the next meeting at the Great Island. "Adjourned at 10 o'clock. "John Page, "Dudley Diggs, "John Blair, Tho. Walker, Nathaniel Harrison, David Jamison, "Bartho Dandridge. "Colonel William Christian, one of the commissioners appointed on behalf of this State to form a treaty of peace with the Cherokee Indians, having attended this board with the proceedings of himself and the other commissioners at a treaty held at the Great Island, in consequence of their former instructions, upon considering the same the board entirely approved thereof, and think it necessary that the same should be laid before the General Assembly, which the Governor is desired to do, and Colonel William Christian having also informed the board that several of the chiefs and warriors of said nation of Indians will accompany him to Williamsburg, resolved that they be received and treated in the most friendly manner and furnished with all necessaries until the General Assembly shall give further directions in the matter." This treaty was not concluded until the first day of July, 1777. By this treaty a new boundary line was established between the settlers and the Indians. The boundaries as fixed by this treaty extended as far down as the mouth of Cloud's creek. This treaty was signed by all the Indian chiefs except Dragging Canoe, who was wounded at the battle of Long Island Flats. He said "that he would hold fast to the talks of Cameron the British agent and continue the war as before." While the treaty was being negotiated two men were murdered on the Clinch river by Dragging Canoe and some of his men, and conduct of this character was continued for many years on the part of Dragging Canoe and the Chickamauga Indians. While this treaty was being negotiated a great many Indians, with their squaws and children, had collected and were quartered in the island, surrounded by a guard to prevent improper intercourse with the whites, but, notwithstanding this precaution, some abandoned fellow shot across the river and killed an Indian. This produced great confusion; the Indians thought they were betrayed and prepared to fly, and it was with much exertion that the officers and commissioners pacified and convinced them that such was not the fact. Afterwards, when the Council met, the Raven opened the conference on the part of his people by a speech in which he reverted to the case of the murdered Indian. He said, "lest that unhappy affair should disturb the harmony and sincerity that ought to exist at that time between the white and red brethren, each party ought to view it as having happened so long ago, that if, when the Indian was buried, an acorn had been thrown into his grave, it would have sprouted and grown and become a lofty spreading oak, sufficiently large for them to sit under its shade and hold their talk. This speech was thought by many to be equal to anything in the celebrated speech of Logan. From the fall of 1775 to the close of the Revolutionary war, the settlers in this part of Virginia were compelled to occupy their forts from early spring until late in the fall, as their settlements were constantly visited by bands of Cherokee and Shawnese Indians sent upon them by the British agents, but the settlements enjoyed perfect freedom from the Indians from the first appearance of winter until the return of spring. During this interval of time the Indians were deterred from making raids into the settlements, by the great danger of detection in consequence of the nakedness of the trees, by the danger of being traced by their tracks in the snow, and by the suffering produced by exposure to cold while traveling and lying in wait. The settlers took advantage of this immunity from attacks by the Indians, cleared their lands, built their houses and made every possible preparation for their crops during the coming season. During the summer of 1776, elections were held throughout the Commonwealth for members of the House of Delegates and the Senate under the new Constitution. At this election the following persons were elected members of the House of Delegates from Fincastle county: Arthur Campbell and William Russell. And the member of the Senate from Botetourt and Fincastle, that being the Tenth Senatorial District, was Colonel William Christian. By an ordinance of the convention of 1775, adopted July 15, 1775, the Western District of Virginia, of which Fincastle county was a part, was required to furnish sixty-eight expert riflemen for the regular service. And by an Act of the Assembly of Virginia adopted in October, 1776, a requisition of seventy-four men was made upon the authorities of Fincastle county to be officered by a captain appointed by the Governor. A First Lieutenant, A Second Lieutenant, and an Ensign. The officers of the company organized in Fincastle county for the continental service in the year 1776 cannot be ascertained, save in one instance. John Buchanan was lieutenant of this company at its organization, and was a lieutenant in the Seventh Regiment in the fall of the same year, and remained in the service until killed in the year 1777. At a meeting of the General Assembly of Virginia, in the fall of the year 1776, a petition from the inhabitants of the western parts of Fincastle county was presented to the House and read; setting forth that they became adventurers in that part of the county in the year 1774, and were obliged by the incursions of the Indians to abandon their settlements, after having discovered and explored the country; that others afterwards became adventurers and claimed the lands by warrants from Lord Dunmore, under the royal proclamation of 1763, and a company of men from North Carolina purchased, or pretended to purchase, from the Cherokee Indians, all the lands from the southernmost waters of Cumberland river to the banks of the Louisa river, including the lands in Powell's Valley, by virtue of which purchase they styled themselves the absolute proprietors of the new independent Transylvania; that officers, both civil and military, are appointed, writs of election issued, assemblies convened, a land office opened, and lands sold at an exorbitant price, and a system of policy introduced, not agreeing with that lately adopted by the late United Colonies, and that they have the greatest reason to question the validity of the purchase aforesaid; that they consider themselves and the said lands to be in the State of Virginia, whose legislature they acknowledge, and to which State they conceive they justly belong; that having assembled together after due notice, they elected two members to represent them in this House, and hope they may be received as their delegates; that they are ready and willing, to the utmost of their abilities, to assist in the support of the present laudable cause, by contributing their quota of men and moneys, and that in order to preserve good order, they had, as was done in West Augusta, elected a committee consisting of twenty-one members, and cheerfully submitted the case to the House. This petition of the inhabitants of that part of Fincastle county, now included within the State of Kentucky, was accompanied by petitions from nearly all the settlers on the Holston and Clinch rivers, and was presented to the General Assembly on the eighth day of October, 1776, and the General Assembly on Friday, October 11, 1776, adopted the following resolutions: "Resolved, That the inhabitants of the western part of Fincastle county not being allowed by the law a distinct representation in the General Assembly, the delegates chosen to represent them in this House cannot be admitted. At the same time the committee are of opinion, that the said inhabitants ought to be formed into a distinct county, in order to entitle them to such representation and other benefits of government." The petition for the division of Fincastle county was referred to a committee of which Carter Braxton was chairman, which committee, through its chairman, on Tuesday, October 15, 1776, presented a bill for the division of the county of Fincastle into two distinct counties, which bill was read the first time and ordered to be read the second time. On Wednesday, October 16, 1776, this bill was read a second time and was committed to Thomas Jefferson and the members from Augusta and Botetourt counties, and on October 17, 1776, Mr. Jefferson, from the committee to whom the bill for dividing the county of Fincastle into two distinct counties was committed, reported that the committee had gone through the bill and made several amendments thereto, which he read in his place, and afterwards delivered in at the clerk's table, where the same was again twice read and agreed to and ordered to be engrossed and read a third time. And, on Wednesday, October 30, 1776, this bill was ordered to be committed to Mr. Jefferson, Mr. Simms, Mr. Bullitt and the members from Fincastle, Augusta and Botetourt counties, and on November 19, 1776, Mr. Mason and the members from Frederick, Hampshire and Bedford counties were added to the committee, to whom the bill for dividing the county of Fincastle into two distinct counties was committed. And on Monday, November 26, 1776, the bill for dividing the county of Fincastle into three distinct counties was read a third time, and it was: "Resolved, That the said bill do pass, and that the title be, an Act for dividing the county of Fincastle into two distinct counties, and the parish of Botetourt into four distinct parishes, and Mr. Arthur Campbell was appointed to carry the same to the Senate for their concurrence. In the Senate, several amendments were proposed to the bill passed by the House, which amendments, being communicated to the House, were disagreed to, whereupon, the Senate communicated with the House, through Mr. Ellzey, as follows: "Mr. Speaker: "The Senate do insist on the amendments by them proposed to the bill entitled, An Act for Dividing the County of Fincastle into three distinct counties, and the parish of Botetourt into four distinct parishes. And upon the amendments being again read, it was, by the House of Delegates, "Resolved, That this House do recede from their disagreement to the said amendments proposed by the Senate, which action of the House having been communicated to the Senate, the Senate insisted on the amendments proposed to the bill by them, whereupon, the Virginia House of Delegates, on December 6, 1776, "Resolved, That this House do insist on the disagreement to said amendments, and that Mr. Campbell do acquaint the Senate therewith." Which resolution being communicated to the Senate, the Act for the dividing of the county of Fincastle into three distinct counties, and the parish of Botetourt into four distinct parishes, was adopted, the Senate having receded from the amendments proposed by them. This act provided that from and after the 31st day of December, 1776, the county of Fincastle shall be divided into three distinct counties, to be known by the names of Montgomery, Washington and Kentucky. Thus ends the history of Fincastle county, in so far as the history of that county forms a part of the history of Washington county.</field>

It was intended that this call should have been presented at a session of the Presbytery in the preceding April, but, for some cause, it was delayed until the following June. Having accepted this call, he removed his family to the Holston, and settled upon three hundred acres of land on the head waters of Wolf Hill creek, which he purchased from Dr. Thomas Walker for the consideration of thirty-three pounds, and which land was conveyed to him by Dr. Walker by a deed dated April 14, 1774. We hope our readers will indulge us if we pause at this place to remark that every acre of this three-hundred-acre tract of land is to-day, 129 years thereafter, in the possession of the direct lineal descendants of the Rev. Charles Cummings. A remarkable fact. As soon as he had settled his family on the Holston, he set about the performance of the duties pertaining to his station with all the energy and intelligence of which he was capable. He purchased from Dr. Thomas Walker, for five shillings, by estimation, fifty-five acres of land, which land was deeded by Dr. Walker "to the minister and congregation of the Sinking Spring Church and their successors for the time being on April 14, 1774. This tract of land was bounded as follows: Beginning at a red oak corner to Andrew Colvill, running thence E. 10 poles to a white oak, N. 20′, E. 126 poles to a hickory; thence N. 31′, W. 48 poles to a chestnut on a high ridge, S. 53′, W. 96 poles to a chestnut and a white oak on the side of said ridge, S. 35′, E. 46 poles to a large white oak, S. 40′, W. 28 poles to a black oak near Sinking Spring, S. 36′, E. 48 poles to a white oak; thence E. 12 poles to the beginning."* * Deed Book "A," page—, Fincastle county. A considerable part of northwest Abingdon is built upon this same tract of land. The first meeting house of the Sinking Spring congregation was erected on the first rise in the present cemetery in the rear of the Martin vault, and was a very large cabin of unhewn logs. It was from 80 to 100 feet long and about 40 feet wide, and had a very remarkable appearance. Governor David Campbell, in speaking of the men who signed this call, says: "In early life I knew personally many of those whose names are signed to it, and I knew nearly all of them from character." They were a most respectable body of men, were all Whigs in the revolution, and nearly all, probably every one of them, performed military service against the Indians, and a large portion of them against the British in the battles of King's Mountain, Guilford Courthouse, and other actions in North and South Carolina. Such was the character of the first men who inhabited our county and worshipped in this, the first place of worship, on all the waters of the Holston and Clinch. Daniel Boone again visited the waters of the Holston in the fall of this year. The Boones and five other families set out from their homes on the Yadkin river, N. C., on September 25, 1773. They passed through Washington county and on into Powell's Valley (on their way to Kentucky), where they were joined by William Bryan, with forty other people. While this body of emigrants were leisurely traveling through Powell's Valley a small company, under James Boone, Daniel Boone's eldest son, left the main body and went to the home of William Russell to secure provisions, and on the 9th of October James Boone and his company, among the number being Russell's son Henry and two slaves, encamped a few miles in the rear of the main body. At this point they were, the next day, waylaid by a small company of Shawnese and Cherokee Indians, who were supposed to be at peace with the white settlers. On the morning of the 10th James Boone and his entire company were captured, and, after cruel torture, were slaughtered. After this occurrence Daniel Boone's company of emigrants broke up and returned to the settlements, and Daniel Boone and his family returned to the home of William Russell, near Castle's Woods, on Clinch river, about forty miles distant, and took up their residence in an empty cabin on the farm of Captain David Glass, seven or eight miles from William Russell's, where they spent the winter of 1773-1774. Daniel Boone had twice, previously to this time, visited the Kentucky wilderness, and had decided to settle in the beautiful country which he had visited. And thus rudely were his first efforts frustrated. The motive actuating the Indians in making this assault must have been jealousy of these, the first emigrants to Kentucky. They could not have had for their object the securing of plunder alone, for the Indians had long lived in peace with the white settlers without any effort to murder or burn. In this assault six men, including Boone's son, were slain, and their cattle and plunder secured and carried off. We have now reached the time when the eyes of all frontiersmen were fixed upon the fertile lands lying beyond the Cumberland mountains. The Kentucky wilderness was no longer visited by the hunter alone, but the explorer and the settler were seeking an opportunity to acquire a future home in the new country. A distinguished author, in speaking of the condition of the Indians at that time, says: "Recently they had been seriously alarmed by the tendency of the whites to encroach on the great hunting grounds south of the Ohio, for here and there hunters and settlers were already beginning to build cabins along the course of that stream," and in another place the same author speaks as follows: "The savages grew continually more hostile, and in the fall of 1773 their attacks became so frequent that it was evident a general outbreak was at hand. Eleven people were murdered in the county of Fincastle alone. The Shawnese were the leaders in all these outrages. Thus the spring of 1774 opened with everything ripe for an explosion. The Virginia borderers were fearfully exasperated, and were ready to take vengeance upon any Indian, whether peaceful or hostile, while the Shawnese and Mingoes, on their side, were arrogant and overbearing, and yet alarmed at the continual advance of the whites."* * The Winning of the West, Vol. I., pages 250-252. The Virginia Colony was at peace with the Cherokees, and most of the Indians' depredations during the year 1774-1775 were committed by the northwest Indians. A Mr. Russell and five of his companions were murdered by the Indians in the fall of the year 1773 in Fincastle county, and about the same time two men, by the name of Cochran and Foley, and a man by the name of Hayes, with his three companions, were murdered by the Indians, but as to the locality of these murders or the circumstances attending them we have no information.† † Wm. Preston Mss. In the course of the summer of 1774, a number of the citizens of Fincastle county were captured and killed by the northern Indians, among the number being Thomas Hogg and two men near the mouth of the Great Kanawha, and Walter Kelly, with three or four other persons, below the falls of the Great Kanawha. William Kelly and a young woman were captured on Muddy creek, a branch of Green river. Kelly was killed and the young woman carried into captivity. During this same summer a man by the name of Shockley, a scout employed by the County Court of Fincastle county, was shot and killed, and on the 7th day of August, 1774, the house of one John Lybrook, situated on Sinking creek in the present county of Craig, was attacked by the Indians. Lybrook was wounded in the arm, and only saved his life by hiding in a cave. Three of his children (one of them a sucking infant), a young woman, a daughter of one Scott, and a child of widow Snidow were killed. All the children were scalped but one, and were mangled in a most cruel manner. At the same time and in the same community, John and Jacob Snidow and a younger brother, whose name is not known, were captured and made prisoners. Two of the brothers escaped from the Indians on the following Wednesday, but the other was carried into captivity and remained with the Indians until he acquired their habits and became so fond of their manner of life that he ever afterwards lived among them. At the same time a Miss Margaret McKinsie was captured and carried into captivity, where she remained for eighteen years, at the end of which time she returned to New river and married a Mr. Benjamin Hall. The white settlers near Pittsburg were on very bad terms with the northwest Indians. On the last day of April, 1774, a small company of Indians left the camp of the Indian Chief Logan, at Yellow creek, and crossed the river to visit a man by the name of Greathouse, a place which they had been accustomed to visit for the purpose of buying rum from the whites. The Indians were made drunk with liquor, and while in this condition were cruelly murdered by Greathouse and his associates. Nine Indians in all were murdered at this time; among the number being the entire family of the Indian Chief Logan. Logan had always been the friend of the white man, and had always been exceedingly kind and gentle to women and children, notwithstanding the fact that some of his relatives had been killed by the whites some years before. Logan was a skilled marksman and a mighty hunter of commanding dignity, who treated all men with a grave courtesy and exacted the same treatment in return. He was greatly liked and respected by all the white hunters and frontiersmen whose friendship and respect were worth having. They admired him for his dexterity and prowess, and they loved him for his straightforward honesty and his noble loyalty to his friends.* * Winning of the West, Vol. I., page 256. This last stroke was more than Logan could stand. He attributed his misfortune to Captain Cresap, and he began at once to raid the settlements with small bands of Indians. This raid was upon the settlers of the Holston and the Clinch. On his first expedition he took thirteen scalps, six of the number being children. He was pursued and overtaken by a party of men commanded by a man by the name of McClure, but he ambushed and defeated them on McClure's creek, now in Dickenson county, and it was from this occurrence that the creek obtained its name. Again, during the same year, he visited the waters of Holston, within twelve miles of the present location of Bristol, and captured and murdered many families. At the house of one Roberts, whose family was cut off, Logan left a war-club, to which was tied a note, which read as follows: "Captain Cresap,—What did you kill my people on Yellow creek for? The white people killed my kin at Conestoga a great while ago, and I thought nothing of that. But you killed my kin again on Yellow creek, and took my cousin prisoner. Then I thought I must kill, too, and I have been three times to war since; but the Indians are not angry, only myself. July 21, 1774. "Captain John Logan."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Williamsburg, Va., November 10th. The following letter is just received from the camp on Point Pleasant, at the mouth of the Great Kenhawa (as then spelled), dated October 17, 1774: "The following is a true statement of a battle fought at this place on the 10th instant: On Monday morning about half an hour before sunrise, two of Captain Russell's company discovered a large party of Indians about a mile from the camp, one of which men was shot by the Indians; the other made his escape and brought in the intelligence. In two or three minutes after, two of Captain Shelby's men came in and confirmed the account. "Colonel Andrew Lewis, being informed thereof, immediately ordered out Colonel Charles Lewis, to take command of one hundred and fifty of the Augusta troops, and with him went Captain Dickinson, Captain Harrison, Captain Wilson, Captain John Lewis, of Augusta, and Captain Lockridge, which made the first division. Colonel Fleming was then ordered to take command of one hundred and fifty men of the Botetourt, Bedford, and Fincastle troops, viz., Captain Thomas Buford, from Bedford; Captain Love, of Botetourt; Captain Shelby and Captain Russell, of Fincastle, which made the second division. "Colonel Charles Lewis's division marched to the right some distance from the Ohio, and Colonel Fleming with his division, on the bank of the Ohio to the left. "Colonel Charles Lewis's division had not marched quite half a mile from the camp when, about sunrise, an attack was made on the front of his division, in a most vigorous manner, by the united tribes of Indians, Shawnese, Delawares, Mingoes, Tawas, and of several other nations—in number not less than eight hundred, and by many thought to be one thousand. "In this heavy attack, Colonel Charles Lewis received a wound, which, in a few hours caused his death, and several of his men fell on the spot; in fact, the Augusta division was obliged to give way to the heavy fire of the enemy. In about a second of a minute after the attack on Colonel Lewis's division, the enemy engaged the front of Colonel Fleming's division on the Ohio, and in a short time the Colonel received two balls through his left arm and one through his breast, and, after animating the officers and soldiers, in a most calm manner, to the pursuit of victory, retired to the camp. "The loss in the field was sensibly felt by the officers in particular; but the Augusta troops being shortly after reinforced from the camp by Colonel Field, with his company, together with Captain McDowell, Captain Matthews, and Captain Stewart, from Augusta; Captain Paulin, Captain Arbuckle and Captain McClanahan, from Botetourt, the enemy no longer able to maintain their ground, were forced to give way till they were in a line with the troops, Colonel Fleming being left in the action on the Ohio. "In this precipitate retreat Colonel Fleming was killed. During this time, which was till after twelve, the action in a small degree abated, but continued, except at short intervals, sharp enough till after one o'clock. Their long retreat gave them a most advantageous spot of ground, from which it appeared to the officers so difficult to dislodge them that it was thought most advisable to stand as the line was then formed, which was about a mile and a quarter in length, and had sustained till then a constant and equal weight of the action, from wing to wing. "It was till about half an hour of sunset they continued firing on us scattered shots, which we returned to their disadvantage. At length the night coming on they found a safe retreat. "They had not the satisfaction of carrying off any of our men's scalps, save those of one or two stragglers they killed before the engagement. Many of their dead they scalped, rather than we should have them, but our troops scalped upwards of twenty of their men that were first killed. "It is beyond doubt their loss, in number, far exceeded ours, which is considerable. "The return of the killed and wounded in the above battle, same as our last, is as follows: "Killed—Colonels Charles Lewis and John Fields, Captains John Murray, R. McClanahan, Samuel Wilson, James Ward, Lieutenant Hugh Allen, Ensigns Cantiff and Bracken, and forty-four privates. Total killed, fifty-three. "Wounded—Colonel William Fleming, Captains John Dickinson, Thomas Buford, and I. Skidman, Lieutenants Goldman, Robinson, Lard and Vance, and seventy-nine privates. Total wounded, eighty-seven; killed and wounded, one hundred and forty."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"To be engraved on the Great Seal, Virtus, the genius of the Commonwealth, dressed like an Amazon, resting on a spear with one hand and holding a sword with the other hand and treading on Tyranny, represented by a man prostrate, a crown fallen from his head, a broken chain in his left hand and a scourge in his right. In the exergon the word "Virginia" over the head of Virtus, and underneath the words, "Sic semper tyrannis." On the reverse a groupe, Libertas, with her wand and pileus. On the other side of her Ceres, with the cornucopia in one hand and an ear of wheat in the other. On the other side Eternitas, with globe and phœnix. In the exergon these words: Deus Nobis Hæc Otia Fecit." This declaration of the Virginia convention is said to have been the first declaration of independence recorded in the world's history. The American people, until this time, had not seriously contemplated a complete separation from England, but now that the British Parliament had refused to listen to their petition and was waging an active war against them, Richard Henry Lee, a representative from Virginia in the Continental Congress at Philadelphia, in the month of May, gave notice that on a day named he would move the Congress to adopt a Declaration of Independence. Early in this same month the Continental Congress had adopted a resolution for the purpose of ascertaining the sentiment of the American colonies on the subject of the independence of America. The motion of Mr. Lee was postponed from day to day, until the first day of July, two days after the adoption of the Virginia Constitution and Bill of Rights, when the Continental Congress resolved itself into a committee of the whole, and began the consideration of the report of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and R. R. Livingston, the committee who had been appointed on the 11th of June to prepare a Declaration of Independence. It is worthy of note that this committee, when appointed, agreed that each member should draw up a Declaration of Independence according to his own ideas, with the understanding that the one that best conformed to the wishes of the committee as a whole should be adopted as the report of the committee. It is stated that Mr. Jefferson's Declaration, being the first read, was unanimously adopted by the committee without debate, the other members refusing to submit their papers for consideration. The Continental Congress, after three days of heated discussion, adopted the report of the committee, which report has since been known as the Declaration of Independence, and is as follows: When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to such separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its power in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, would dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed; but when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies, and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these States. To prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operations till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the rights of representation in the legislature—a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly for opposing, with manly firmness, his invasion of the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise, the State remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without and convulsions within. He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners, refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands. He has obstructed the administration of justice by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers. He has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers, to harrass our people and eat out their substance. He has kept among us in times of peace standing armies without the consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws, giving his assent to their pretended acts of legislation. For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us, For protecting them by a mock trial, from punishment, for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these States, For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world, For imposing taxes on us without our consent, For depriving us in many cases of the benefit of trial by jury, For transporting us beyond seas, to be tried for pretended offences, For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring Province, establishing therein an arbitrary government and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies, For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws and altering fundamentally the powers of our governments. For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislature for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is, at this time, transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries, to complete the work of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on the high seas, to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands. He has excited domestick insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every stage of these oppressions, we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms; our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time, of attempts, made by their Legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us; we have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here; we have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity; and we have conjured them, by the ties of our common kindred, to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They, too, have been deaf to the voice of justice and consanguinity. We must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends. We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America in General Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority of the good people of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown; and that all political connections between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that, as free and independent States, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce and to do all other acts and things which independent States may of right do. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor. It has been said that this Declaration of Independence was the most sublime exhibition that man has ever made to man. The members composing the Congress were, in their intelligence and patriotism, the giants of our race, and the object of that Congress was the protection of our race. This Declaration of Independence was proclaimed at Philadelphia on the 8th day of July, 1776, and on the 9th it was read to each brigade of the Continental army. This declaration was received by the people at all points with the greatest enthusiasm. A part of the policy adopted by the British Ministry for the reduction of the American Colonies was the enlisting of the Indians in the service of the British Government. We have now reached that point where the history of Southwest Virginia is closely connected with the operations of the Indians in behalf of the British Government. Numerous agents of the Royal Government were sent to the different Indian tribes living along the waters of the western frontiers, and they were so far successful in their efforts to incite the Indian tribes to war, that, by the spring of 1776, the Creeks, Cherokees, Choctaws and Chickasaws were induced to take up arms in behalf of their British allies. The Cherokee Indians, who were the nearest and most accessible tribe to the white settlers, were more numerous than most of the other Indian tribes, and they were the first to take up arms at the instance of the British agents. If the British government had any friends among the backwoodsmen of Fincastle county, this action was of such a character as to alienate the affection and respect of every respectable man. In speaking of the success of the British agents in this matter, a distinguished author has said: "Their success and the constant ravages of the Indians maddened the American frontiersmen upon whom the blow fell, and changed their resentment against the British king into a deadly and lasting hatred, which their sons and grandsons inherited. Indian warfare was of such peculiar atrocity that the employment of Indians as allies forbade any further hope of reconciliation. They saw their homes destroyed, their wives outraged, their children captured, their friends butchered and tortured wholesale by Indians armed with British weapons, bribed by British gold and obeying the orders of British agents and commanders."* * Winning of the West, Part II., p. 76. About this time Colonel Arthur Campbell, of Fincastle county, in writing of this action of the British Government, in arming the Indian tribes, expressed himself as follows: "This infernal malignity of a professed Christian prince was reserved to be exhibited to the world in the reign of George III." Alexander Cameron, the British agent among the Cherokee Indians, lost no time in calling together the chiefs and warriors of this tribe of Indians, to inform them of the wishes of his government. When Cameron disclosed to the Indians his plans, they were greatly astonished, and would not, for some time, believe the statement of Cameron, that one part of the white people wished to wage war against their brothers, for a civil war was unknown between Indians speaking the same language, but he finally succeeded in enlisting the Indians by promising them presents in clothing and by telling them that they could plunder and rob the settlers, and by inducing them to believe that all the lands on the western waters would be reserved to them by the British government as their hunting grounds. This tribe of Indians had been acting for some time in a manner that clearly indicated that they were determined upon hostilities. In the spring of 1775, Andrew Greer, had gone to the Cherokee towns to purchase furs. While there, he had observed the conduct of two white traders, and was convinced that they intended to do him some injury, if possible. When he started from the Indian towns for his home, he left the main trading path and came up the Nolichucky trace and escaped injury, but, at the same time, two men by the name of Boyd and Doggett, who had been sent to the Indian towns by the Virginia authorities, were met on the trace that Greer had left, at Boyd's creek, by Indians, and were killed by them and their bodies hidden. The Virginia settlement had long been at peace with the Indians, but they were sufficiently acquainted with their character to know, that, having once tasted blood, their disposition was to indulge to excess, and now they knew they must prepare for a long and bloody war with a tribe of Indians that exceeded them in numbers. They at once proceeded to put their frontier settlements in a defensive attitude. A fort was built at Watauga, to which was given the name of Fort Lee, the old fort* * Fort Robinson. at Long Island was repaired and called Fort Patrick Henry. Another fort was erected about seven miles east from Long Island, at Amos Eaton's, on the trace leading to Fort Chiswell. A fort was erected shortly before this time at Rye Cove, about fifty miles from the North Fork of Clinch, by a man by the name of Isaac Crismen, who was, afterwards, with two members of his family, murdered by the Indians. Information of the invasion intended by the Indians was forwarded to the Committee of Safety of Fincastle county by Isaac Thomas, an Indian trader, at the instance of Nancy Ward, a noted Indian woman and a relative of several of the principal chiefs. The frontier settlement, at this day, was in Carter's Valley, the settlers obtaining their supplies from the settlement at Wolf Hill (now Abingdon). The action of the Virginia Committee of Safety, requiring a test oath of all the citizens of the Commonwealth, had driven many sympathizers of the British Government to this settlement in Carter's Valley, where they hoped to escape the consequences of their refusal to subscribe to the oath, but information of their presence was obtained by John Carter, a Virginian, who communicated the information he had obtained to the settlers near Wolf Hill. These settlers were great Whigs, and, upon receiving this information, a number of them assembled and went to Brown's settlement in Carter's Valley, and after having assembled the people, John Coulter, a member of the county court of this county, administered to them an oath to be faithful to the common cause. Early in May, the settlers in Carter's Valley and all the families below the North Fork of the Holston, in view of the threatened Indian invasion, left their homes and returned to the settlements. To add to the alarm of the frontier settlers, a letter was delivered at the house of Charles Robertson, on the 18th day of May, 1776, under circumstances that were exceedingly suspicious; which letter accompanied by the affidavit of Nathan Reed, was as follows: "Wattaga. . . . . . . This day, Nathan Reed came before me, one of the justices of Wattaga, and made oath on the Holy Evangelists of Almighty God, that a stranger came up to Charles Robertson's gate yesterday evening—who he was he did not know—and delivered a letter of which this is a true copy. Sworn before me the 19th of May, 1776. Attest, James Smith. John Carter."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gentlemen:— Some time ago, Mr. Cameron and myself wrote you a letter by Mr. Thomas, and enclosed a talk we had with the Indians respecting the purchase which is reported you lately made of them on the rivers Wattaga, Nolichucky. We are since informed that you are under great apprenhension of the Indians doing mischief immediately. But it is not the desire of his Majesty to set his friends and allies, the Indians, on his liege subjects: therefore whoever you are, that are willing to join his Majesty's forces as soon as they arrive at the Cherokee nation, by repairing to the King's standard, shall find protection for themselves and their families and be free from all danger whatever; yet, that his Majesty's officers may be certain which of you are willing to take up arms in his Majesty's just right, I have thought fit to recommend it to you and every one that is desirous of preventing inevitable ruin to themselves and families, immediately to subscribe a written paper acknowledging their allegiance to his Majesty King George, and that they are ready and willing, whenever called on, to appear in arms in defence of the British right in America; which paper, as soon as it is signed and sent to me safe by hand, should any of the inhabitants be desirous of knowing how they are to be free from every kind of insult and danger, inform them that his Majesty will immediately land an army in West Florida, march them through the Creek to the Chickasaw nation, where five hundred warriors from each nation are to join them, and then come by Chota, who have promised their assistance, and then to take possession of the frontiers of North Carolina and Virginia, at the same time that his Majesty's forces make a diversion on the sea coast of those Provinces. If any of the inhabitants have any beef, cattle, flour, pork or horses to spare, they shall have a good price for them by applying to us, as soon as his Majesty's troops are embodied. I am yours, &amp;c., "Henry Stuart."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Fincastle, ss.— The deposition of Jarret Williams taken before me, Anthony Bledsoe, a justice of the peace for the county aforesaid, being first sworn on the Holy Evangelists of Almighty God, deposeth and saith: That he left the Cherokee nation on Monday night, the 8th inst. (July); "That the part of the nation called the Over-Hills were then preparing to go to war against the frontiers of Virginia, having purchased to the amount of 1,000 skins or thereabouts, for mockasons. They were also beating flour for a march, and making other warlike preparations. Their number, from calculation made by the Raven Warrior, amounts to about six hundred warriors; and, according to the deponent's idea, he thinks we may expect a general attack any hour. They propose to take away negroes and horses, and to kill all kinds of sheep, cattle, &amp;c.; also to destroy all corn, burn houses, &amp;c. And he also heard that the Valley towns were, a part of them, set off; but that they had sent a runner to stop them till all were ready to start. He further relates that Alexander Cameron informed them that he had concluded to send Captain Nathaniel Guist, William Faulin, Isaac Williams and the deponent with the Indians, till they came near to Nolichucky, then the Indians were to stop and Guest and the other whites above mentioned were to go to see if there were any King's men among the inhabitants; and if they found any they were to take them off to the Indians or have a white signal in their hands, or otherwise to distinguish them. When this was done they were to fall on the inhabitants and kill and drive all they possibly could. "That on Saturday, the 6th inst., in the night, he heard two prisoners were brought in about midnight, but the deponent saw only one. That the within Williams saw only one scalp brought by a party of Indians, with a prisoner; but, from accounts, they had five scalps. He also says he heard the prisoner examined by Cameron, thought he gave a very imperfect account, being very much cast down. He further says that the Cherokees had received the war-belt from the Shawnese, Mingo, Taawah and Delaware nations, to strike the white people. That fifteen of the said nations were in the Cherokee towns, and that few of the Cherokees went in company with the Shawnese, &amp;c. That they all intended to strike the settlers in Kentucky; and that the Cherokees gave the Shawnese four scalps of white men, which they had carried away with them. The said Shawnese and Mingoes informed the Cherokees that they were then at peace with every other nation; that the French were to supply them with ammunition, and that they wanted the Cherokees to join them to strike the white people on the frontiers, which the Cherokees have agreed to. "And the deponent further saith that, before he left the nation, a number of the Cherokees of the Lower Towns were gone to fall on the frontiers of South Carolina and Georgia; and further saith not. Jarrett Williams."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Gentlemen,— Your letter of the 30th ult. with the deposition of Mr. Bryan, came to hand this evening by your messenger. The news is really alarming, with regard to the disposition of the Indians, who are doubtless advised to break with the white people, by the enemies to American liberty who reside among them. But I cannot conceive that you have anything to fear from the pretended invasion by British troops, by the route they mention. This must, in my opinion, be a scheme purposely calculated to intimidate the inhabitants, either to abandon their plantations or turn enemies to their country, neither of which I hope it will be able to effect. "Our Convention, on the 14th of May, ordered 500 pounds of gunpowder to each of the counties of Fincastle, Botetourt, Augusta, and West Augusta, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . , and double that quantity of lead. . . . . . . . . . . . They likewise ordered 100 men to be forthwith raised in Fincastle, to be stationed where our committee directs for the protection of the frontier. . . . . I sent the several letters and depositions you furnished me, from which it is reasonable to believe that when all these shall have been examined vigorous measures will be adopted for our protection. "I have already advertised our committee to meet at Fort Chiswell on Tuesday the 11th instant, and have directed the candidates for commissions in the new companies to exert themselves in engaging the number of men required until then. I much expect we shall have further news from Williamsburg by the time the committee meets. I have written to Colonel Calloway the second time for 200 pounds of lead, which I hope he will deliver the bearer. This reply will, I hope, be some relief to your distressed settlement, and, as I said before, should more be wanted I am convinced you may be supplied. I am fully convinced that the expense will be repaid you by the Convention of Virginia or North Carolina on a fair representation of the case being laid before them, whichsoever of them takes your settlement under protection, as there is not the least reason that any one part of the colony should be at any extraordinary expense in the defence of the whole, and you may be assured you cannot be overstocked with that necessary article, for should it please Providence that the impending storm should blow over, and there would be no occasion to use the ammunition in the general defense, then it might be sold out to individuals, and the expense of the whole be reimbursed to those who so generously contributed towards the purchase. "I am, with the most sincere wishes for the safety of your settlement, your most obedient and very humble servant, "Wm. Preston."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. WASHINGTON COUNTY, 1777-1786. The Act of the General, Assembly of Virginia dividing the county of Fincastle into three distinct counties, to-wit: Montgomery, Washington, and Kentucky, was adopted by the General Assembly of Virginia on the 6th day of December, 1776, and provided that from and after the last day of December, 1776, the said county of Fincastle should be divided into three counties. And this Act defines the bounds of Washington county as follows, viz.: "That all that part of said county of Fincastle included in the lines beginning at the Cumberland mountains where the line of Kentucky county intersects the North Carolina (now Tennessee) line; thence east along the said Carolina line to the top of Iron mountain; thence along the same easterly to the source of the South Fork of the Holston river; thence northwardly along the highest part of the highlands, ridges and mountains that divide the waters of the Tennessee from those of the Great Kanawha to the most easterly source of Clinch river; thence westwardly along the top of the mountain that divides the waters of the Clinch river from those of the Great Kanawha and Sandy Creek to the line of Kentucky county, and thence along the same to the beginning, shall be one other distinct county and called and known by the name of Washington.* * Hening statutes, 1776. "The eastern boundary of Washington county as thus defined was altered by Act of the General Assembly of Virginia at its session in the month of May, 1777, as follows: Beginning at a ford on Holston river, next above Captain John Campbell's, at the Royal Oak, and running from thence a due south course to the dividing line between the States of Virginia and North Carolina; and from the ford aforesaid to the westerly end of Morris' Knob, about three miles above Maiden Spring on Clinch, and from thence, by a line to be drawn due north, until it shall intersect the waters of the Great Sandy river." The Act establishing the county of Washington directed that the justices named in the commissions of the peace for the said county should meet at Black's Fort, in said county, on the last Tuesday in January, 1777, which day in each month was designated by said Act as County Court day, and a majority of the justices so commissioned were authorized to designate the place for holding said court and to elect a clerk for said court. The power to appoint the first sheriff of the county was vested in the Governor. The territory included within the county of Washington as thus established is now embraced in the following counties: Washington, Russell, Scott, Smyth, Tazewell, Lee, Buchanan, Dickenson, Wise, a territory sufficient in extent and wealth to constitute a great State. Governor Patrick Henry, on the 21st day of December, 1776, issued a commission of the peace and dedimus for Washington county appointing the following persons as justices of the peace for said county: Arthur Campbell, Evan Shelby, James Dysart, John Anderson, John Coulter, William Campbell, Daniel Smith, William Edmiston, Joseph Martin, John Campbell, Alexander Buchanan, John Kinkead, James Montgomery, John Snoddy, George Blackburn and Thomas Mastin, and on the same day he issued his commission appointing the following officers for the said county: Sheriff—James Dysart, County Lieutenant—Arthur Campbell, Colonel—Evan Shelby, Lieutenant-Colonel—William Campbell, Major—Daniel Smith. The first court of said county assembled at Black's Fort (now Abingdon) on the last Tuesday in January, 1777, being the 28th day of that month, pursuant to the Act of the Assembly establishing the county, on which day William Campbell and Joseph Martin, two of the justices commissioned by the Governor, administered the oath of a justice of the peace and of a justice of the County Court in Chancery to Arthur Campbell, the first justice named in said commission, and he afterwards administered the aforesaid oaths to: William Campbell, John Campbell, John Kinkead, James Montgomery, William Edmiston, Joseph Martin, John Anderson, John Snoddy, and George Blackburn. The court thus assembled, constituting a majority of the justices commissioned by the Governor, proceeded to the election of a clerk, when David Campbell was elected clerk. At the time Washington county was established by law Colonel Arthur Campbell and Colonel William Russell represented Fincastle county in the House of Delegates, and Colonel William Christian represented the district in the Senate of Virginia. Colonel Campbell and Colonel Russell resided in that portion of Fincastle county afterwards included in the bounds of Washington county. Colonel Russell and Colonel Christian had served with General Washington in the Continental Army, while Colonel Arthur Campbell had been a member of the Convention that adopted the Constitution establishing the Commonwealth of Virginia, which Convention elected General George Washington a member of the Continental Congress which assembled in Philadelphia in 1776. It is not definitely known who suggested the name of Washington for the new county; and while the question is in doubt, still it is reasonable to suppose that Colonel Arthur Campbell was the author of the idea, as it appears from the proceedings of the House of Delegates that he was designated by the House to convey the information to the Senate of Virginia that the House had passed the Act establishing the county. But without regard to who suggested the name for the new county it is a fact that this is the first locality in the United States that was honored with the name of the "Father of Our Country." The Act establishing the new county was agreed to by the General Assembly of Virginia on December 6, 1776, and the county government was organized on January 28, 1777. Tennessee and North Carolina historians insist that Washington county, Tennessee, was the first locality in the Union to receive the name of Washington, but, by an examination of the North Carolina records, it will be ascertained that Washington districts, North Carolina (now Tennessee), was not mentioned until April, 1777, and the county of Washington, North Carolina (now Tennessee), was not established by the General Assembly of North Carolina until November, 1777. Black's Fort, the locality of the meeting of the first court of Washington county, was erected in the year 1776 on the lands of Captain Joseph Black, on the west bank or near the west bank of what was then known as Eighteen Miles Creek, alias Castle's Creek, by the settlers living in the vicinity, and about five hundred other settlers who had fled from their homes west of Abingdon upon the outbreak of the Indian War in 1776. It was one of those rude structures which the pioneers were accustomed to make for defence against the Indians, consisting of a few log cabins surrounded by a stockade. The locality of this fort was about twenty-five yards south of the Norfolk and Western railroad, in the Knob road, and near the brick cottage, the property of Charles F. Palmer. In the fall of the year 1879, Captain Frank S. Findlay, while excavating for a place for a turbine wheel near this place, discovered a portion of an old wall constructed of rock and logs some five or six feet below the surface, and in the wall was found an arrow made from the heart of a white oak, with a sharp iron spike affixed. This wall was a part of the old fort, and it is not improbable that this arrow was sped there by an Indian. In the year 1796 a mill dam was erected about fifty yards south of this old wall.* * Black's Mill Dam. The first court of Washington county was in session two days, January 28th-29th. The first day of the term was occupied in qualifying the members of the court, the election of a clerk, the qualifications of militia officers, as above given, and the granting of letters of administration in several cases. Upon the second day of the term the first matter of importance that received the attention of the court was the appointment of William Campbell, William Edmiston, John Anderson and George Blackburn as commissioners to hire wagons to bring up the county salt allowed by the Governor and Council, and to receive and distribute the same agreeably to said order of Council. Some people, in speaking of this order of the County Court, have expressed surprise that such an order should have been entered by the court of a county in which was located great beds of salt, and, further, that the Governor and Council thus allotted salt to this county. At the time this order was entered salt was a rare article and exceedingly valuable, and was not known to exist in this country. So difficult was it to supply the demands for salt that in the year 1776 the General Assembly of Virginia enacted the following law: "Resolved that the Governor, with the advice of the Privy Council, be empowered to purchase, on account of the public and at a generous price, all the salt that may be imported into this country in the course of the next six months, and that he be authorized to issue his warrant on the treasurer to pay for the same: that such salt when purchased be immediately stored in some convenient and secure parts of the country, and distributed by order of the Governor, with the advice of the Council, amongst the inhabitants of the different counties, in such proportion as their exigencies and the quantity procured may admit, regard being principally had to such counties as are farthest removed from salt water; and that the receivers of the salt do pay into the hands of such persons as may be appointed for that purpose, at the time of the delivery, so much per bushel, as the Governor, with the advice of the Council, may judge reasonable; the money when received to be paid with all convenient dispatch into the treasury, for reimbursing the publick." It was pursuant to the order of the Governor and Council, acting upon the authority of this act, that the commissioners were appointed. On the second day the court proceeded to appoint a number of officers to take a list of tithables and of the quantity of taxable lands in the county. The following commissioners were appointed by the court to do this work in the localities mentioned, to-wit: Joseph Martin, on north side Clinch mountain, high as Glade Hollow. John Kinkead, Glade Hollow to head of Clinch. John Map of Washington County, Virginia 1870 Campbell, head of Holston to Stalnaker's direct across. William Edmiston, Stalnaker's to Black's Fort, direct across. James Montgomery, Black's Fort to Major Bledsoe's. John Anderson, from Major Bledsoe's as low as there are settlers. At the same time the court appointed the following constables: Rawley Duncan, from Castle's Woods to lowest settlement. James Wharton, Castle's Woods to Glade Hollow. James Laughlin, Glade Hollow, to upper settlement Elk Garden. William Lean, head of Holston to SevenMile Ford. Robert Brown, Seven-Mile Ford to Eleven-Mile Creek. Christopher Acklin, Eleven-Mile Creek to Ford of Beaver Creek. John Fain, Eleven-Mile Creek to Sinking Creek. James Steel, Ford Beaver Creek to Amos Eaton's. At the same time the following surveyors of roads were appointed: Alexander Wylie, from county line to Charles Hayes. John Hays, from Charles Hays' to Mill Creek. Jacob Anderson, from Mill Creek to Seven-Mile Ford. Aaron Lewis, Seven-Mile Ford to Big Spring. Andrew Kincannon from Big Spring to James Kincannon's. James Bryan, from James Kincannon' to Joseph Black's. Andrew Colvill, from Joseph Black's to Ford Beaver Creek. Benjamin Gray, Ford Beaver Creek to Steel's Creek. David Steel, from Steel's Creek to the meeting house. Amos Eaton, from meeting house to Fort Patrick Henry. Thomas Berry, Watauga Road, James Bryan's to James Montgomery's. William Young, Captain Montgomery's to Isaac Riddle's. Cox, Isaac Riddle's to Ford of Holston. The names as above given and the localities assigned to each are important in this, that they definitely indicate the established roads in the county at the beginning of our local government, and define, with reasonable certainty, the extent of the settlements at that time. Many readers will be surprised to know that the Virginia authorities appointed officials and exercised jurisdiction over the country (now Tennessee), as low down as Fort Patrick Henry, thirty miles below Bristol. The explanation is that our people supposed the Holston river to be the dividing line between the two States, Virginia and North Carolina. At this time and for several years thereafter, Virginia exercised jurisdiction, collected taxes and gave protection to the settlers as low down as Carter's Valley in Tennessee. On the second day of the court, Isaac Shelby, Robert Craig, John Dunkin and John Adair, were recommended to the Governor as proper persons to be added to the Commission of the Peace for the county, and they were commissioned accordingly. On the same day the court recommended to Edmund Randolph, Attorney for the Commonwealth, Ephraim Dunlop, as a proper person to act as Deputy Attorney for the Commonwealth in this county, and he was commissioned accordingly, and became the first practising attorney for the Commonwealth in this county. On the same day the court ordered that the house adjoining that which the court is held in, be a prison, and that the sheriff be empowered to employ some person to put it in the best repair he can." The statement has been made by a very worthy citizen of Washington county of former days,* * Charles B. Coale. "that the first court of this county assembled in a grove on the hillside south of Greenway's store, but in view of the above order of the court, this statement is inaccurate, as the court was held within the stockade of Black's Fort, and the house designated as a prison was within the same stockade. At the time in question, the courts of the country undertook to regulate the private affairs of the citizens to a much greater extent than at the present time, which can be accounted for by the fact that our people had just shaken off the heavy hand of monarchy and established, for the first time, constitutional government. As an example of the extent to which the private concerns of the people were then regulated by government, the court of this county, on the second day of its term, fixed the price of liquors as follows: Rum, 16s. per gallon; Rye whiskey, 8s.; corn whiskey, 4s.; a bowl of rum toddy, with loaf sugar, 2s., with brown sugar 1s. And at the March term, 1779, it fixed the price of a warm dinner at 15s.; cold dinner, 9s.; for a good breakfast, 12s.; oats or corn at 4s. per gallon; good lodging with clean sheets, 2s. Stabblidge, with hay or fodder, 2s., and good pasturage the same. After the transaction of considerable business, on the afternoon of the 29th day of January, 1777, the first court of the county adjourned, to court in course, which was the last Tuesday in February, being the 25th day of that month, on which day the court assembled at Black's Fort, with several members present. The first business of importance transacted was the qualification of Luke Bowyer to practice as an attorney in this court, and, thereupon, the court proceeded to the examination of Edward Bond, on suspicion of his having murdered Thomas Jones. The court heard the evidence and acquitted the prisoner. On the following day the court proceeded to the examination of the same Edward Bond, upon suspicion of his having stolen a small bay mare of the value of fifteen pounds, and upon a hearing of the evidence against him, he was held for trial at the General Court, at the capitol in the city of Williamsburg." The student of our early history must be impressed with this fact, that our forefathers would give to the prisoner charged with murder the benefit of every reasonable doubt, while, on the other hand, they would give the prisoner charged with horse-stealing, the maximum punishment prescribed by law, if there existed against him a strong suspicion. On the 26th day of February, 1777, the court proceeded to recommend to the Governor of Virginia the militia officers for Washington county, which officers were duly commissioned and were as follows: Captains: William Edmiston, Joseph Martin, James Montgomery, Aaron Lewis, Gilbert Christian, James Dysart, John Campbell, John Anderson, George Adams, Andrew Colvill, John Campbell, Royal Oak; John Shelby, Sr.; Robert Buchanan, Sr., John Duncan, James Shelby, Thomas Mastin, John Kinkead, William Bowen, Robert Craig, James Robertson, Watauga. Lieutenants of Militia: David Beattie, Samuel Hays, David Ward, Thomas Price, George Freeland, James Fulkerson, John Berry, Charles Campbell, James Maxwell, John Snoddy, John Coulter, Roger Topp, John Anderson, George Maxwell, William Blackburn, Andrew Kincannon, John Frazier, Alexander Wylie, Charles Allison, Joseph Black. Ensigns of Militia: Thomas Whitten, Solomon Litton, Abraham McClelland, John Loony, James Elliott, John Davis, John Wilson, James Shaw, James Crabtree, Robert Davis, Rees Bowen, Henry Dickenson, William Rosebrough, Josiah Ramsey, William Young, William Casey, John Lowry, William Neal, Arthur Bowen, Alexander Barnett. Colonel Arthur Campbell, immediately upon his qualification as county lieutenant of Washington county, proceeded to organize the militia of the county, and place the same upon such footing as they would be able to repel any attack that might be made upon the settlers on the frontiers, the most exposed part of which was in Carter's Valley and the Watauga settlement in the vicinity of Elizabethton, Tennessee. On the 31st day of March, 1777, he requested James Robertson, a captain in the militia of this county, residing at Watauga to furnish him with a list of the settlers at Watauga, that he might know their strength and give such orders as were necessary for their protection. Captain Robertson furnished the list, whereupon Colonel Campbell, in view of the danger in which the settlements stood, directed Robertson to assemble the settlers in one or two places, and he recommended Rice's and Patterson's Mills as the most proper ones. "Let your company be at Rice's," said he, "and Captain Gilbert Christian may come to Patterson's Mill." There was to have been a complete suspension of hostilities between the Cherokee Indians and the white settlers, from the return of Colonel Christian, in the fall of 1776, until the month of May, 1777, the time set for the negotiation of a treaty at Long Island. Notwithstanding the fact that the Indians had agreed to a suspension of hostilities, and that there were four hundred soldiers stationed at Long Island, under the command of Colonel Evan Shelby and Major Anthony Bledsoe, numerous hostilities were committed by the Indians. Several murders were committed on the frontiers, and on the 10th of April, 1777, James Calvatt was shot and scalped. The Indians who killed Calvatt were pursued by Captain James Robertson and nine men, who killed one Indian and retook ten horses, but, upon his return from the pursuit of the Indians, he and his men were attacked by a party of Creeks and Cherokees, who wounded two of his men and forced him to retreat. At the same time two men were killed on Clinch river, and it developed that the Indians had numerous parties out murdering and plundering whenever possible. The Indians put the blame of this trouble upon Dragging Canoe, the Indian chief, who, upon receiving a wound at the battle of Long Island Flats, on July 20, 1776, had retired to the Chickamauga country and refused to talk of peace. In the spring of the year 1777, pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Virginia, an election was held for members of the General Assembly from Washington county, at which election Arthur Campbell and William Edmiston were opposed by Anthony Bledsoe and William Cocke. The qualification of electors voting at said election was as follows: "Every free white man, who, at the time of the election, shall have been for one year preceding, in possession of twenty-five acres of land with a house and plantation thereon, or one hundred acres of land without a house and plantation thereon, and having right for an estate for life, at least, in the said land, in his own right or in the right of his wife, was entitled to a vote." This election was hotly contested and resulted in favor of Anthony Bledsoe and William Cocke, two gentlemen who afterwards became distinguished in the history of Tennessee, William Cocke being one of the two United States Senators elected to represent the State of Tennessee, at the date of its formation, in the Senate of the United States. Colonel Arthur Campbell and Captain William Edmiston, on the 20th day of May, 1777, filed a petition with the House of Delegates of Virginia, setting forth that the petitioners, with Anthony Bledsoe and William Cocke, were candidates at the last election of delegates for the county of Washington; that on the close of the poll it appeared that the greatest number of votes taken were in favor of Anthony Bledsoe and William Cocke, owing, as they conceive, to many votes being given in by persons who reside in North Carolina and by others not entitled to vote; that they apprehend the said Bledsoe is incapable of sitting as a member of the legislature, he having a military command which excluded him by the constitution; that the said Cocke is not possessed of such landed property in the county as is required by law, not to mention some instances of bribery and corruption practised contrary to the spirit of the present government; that these matters give dissatisfaction to what they believe to be a majority of the legal electors in the said county; and submitting themselves to such determination as shall be thought reasonable and just. Thus our county was honored by a contested election in the dawn of its history, which must have excited a good deal of feeling among the pioneers of the Holston and the Clinch. During the same session of the General Assembly, Mr. Banister, chairman of the Committee on Privileges and Elections, reported to the legislature that the committee had agreed upon a report and had come to several resolutions thereupon, which they had directed him to report to the House. Having read the report in his place, he afterwards delivered it in at the clerk's table, where the same was read and was as followeth—viz.: "As to the first charge contained in the said petition against the sitting members, as not having a greater number of legal votes than the petitioners, it appears to your committee, from a certificate of the sheriff of the county of Washington, that upon the close of the poll, the number of the voters stood as follows—to-wit: For Mr. Anthony Bledsoe 297 For Mr. William Cocke 294 For Mr. Arthur Campbell 211 For Mr. William Edmiston 144 It also appears to your committee by a line run by Colonel John Donaldson between this State and North Carolina, as far as the Holston river, that should it be continued in the same latitude to where it would intersect the north fork of Holston river, a considerable number of those who voted for the sitting members would be left in North Carolina, and if allowed the right of suffrage in the said county of Washington, would give them the greatest number of legal votes. It farther appears to your committee, from the information of Thomas Walker, Esq., that from the most accurate observations he has been able to make, the Great Island on the Holston river lies in this State, and that, should a direct line run from where the said Donaldson's terminated to the said island, the greater number of voters living in the bend of Holston river would be taken into the county of Washington, and that such line would in many places intersect the river. It appears to your committee from the information of Colonel William Christian that he brought a writ of ejectment in the County Court of Fincastle for a tract of land lying near the Holston river, between the Great Island and the termination of Donaldson's line; that the person who was in possession of the land and defended the suit, pleaded to the jurisdiction of the court, which was overruled and he obtained a judgment. It farther appears to your committee, from the testimony of James Thompson, that he acted as sheriff in the county formerly Fincastle in the years 1774 and 1775, during which time he collected levies and taxes from those people who reside on the north side of the Holston river as low down as within about six miles of the great island, which was esteemed the reputed bounds of Virginia. As to the second article of charge contained in the petition touching Mr. Bledsoe's holding a military command, it appears to your committee that Mr. Bledsoe holds no other commission than that of a major in the militia. As to the article of charge against Mr. Cocke, as not being a landholder and resident in the said county of Washington, it appears to your committee, from the testimony of James Thompson and John Montgomery, that Mr. Cocke was possessed, under a survey, of more than one hundred acres of land for one year preceding the election, hath resided in the county formerly Fincastle, with a family, several years, until some time in February last, when Mr. Cocke moved part of his family out of the country for fear of an Indian war, but continues there himself the greater part of his time. That the said John Montgomery was present when the poll was closed and heard the sheriff proclaim the sitting members duly elected. As to the last article of charge respecting the bribery and corruption, it appears to your committee to be groundless. Whereupon your committee came to the following resolutions: Resolved, as the opinion of this committee, That the said Anthony Bledsoe and William Cocke were duly elected to serve as delegates in this present General Assembly for the county of Washington. The said resolutions being severally read a second time, were, upon the question severally put thereupon, agreed to by the House."* * Journal House of Delegates, 1777. While the people of Washington county, Virginia, may feel some pride in knowing that our people explored East Tennessee and furnished the rule of action by which her early settlers were governed, on the other hand East Tennesseeans will find pride in the fact that they furnished Washington county, Virginia, her first representatives in the Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia. This election was held at Black's Fort, the county seat of Washington county, and every elector in the county was required to attend and cast his vote in person, under a penalty, and we may well imagine what a busy appearance the neighborhood of Black's Fort presented that day, 946 men from Powell's Valley, Clinch Valley, Holston, Carter's Valley and Watauga, Tennessee. On the 29th day of April, 1777, the ancestor of a great many people whose names have been honorably associated with the history of Washington county appeared in court. He was not a stranger to this section, nor was he a stranger to the members of that court. He had long been a deputy surveyor, under William Preston, surveyor of Fincastle county, and had previously thereto surveyed for the citizens of Holston large and numerous tracts of land. His name was Robert Preston, and on that day he presented to the court a commission from the masters of William and Mary College, appointing him surveyor of Washington county. The position of county surveyor was at that time, the most lucrative position to be found in any of the counties and was much sought after. William Preston, of Smithfield, as well as Robert Preston, had long been actively engaged by Colonel James Patton and the Loyal Land Company, in surveying and locating their grants of one hundred and twenty thousand and eight hundred thousand acres of land in Southwest Virginia. For this reason they had incurred the displeasure of many of the people of Southwestern Virginia, and particularly that of Colonel Arthur Campbell and his family, men who were ambitious and who felt it their right to rule. Whether this was the reason for the action of the court, or whether the reason is correctly stated in the order of the court cannot be stated. The court entered the following order: "Robert Preston, Gent., produced a commission from the Masters of William and Mary College appointing him a surveyor of Washington, and it is the opinion of the court that the same should not be received, as it is issued by virtue of a prerogative from the Crown of England." If the order of this court correctly stated the motive of the court, there can be no question that the court detested the Crown of England and everything emanating therefrom. Robert Preston appealed from this order of the County Court of Washington county, to the General Court at Williamsburg, which appeal was pending for some time, during which time, Robert Preston produced a surveyor's commission from the Masters of William and Mary College, dated January 23, 1777, to the County Court, of this county, and desired to be qualified by the said court, but his application was refused by the court, as there was an appeal pending in the General Court for a refusal of the same character. While the appeal of Robert Preston was pending in the General Court, numerously signed petitions were presented to the General Assembly of Virginia, praying that body to confer the power of selecting county surveyors upon the County Courts of the several counties, but Robert Preston seemed to have the ear of government, and all petitions were rejected. I cannot say what disposition was made of the appeal of Robert Preston, but from an inspection of the records of the County Court of this county, the following information is gathered: "Robert Preston, Gent., produced a commission from Thos. Jefferson, Gov. of the Commonwealth of Virginia, being dated the 22nd day of December, 1779, appointing him Surveyor of the County of Washington, and gave bond with James Dysart and Aaron Lewis, his securities, in the sum of 20,000 pounds for the faithful discharge of his office and took the oath of office." This office he filled until the year 1831, a little more than fifty-one years. The bad feeling between the Preston and Campbell families continued for many years, during which time there was a resort to arms. A duel was fought and a member of the Campbell family wounded, but I am happy to say this feeling has long since died out, and the two families for many years have been intimately connected, socially and otherwise. The settlers on the Holston and Clinch, during the years 17761777, had been greatly harassed by the invasion of the Indians, and thereby prevented from making anything like a crop from their lands. They had also been required to furnish supplies to Colonel Christian and his army of two thousand men, upon their invasion of the Cherokee country, and the country was thereby greatly impoverished before the crops in the year 1777 were harvested. The good citizens, the relatives and friends of the settlers, living in Augusta county, contributed through Mr. Alexander St. Clair considerable sums of money, and provisions, for the relief of the settlers on the frontiers, and the County Court of this county, besides entering the following order, directed Captain William Campbell to have Mr. St. Clair to lay out the money in his hands for wheat. "Ordered that Joseph Martin, John Kinkead, John Coulter, Gilbert Christian, William Campbell and Thomas Mastin, who are hereby appointed as commissioners to distribute the flour contributed in Augusta county or elsewhere for the distressed inhabitants of this county, and to hire wagons to bring the same to this county." This is the only instance save one, in the history of this county, that outsiders have been called upon to contribute to the support of the people of Washington county. On the same day, the court entered an order appointing Robert Young, constable, from Amos Eaton's to Patterson's Mill, Castleton Brooks, from Patterson's Mill to lowest settlements down the river. These appointments were made to keep in touch with the advancing settlements. At a meeting of the court on the 30th day of April, 1777, it was "ordered that the court be held as soon as the courthouse can be built, at the place formerly laid off for a town, upon the land given to the county by the honorable Thomas Walker, Joseph Black and Samuel Briggs. At the time of the organization of the county, Dr. Thomas Walker, Joseph Black and Samuel Briggs agreed to give one hundred and twenty acres of land in the county of Washington agreeably to a survey thereof made by Robert Doach for the purpose of establishing a town thereon, and for raising a sum of money towards defraying the expenses of building a courthouse and prison. This offer was made by the gentlemen mentioned to the County Court as an inducement to have them establish the county seat near Black's Fort and adjoining their other lands. Tradition says that the court hesitated for some time in making a selection between Wolf Hills, (now Abingdon), and Shugartsville, (now Green Spring). From a perusal of the orders of the County Court, it appears that a number of logs and other timber had been gathered at Mr. Black's for the purpose of building a magazine when, on the 27th day of August, 1777, the County Court ordered the sheriff to employ some person or persons, upon the best terms he could, to remove the logs and other timber at Mr. Black's for the purpose of building a magazine, to some convenient place where the town is to stand and there to be built for a courthouse." "And likewise to build a prison fourteen feet square, with square timber, twelve inches each way, and a good shingle roof," with directions to line the side wall and under floor with two-inch plank, and put nine iron spikes in each plank, six inches long in lieu of a stone wall." Pursuant to this order, the sheriff of the county let the contract for the building of the county courthouse to Samuel Evans; to Abraham Goodpasture, the building of a prison; to G. Martin, the contract for making irons for criminals, and to Hugh Berry the contract for making the nails to be used in the building of the courthouse The courthouse was built of logs and stood upon the lot occupied by the present residence of Mrs. James W. Preston. The jail or prison (a fair description of which has been previously given), stood on the lower end of the present courthouse lot, a short distance from the street and north of the present courthouse. On the 30th day of April, 1777, the County Court "ordered that Arthur Campbell, William Campbell, Daniel Smith, Joseph Martin, William Edmiston, John Coulter and Robert Craig, gents, be appointed trustees to dispose of the land given to the county by the Honorable Thomas Walker, Samuel Briggs and Joseph Black, and formerly laid off by Captain Robert Doach, and that they or any four of them shall sell the same and apply the money arising therefrom toward defraying the expenses of the publick buildings in this county." Pursuant to this order of the court, the trustees therein named employed John Coulter to lay off a part of the streets and alleys of the proposed town, which service he performed and reported to the court and received his pay therefor. The time when the new courthouse was first occupied cannot be definitely fixed, but must have been in the year 1778, and the new prison was not used or occupied until the year 1779. On the same day the court directed David Campbell, clerk, to furnish blank books for keeping the public records, and ordered the sheriff to summons twenty-four of the most capable freeholders to serve as a grand jury, which grand jury met on the 27th day of May, 1777, at Black's Fort, and made the following indictments— to-wit: Margaret Drummon for having a bastard child, and James Bryan for not having the road in good repair he was surveyor of. On the same day the court entered the following order: "Ordered that it be certified that it is the opinion of the court, that the field officers for Washington county be recommended to His Excellency the Governor, to be continued and be in the office they have been commissioned to by his Excellency, which appointments are approved of by the court of this county. Major Anthony Bledsoe, upon his election as a member of the Legislature of Virginia, resigned his position as major of the forces stationed at Long Island and left for Richmond, and was succeeded by Captain William Russell. Major Bledsoe and Captain Cocke expected, upon the assembling of the legislature at Richmond, to have the pleasure of displacing the militia officers of Washington county and filling their positions with their friends and partizans, and Colonel Campbell, as a means to disappoint Cocke and Bledsoe in the accomplishment of their purpose, had the preceding order entered by the court of this county, which action had the desired effect, and as a result of it Cocke and Bledsoe preferred charges against Colonel Campbell, which charges were heard and dismissed by the Governor and Council, in the same year. The County Court during this year, upon motion of James Dysart, sheriff of the county, permitted Joseph Black, James Roberts and John King, to qualify as deputy sheriffs for this county, and during the same year, permitted Robert Campbell and John Campbell to qualify as deputy clerks for said county. During the early part of the year 1777, the court ordered the following roads opened and established: "A road from James Kincannon's to William Kennedy's Mill. A road from Samuel Henry's up the South Fork of Holston, the way viewed by Robert Buchanan, Alexander McNutt and Robert Edmiston, pursuant to the order of the Fincastle court." And, "on motion, John Anderson, Gilbert Christian, James Elliott, James Fulkerson and William Roberts, were appointed commissioners to view a road from George Blackburn's by James Fulkerson's to the forks of the path leading to Kentucky and the mouth of Reedy creek." In the fall of this year, the following orders relating to the roads of the county, were entered: "Benjamin Gray and William Blackburn were appointed commissioners to view and locate a road from the courthouse to Shoate's Ford on Holston river on the 27th day of August, 1777, and the report of the viewers establishing this road was confirmed by the court on the 30th day of September, 1777. Josiah Gamble, Thomas Berry and Adam Keer were appointed commissioners to locate a road from the courthouse to Philip's Mill, on the Watauga road, on the 27th of August, 1777; their report was confirmed and the road established on the 30th day of September, 1777. William Bowen, David Ward, Rees Bowen and James Fowler were appointed commissioners to locate a road from the Richlands by Maiden's Spring to the gap of the Laurel Fork of the north branch of Holston on the 30th day of September, 1777, and on the same day, John Finley, John Fowler and Abraham Crabtree were appointed commissioners to locate a road from said gap down the valley to the head of Fifteen-Mile creek and on to the courthouse. On the same day, Albert McClure, Thomas McCulloch and Joseph Martin were appointed commissioners to view a road from the foot of Clinch mountain where James Logan lived to the gap of the mountain opposite the head of Fifteen-Mile creek. Their report was received and confirmed on the 18th day of March, 1778. John Kinkead, Daniel Smith, Thomas Price and William Gilmer were appointed commissioners to locate a road from the north side of Clinch mountain, over Clinch mountain, to Robert and James Logan's and Halbert McClure. Thomas McCulloch and Joseph Martin were appointed commissioners to locate a road from the foot of Clinch mountain at James Logan's to the courthouse. William Casey, Robert Harrold and Samuel Staples were appointed commissioners on the 26th day of November, 1777, to locate a road from the mouth of Harrold's creek to the courthouse, and on the same day, Francis Cooper, John Dunkin and James Davis were appointed commissioners to locate a road from the North Fork of Holston to the Castle's Woods road through Little Moccasin Gap; this last road was established by order of the court on the 18th day of March, 1778. We give this information in regard to the roads established in the year 1777, as it is always of interest to the citizens to know the time and circumstances attending the opening of our public roads. The State authorities in the month of October, 1777, made a requisition upon the authorities of Washington county for thirty-three men for the continental service, which requisition was promptly complied with. During the summer of this year, all the western settlements were visited by numbers of Tories from the eastern portion of the State and from the disaffected portions of North Carolina, and were greatly troubled by their presence in this, that they usually joined themselves in bands and traveled about through the settlements, stealing horses and robbing the Whig sympathizers; and oftentimes, in accomplishing their purposes, committed the offence of murder, and, from all appearances, in the fall of this year it looked as if they would be able to give the settlers a great deal of trouble, unless in some manner restrained. The people living on Holston undertook to restrain these Tory sympathizers by a resort to the courts and by inflicting the punishment prescribed by law, and, in so doing, Isaac Lebo, Jeremiah Slaughter and William Houston were indicted, tried and convicted for conduct and conversation evidencing a disposition inimical to the cause of America. Their goods were confiscated and they were fined and imprisoned. The British government had spies scattered throughout the country, carrying messages between its officials and the Indians living to the south and west of the Holston settlements, and the situation was fast becoming exceedingly precarious. One of these spies was captured and punished by Colonel William Campbell and some of his friends, in this year, when Colonel Campbell was returning to his home from preaching, in company with his wife and two or three gentlemen. The circumstances were as follows: "When Colonel Campbell had gotten within a few miles of home, he discovered a man walking, with a little bundle on a stick thrown over his shoulder. When the man got within some hundred and fifty yards of Campbell, he turned obliquely off from the road. As soon as Campbell discovered this, he turned from the road in a direction to intercept him. When the man discovered that he was about to be intercepted by Campbell and his companions, he broke and ran with all his might towards the river. The pursuers galloped after him and as there was no ford there they jumped off of their horses and ran across the river and overtook their game in an ivy cleft. They carried him back to the road. When they got back several other men fell in company with them. The spy, as I will now call the man, was dressed very shabbily. Colonel Campbell asked him why he turned from the road. The spy appeared very silly and offered some flimsy excuse. Campbell propounded a great many other questions to him. The fellow pretended to have very little sense and said that he was a very poor man and was going to the back settlements where there was plenty of land. From the many questions Campbell proposed to the spy he became perfectly satisfied that he was a man of fine sense and under the disguise of a fool. Campbell informed him that he believed him to be a man engaged in some vile service and he must be searched, to which the spy had no objection. His bundle was searched, in which was found nothing but some old clothes. Campbell informed him he must pull off all the clothes he had on and put on the suit he had in his bundle. In his pocket they found a pass and some other old papers, all badly written. Every part of his clothing was examined very minutely, but nothing could be found. Campbell remarked to the spy that he had a very good pair of shoes on and he believed he would examine them. He took out his pocket knife and ripped off the bottom soles of the shoes, and under each of them he found a letter written by the British commander, addressed to the King of the Cherokee Indians. The letters were written on very fine paper and were enveloped in bladder so as to render them water-proof. The Indians were informed that the whites had rebelled against their king, that a large army had been sent against them, which would in a short time subdue them. The Indians were exhorted to send their warriors in every direction and harass the whites as much as possible. They were reminded of the injuries they had received from the whites and were told that as soon as the rebels were subdued, they would be amply remunerated for all the land that had been taken from them and for whatever other losses they had sustained from them. The letter wound up by recommending the bearer to the king as a man of sense and honesty and as one in whose counsels they should place implicit confidence. After the letters were read, a council was held and it was unanimously agreed that the spy should be hanged. Colonel Campbell informed the spy that he had but a short time to live and he had as well make a full and candid confession of everything connected with his trip. The spy said that he had been promised by the British commander a large sum of money to carry these letters to the Indians and to incite them to do all the mischief they could possibly accomplish. Soon after this confession the spy was taken by Campbell and his companions and swung to a limb."* * Capt. John Redd's MSS. At the August term of the County Court of 1777, the situation had become so alarming that the court thought proper to require all the citizens of the county to take the oath of allegiance to the Commonwealth and directed that George Blackburn tender the oath of allegiance to all free male inhabitants living in the bounds of Captain James Shelby's, Robert Craig's and Andrew Colvill's companies. James Montgomery to tender the oath to those living in his own and Captain John Shelby's companies. Arthur Campbell to tender the oath of allegiance to all in Captain Edmiston's and Captain Dysart's companies. William Campbell to tender the oath of allegiance to those living in Captain Aaron Lewis's company. John Snoddy, to those in his own and Captain Adam's company. John Campbell, to those in his own and Captain John Campbell's companies at Royal Oak. John Kinkead in his own and Captain Dunkin's company. Daniel Smith, to those living from the upper part of Captain Dunkin's company to the county line, and to John Coulter was assigned the duty of tendering the oath of allegiance to all free male inhabitants in the bounds of Captain Gilbert Christian's company and Captain James Robertson's company at Watauga. The members of the County Court of Washington county were zealous Whigs and were so aggressive in the enforcement of their views, that it was with difficulty that a Tory could make his home anywhere within the bounds of this county without being prosecuted to the full extent of the law. A majority of these men did not recognize any distinction between an Indian who would scalp his wife and children and a man with a white skin who would lend his influence to a government that would offer every inducement to the Indian to murder and plunder the white settlers. Colonel William Campbell was particularly aggressive in his prosecution of the Tories to be found within the county, and, by reason thereof, was the object of special hatred on their part. At this time there lived in Washington county two men by the names of Francis Hopkins and William Hopkins. Francis Hopkins was a counterfeiter and, at the May term of the County Court in the year 1778, he was tried by the court on suspicion of his having counterfeited, erased and altered sundry treasury notes; the currency of this Commonwealth, knowing the same to be bad. He was found guilty, fined fifty dollars lawful money of Virginia, sentenced to six months in prison, and was ordered to be confined within the walls of the Fort at William Cocke's (now C. L. Clyce's), on Renfro's creek, alias Spring creek, until the county gaol was completed. He was conveyed to Cocke's Fort, but, within a short time thereafter, made his escape and began a series of very bold and daring depredations upon the Whig settlers of the county. He organized a band of Tories, whose occupation was to steal the horses of the settlers and intimidate the citizens whenever possible. He went so far as to post notices at and near the home of Colonel William Campbell, warning him that if he did not desist from his prosecution of the loyal adherents of George III, a terrible calamity would befall him, either in the loss of his property or his life. "On a quiet and beautiful Sabbath in the spring time of the year 1780, General Campbell accompanied by his wife (who was a sister of Patrick Henry), and several of their neighbors, attended a religious service at a Presbyterian house of worship known as Ebbing Spring Church in the upper end of this county. As they were returning to their homes they happened to be conversing about the audacity of the Tory who had been so bold and defiant in his declarations and was suspected of having posted these notices above referred to. Just as they arrived at the top of a hill, a short distance west of the present residence of Colonel Hiram A. Greever, they observed a man on horseback on the opposite hill, coming towards them. General Campbell was riding beside his wife, with an infant on before him. One of them remarked that the individual meeting them was the Tory of whom they had been speaking, probably now on a horse-stealing expedition, as he was observed to be carrying a rope halter in his hand. Hearing this, Colonel Campbell, without halting, handed the infant over to its mother and dashed out in front. Seeing the movement and recognizing the man whom he so much feared and hated, the Tory wheeled his horse and started back at quite a rapid gait, pursued at full speed by Colonel Campbell and one of the gentlemen of the company, whose name was Thompson. Never, it may be presumed, either before or since, has such a dashing and exciting race been witnessed upon that long level between the residences of Colonels Greever and Beattie. As they reached the branch at the base of the hill a little west of Colonel Beattie's, Colonel Campbell dashed up alongside the fleeing Tory, who, seeing that he would be caught, turned short to the right down the bank and plunged into the river. As he struck the water, Colonel Campbell, who had left his companion in the rear, leaped in beside him, grasped the Tory's holsters and threw them into the stream, and then dragged him from his horse into the water. At this moment Mr. Thompson rode up. They took their prisoner out on the bank and held what may be termed a drum-head court. The Tory, who, bad as he was, had the virtue of being a brave, candid man, at once acknowledged the truth of the charge preferred against him and boldly declared his defiance and determination to take horses wherever he could find them. But he was mistaken in his man, for in less than ten minutes he was dangling from the limb of a large sycamore that stood upon the bank of the river, the stump of which was to be seen a few years ago, and may be there yet for aught the writer knows.* * Charles B. Coale. After the sudden taking off of Francis Hopkins, as above detailed, William Hopkins continued his depredations upon the Whig settlers and resorted to arms, for which offence he also was arrested in the year 1779 and committed to the gaol of this county for trial, but escaped therefrom, whereupon, the court entered the following order on the 16th day of June, 1779: "Washington county ss. On motion of Ephraim Dunlop, Deputy Attorney for the Commonwealth, that the estate of William Hopkins, who had been taken and committed to the gaol of this county for treasonable practices against the United States of America, in taking up arms under the British Standard and who had broken the gaol and escaped, be sold and the money deposited in the treasury, it appearing to the court that the said Hopkins has no family, and that he has no stated place of abode, "Ordered that the sheriff seize and sell all the estate of the said Hopkins which shall be found in his bailiwick and that he keep the money accruing from such sale in his hands until the General Assembly shall determine how the said money is to be expended." Ordered that the clerk of the court transmit this order to the Speaker of the House of Delegates at the next session of the Assembly. The good citizens of the county organized themselves into bands called "Regulators," and patroled the county and meted out punishment to the offenders according to the enormity of their conduct. The citizens, following the example of their leaders, adopted, in dealing with Tory sympathizers, measures of such a character that this county was comparatively free from Tory influences during the entire war, and numbered among her citizens only such persons as were willing and ready to offer their lives and property as a sacrifice on the altar of their country. And so strong and healthy was the Whig settlement in this county, in the years 1778-1779, that numbers of our citizens were called upon to assist in suppressing an uprising of the Tory sympathizers in the county of Montgomery. The mode of procedure adopted by our Revolutionary fathers, in dealing with this matter, may not meet with the approval of some at this day, but it is evident to the student of our history, that the methods used were the most effective in dealing with the unprincipled men who had chosen, with the assistance of the Indians, to commit all manner of depredations and outrages upon the frontier settlements. In the county of Montgomery, persuasion and good treatment were used on this character of citizens and resulted in what might be termed an insurrection, a deplorable state of affairs that could not be remedied without the assistance of the patriots of Washington county and the application of their methods in the premises. In Washington county stern justice was meted out speedily and effectively, to all violators of the law, which policy was approved by the body politic and had the desired effect. In the month of July, 1777, the Government of Virginia decided to appoint a superintendent or Indian Agent for the Cherokee Indians, which position was conferred upon Captain Joseph Martin, and the agency was located at the Long Island in Holston river. Captain Martin, upon his appointment as Indian Agent, proceeded to build a large store house on the island, for the purpose of depositing such goods as the government might send out for the Indians and for the accommodation of the Indians when at Long Island on business with the Indian Agent. Daniel Boone, in March, 1775, undertook to mark out for a number of North Carolina gentlemen a road from Watauga, Tennessee, through the wilderness to Kentucky, which he did. The road marked out by Boone, at this time, was from the Watauga settlement near Elizabethton (Tennessee), to the Cumberland Gap, and, from the Gap, it followed the Indian trace known as "the Warrior's Path," about fifty miles, where it left the "Warrior's Path," bearing to the west to the "Hazel Patch" and to Rock Castle river. From Rock Castle river the road passed through the present county of Madison (Kentucky) and on to the Kentucky river, at the mouth of Otter creek. About one mile below the mouth of this creek, Boone established headquarters and erected a fort, and called it Boonesborough. Boone was followed by a large company in charge of Richard Henderson, who claimed to own all the lands between the Ohio and the Cumberland rivers, by purchase from the Cherokee Indians, to which country he had given the name of Transylvania. Benjamin Logan with a company of men from the Wolf Hills, (now Abingdon), joined Colonel Henderson in Powell's Valley, and the two companies traveled together as far as Rockcastle river in Kentucky, where Logan, not approving of Colonel Henderson's pretensions or plans, left Henderson and traveled westwardly in the direction of the Crab Orchard, and when he had reached the level land he halted and built a fort which he called "Logan's Fort." In this year, a large number of emigrants began to travel into Kentucky, seeking homes, and, by the month of July, a considerable body of people had gathered at Boone's Fort and Logan's Fort. On the 4th day of July, 1777, one hundred Indians appeared before Logan's Fort and laid siege to it, which siege continued until the month of September. When the siege had lasted for some time, Captain Benjamin Logan, with a number of friends, slipped out of the fort by night and began an exceedingly hard and dangerous trip to the settlements on Holston, to procure supplies for the fort and reinforcements against the Indians. They traveled by night and lay by during the day; but, finally reaching the Holston at Wolf Hills, they secured powder and the assistance of forty riflemen, and returned to the fort within ten days. The riflemen from the Holston settlements were under the command of Colonel John Bowman. Many of the men who went to the rescue of their relatives and fellow-citizens in Kentucky at this time subsequently made their homes in Kentucky, and Benjamin Logan became a great man in the new State. The road thus marked by Daniel Boone and Benjamin Logan continued to be the passageway of many hundreds of settlers and emigrants on their way to Kentucky until the year 1781, although it was nothing more than a mere path or trace. By the year 1779 great numbers of people were emigrating to and settling to the westward of the Cumberland mountains. In this year the General Assembly of Virginia passed an act for marking and opening a road over the Cumberland mountains into the county of Kentucky. The act in question appointed Evan Shelby and Richard Calloway commissioners to explore the country adjacent to and on both sides of the Cumberland mountains, and to trace and mark the most convenient road from the settlements on the east side of the mountains over the same into the open country into the county of Kentucky, and to cause such road, with all convenient dispatch to be opened and cleared in such manner as to give passage to travelers with pack-horses for the present, and to report to the next session of the Assembly the distance, the practicability and the cost of completing and making the same a good wagon road. The act further provided that should the said Evan Shelby or Richard Calloway refuse or be unable to act, then the County Court of their residence should appoint his or their successor. It provided also that a guard of not more than fifty men from the county most convenient should attend said commissioners while locating this road. Colonel Evan Shelby declined to act as commissioner, pursuant to the act of the Assembly above mentioned, and the County Court of Washington county, in which he lived, on June 20, 1780, entered the following order: "Ordered that Captain John Kinkead be appointed in the room of Colonel Evan Shelby, who has refused to act agreeably to the Act of Assembly for marking and opening a road over the Cumberland mountains into the county of Kentucke." This appointment Captain Kinkead accepted, and, along with Captain Calloway, effected the opening of a road through the Cumberland mountains to Kentucky, and on the first day of December, 1781, a petition of John Kinkead was presented to the General Assembly of Virginia "setting forth that agreeably to appointment of the County Court of Washington he, in conjunction with the other commissioner, proceeded to and effected the opening of a road through the Cumberland mountains to Kentucky, and praying to be paid for the service." The road thus located by Captains Kinkead and Calloway, became what was known as the "Wilderness Road," and for twenty years subsequent thereto was the principal highway traveled by an immense train of emigrants to the West. This road passed through Abingdon, and that the present generation may be able to locate this road, I give the stopping points, with the distances between, along the road from Inglis' Ferry at New river to Cumberland Gap: Miles. * * Wm.

Chief-Justice Robertson, of Kentucky, in speaking of the land law enacted for Kentucky by the General Assembly of Virginia in the year 1779, and of the emigration which took place in that year, used the following language: "This beneficent enactment brought to the country during the fall and winter of that year an unexampled tide of emigrants, who, exchanging all the comforts of their native society and homes for settlements for themselves and children here, came, like pilgrims, to a wilderness to be made secure by their arms and habitable by the toil of their lives. Through privations incredible and perils thick, thousands of men, women and children came in successive caravans, forming continuous streams of human beings, horses, cattle and other domestic animals, all moving onward along a lonely and houseless path to a wild and cheerless land. Cast your eyes back on that long procession of missionaries in the cause of civilization; behold the men on foot with their trusty guns on their shoulders, driving stock and leading pack-horses; and the women, some walking with pails on their heads, others riding with children in their laps, and other children hung in baskets on horses, fastened to the tails of others going before; see them encamped at night expecting to be massacred by Indians; behold them in the month of December, in that ever memorable season of unprecedented cold called the "hard winter," traveling two or three miles a day, frequently in danger of being frozen or killed by the falling of horses on the icy and almost impassable trace, and subsisting on stinted allowances of stale bread and meat; but now, lastly, look at them at the destined fort, perhaps on the eve of Merry Christmas, when met by the hearty welcome of friends who had come before, and, cheered by the fresh buffalo meat and parched corn, they rejoice at their deliverance and resolve to be contented with their lot." It was by this route and in this manner that many of our citizens traveled to their new homes in Kentucky and throughout the West, and it was for the protection of travelers on this route that the county officials of Washington county, Virginia, expended a great deal of effort and money, the Indians, for many years subsequent to 1775, waylaying this route, murdering the emigrants and stealing their horses and plunder. The ministers of the Gospel, being Presbyterian in belief, kept step with the advance of the settlers upon the frontiers. The settlements had scarcely reached the vicinity of Jonesboro, Tennessee, when Rev. Samuel Doak, a Presbyterian minister, who had been educated at Princeton, with great energy and with a determination to make his home on the frontiers, appeared upon the scene, after having walked through Maryland and Virginia, driving before him a horse loaded with books. He was greatly appreciated by the people among whom he had cast his lot, and he, in turn, exercised a wonderful influence upon the early settlers of East Tennessee. In this year, 1777, through the influence of this preacher, a Presbyterian log church was erected near Jonesboro, Tennessee, to which was given the name of "Salem Church." Near this church soon thereafter he erected a school-house which afterwards became Washington College, this church and school being the first erected in the State of Tennessee. On the 26th day of November, 1777, the county court of this county proceeded to make a statement of the county levy for the year 1777, which statement was as follows: "To Abraham Goodpasture, for building the prison, £450 To Samuel Evans, for building a house to hold court in, To John Coulter for laying off the lots of the town, To Clerk for ex officio services, Tobacco, 1,000 lbs. To Clerk, for public services, Tobacco, 1,300 lbs. To a blank record book and alphabet, £5 To carriage for do. from Williamsburg, 7s. 6d. To Wm. Young, for old Wolf Head, To the Sheriff, for ex officio services, To Sheriff, for whole of his public services, Tobacco, 12,000 lbs. To building of pillory and stocks, By 890 tithables, at 8s., £356 To Hugh Berry, for making 1,760 nails for courthouse roof, £5 To G. Martin, for making irons for criminals, From an inspection of this county levy, it will be seen that our first county government was very frugal and economical. Many readers will not understand how it was that a part of the county expenses was paid in tobacco. The explanation is that, in those early days, money was exceedingly scarce, and the House of Burgesses of Virginia, as early as the year 1772, enacted a law permitting the inhabitants of this section of Virginia to discharge all secretaries', clerks' and other officers' fees in tobacco at the rate of eight shillings and four pence for every hundredweight of gross tobacco. And this law remained in force for a decade thereafter. The Governor of Virginia, on the 23d day of July, 1777, issued a new commission of the peace and dedimus for this county, directed to Arthur Campbell, William Campbell, William Edmiston, Joseph Martin, James Dysart, John Anderson, John Coulter, George Blackburn, Isaac Shelby, John Dunkin, Gilbert Christian, Evan Shelby, Daniel Smith, John Campbell, Alexander Buchanan, John Kinkead, James Montgomery, John Snoddy, Thomas Mastin, Robert Craig, John Adair, Thomas Caldwell, and, on the 25th day of November, 1777, this commission was produced and read, and, thereupon, pursuant to the said dedimus, the said Arthur Campbell took the oath of a justice of the peace and a justice of the County Court in chancery, all of which oaths were administered to him by John Kinkead. Thereupon, the said Arthur Campbell administered the same oaths to: John Kinkead, John Coulter, James Montgomery, Robert Craig, John Dunkin, and thus was constituted the second County Court for Washington county. In the fall of this year, General George Rogers Clark traveled from Kentucky over the "Wilderness Road," on his way to Richmond, in company with a young lawyer by the name of John Gabriel Jones, and reached Mump's Fort in Powell's Valley about ten days subsequent to the killing, by the Indians, of a settler by the name of Parks. In traveling through this portion of Virginia, he usually stopped at the nearest house when dark overtook him, for which he usually paid, at the small cabins, a shilling and sixpence for breakfast, bed and feed for horse. On his way he became acquainted with Captain William Campbell, whom he found a very agreeable companion. The object of this journey to Richmond on the part of General Clark was to secure the approval of the Governor of a plan that he then conceived to be feasible and that would be of great value to the American Colonies. He sought the consent and assistance of the Governor in equipping and carrying on an expedition against the British posts at Vincennes and Kaskaskia in the Illinois county; and there can be but little doubt that he discussed this question with Captain Campbell, at the time of his visit to Holston. He succeeded in obtaining the consent and authority of the Governor to enlist three hundred and fifty men from the counties west of the Alleghany mountains, to be used upon this expedition, of which number four companies were to be raised in the Holston and Clinch settlements, and Major W. B. Smith was dispatched, in the year 1778, to recruit men for that service in this section. There seems to be a conflict among historians as to the number of men raised in this section by Major Smith for this service, one giving the number as amounting to four companies; another, as one company. The men recruited for this service were not informed of the purpose for which they were intended, until they had reached the falls of the Ohio (now Louisville). The company of recruits from the Holston settlements did not suppose, when they entered the service, that they were to be taken upon such a long and dangerous expedition, and when they were informed of the purpose for which they were to be used, they objected to proceeding any further and left the camp of General Clark and returned to their homes. This is the one disagreeable circumstance connected with the history of our people. These men were recruited from a country where the people were brave and adventurous, and it is hard to account for their conduct upon this occasion. We are sorry to state that, by their conduct, they deprived this portion of Virginia of the honor of sharing in the wonderful expedition and conquests of General Clark. While the company, as a whole, refused to go upon this expedition, a few of the men joined other companies and took part in the expedition; and their names, so far as I have been able to gather them, are as follows: Low Brown, Solomon Stratton, John Lasly, Nealy McGuire, William Peery. Supplies for this expedition were purchased upon the Holston, as is evidenced by an order of the court entered on the 17th day of March, 1779, which order is as follows: "Whereas twenty-six forty dollar bills were found in the possession of Captain Thomas Quirk, and, on the examination of the court of Washington county, were supposed to be counterfeit, the said Captain Quirk delivered the said bills to the sheriff in the presence of the court, and it appears by the oath of the said Thomas Quirk and Andrew Colvill that the said Thomas Quirk received these bills of James Buchanan, commissary for the Illinois service, to purchase bacon. Whereupon, it is ordered that the sheriff take or send the said bills to the Board of Auditors for further proceedings, according to law. A list of the bills is given, which bills are signed by D. Summers and G. Brown and dated April 11, 1778." At the election held for Washington county in the spring of the year 1778, Arthur Campbell and Anthony Bledsoe were elected members of the House of Delegates, and William Fleming, of Botetourt, a member of the Senate, in the General Assembly of Virginia. In the spring of this year, Captain James Dysart and Lieutenant Samuel Newell were placed in command of two companies of militia to range, during the summer, along the frontiers in Powell's and Clinch Valleys, as a protection against the Indians. Early in the month of May, before the departure of these ranging parties, a man by the name of Whitesides, a large, active man, left his home near Elk Garden Fort for Glade Hollow Fort, where he had a horse running on the range. While hunting for his horse about two miles from Glade Hollow Fort, he was captured by nine Indians, who pinioned his arms back, loaded him with their extra plunder and some meat cut from the carcass of a dead horse, and in this manner skulked about for several days, watching for an opportunity to attack Glade Hollow Fort, which was in a wretched state of defence, seven men only being in the fort.* * Benjamin Sharp Letter, American Pioneer. These men were engaged daily in bringing salt-petre dust from a cave at some distance from the fort, to make salt-petre, upon the discovery of which, the Indians resolved to take the fort the next time the men went out. They tied Whitesides' feet and left an Indian to guard him, while the others sought a more convenient place to attack the fort when occasion offered. In the meantime the Indian who had charge of Whitesides, thinking they were too much exposed to view, untied his feet and made him creep further into the brush and, laying down his gun, sat down before Whitesides to tie his feet again. At that moment, Whitesides seized the gun, and, although his arms were pinioned, gave the Indian such a blow over the head as broke the gun to pieces and felled the Indian to the ground and, perhaps, killed him. Whitesides then sprang to his feet and gave the alarm to the men near the fort, who ran back to the fort with all speed, but Whitesides ran past the fort towards the Elk Garden fort, carrying all the Indian's plunder on his back. The eight Indians who were waylaying the fort, hearing the alarm, ran back, and finding their companion, perhaps lifeless, pursued Whitesides; and while doing so, met about forty men in plain view of the fort, on their way to act as rangers; on whom the Indians fired and killed two. The rest fled ingloriously, each one in his way, spreading the alarm that the fort was taken. Upon receipt of this news at Black's Fort, Captain Samuel Newell, with eighteen men set off for Glade Hollow Fort. They ran about twelve miles that evening and waded the North Fork of Holston just before night, but were forced to stop when night set in, as they had no trace they could follow in the night, and, in many places the weeds and grass were waist high. They arrived in view of the fort next morning between eight and nine o'clock, and upon reconnoitering, found the fort had not been taken. When the occupants of the fort saw them, they ran out to meet them. The next day, Captain James Dysart, with eighteen men, arrived at the fort. During the same year, in the lower end of this county, a young man by the name of Fulkerson was killed when driving up his horses from the range, and Thomas Sharp was fired at and badly wounded, but, being on horseback, he made his escape and recovered from his wounds. Jacob Fulkerson and a young man by the name of Callahan were both killed this year, while hunting their cattle in the range. On the 23d day of April, 1778, the court entered the following order: "Ordered that Colonel William Campbell be appointed to distribute the county salt to the most necessitous of the frontier inhabitants of Clinch and the lower settlements of Washington county below the mouth of the North Fork, such a quantity reserving as he shall judge sufficient for the militia on duty, also selling at such rate as will be sufficient to discharge the first cost and expenses." "Ordered that Isaac Lebo be permitted to go towards the Moravian Town for salt, and that he return within the term of three weeks." Isaac Lebo is one of the same men that had, previously to this time, been arrested, tried and convicted of treasonable practices against the Commonwealth, and this, no doubt, was an excuse offered by him for an opportunity to communicate with his Tory friends in the South. On the 21st day of May, 1778, Samuel Newell qualified as Deputy Sheriff for the county and gave and filed a bond for the due collection and accounting for the taxes of the county of Washington, and entered upon his duties as first tax collector for the county, under the law of Virginia. It was the duty of the County Court to recommend to the Governor the names of the three magistrates named first in the Commission of Peace, from which list the Governor commissioned a sheriff for the county, and on the 20th day of April, 1778, the court recommended Arthur Campbell, William Campbell and Daniel Smith as fit and proper persons to execute the office of sheriff for the county of Washington. From this list the Governor commissioned Arthur Campbell as sheriff of the county, and he qualified as such on the 16th day of February, 1779, with Evan Shelby, Andrew Willoughby and Andrew Kincannon as his securities. During this and the succeeding year, the following gentlemen qualified as deputy sheriffs of the county; Samuel Newell, Christopher Acklin and Alexander Donaldson. At the March court 1779, Harry Innes and Rowland Madison qualified to practice law in the courts of the county. Harry Innes afterwards moved to the county of Kentucky, where he became distinguished in the annals of that State. At the same term of the court, Daniel Smith, Robert Craig and John Campbell were appointed commissioners of the tax, the land owners having failed to attend and elect commissioners. At this term of the court, David Campbell resigned his position as Clerk of the Court, and John Campbell was appointed to succeed him, which position he occupied until the year 1824, during which time he faithfully discharged his duties and retained the respect and confidence of the people of this county. David Campbell, who resigned his position as Clerk of the Court on the 15th day of August, 1780, obtained a commission from His Excellency, Thomas Jefferson, appointing him attorney-at-law, and qualified as such in the court of this county, but, soon thereafter, he removed to Campbell's Station, Tennessee, in which State he won distinction in his profession and became the first Chief Justice of that State. From the orders of the court at this term, it appears that Samuel Evans had not completed the courthouse, pursuant to contract, and Joseph Black was directed to agree with Evans as to the amount he should receive for the work that he had done upon the courthouse; and the sheriff was directed to agree with some person to finish the courthouse. At the April term of this court, a statement of the county levy was made for the year 1779, which is as follows: "Ephraim Dunlop, for services as State's Attorney for the year 1777 and for the year 1778, £200.00 Abraham Goodpasture, for building prison, 500.00 Samuel Evans, for building courthouse, 100.00 Abraham Goodpasture, finishing courthouse, 100.00 Arthur Campbell, for three blank books for the Clerk, 15.00 To do. for the body of the law for use of the Court, 5. To do. for cash paid Hugh Berry, nails courthouse, 5. To do. for 60 lbs. iron furnished for nails courthouse, 5. To window glass for courthouse, 12 lights @ 9s., 5.8 To do. for ex officio services for 1777-1778, 15.0 Allowed for pillory and stocks, 75.0 By 1464 tithables @ 15s. per tithable, 1,098.9 At this same court the following order was entered: "Ordered that the main road be cut according to report of Joseph Black, Andrew Colvill and James Piper, viewers from the courthouse to the Twenty-Mile creek, and that Andrew Colvill be surveyor from the courthouse to the west side of Spring creek, and that the tithables formerly ordered work upon the same." The Pillory—Used in this Section in the Early Days. The road was opened pursuant to this order, the location of which was about the same as that of the present road from Abingdon to Papersville, Tennessee. At the May term of court, 1779, the Attorney for the Commonwealth filed an information against John Yancy, a citizen and hotel keeper, living in the town of Abingdon, charging him with the offence of enclosing his sheep in the courthouse, upon which information divers witnesses were sworn and examined, and the defendant heard in his defence, whereupon, the court fined the defendant twenty shillings and the costs. At the same court, the prison erected by Abraham Goodpasture was, by order of the court, used, but not received. On the same day the court entered the following order: "Ordered that David Carson and Joseph Black lay off the prison bounds, exceeding five acres and not more than ten, and take in the water, and David Carson was paid six pounds for his services." On the 19th day of August the court entered the following order: "Ordered that Arthur Campbell, Anthony Bledsoe, Daniel Smith, Joseph Black and John Blackamore be appointed examiners of the bills of credit of this State and the other United States, agreeably to the act of the Assembly entitled "An Act for more effectually guarding against counterfeiting of the Bills of Credit, Treasury Notes and Loan Office certificates." In the early summer of this year, the Tories living near the head of the Yadkin river, North Carolina, and on New river and Walker's creek in Montgomery county, Virginia, began to form into a body, with the intention of destroying the Lead Mines on New river, robbing the well affected citizens of that county, and then forcing their way to the headquarters of Lord Cornwallis, who was at that time in the Carolinas. There was every prospect that an insurrection would take place, and, notwithstanding the untiring efforts of Colonel William Preston, the county-lieutenant of that county, he was unable to quiet the disaffected, or to protect the well-disposed citizens. As a last resort Colonel Preston called upon the officials of Washington county for assistance, when Captain William Campbell, with about one hundred and fifty militia from this county, all well mounted, turned out and proceeded to suppress this, a new kind of enemy to the people of Washington county. The name of Captain Campbell was such as to strike consternation into the rank of the Tories, who dispersed upon his approach and offered no open resistance. The militia from this county were then dispatched in small detachments and had active business for several weeks pursuing, taking and imprisoning Tories. The militia subsisted themselves and their horses upon the grain and stock of the Tories, and compelled all Tory sympathizers who were old and unfit for service to give security for their good behavior, or to go to jail. The young, effective men were pardoned on condition of their serving as faithful soldiers in the armies of the United States during the war, as an atonement for their crime. Colonel Campbell and his men saw hard and active duty during this time, but lost no lives nor had any of their men wounded. Captain Campbell and his militia from this county were ably seconded in their efforts to suppress the Tory sentiment then existing in Montgomery, by Colonel Walter Crockett, Captain Charles Lynch, Captain Robert Sayers and Captain Isaac Campbell. Captains Sayers and Campbell each commanded a company of men numbering twenty-eight and thirty-five respectively, at this time, and were not satisfied with a suppression of the Tories in Montgomery county, but thereafter proceeded to perform the same service in parts of Surrey and Wilkes counties, North Carolina. Captain Campbell and his men, in dealing with the Tories of Montgomery county, applied the same methods used so effectively in Washington county, of which we give one instance, that the reader may understand the methods used. "There is a beautiful little valley known by the name of "Black Lick," nestling among the mountains of Wythe county, which, being remote from highways and environed by uninhabited forests, afforded shelter for a number of Tories, who made frequent forays upon the neighboring settlements and then concealed themselves in this remote and quiet retreat. Their hiding place becoming discovered, General Campbell's men surrounded it, captured about a dozen and hung them upon two white oaks which, spared by the woodman's ax for the righteous office they had performed, were still standing a few years ago, and were long known by the name of the "Tory Trees."* * Chas. B. Coale. At the time in question, Captain Charles Lynch, of Bedford county, was manager for the Commonwealth at the Lead Mines on New river, and, as a result of the visit of Captain Campbell to Montgomery county in this year, he thereafter adopted Campbell's method of dealing with Tories and wrong-doers; and, ever after, during the war, when any of the inhabitants were suspected of wrong doing or treasonable conduct, they were dealt with according to what was termed "Captain Lynch's Law," and from this man and this occasion originated the term "Lynch Law," as it is practised throughout the nation, under peculiar circumstances, at this day. Upon the return of Captain Campbell and his men from Montgomery county, considerable complaint was made by the Tory inhabitants of that section of Virginia, and efforts were made to prosecute Campbell and his associates, but the Legislature of Virginia, recognizing the valuable services of these patriots, in October of that year passed an Act exempting them from all pains and penalties by reason of their acts, which Act of the Assembly is as follows: "Whereas divers evil-disposed persons on the frontiers of this Commonwealth had broken out into an open insurrection and conspiracy and actually levied war against the Commonwealth, and it is represented to the present General Assembly that William Campbell, Walter Crockett and other liege subjects of the Commonwealth, aided by detachments of the militia and volunteers from the county of Washington and other parties of the frontiers did by their timely and effectual exertion suppress and defeat such conspiracy; and whereas the necessary measures taken for that purpose may not be strictly warranted by law, although justifiable from the immediate urgency and imminences of the danger; be it therefore declared and enacted, That the said William Campbell, Walter Crockett and all other persons whatsoever concerned in suppressing the said conspiracy and insurrection, or in advising, issuing or executing any orders or measures taken for that purpose stand indemnified and clearly exonerated of and from all pains, penalties, prosecutions, actions, suits and damages on account thereof; and that if any indictment, prosecution, action or suit shall be laid or brought against them, or any of them, for any act or thing done therein, the defendant or defendants may plead in bar, or the general issue, and give this act in evidence."* * 10 Hening Statutes, page 195. In the summer of this year, at the instigation of British agents, Dragging Canoe and his band of Indians, living at Chickamauga, were induced to undertake a campaign against the Virginia and Carolina frontiers. While making preparations for the campaign, James Robertson, who was then at Chote, received information of their intended invasion and immediately informed the leaders on the Holston. Upon the receipt of this information it was decided that the militia of the two governments should unite, and carry on an active expedition against these Indians. Colonel Evan Shelby, of Sapling Grove (now Bristol), was selected to command the expedition. The forces from the two States assembled at the mouth of Big Creek on the Clinch river (near Rogersville, Tennessee), on April 10, 1779, Captain Isaac Shelby being in command of the forces from Washington county, Virginia. At this point the entire army, consisting of several hundred men, volunteers from the settlements, and a regiment of twelve-months' men, under the command of Captain John Montgomery, intended as a reinforcement to General Clark in the Illinois, temporarily diverted from that object for use in this campaign, embarked in canoes and boats, and descended the Tennessee river to the home of the Chickamoggas. The Indians were completely taken by surprise and fled in all directions to the hills and mountains, not offering any resistance. Forty Indians, at least, were killed, and their towns were destroyed, their horses and cattle driven away, and their corn and provisions, as well as twenty thousand pounds in value of stores and goods, carried off. Thereupon, the troops destroyed their boats and canoes and returned to their homes on foot. Thus it was that one of the cherished hopes of the British ministry was foiled and the prospects of the Colonies exceedingly enhanced. Colonel Shelby, while making preparations to conduct this expedition against the Indians at Chickamogga, dispatched John Douglass to the settlements on Clinch river, pursuant to the orders of Colonel Russell, but Douglas was waylaid and killed by the Indians and his horse ridden off. When the expedition against the Chickamogga Indians was decided upon, Colonel Evan Shelby dispatched John Hutson to the Indian town with letters to Colonel Joseph Martin, advising him to remove from the Indian country to the Great Island, agreeably to the Governor's instructions, but, unfortunately, Hutson was drowned in the execution of that business, and his widow, Eleanor Hutson was allowed by the General Assembly at its fall session in the year 1779, the sum of twenty-four pounds for the present relief of herself and children, and twelve pounds per annum during her widowhood. "In the summer of 1779, the Indians visited the home of Jesse Evans, who lived near the head waters of the Clinch river, and destroyed his family. On the morning of the day in question, Jesse Evans left his house, with five or six hired men, for the purpose of executing some work at a distance from home. As they carried with them various farming implements, their guns were left at the house, where Mrs. Evans was engaged in weaving a piece of cloth. Her oldest daughter was filling quills for her while the four remaining children were either at play in the garden or gathering vegetables. The garden was about sixty yards from the house, and, as no sawmills were in existence at that day in this country, slab-boards were put up in a manner called "wattling" for palings. These were some six feet long and made what is called a close fence. Eight or ten Indians, who lay concealed in a thicket near the garden, silently left their hiding places and made their way, unobserved, to the back of the garden. There, removing a few boards, they bounded through and commenced the horrid work of killing and scalping the children. The first warning Mrs. Evans had was their screams and cries. She ran to the door and beheld the sickening scene, with such feelings as only a mother can experience. Mrs. Evans was a stout, athletic woman, and, being inured to the hardships of the times, with her to will was to do. She saw plainly that on her exertions alone could one spark of hope be entertained for the life of her "first born." An unnatural strength seemed to nerve her arm and she resolved to defend her surviving child to the last extremity. Rushing into the house she closed the door, which being too small, left a crevice, through which in a few moments an Indian extended his gun, aiming to pry open the door and finish the bloody work which had been so fearfully begun. Mrs. Evans had thrown herself against the door to prevent the entrance of the savages, but no sooner did she see the gun barrel than she seized it and drew it in so far as to make it an available lever in prying to the door. The Indians threw themselves against the door to force it open, but their efforts were unavailing. The heroic woman stood to her post, well knowing that her life depended upon her own exertions. The Indians now endeavored to wrest the gun from her; in this they likewise failed. Hitherto she had worked in silence, but as she saw no prospect of the Indians relinquishing their object, she began to call loudly for her husband, as if he were really near. It had the desired effect; they let go the gun and hastily left the house, while Mrs. Evans sat quietly down to await a second attack, but the Indians, who had perhaps seen Mr. Evans and his workmen leave the house, feared he might be near, and made off with all speed. While Mrs. Evans was thus sitting and brooding over the melancholy death of her children, anxious to go to those in the garden, but fearing to leave her surviving one in the house, exposed to a second attack, a man named Goldsby stepped up to the door. Never did manna fall to the hungered Jew more opportunely, yet no sooner did he hear her woful tale than he turned his back upon her and fled as if every tree and bush had been an Indian taking deadly aim at him. Such were his exertions to get to a place of greater safety that he brought on hemorrhage of the lungs, from which he with much difficulty recovered. Seeing herself thus left to the mercy of the savages, Mrs. Evans took up the gun she had taken from them and started with her remaining daughter to Major John Taylor's, about two miles distant, where, tired and frenzied with grief, she arrived in safety. She had not been gone a great while, when Mr. Evans returned and, not suspecting anything wrong, took down a book, and was engaged in its perusal for some time, till finally he became impatient and started to the garden, where he supposed Mrs. Evans was gathering vegetables. What must have been his feelings when he reached the garden to see four of his children murdered and scalped. Seeing nothing of his wife and eldest daughter, he supposed they had been taken prisoners; he therefore returned quickly to the house, seized his gun and started for Major Taylor's to get assistance and a company to follow on and try, if possible, to overtake them. Frantic with grief he rushed into the house to tell his tale of woe, when he was caught in the arms of his brave wife. His joy at finding them was so great that he could scarcely contain himself; he wept, then laughed, then thanked God it was no worse. As is common in such cases in a new country, the neighbors flocked in to know the worst, and to offer such aid as lay in their power. They sympathized as only frontiersmen can sympathize, with the bereaved parents; but the thought of having to bury four children the next morning was so shocking and so dreadful to reflect on, that but little peace was to be expected for them. Slowly the reluctant hours of night passed away, and a faint gleam of light became visible in the eastern sky. The joyous warblers were gayly flitting from branch to branch and carrolling their sweetest lays, while the sun rose above the mountain summit, shooting his bright beams on the sparkling dewdrops which hung like so many diamonds from the green boughs of the mountain shrubbery, giving, altogether, an air of gorgeous beauty which seemed to deny the truth of the evening's tale. The light clouds swimming in the eastern atmosphere, brilliantly tinted with the rising sun, And the gentle murmur of the morning breeze, Singing nature's anthem to the forest trees, seemed to say such horrid work could not be done by beings wearing human form. But alas! while nature teaches naught but love, men teach themselves lessons which call forth her sternest frowns. A hasty breakfast was prepared and the men set off to Mr. Evans's house to bury the murdered children. With a heart too full for utterance, the father led the way, as if afraid to look at those little forms for whose happiness he had toiled, and braved the dangers of a frontier life. But a day ago he had dandled them on his knees, and listened to their innocent prattle; they were now monuments of Indian barbarity. Turning a hill the fatal garden was instantly painted on the retina of the fond parent's eye, to be quickly erased by the silent tears which overflowed their fountain and came trickling down his weather beaten face. The party came up to the back of the house at the front of which stood the milk-house, over a spring of clear water, when, lo! they beheld coming up, as it were from the very depth of the grave, Mary, a little child only four years old, who had recovered from the stunning blow of the tomahawk and had been in quest of water at the familiar old spring around which, but a day before, she had sported in childish glee. The scalp that had been torn from the skull was hanging hideously over her pale face, which was much besmeared with blood. She stretched out her little arms to meet her father, who rushed to her with all the wild joy of one whose heart beats warm with parental emotions! She had wandered about in the dark from the time she had recovered and, it may be, had more than once tried to wake her little sisters on whose heads the tomahawks had fallen with greater force. This poor, half-murdered little child lived, married and raised a large family."* * Bickley's History of Tazewell. In the spring of the year 1779, at the election held for members of the General Assembly of Virginia, Isaac Shelby and David Campbell were elected and served the people of Washington county for this year. During this year General E. Clarke, of Georgia, was compelled to take refuge in the settlements on Watauga and Holston, and, while in the settlements, repeated to the hardy frontiersmen many of the dastardly deeds committed by the British forces in their invasion and subjugation of South Carolina and Georgia. As a result, many of the citizens of these settlements returned with him to his home in Georgia to assist in avenging the wrongs of their fellow countrymen and, in addition thereto, creating throughout Southwestern Virginia and the Holston settlements a lively interest in the affairs to the south of the settlements. The officials of Washington county, Virginia, from the first organization of the county until this time, had, without question, exercised their authority as low down as Carter's Valley, upon the supposition that all that portion of the country was in Virginia, but, on the 30th day of September in this year, an occurrence took place in Carter's Valley, between William Cocke, lately a representative from Washington county in the Legislature of Virginia, and Alexander Donaldson, a deputy for Arthur Campbell, that resulted in greatly curtailing the territory included within this county. The circumstances connected with this transaction are best stated by the order of the County Court of Washington county, Virginia, entered on the 20th of October, 1779, which is as follows: "The complaint of the sheriff against William Cocke for insulting and obstructing Alexander Donaldson, deputy sheriff, when collecting the public tax about the thirteenth day of September last, and being examined saith; that, being at a point on the north side of Holston river in Carter's Valley, collecting the public tax, the said William Cocke, as he came to the door of the house in which said sheriff was doing business, said that there was the sheriff of Virginia collecting the tax, and asked him what right he had to collect taxes there, as it was in Carolina and never was in Virginia; that he said the people were fools if they did pay him public dues, and that he dared him to serve any process whatever; that he, said Cocke, undertook for the people, upon which sundry people refused to pay their tax and some, that had paid, wanted their money back again." "Ordered that the conduct of William Cocke respecting the obstructing, insulting and threatening the sheriff in the execution of his office be represented to the Executive of Virginia. "Ordered that if William Cocke be found in this county that he be taken into custody and caused to appear before the justices at the next court to answer for his conduct for obstructing the sheriff in execution of his office." As a result of this difficulty, the General Assembly of Virginia and North Carolina at their sessions, in the year 1779, appointed Dr. Thomas Walker and Daniel Smith, on the part of Virginia, and Richard Henderson and William B. Smith, on the part of North Carolina, commissioners, to run the line between the two States, beginning where Fry and Jefferson and Weldon and Churton ended their work, near Steep Rock creek, if found to be truly in latitude 36 degrees 30 minutes North, and to run thence due west to the Tennessee or the Ohio river. The commissioners ran the line without trouble for about forty miles, when they disagreed, the North Carolina commissioners claiming the true line to be about two miles north of the place at which the commissioners were then stationed. The Virginia commissioners proceeded to run the line to the Mississippi river and made their report. Nothing further will be said upon this subject at this point, but it will be separately treated in another part of this book. Suffice it to say that the line, as ascertained by the Virginia commissioners, deprived Washington county of from one-third to one-half of the territory supposed to lie within Washington county; and the North Carolina Legislature, at their fall session in this year, established Sullivan county, North Carolina, afterwards Tennessee, and the government of that county was organized at the house of Moses Loony in the month of February, 1780. Isaac Shelby, one of Washington county's representatives in the Legislature of Virginia, qualified as county lieutenant and Ephraim Dunlop, Washington county's deputy attorney, was appointed State's attorney for the new county. The act of the General Assembly of North Carolina erecting the county of Sullivan recites that the then late extension of the northern boundary line of the State from Holston river, that lies directly west from a place well known by the name of Steep Rock, makes it evident that all the lands west of said place, lying on the west and northwest side of said river Holston have, by mistake of the settlers, been held and deemed to be in the State of Virginia; owing to which mistake they have not entered said lands in the proper offices. It recites also, that by a line lately run, it appears that a number of such settlers have fallen into the State of North Carolina, and it makes provision for the security of their lands and improvements. These were the first lands taken from the county as originally formed. In the fall of this year Andrew Colvill, a citizen of Wolf Hills, was commissioned as escheator for Washington county, and Evan Baker was appointed deputy commissary on the western side of the Blue Ridge, agreeably to the order of the Governor and Council. On the 22d day of March, 1780, the County Court of this county entered several important orders, among the number being one fixing the county levy for the year 1779, at twenty dollars for each tithable, and appointing John Campbell, David Carson and Alexander Montogmery commissioners of the tax for that year, and James Dysart, Robert Craig and John Kinkead commissioners to collect that portion of the tax that was payable in commutable articles. Robert Craig and Aaron Lewis were recommended to the Governor as fit and proper persons for coroners of Washington county and were commissioned as such, and Benjamin Estill, Alexander Montgomery, Thomas Montgomery, John Latham, Joseph Black, David Watson, Aaron Lewis, James Fulkerson, David Ward, Robert Campbell, and Alexander Barnett, were recommended to the Governor as fit and proper persons to be added to the commission of the peace for Washington county, and were commissioned as such. These recommendations were made in view of the fact that quite a number of the members of the court of this county had been lost to the county when the State line was run and Sullivan county, North Carolina, was formed. By far the most important order entered by the court on this day was the following: "Ordered that it be recommended to the county lieutenant of this county not to call a general muster the ensuing month, on account of the apparent danger from the enemy and other distressing circumstances of the county." The army of Cornwallis was fast approaching the southern border of North Carolina, and every friend of the British government was stimulated into life and became a source of uneasiness and trouble to the back settlements. At this time General Rutherford, of North Carolina, made a requisition upon Sullivan and Washington counties in North Carolina for the aid of their militia in the defence of the State. Cornwallis was meeting with but little obstruction in his march and contemplated nothing less than the overrunning of North Carolina and the invasion of Virginia. It was this state of affairs that produced the alarm among the settlers in Washington county. At the April court, 1780, William Campbell was recommended by the court and commissioned by the Governor, as colonel of the county militia, in the place of Evan Shelby, who had become a citizen of the State of North Carolina. Daniel Smith was commissioned lieutenant-colonel, and William Edmiston major. At the same time the following militia officers were recommended and commissioned: Captains of Militia: James Crabtree, William Edmiston, David Beatie, Jr., William Edmiston, Jr., Alexander Barnett, David Beatie, Charles Cocke, and previously to this time and during the years 1778 and 1779, the following captains of militia were commissioned: George Maxwell, Thomas Caldwell, William Neil, James Fulkerson, Lieutenants of Militia: Robert Edmiston, Jr., William Bartlett, William Edmiston, Humberson Lyon, William Davison, Joshua Buckner, Joseph Scott, and in the year 1778-1779, the following: William Blackburn, Levi Bishop, Hugh Crawford, Solomon Litton, William Rosebrough, William Pitman, John Davis, Moses Loony, James Leeper, Roger Topp, Samuel Newell, John Lowry, George Finley. Ensigns of Militia: Robert Campbell, James Houston, Andrew Goff, Hugh Campbell, John McFerrin, Nathaniel Dryden, Daniel Davison, William Blackmore, and in 1778-1779: John Sawyers, Rees Bowen, Patrick Campbell, John Steele, Thomas Sharp, George Teeter, Samuel Vanhook, William Crockett. I give the names of the officers of the county militia from the formation of the county to this time with considerable particularity, as we know that every officer at the Battle of King's Mountain, from Washington county, was made up from this list. And it is more than probable that all the officers whose names (with very few exceptions) have been given were present on that occasion. At the county court held on the last Tuesday in April of this year John Yancy and Christopher Acklin were licensed by the court to keep ordinaries in the town of Abingdon, being among the first ordinary keepers in the town of Abingdon At the June term of this court there seemed to have been a little trouble among the gentry, which is evidenced by the following orders entered by the court on that day: "Ordered that James Kerr be fined two hundred pounds for insulting Joseph Scott in open court. "Ordered that William Robinson be fined two hundred pounds for insulting Joseph Scott. "Ordered that Joseph Scott be fined two hundred pounds for flashing a pistol at James Kerr in the court yard. "Ordered that James Kerr be fined twenty pounds for insulting James Montgomery." At the same term of the court Robert Irvin qualified as deputy for Arthur Campbell, sheriff of Washington county. The following order entered by the court on August 17th is given, because it designates the first settler at the head of Little Moccasin creek. "Ordered that John Snoddy, gent, give Alexander Barnett a list of tithables to work on the road from the mouth of Harrold's creek to Alexander Montgomery's old cabin, at the head of Little Moccasin." During the summer of this year the militia of this county was kept on the move in consequence of the threatened invasion of the British forces from the South. In the months of August and September one hundred and fifty men from Washington county saw active service on New river, about the Lead Mines, and over the mountains in North Carolina, under Colonel William Campbell, to prevent and suppress any attempted insurrection among the Tories in those quarters. The Cherokee Indians, in September of this year, began to give evidence of an unfriendly disposition, and every indication pointed to an Indian war, when the Governor of Virginia directed Colonel William Campbell to take command of an expedition against the Cherokee Indians, and it was left to his choice whether to take the troops down the Tennessee by water or on horseback. If the men went on horseback they were to be paid for such pack horses as might be lost without fault of the owner. BATTLE OF KING'S MOUNTAIN. While preparations were being made for this expedition and men were being mustered into service Colonel William Campbell was directed by the Governor to take command of the militia ordered to suppress the Tories who were at that time rising in arms, and to apply to that purpose the same means and powers that he was invested with for carrying on the Cherokee expedition, and, while making every preparation to execute the orders of the Governor, letters were received by him from Colonels Isaac Shelby and John Sevier requesting his assistance in a contemplated expedition against Colonel Ferguson, the British officer who was then stationed at Gilberttown, North Carolina. Acting under the orders of the Governor previously given, Colonel William Campbell joined in this expedition, and marched a number of mounted militia from this county to King's mountain, South Carolina. Many writers, in speaking of the campaign against Ferguson and of the battle at King's mountain, make the statement that this expedition was without authority of government, but Colonel William Campbell seemed to think differently, as is evidenced by a certificate made by him in his own handwriting in the year 1781 and recently discovered among some old papers in the auditor's office at Richmond. This certificate, with endorsements thereon, is here given in full: "I hereby certify that when I was ordered by the Executive last summer to take command of an expedition against the Cherokee Indians, it was left to my own choice whether to take the troops down the Tennessee by water, or on horseback, they were to be paid for such pack horses as might be lost without default of the owners. That expedition not being carried on, I was directed by His Excellency the Governor to take command of the militia ordered to suppress the Tories who were at that time rising in arms, and to apply to that purpose the same means and powers which I was invested with for carrying on the Cherokee expedition, under which direction I marched a number of mounted militia to King's mountain, S. C. Wm. Campbell (Col.)." June 16, 1781. Endorsed on back. 1780 certificate of Colonel William Campbell respecting King's mountain expedition. The situation to the south of Virginia at this time was truly alarming. The British had captured Charleston, with General Lincoln and his entire army, early in this year, and the war was transferred to the Carolinas and Georgia. General Gates, who had captured the British army at Saratoga and was in command of the Southern army during this year, was disastrouly defeated at Camden, and Colonel Sumpter and his body of patriots had been cut to pieces by Colonel Tarleton at Fishing creek. Detachments from the British army were scattered throughout South Carolina and Georgia. Colonel Buford and his Virginia forces had been defeated and cut to pieces by Tarleton's cavalry at the Waxhaw's, and every preparation was being made by Lord Cornwallis to overrun with his victorious army the States of North Carolina and Virginia in the order named. Lord Cornwallis had placed the command of the western borders of North Carolina and South Carolina under Colonel Patrick Ferguson, one of the ablest British commanders at that time in the field, and he had overrun and destroyed the Whig forces in his territory to such an extent that the officers and men of the Whig forces were driven across the mountains to the Holston settlements. A portion of the militia of Sullivan and Washington counties, North Carolina, under the command of Colonel Isaac Shelby, had been in the service of the State and had exhibited a great deal of ability and prowess at the battles of Musgrove's Mill and Cane Creek, after which they retired to their homes without suffering any inconvenience from Ferguson or his forces. Colonel Ferguson was greatly embittered toward the forces from the Holston or back waters (as it was then termed), and when he arrived at Gilberttown, he paroled a Whig prisoner by the name of Samuel Phillips, a relative of Colonel Isaac Shelby, and sent him to deliver a message to the officers of militia on the waters of the Holston, Watauga and Nolichucky, which message was as follows: "If they did not desist from their opposition to the British arms he would march his army over the mountains, hang their leaders, and lay their country waste with fire and sword." There can be no question that Colonel Ferguson was informed of the situation of the western settlers and the route by which he could reach their country, for at that time there were in his army a number of Tories from the back waters. A crisis had been reached in the struggle for liberty, and now at the darkest hour in the struggle of the patriots, the opportunity and the men have met, when a band of western frontiersmen were to strike a telling blow for the cause of liberty and all America. Phillips immediately crossed the mountains and delivered the message to Colonel Shelby as directed, and gave him such information, in addition thereto, as he had in regard to the strength and position of Ferguson and his men. Colonel Shelby immediately addressed a letter to Colonel William Campbell, of Washington county, Virginia, and sent it by express by his brother, Moses Shelby, while Colonel Shelby went to the home of Colonel John Sevier and informed him of Ferguson's threats, and suggested means by which they might embody a force sufficient to surprise and attack Ferguson in his camp and prevent the impending stroke. To the propositions of Colonel Shelby, Colonel Sevier readily agreed. On the 18th day of September, 1780, Colonel Charles McDowell, of "Quaker Meadows," North Carolina, and Colonel Andrew Hampton, of South Carolina, patriot leaders, with about one hundred and sixty men, arrived at Colonel John Carter's in Carter's Valley, fleeing from Ferguson and his forces. These men were consulted by Colonel Shelby, and a time and place appointed for the assembling of all the forces that could be enlisted for this expedition, at the Sycamore shoals or flats, on the Watauga river, about three miles below the present town of Elizabethton, Tennessee. It is stated by many writers on the subject that Colonel William Campbell refused to join Shelby in this expedition when first approached upon the subject, and that he consented only upon the receipt of a second and more urgent request, but I do not know upon what authority this statement is made, for on the 6th day of September of this year Colonel Campbell was at Bethabara, Surry county, North Carolina, with the Washington county militia, suppressing and preventing insurrection among the Tories in that section, and it is evident to any one acquainted with the country that he must have marched his men immediately from that point to Washington courthouse, and from there to the Sycamore Shoals, to have reached that point on the 25th of September. I do not think there can be any doubt that Colonel Campbell joined in this expedition very heartily, upon the receipt of information from Shelby, and that he, with the Washington county forces, entered upon this expedition with the greatest of enthusiasm, as is evidenced by the large numbers of volunteers collected and the rapidity of their movements. It is reasonable to suppose that Colonel Arthur Campbell was busy enlisting the militia of this county and equipping them for this expedition while Colonel William Campbell and his men were returning from North Carolina. Colonel Arthur Campbell, in speaking of the situation of the Southern Colonies, said: "The tale of McDowell's men was a doleful one, and tended to excite the resentment of the people, who, of late, had become inured to danger by fighting the Indian, and who had an utter detestation of the tyranny of the British Government. Upon the arrival of Colonel William Campbell, in Abingdon, on the 22d day of September, 1780, it was decided that two hundred of the militia of this county should accompany him upon this expedition. The men seemed animated with a spirit of patriotism and assembled at Wolf creek, near the Bradley farm west of Abingdon, from which point they marched immediately for the Sycamore Shoals, arriving at that point on the 25th day of September, according to appointment. Colonel William Campbell did not accompany the men to Sycamore shoals, he going by Colonel Shelby's at Sapling grove (now Bristol), while his men followed the Watauga road. Colonel Arthur Campbell, who had been left at Abingdon with a portion of the militia to defend the inhabitants of the county against any Indian invasion, at the earnest solicitation of the militia under his command, and wishing to give all possible strength to the expedition against Colonel Ferguson, on the 24th day of September left Abingdon with an additional two hundred men for the Sycamore shoals, and arrived on the 26th, just as the little army of mountaineers were preparing to march for the Carolinas. The approach of Colonel Arthur Campbell with the reinforcements and the effect that it had upon the army are best described in the words of a North Carolina historian: "When nearly ready to begin the march, the sound of approaching voices was heard once more. The camp was astir; unexpected visitors were discovered in the distance; nearer they came, and recognition was announced by a wild shout of joy, and Colonel Arthur Campbell led two hundred men into the camp. One thousand and fifty voices now made the welkin ring with their glad acclaim. Colonel Campbell, fearing that there might not be men enough to secure certain victory, determined, after Colonel William Campbell had left, to reinforce his strength. This being now done, he bade his men `Godspeed' and a hearty `goodbye,' and returned to his home again."* * Schenk, N. C., 1780-1781. Thus it will be seen that the militia of Washington county were not only willing to go when required to do so, but were anxious to strike a blow for their altars and their homes, and it is reasonable to suppose that, if the country had been free from the fear of an Indian war, twice four hundred men would have voluntarily accompanied Colonel Campbell upon this expedition. Let us take a look at the little army of patriots assembled at the Sycamore shoals. This army was made up and commanded as follows: Colonel William Campbell, 400 men Colonel Isaac Shelby, 240 men Colonel John Sevier, 240 men Colonel Charles McDowell and Andrew Hampton, 160 men The money to equip the North Carolina militia was obtained by Colonels Sevier and Shelby from John Adair, the North Carolina entrytaker, in Washington county, North Carolina; but the Virginia militia under Campbell were equipped by the Washington county authorities and paid by the State of Virginia. Every member of this little army, with but few exceptions, was dressed in the woolen clothes manufactured by his wife and daughters, and wore a fur-skin cap. A distinguished historian describes in such an interesting way the appearance of these mountaineers as they began their march, that I give his statements in regard thereto: "Their fringed and tasseled hunting-shirts were girded in by bead-worked belts, and the trappings of their horses were stained red and yellow. On their heads they wore caps of coon-skin or mink-skin, with the tails hanging down, or else felt hats, in each of which was thrust a buck's tail or a sprig of evergreen. Every man carried a small bore rifle, a tomahawk and a scalping knife. A very few of the officers had swords, and there was not a bayonet nor a tent in the army."* * Winning of the West. It would seem from the descriptions given by historians in speaking of this expedition, that the men were very poorly equipped, but, from an inspection of the records of this county, it will be found that the estates of the men killed at the battle of King's Mountain were valued very high, and that no part of their property was more valuable than their equipments at the time they were killed, a sample of which is as follows; appraised value:† † Captain Wm. Edmiston estate. "One blue broadcloth and linen jacket, £150 "One pair of leather breeches, 75 "One great coat, 150 "One horse, 600 "Every member of this little army was equipped with a Deckard rifle, and they were not only splendid horsemen but excellent marksmen; and by the warfare that they had been carrying on with the Indians they were accustomed to every kind of danger and hardship. They had oftentimes heard of the wrongs of their Whig kinsmen to the South; not only from Colonels McDowell and Hampton and their men, but from General Clarke, of Georgia, and his men, and they were determined, if possible, to prevent the advance of Colonel Ferguson to this side of the mountain, and to rescue their brethren to the South from their sad plight. "On the 26th day of the month when they were ready to march, the men assembled in a grove, and there the Rev. Samuel Doak, a Presbyterian preacher, the pioneer clergyman of the frontiers, made a few remarks befitting the occasion, closing the same with the Bible quotation: `The sword of the Lord and of Gideon.' And while these stern hardy men bowed their heads in reverence, this good man invoked on the expedition the blessings of the Lord. He recounted the dangers that surrounded his congregation from the savages in their rear and the British in their front; and reciting the promises of mercy contained in the word of their God, he earnestly prayed for protection to their families and success to those who were marching to defend their homes and liberty; and so effective were his prayers that tears stole down the cheeks of many of the rough and hardy mountaineers. After this the army mounted their horses and commenced their march for South Carolina. The route pursued by these men upon this march is a matter of considerable interest to their descendants, and I give the route as described by Draper in his history of the `Battle of King's Mountain.' "Leaving the Sycamore shoals, they probably ate their dinner at Clark's mill on Gap creek, three miles from the shoals; they thence passed up Gap creek to its head, where they bore to the left, crossing Little Doe river, passing on to the `resting place' at the Shelying Rock, about a mile beyond Crab Orchard and about twenty miles from the shoals, where they encamped for the night. At this place a number of their horses were shod by a man by the name of Miller. "The next morning they were delayed for some time in butchering several of their cattle, after which they passed on about four miles. Reaching the base of the Yellow and Roan Mountains, they ascended the mountain, following Bright's trace, through a gap between Yellow mountain on the north and Roan mountain on the south. When they had reached the table-land on top of the mountain, they found it covered with snow shoe-mouth deep, on the summit of which there were about one hundred acres of beautiful tableland and a fine spring that ran over into the Watauga. In this field the soldiers were paraded under their respective officers and were ordered to discharge their rifles, and such was the rareness of the atmosphere that there was little or no report. This body of tableland is known as the `Bald Place,' or `the Bald of the Yellow.' "At this point two men from Colonel John Sevier's company deserted. Their names were James Crawford and Samuel Chambers. It was suspected that they would make their way to Colonel Ferguson and inform him of the coming of the backwoodsmen, and this suspicion was correct. Upon the discovery of this fact, it was decided by the commanders that they would not pursue the route previously proposed, but would pass by a more northerly route, so as to confuse Ferguson should he send spies to make discoveries. After they had refreshments they passed on down the mountain a few miles into Elk Hollow, a low place between the Yellow and Roan mountains, where, at a fine spring, they encamped for the night. On the 28th they descended Roaring creek to the North Toe river, and thence down the Toe to a noted spring on the Davenport place, since Tate's, and now known as Child's Place, where they probably rested, and thence down to the mouth of Grassy creek, where they encamped and rested for the night. On the 29th they passed up Grassy creek to its head, and over Blue Ridge at Gillespie's gap to Cathey's mill, where they camped. The country that they had passed through to this point cannot be excelled in romantic grandeur anywhere on earth. It was excellently watered, broken by high mountains and interspersed with beautiful valleys. A North Carolina historian, in speaking of this country, says: "If we were to meet an army with music and banners we would hardly notice it. Man and all his works and all his devices are sinking into insignificance. We feel that we are approaching nearer and nearer to the Almighty Architect. We feel in all things about us the presence of the great Creator. A sense of awe and reverence comes over us, and we expect to find in this stupendous temple we are approaching none but men of pure hearts and benignant minds. But, by degrees, as we clamber up the winding hill, the sensation of awe gives way, new scenes of beauty and grandeur open upon our ravished visions, and a multitude of emotions swell within our hearts. We are dazzled, bewildered and excited, we know not how nor why; our souls expand and swim through the immensity before and around us, and our beings seem merged into the infinite and glorious works of God. This is the country of the fairies; and here they have their shaded dells, their mock mountains and their green valleys, thrown into ten thousand shapes of beauty. But higher up are the Titian hills; and when we get among them we will find the difference between abodes of the giants and their elfin neighbors." At Cathey's mill the troops were divided, Campbell, with his men, following a trail six miles south to Wofford Fort, the others going to Honey Cut creek, at which point Colonel Charles McDowell, who had left the Sycamore shoals in advance of the troops to notify the Carolina Whigs of the coming of the mountain men, rejoined the army. And, on Saturday morning, the 30th day of September, the mountain men passed over Silver and Linville mountains in an easterly course, and down Paddie's creek to "Quaker Meadows," where the fatted calf was killed and the mountain men regaled themselves in the beautiful valley. Soon thereafter, Colonel Benjamin Cleveland and Major Winston joined the mountain men with three hundred and fifty North Carolinians from the counties of Surry and Wilkes. It may be interesting to our readers to know that Surry county, North Carolina, joined Virginia on the south, and embraced that portion of North Carolina now included in the present counties of Ashe, Alleghany, Watauga and Mitchell, our nearest neighbors to the south. On Sunday morning, October 1st, the Whigs left "Quaker Meadows" with light hearts and eager footsteps, believing that they would soon be upon Ferguson and his corps. They rapidly advanced, passing Pilot mountain, and in the evening encamped in a gap of the South mountain, near where the heads of Cane and Silver creeks interlock each other, and on Monday they remained in camp for the day because of the rain that was constantly falling. On this day it was decided that it was necessary to have a military head to their organization, and Colonel McDowell was dispatched to General Gates, requesting him to send forward a general officer to take the command. The letter addressed by the officers to General Gates and forwarded by Colonel McDowell was as follows: Rutherford County, Camp near Gilberttown, October 1st, 1780. Sir:— We have now collected at this place about 1,500 good men, drawn from the counties of Surry, Wilkes, Burke, Washington and Sullivan counties in this State, and Washington county in Virginia, and expect to be joined in a few days by Colonel Clarke, of Georgia, and Colonel Williams, of South Carolina, with about 1,000 more. As we have at this time called out our militia without any orders from the Executives of our different States, and with the view of expelling the enemy out of this part of the country, we think such a body of men worthy of your attention, and would request you to send a general officer immediately to take the command of such troops as may embody in this quarter. Our troops being all militia and but little acquainted with discipline, we would wish him to be a gentleman of address and able to keep up a proper discipline without disgusting the soldiery. Every assistance in our power shall be given the officer you may think proper to take the command of us. It is the wish of such of us as are acquainted with General Davidson and Colonel Morgan (if in service) that one of these gentlemen may be appointed to the command. We are in great want of ammunition, and hope you will endeavor to have us properly furnished with that article. Colonel McDowell will wait upon you with this, who can inform you of the present situation of the enemy, and such other particulars respecting our troops as you may think necessary. * * (From original of "Gates papers" in possession of the New York Historical society.) We are, sir, your most obedient and very humble ser'ts. (Signed) BENJ. CLEVELAND, ISAAC SHELBY, JOHN LORD, AND'W HAMPTON, WM. CAMPBELL, JO. WINSTON. Isaac Shelby, in his old age, made the statement that Colonel McDowell was dispatched upon this mission for the purpose of disposing of his services, as he, by reason of his age, was too slow and too inactive for the command of such an enterprise as they were then engaged in, and this statement has been repeated by most historians. While it may be true, there can be no good reason for believing the statement, for, at this time, Colonel McDowell was only thirty-seven years of age, was an active and very intelligent man and had seen a great deal of service, before that time, in his campaigns against the invaders. It is much more reasonable to believe that Colonel McDowell, being the commanding officer in the county where the army was then stationed and knowing the country well, of his own accord proposed to deliver this message to General Gates. Upon the departure of Colonel McDowell the other colonels assembled and elected Colonel William Campbell, of Washington county, to command the whole, upon the suggestion of Isaac Shelby, who had, previously to this time, always from his earliest manhood taken orders from Colonel Campbell, who had served as an officer in the Continental army. On the morning of the 5th of October, the mountain men made preparations to march from their camp to the gap at South mountain, expecting to find Colonel Ferguson at Gilberttown and attack him. Before beginning the march, Colonel Cleveland requested the troops to form a circle, promising to tell them the news. After which, he came within the circle, accompanied by the other officers, and taking off his hat, addressed the troops as follows: "Now, my brave fellows, I have come to tell you the news. The enemy is at hand and we must up and at them. Now is the time for every man of you to do his country a priceless service, such as shall lead your children to exult in the fact that their fathers were the conquerors of Ferguson. When the pinch comes I shall be with you. But if any of you shrink from sharing in the battle and the glory, you can now have the opportunity of backing out and leaving; and you shall have a few minutes for considering the matter." After which Major McDowell and Colonel Shelby made a few remarks and requested all those who hesitated about going further to step back three paces to the rear when the word was given. When the word was given not one member of that army accepted the privilege, but a shout went up from the assembled hosts when it was ascertained that there was not a coward or a slink in that little army. After this the army marched down Cane creek a few miles and encamped for the night. On the following day they reached a point near Gilberttown and ascertained that Ferguson, hearing of their coming, had retreated. Colonel Ferguson, upon hearing of the approach of the mountain men, dispatched two messengers to Cornwallis, requesting assistance at once, and issued the following proclamation to the country: "Gentlemen:— Unless you wish to be eat up by an inundation of barbarians, who have begun by murdering an unarmed son before an aged father, and afterwards lopped off his arms, and who, by their shocking cruelties and irregularities, give the best proof of their cowardice and want of discipline; I say, that if you wish to be pinioned, robbed and murdered, and see your wives and daughters in four days abused by the dregs of mankind; in short, if you wish to deserve to live and bear the name of men, grasp your arms in a moment and run to camp. The `Back Water' men have crossed the mountains; McDowell, Hampton, Shelby and Cleveland are at their head, so that you know what you have to depend upon. If you choose to be degraded forever and ever by a set of mongrels, say so at once, and let your women turn their backs upon you and look out for real men to protect them. PAT. FERGUSON, Major 71st Regiment." He then retreated to Green river, where he gave out that he was retreating to Fort Ninety-six, South Carolina. He then proceeded to Dennard's Fort on Broad river, from which point he marched about four miles on the 2d day of October and lay on his arms all that night expecting an attack, and on the 3d day of October he marched to Tate's place, where he sent the following message to Cornwallis: "My Lord:— I am on my march to you by a road leading from Cherokee Ford, north of King's mountain. Three or four hundred good soldiers could finish this business. Something must be done soon. This is their last push in this quarter. "PATRICK FERGUSON." The position occupied by Ferguson at this time was sixteen miles northeast of King's mountain and thirty-five miles west of Charlotte, the headquarters of Cornwallis. It seems that it was the intention of Ferguson, when he began his retreat from Gilberttown to join Cornwallis at Charlotte, with all possible speed, but, for some strange reason, he was impelled to march to the southwest, where he was to meet his destiny and lose his life. He reached King's mountain on the evening of the 6th of October, where he pitched his camp and made all necessary preparations to defend his position, and gave utterance to the following sacrilegious boast: "That he was on King's mountain, that he was king of that mountain, and God Almighty could not drive him from it." The position occupied by Cornwallis and where the battle was fought, is in York county, South Carolina, about one and a half miles south of the State line. That portion of the mountain upon which the battle was fought was nothing more than an oblong hill or stony ridge, some six hundred yards long and about two hundred and fifty yards across from one base to the other, and from sixty to one hundred and twenty yards on the top, tapering to the south. "So narrow," says Mill's Statistics, "that a man, standing on it, may be shot from either side." The top of the ridge is about sixty feet above the level of the surrounding country. Many of the participants in the battle of King's mountain thought that they could see a resemblance to that battleground in the ridge south of and near to Abingdon, and to this they gave the name of King's mountain, which name it bears at the present time. The principal elevation on this range of mountains in South Carolina was about six miles from the battleground. We left the mountain men near Gilberttown, where they were informed that Ferguson had retreated some fifty or sixty miles in the direction of Fort Ninety-Six; which information greatly depressed them, but they determined to pursue, which they did immediately, as far as Dennard's Ford, where they lost the trail for awhile, but they proceeded to Alexander's Ford of Green river, where the officers determined to select their best men, best horses and best rifles, and to pursue Ferguson unremittingly and overtake him before he could receive reinforcements or reach any fort that would give him protection. The mountain men were for some time perplexed by the movements of Ferguson, and were unable to tell by what route he had fled, but soon ascertained from a Whig sympathizer, that Ferguson, on the evening of the 5th, had written a letter to Lord Cornwallis and had taken a position on the following day at King's mountain. The number of men selected on the night of the 5th of October, to make the forced march to overtake Ferguson, was about seven hundred, thus leaving behind about six hundred and ninety men. The Carolina troops thus left behind, were in charge of Major Joseph Herndon, of Cleveland's regiment, and that portion of Campbell's regiment left behind were in charge of Captain William Neil. The men selected were all well mounted, while those left behind were not. But Colonel Campbell placed the Washington county troops in charge of an officer of much energy of character, to whom he gave directions to do everything in his power to expedite the march of the troops placed in his charge, by pushing them forward as fast as possible. Campbell, with the mounted men, started in pursuit of Ferguson on the morning of the 6th of October, passing in a southerly direction to the Sandy Plains, thence southeasterly to the Cowpens, about twenty-one miles, which point they reached shortly after sunset, where they found Colonels Hill, Lacy, Williams and Graham, with their forces. On this day, they passed in the immediate vicinity of several large bodies of Tories, one of which numbered six hundred. "The riflemen from the mountains had turned out to catch Ferguson, and this was their rallying cry from the day they left the Sycamore shoals on the Watauga."* * Draper's King's Mountain. They did not intend to be diverted from their object, and therefore did not waste any time on the small parties along their way. Ensign Robert Campbell, of the Virginia troops, in his diary says: "That he was dispatched with a party of eighty men to break up the party of six hundred Tories stationed near the Cowpens, but that they had moved before the mountaineers reached the Cowpens and could not be overtaken that night." Captain Colvill undertook to surprise this same company the following night, but met with no better success. While the troops were stationed at the Cowpens, a Whig spy, who was a crippled man, reported to the Whig chiefs, that he had visited the camp of Ferguson, and ascertained his plans, and that his forces did not exceed 1,500 men, which information encouraged the mountain men very much, but, as a matter of precaution, Enoch Gilmore, another spy, was sent out to gain the latest intelligence in regard to the movements of the enemy, which he did, and returned to the camp of the mountain men on the evening of the 6th. When the march was begun from the Cowpens on the evening of the 6th, the whole number of mounted men was 900, besides a squad of footmen numbering about fifty. The march from the Cowpens to King's mountain was made by night and there was a drizzle of rain falling during most of the time. Campbell's men lost their way, and, on the morning of the 7th, it was ascertained that they were not more than five miles from the Cowpens, but they soon joined the main force and pushed rapidly forward in an easterly direction, passing the Cherokee Ford and on to Beason's where they halted for a short while and learned that Ferguson was only nine miles off and in camp. As Colonel Campbell rode off from this point, a girl followed, and, calling to him, asked: "How many of you are there?" "Enough to whip Ferguson if we can find him," was the reply, whereupon the girl, pointing her finger in a direct line to King's mountain, said: "He is on that mountain." Several persons were captured between this point and Ferguson's camp, one of the number being a man by the name of John Ponder, upon whose person was found a message from Ferguson to Cornwallis imploring assistance. Another was Henry Watkins, a Whig, whom Ferguson had just released, and who gave the mountain men accurate information of Ferguson and his situation. At this point the mountain men were drawn up in two lines, two men deep, Colonel Campbell leading the right and Colonel Cleveland the left, and proceeded on their march. When they came near to the mountain, they moved up a branch between two rocky knobs, beyond which the enemy's camp was in full view, 550 yards in front of them. This was at about 3 o'clock in the evening. Orders were given for the men to dismount and tie their horses, and to tie their blankets and coats to the saddles, and a few men were detailed to guard them. This was on the east side of King's creek, after which the order was given to the men, "Fresh prime your guns, and every man go into battle firmly resolved to fight till he dies." The army of Ferguson numbered about 1,100 men, the two armies being about equal in number, but there was a considerable difference in the motives which prompted them to fight. The Tories were fighting for the honor of their king. That was one and various other motives might be mentioned; while, on the other hand, the Whigs fought for the liberty and independence of the American Colonies, for the right to exercise their religious views without restraint and to protect their homes and families from unprincipled Tories and savage Indians. Dr. Draper, in speaking of the Virginia troops who participated in this battle, says: "Those men from the Holston under Campbell were a peculiar people, somewhat of the character of Cromwell's people. They were, almost to a man, Presbyterians. In their homes in the Holston Valley they were settled in pretty compact congregations, quite tenacious of their religious and civil liberties, as handed down from father to son from their Scotch-Irish ancestors. Their preacher, Rev. Charles Cummings, was well fitted for the times; a man of piety and sterling patriotism, who constantly exerted himself to encourage his people to make every needed sacrifice, and put forth every possible exertion in defence of the liberties of their country. They were a remarkable body of men, both physically and mentally. Inured to frontier life, raised mostly in Augusta and Rockbridge counties, Virginia, a frontier region in the French and Indian war, they early settled on the Holston, and were accustomed from their childhood to border life and hardships; ever ready at the tap of the drum to turn out on military service; in the busiest crop season, their wives, sisters and daughters could, in their absence, plant and sow and harvest. They were better educated than most of the frontier settlers and had a more thorough understanding of the questions at issue between the Colonies and their mother country. These men went forth to strike their country's foes, as did the patriarchs of old, feeling assured that the God of battles was with them and that he would surely crown their efforts with success. They had no doubts nor fears. They trusted in God and kept their powder dry. Such a thing as a coward was not known among them. How fitting it was that to such a band of men should have been assigned, by Campbell's own good judgment, the attack on Ferguson's choicest troops, his Provincial Rangers. It was a happy omen of success, literally the forlorn hope, the right men in the right place." The two armies now confronted each other, the decisive moment was at hand, and the mountain men were eager to pounce upon their prey. Colonel Campbell arranged his forces in two divisions, making each division as nearly equal as possible, the two divisions to surround the mountain. Campbell was to lead the Virginians across the southern end of the ridge and southeast side, then Sevier's regiment and McDowell's and Winston's battalions were to form a column on the right wing, northeast of Campbell and in the order named, under the command of Colonel John Sevier. Shelby's regiment was to take a position on the left of the mountain, opposite to Campbell, and form the left center, Campbell's left and Shelby's right coming together, beyond Shelby was placed Williams's command, including Brandon, Hammond and Candler, then the South Carolinians under Lacy, Hathorn and Steen, with the remainder of the Wilkes and Surry men under Cleveland, together with the Lincoln troops under Chronicle and Hambright. The regiments or companies in the order named surrounded the mountain; Campbell on the southeast, then Sevier, McDowell, Winston, Hambright, Cleveland, Lacy, Williams and Shelby. Campbell was to swing to the north the left of his column and Shelby to the south with his right wing, so that the two columns should cross the mountain at its southwestern extremity; and when all the companies were in position to form a complete cordon around the mountain, which was to be drawn closer to the center as the battle progressed. Colonel Campbell, when everything was in readiness, visited in person every command in the little army, and said to the men: "That if any of them, men or officers, were afraid, to quit the ranks and go home; that he wished no man to engage in the action who could not fight. That as for himself he was determined to fight the enemy a week, if need be, to gain the victory."* * Draper's King's Mountains. He gave the necessary orders to his subordinate officers and placed himself at the head of his own regiment. Many of the men threw aside their hats, tying handkerchiefs around their heads so as to be less likely to be retarded by limbs and bushes when dashing up the mountain. The march began for the battleground, and when the mountain men were discovered by Colonel Ferguson, the shrill whistle used by him was distinctly heard, summoning his followers to arms; the battle drums were beaten and every preparation was made in the British camp for battle. A party of Colonel Shelby's men captured some of the enemy's pickets without firing a gun. In ordering the battle Colonel Campbell had directed each company of his army to listen for the Indian "war whoop" from the center column when everything was ready for the attack. When heard, the army was to rush forward upon the enemy, doing all possible damage and repeating the same "war-whoop." The first firing occurred in the vicinity of Shelby's men, and before they had taken their position for the battle, but, they were not permitted to return the fire, until they had gained their designated position. Colonel Shelby directed his men to press on to their places and then their fire would not be lost. Colonel Campbell, about the time this firing began, taking his position in front of his men, threw off his coat and shouted at the top of his voice. "Here they are, my brave boys; shout like h—l and fight like devils!" The woods immediately resounded with shouts of the line, in which they were heartily joined, first by Shelby's corps, and then the shouting was instantly caught up by the others along the two wings."* * Draper's King's Mountains. At the same time, Captain Andrew Colvill, of the Virginia troops, and Major Micajah Lewis and Captain Joel Lewis, with their troops were directed by Colonel Campbell to charge the British main guard, about one half way up the spur of the mountain, which they did, and at this point, the first heavy fighting between the two armies took place. The charge was made by the mountaineers with such vigor that the British guard was forced to retreat, leaving some of their men killed and wounded, and the Virginia troops lost Lieutenant Robert Edmiston and John Beattie of Colvill's company, killed, and Lieutenant Samuel Newell of this same company was wounded, but Newell secured a horse, which he mounted and returned to the conflict. At this time an incident occurred which is preserved, and is here given. One of the mountaineers came within rifle shot of a British sentinel before the latter perceived him. On discovering the American, he discharged his musket and ran with all speed toward the camp on the hill. This adventurous Whig, who had pressed forward considerably in advance of his fellows, quickly dismounted, leveled his rifle, firing at the retreating Briton, the ball striking him in the back of the head, when he fell and expired."* The position assigned to Colonel Campbell's men was the most difficult of ascent of any part on the ridge, being very rocky and steep, but they were not to be deterred by such obstacles, pressing up the mountain little by little until they had reached near the top of the hill, firing all the time. When they had reached this point Colonel Ferguson ordered his Rangers to charge the Virginia troops with fixed bayonets, which they did. The Virginia troops stood their ground for some time, but were forced to retreat down the mountain. Colonel Campbell and Major Edmiston, with the assistance of Lieutenant Newell, rallied the Virginia troops. Colonel Campbell led his men again to the conflict, and by constant and well-directed fire the Virginians drove the enemy back and reached the summit of the mountain, when the mountain was covered with flame and smoke and seemed to thunder."* * Draper's King's Mountains. Colonel Shelby, in speaking of the conduct of the Virginians at this time, says: "Campbell, with his division, ascended the hill, killing all that came in his way, till, coming near enough to the main body of the enemy who were posted upon the summit, he poured in upon them a most deadly fire. The enemy, with fixed bayonets, advanced upon his troops, who gave way and went down the hill, where they rallied and formed again and advanced."† † Col. Shelby's letter to Col. Arthur Campbell, October, 1780. During this last attack Lieutenant Robert Edmiston, Jr., was wounded in the arm and sought shelter behind a tree, where John Craig bandaged his arm, when Edmiston exclaimed: "Let us at it again," and returned to the front as if he had not been wounded. A noted historian, in speaking of this incident, has said: "Of such grit was Campbell's Holston soldiers composed; and as long as there was any fighting to be done for their country and they could stand upon their feet, they never failed to share largely in it." While Campbell's men were engaged with the British Rangers, Colonel Shelby was pressing the enemy from the southwestern end of the mountain to such an extent that Ferguson was forced to withdraw his Rangers from that quarter and to charge Shelby's column, which, in turn, were forced to retreat before the British Rangers, but they were rallied at the foot of the hill, when Shelby addressed his men as follows: "Now, boys, quickly reload your rifles, and let's advance upon them and give them another h—l of fire!"* * Draper's King's Mountains. Campbell's and Shelby's men were engaged for fully ten minutes before the other forces reached their position, after which time Ferguson and his forces were assailed from all quarters by the riflemen, who, pressing up the ridge, protected themselves behind the trees, constantly firing on the British forces. Shortly after the opening of the battle it was discovered that a portion of Ferguson's forces had concealed themselves behind a chain of rocks at a very dangerous point, from which they successfully assailed the mountain men. Colonel Shelby directed Ensign Robert Campbell, with a company of Virginia troops, to move to the right and to dislodge the men from their position, which Campbell did, and led his men within forty steps of them, when he discovered that the Virginia troops had been driven down the hill. Then he gave orders to his men to post themselves opposite to the rocks and near to the enemy, while he assisted in rallying Colonel Campbell's men, which orders were obeyed, Ensign Campbell's men keeping up such a deadly fire on the British, that Colonel Ferguson was compelled to order a strong force to assist the men placed among the rocks, but they were compelled to retire to another position on the mountain before the close of the action. The battle was now raging all around the mountain; the report of hundreds of rifles and muskets, the loud commands of the officers, the Indian "war-whoops" constantly given by the mountaineers, and the shrill noise made by Ferguson's whistle, conspired to make a tumult never to be forgotten and seldom experienced by men. Colonel Lacy, with the South Carolinians; Major Chronicle, with his North Carolina forces; Colonels Shelby and Sevier, with the Holston forces; Colonel Cleveland, with his boys from Surry, and the other officers in this little army, magnificently vindicated in this conflict their claim to the title of patriots. When the British forces would attack any one command they would in turn be assailed by the mountain men in their rear and be forced to turn upon their pursuers, but every charge and counter-charge saw Ferguson's ranks grow thinner and thinner, and the coil was drawn closer and closer around the top of the mountain. Ferguson and his forces were surrounded by the mountain men, whose fire was so constant and deadly that it was with difficulty that the British officers could rally their men. The British troops began to give way on the southeastern side of the mountain, where they were hard pressed by Campbell and Shelby, and assailed in the rear by Cleveland, and on their flanks by McDowell and Winston. At this time two white flags were raised on the British line, but Ferguson immediately cut them down, swearing that he would never surrender to such banditti, Seeing, however, that he was whipped, with a few friends he made an attempt to break through the lines of the mountain men on the southeastern side of the mountain and make his escape, but in making the effort he was shot through with six or eight bullets. When Ferguson attempted to make his escape a mountaincer by the name of Gilliland, who had been several times wounded, seeing his advance, attempted to fire his gun at him, but it snapped, when he called upon Robert Young, a member of his company, saying to him: "There is Ferguson; shoot him," to which Young replied: "I'll try and see what Sweet Lips can do," whereupon he discharged his rifle and Ferguson fell from his horse dead, and his friends were driven back within the lines. Among the wounds received by Colonel Ferguson was one through the head. He received the fatal shot near Colonel John Sevier's company, and not far from the position occupied by Ensign Robert Campbell, who had been directed by Colonel Shelby to dislodge the British stationed behind a ledge of rocks as before detailed. The last conflict between Colonel Campbell's men, assisted by Colonel Shelby's men, and the British, lasted fully twenty minutes, the contestants being not more than forty yards apart. This is said to have been the most hotly-contested part of the action. Colonel Campbell at this time was some distance in front of his company urging them on to victory, and while in this position he called to his men: "Boys, remember your liberty! Come on, come on! my brave fellows; another gun, another gun will do it! D—n them; we must have them out of this."* * Draper's King's Mountains. While the British made a noble stand, they were driven to the top of the mountain to their wagons, from which position they were driven immediately into a low place in the mountain, where they surrendered. Colonels Campbell and Shelby were ably assisted by the bravery of the men under Cleveland, Lacy and Williams, who kept up a vigorous attack from their position. Captain DePeyster, the next in command, upon the death of Colonel Ferguson, immediately hoisted the white flag and called for quarter, which flag was soon taken from his hand by one of his officers on horseback and held so high that it could be seen all along the American line. This white flag was not the only one hoisted in the British army. At another point a British soldier was mounted on a horse and directed to hold up a white handkerchief, which he did, and was immediately shot down by Charles Bowen, a second soldier suffering the same fate; but upon a third attempt Major Evan Shelby received the flag and proclaimed the surrender, but the mountain men who had been scattered in the battle were continually coming up and continued to fire without comprehending in the heat of the moment what had happened,"* * Draper's King's Mountains. and many others were ignorant of the meaning of a white flag under such circumstances, while others were angered at the loss of relatives and friends at and before this battle. In the summer of this year Colonel Buford, in command of a body of Virginia troops, had been surprised and his command cut to pieces by Colonel Tarleton at the Waxhaws in North Carolina; Buford's men, when surrounded by Tarleton's forces, begged for quarter, which Tarleton declined to give, and they were cut to pieces without mercy. The circumstances attending this slaughter were well known to all the mountain men engaged in the battle of King's Mountain, and the word "Buford" had been adopted as the pass-word by the mountain men before engaging in this action, and when the British were driven into the low ground heretofore described, and were offering to surrender, numbers of the mountain men were heard to cry out: "Give them Buford's play!" and after the surrender the Americans continued to slaughter the British for some time, notwithstanding the efforts of the Whig officers to prevent the slaughter. About this time Colonel Campbell came running up, and, seeing Andrew Evans, a member of his command, about to fire on the British, knocked his gun up, exclaiming: "Evans, for God's sake, don't shoot! It is murder to kill them now, for they have raised the flag." Campbell, as he rushed along, repeated the order: "Cease firing! For God's sake, cease firing!" Campbell thereupon ordered Captain DePeyster, the British officer, to dismount, calling out to the British forces: "Officers, rank by yourselves. Prisoners, take off your hats and sit down." The mountaineers were directed to surround the prisoners in one continuous circle four deep. Colonel Campbell then proposed to his troops "three huzzas for liberty." At this time a small squad of Tories, who had been sent by Colonel Ferguson on a foraging expedition, returned to the mountain, and, not knowing of the surrender, fired upon the mountain men, killing Colonel Williams, of South Carolina. Colonel Campbell, acting upon his belief that Colonel Tarleton had arrived with his detachment, ordered the men of Colonels Williams' and Brandon's commands to fire upon the enemy, which they did, killing about one hundred of them, when the mistake was discovered, and the firing ceased. Colonel DePeyster delivered his sword to Colonel Campbell, while Captain Ryerson delivered his sword to Lieutenant Andrew Kincannon, of the Virginia forces. Colonel Campbell at this time was in his shirt sleeves, with his collar open, and when some of the Americans pointed him out as their commander the British officers at first, from his unmilitary plight, seemed to doubt it, but a number of officers now surrendered their swords to him, and he had several in his hands and under his arms. The battle was now ended after fifty minutes of hard fighting. Colonel Ferguson, the British commander, was killed, and the losses in his army were as follows: British Rangers. Killed, 30 Wounded, 28 Prisoners, 57 Tories. Killed, 127 Wounded, 125 Prisoners, 649 The killed and wounded in the army of the mountain men were thirty killed and sixty wounded. Colonel Campbell's regiment of Virginians from Washington county met with greater losses than any other regiment engaged in this battle, the killed being: William Edmiston, captain. Rees Bowen, lieutenant. William Blackburn, lieutenant. Robert Edmiston, Sr., lieutenant. Andrew Edmiston, ensign. Humberson Lyon, ensign. James Laird, ensign. William Flower, private. John Beattie, ensign. James Corry, ensign. Nathaniel Dryden, ensign. Nathaniel Gist, ensign. James Phillips, ensign. Thomas McCulloch, ensign. Elisha Pepper, private. Henry Henniger, private. And the wounded were as follows: James Dysart, captain. Samuel Newell, lieutenant. Robert Edmiston, Jr., lieutenant. Frederick Fisher, private. John Scaggs, private. Benoni Benning, private. Charles Kilgore, private. William Bullen, private. Leonard Hyce, private. Israel Hayter, private, and William Moore, private.* * The names of ten privates wounded in this battle cannot be ascertained. It is a fact worth remembering that in this contest thirteen officers and three privates of the Virginia forces were killed, being more then one-half of all the killed in this battle, and that three officers and eighteen privates were wounded, a little more than one-third of the men wounded in this battle; they were members of the Virginia companies. Another remarkable fact connected with this battle is that of the eight members of Colonel Campbell's regiment by the name of Edmiston three were killed and one wounded. Among the rocks where the Tories had posted themselves during this battle the bodies of eighteen Tories were found, all of whom had been shot directly through the head. All the prisoners were placed under strong guard. The Whigs encamped for the night on the battleground with the dead and wounded, and passed the night amid the groans and lamentations of the wounded Tories. A great quantity of powder, lead, shot and provisions were captured and approproiated as a result of this battle, and Ferguson's effects were divided among the officers, his sword being given to Colonel Sevier. Captain Joseph McDowell secured six of his china dinner plates and a small coffee cup and saucer; Colonel Shelby secured his large silver whistle, while a smaller whistle was obtained by Elias Powell, one of his soldiers; Colonel Sevier, his silken sash and lieutenant-colonel's commission and DePeyster's sword; Colonel Cleveland, his riding horse; Colonel Campbell, a portion of his correspondence; Samuel Talbot, of this county, removed his dead body from the place where it lay, and secured his pistol, which had dropped from his pocket. Dr. Draper has preserved several incidents relating to the soldiers from this county and their conduct in this battle, which are here copied in full: "During the battle Captain William Edmiston, of Campbell's regiment, remarked to John McCrosky, one of his men, that he was not satisfied with his position, and dashed forward into the hottest part of the battle, and there received the charge of DePeyster's Rangers, discharged his gun, then clubbed it, and knocked the rifle out of the grasp of one of the Britons. Seizing him by the neck, he made him his prisoner and brought him to the foot of the hill. Returning again up the mountain, he bravely fell fighting in front of his company near his beloved colonel. His faithful soldier, McCroskey, when the contest was ended, went in search of his captain, found him and related the great victory gained, when the dying man nodded his satisfaction at the result. The stern Colonel Campbell was seen to brush away a tear, when he saw his good friend and heroic captain stretched upon the ground under a tree with one hand clutching his side as if to restrain his life-blood from ebbing away until the battle was over. He heard the shout of victory as his commander and friend grasped his other hand. He was past speaking; but he kissed his colonel's hand, smiled, loosed his feeble hold on life, and the Christian patriot went to his reward. "Lieutenant Rees Bowen, who commanded one of the companies of the Virginia regiment, was observed while marching forward to attack the enemy, to make a hazardous and unnecessary exposure of his person. Some friend kindly remonstrated with him: `Why, Bowen, do you not take a tree? why rashly present yourself to the deliberate aim of the Provincial and Tory riflemen concealed behind every rock and bush before you? Death will inevitably result if you persist. Take to a tree.' He indignantly replied: `No! Never shall it be said that I sought safety by hiding my person or dodging from a Briton or a Tory who opposed me in the field.' Well had it been for him and his country had he been more prudent, and, as his superiors had advised, taken shelter whenever it could be found, for he had scarcely concluded his brave utterance when a rifle ball struck him in the breast. He fell and expired. "An incident of an exciting character occurred near the close of the contest which very nearly cost the heroic Colonel Cleveland his life. Charles Bowen, of Captain William Edmiston's company, of Campbell's regiment, vaguely heard that his brother Rees Bowen had been killed, and was much distressed and exasperated in consequence. On the spur of the moment and without due consideration of the danger he incurred he commenced a wild and hurried search for his brother, hoping he might yet find him in a wounded condition only. He soon came across his own fallen Captain Edmiston shot in the head and dying, and, hurrying from one point to another, he at length found himself within fifteen or twenty paces of the enemy and near to Colonel Cleveland, when he slipped behind a tree. "At this time the enemy began to waver and show signs of surrendering. Bowen promptly shot down the first man among them who hoisted a flag, and immediately, as the custom was, turned his back to the tree to reload, when Cleveland advanced on foot, suspecting from the wildness of his actions that he was a Tory, and demanded the countersign, which Bowen, in his half-bewildered state of mind had, for the time being, forgotten. Cleveland, now confirmed in his conjectures, immediately leveled his rifle at Bowen's breast and attempted to shoot, but, fortunately, it missed fire. Bowen, enraged and perhaps hardly aware of his own act, jumped at and seized Cleveland by the collar, snatched his tomahawk from his belt, and would in another moment have buried it in the colonel's brains had not his arm been arrested by a soldier named Buchanan, who knew both parties. Bowen, now coming to himself, recollected the countersign and gave it "Buford," when Cleveland dropped his gun and clasped Bowen in his arms for joy that each had so narrowly and unwittingly been restrained from sacrificing the other. This same author, in speaking of Campbell's regiment, says: "No regiment had their endurance and courage more severely tested than Campbell's. They were the first in the onset, the first to be charged down the declivity by Ferguson's Rangers, the first to rally and return to the contest. Everything depended upon successively rallying the men when first driven down the mountain. Had they become demoralized, as did the troops at Gates' defeat near Camden, and as did some of Greene's militia at Guilford, they would have brought disgrace and disaster upon the Whig cause. When repulsed at the point of the bayonet the well-known voice of their heroic commander bade them "halt!" Return, my brave fellows, and you will drive the enemy immediately!" He was promptly obeyed, for Campbell and his officers had the full confidence and control of their mountaineers. They bravely faced about and drove the enemy in turn up the mountain. In these desperate attacks many a hand-to-hand fight and many an act of heroism occurred, the wonder and admiration of all beholders; but there were so many heroic incidents where all were heroes, that only the particulars of here and there one have been handed down to us. Ensign Robert Campbell, at the head of a charging party, with singular boldness and address, killed Lieutenant McGinnis, a brave officer of Ferguson's Rangers."* * Draper's King's Mountain. There is a tradition in the Bowen family that Lieutenant Rees Bowen, when he received orders to march to King's mountain, took with him John Bowen, his son, a mere boy, who participated in the battle and brought home to his mother his father's bloody shoes. A similar tradition in the Breckenridge family is to the effect that Alexander Breckenridge, a prosperous farmer living in the vicinity of Abingdon, was accompanied to this battle by his son, George Breckenridge, who was under fifteen years of age, and that he (George Breckenridge) took an active part in the battle. On the morning of October 8th, being Sunday, Colonel Campbell's army drew the British baggage wagons, numbering seventeen, across their camp-fires, where they were burned, and, with all the provision that they could possibly carry, they began their return march for the mountains with all expedition possible, fearing the arrival of Colonel Tarleton, encumbered as they were with so many prisoners and such a quantity of captured stores. The prisoners were required to carry their own arms, as the Whigs had no other means of conveyance. The report was current in the camp, upon the morning the army started on its return, that Colonel Tarleton would attempt a rescue of the prisoners, numbering more than six hundred, and it is stated by a distinguished Englishman, who was at that time a prisoner, that before the troops moved Colonel Campbell gave orders to his men that should they be attacked on the march they should fire on and destroy the prisoners; but it is exceedingly doubtful whether such orders were ever given. Colonel Campbell, with a party of men, remained behind to bury their dead countrymen, and he directed the British prisoners to bury their dead. The British dead were interred in two pits—one a very large one, in which the Tories were laid side by side; the other a smaller one, in which doubtless the men of Ferguson's corps were buried."* * Draper's King's Mountains. The army marched that day twelve miles and encamped on the eastern bank of Broad river. The next day they marched up Broad river and encamped on the northern bank of Boran's river, and on the succeeding Friday Colonel Campbell issued an order directing that all the wounded soldiers who were not able to march should be placed by the companies to which they belonged at the most suitable place they could find, which was done. The army thereafter moved much more rapidly, encamping the evening of that day at Bickerstaff's Old Fields, where on the 14th Colonel Campbell issued a general order deploring the many desertions from the army and the felonies committed, by those who had deserted, on the poverty-stricken people of the country, and appealed to the officers under his command to suppress the bad practice. While in camp at this point the officers from North and South Carolina made complaints to Colonel Campbell that there were among the prisoners a number of men who were robbers and assassins; whereupon, Colonel Campbell ordered the convening of a court-martial to examine into the complaints. A copy of the law of North Carolina was obtained, which authorized a trial of persons charged with such offences by a jury summoned by two magistrates, and directed their execution if found guilty. The court-martial composed of the field officers and captains, assembled and conducted their meeting in an orderly manner. Witnesses were examined in every case, and, during the day, thirty-six men were tried and found guilty of murder, robbery and other offences, and sentenced to be hanged, and on the evening of the same day, an oak tree which stood near the camp by the road side was selected as a proper place to execute the orders of the court. The prisoners were brought out, surrounded by the Whig troops four deep, after which the hanging began. Three were hanged at a time, until nine of the condemned men had been executed. Then a young man by the name of Baldwin, a brother of one of the criminals, approached, and, placing his arms around his brother, who was about to be hanged, wept as if his heart would break, and, while doing so, cut the cords that bound his brother, who darted through the body of men and escaped, every man being so much affected by the actions of young Baldwin that not one man attempted to recapture or take his brother. At this point Colonel Shelby interposed and proposed that the executions should cease, and the rest of the thirty-six condemned criminals escaped hanging, being pardoned by Campbell, the commanding officer. The Tory leaders who were hanged at Bickerstaff were left swinging to the oak tree on which they were executed, but, on the following day, after the departure of Campbell's forces, an elderly lady living in the community, with the assistance of one man, cut the bodies down and had them buried. The march of the mountaineers began on the 15th of October, and, after a hard day's march, through a constant downpour of rain, they reached "Quaker Meadows," the home of Major McDowell, having traveled thirty-two miles; where the troops were tolerably well provided for. At this point on the following day, it was agreed that Colonel Lacy with his men should return to South Carolina, while the regiments of Colonels Sevier and Shelby, with that portion of Colonel Campbell's regiment that were on foot, were directed to take the mountain trail and return to their homes. The greater portion of Campbell's regiment, with Cleveland, Winston and McDowell and their North Carolina troops, decided to remain in the service and act as a guard to the prisoners. From "Quaker Meadows," Campbell's troops with their prisoners, marched several days in the direction of Hillsborough, arriving at Haygood's plantation on Briar creek, where Colonel Campbell discharged a portion of his men; from which point, on the 20th, he addressed a letter to his brother-in-law, Colonel Arthur Campbell, giving him an account of the battle, which letter is as follows: Wilkes county, Camp on Briar Creek, October 20, 1780. Dear Sir:— Ferguson and his party are no more in circumstances to injure the citizens of America. We came up with him in Craven county, South Carolina, posted on a height called King's mountain, about twelve miles north of the Cherokee ford of Broad river, about two o'clock in the evening of the 7th instant, we having marched the whole night before. Colonel Shelby's regiment and mine began the attack, and sustained the whole fire of the enemy for about ten minutes while the other troops were forming around the height upon which the enemy were posted. The firing then became general and as heavy as you can conceive for the number of men. The advantageous situation of the enemy—being on top of a steep ridge—obliged us to expose ourselves exceedingly, and the dislodging of them was equal to driving them from strong breast-works; though, in the end, we gained the point of the ridge, where my regiment fought, and drove them along the summit, nearly to the other end, where Colonel Cleveland with his country men were. There they were drove into a huddle, and the greatest confusion. The flag for a surrender was immediately hoisted; and as soon as the troops could be noticed of it, the firing ceased, and the survivors surrendered themselves prisoners at discretion. The victory was complete to a wish. My regiment has suffered more than any other in the action. I must proceed with the prisoners until I can some way dispose of them. Probably I may go to Richmond in Virginia. I am, &amp;c., WM. CAMPBELL, Col. Com. From Briar creek the army proceeded by slow marches, by Salem to Bethabara, a Moravian village, a large majority of the inhabitants of which were Tories. While stationed at this point, Colonels Campbell, Cleveland and Shelby made their official report of the battle of King's mountain, which report is as follows: "A statement of the proceedings of the western army, from the 25th day of September, 1780, to the reduction of Major Ferguson and the army under his command. On receiving intelligence that Major Ferguson had advanced up as high as Gilberttown, in Rutherford county, and threatened to cross the mountains to the western waters, Colonel Campbell, with 400 men from Washington county, Virginia, Colonel Isaac Shelby with 240 men from Sullivan county, North Carolina, and Lieutenant-Colonel John Sevier with 240 men from Washington county, North Carolina, assembled at Watauga on the 25th day of September, where they were joined by Colonel Charles McDowell, with 160 men from the counties of Burke and Rutherford, who had fled before the enemy to the western waters. We began our march on the 26th, and on the 30th we were joined by Colonel Cleveland on the Catawba river, with 350 men from the counties of Wilkes and Surry. No one officer having properly a right to command in chief, on the first day of October we dispatched an express to Major General Gates, informing him of our situation, and requested him to send a general officer to take command of the whole. In the meantime Colonel Campbell was chosen to act as commandant till such general officer should arrive. We marched to the Cowpens, on Broad river in South Carolina, where we were joined by Colonel James Williams, with 400 men, on the evening of the 6th of October, who informed us that the enemy lay encamped somewhere near the Cherokee ford of Broad river, about thirty miles distant from us. By a council of the principal officers, it was then thought advisable to pursue the enemy that night with 900 of the best horsemen, and leave the weak horse and footmen to follow as fast as possible. We began our march with 900 of the best horsemen about eight o'clock the same evening, and marching all night came up with the enemy about three o'clock, P. M., of the 7th, who lay encamped on the top of King's mountain, twelve miles north of the Cherokee ford, in the confidence that they would not be forced from so advantageous a post. Previous to the attack, on the march, the following disposition was made: Colonel Shelby's regiment formed a column in the center on the left; Colonel Campbell's regiment another on the right; part of Colonel Cleveland's regiment, headed in front by Major Winston, and Colonel Sevier's regiment formed a large column on the right wing; the other part of Colonel Cleveland's regiment, headed by Colonel Cleveland himself, and Colonel Williams' regiment, composed the left wing. In this order we advanced, and got within a quarter of a mile of the enemy before we were discovered. Colonel Shelby's and Colonel Campbell's regiments began the attack, and kept up a fire while the right and left wings were advancing to surround them, which was done in about five minutes; the greatest part of which time a heavy and incessant fire was kept up on both sides; our men in some parts, where the regulars fought, were obliged to give way a small distance, two or three times, but rallied and returned with additional ardor to the attack. The troops upon the right having gained the summit of the eminence, obliged the enemy to retreat along the top of the ridge to where Colonel Cleveland commanded, and were there stopped by his brave men. A flag was immediately hoisted by Captain DePeyster, their commanding officer (Major Ferguson having been killed a little before), for a surrender, our fire immediately ceased, and the enemy laid down their arms, the greatest part of them charged, and surrendered themselves to us prisoners at discretion. It appeared from their own provision returns for that day, found in their camp, that their whole force consisted of 1,125 men, out of which they sustained the following loss: Of the regulars, one major, one captain, two sergeants, and fifteen privates killed; thirty-five privates wounded, left on the ground not able to march. Two captains, four lieutenants, three ensigns, one surgeon, five sergeants, three corporals, one drummer, and forty-nine privates taken prisoners. Loss of the Tories: two colonels, three captains and 201 privates killed; one major and 127 privates wounded, and left on the ground, not able to march; one colonel, twelve captains, eleven lieutenants, two ensigns, one quartermaster, one adjutant, two commissaries, eighteen sergeants and 600 privates taken prisoners. Total loss of the enemy, 1,105 men, at King's mountain. Given under our hands at camp. (Signed) WM. CAMPBELL, ISAAC SHELBY, BENJ. CLEVELAND. * * Foote's Sketches, N. C., page. 266 The number of men composing the army of the mountain men on this expedition was as follows: From Washington county, Va., under Colonel Wm. Campbell, 400 From Sullivan county, N. C., under Colonel Isaac Shelby, 240 From Washington county, N. C., under Colonel John Sevier, 240 From Burke and Rutherford, N. C., under Colonel Charles McDowell, 160 From Wilkes and Surry, N. C., under Colonel Cleveland and Major John Winston, 350 1,350 The official report of the killed and wounded in the army of the mountain men, as published at the time and now on file with the Gates' papers in the New York Historical Society, gives the killed and wounded as follows: Return of Killed and Wounded.

On the 26th day of October, Colonel Campbell issued an order appointing Colonel Cleveland to the command of the troops then encamped at Bethabara, after which, Colonels Campbell and Shelby repaired to General Gates's camp at Hillsborough, Colonel Shelby to offer the services of a number of mountain men under Major McDowell, to serve under General Morgan. The object of Colonel Campbell's visit is best stated in a letter written by him to Governor Jefferson from Hillsborough, which letter is as follows: "Hillsborough, October 31, 1780. "Sir,— I came to this place last night to receive General Gates' directions how to dispose of the prisoners taken at King's mountain, in the State of South Carolina, upon the 7th instant. He has ordered them to be taken over to Montgomery county, where they are to be secured under proper guards. General Gates transmits to your Excellency a state of the proceedings of our little party to the westward. I flatter myself we have much relieved that part of the country from its late distress. "I am, your Excellency's most obedient and very humble servant, "WILLIAM CAMPBELL." General Gates directed Colonel William Preston to prepare a proper place for the reception and care of the prisoners, but Colonel Preston immediately answered General Gates, informing him that the Lead Mines would be an unsafe place for the prisoners, as a large portion of the inhabitants of Montgomery county were disaffected, and advised General Gates to send the prisoners to Botetourt county. General Gates, upon receipt of Colonel Preston's letter, was in doubt as to the proper disposition of the prisoners, and Colonel Campbell advised him to send the prisoners north to Washington's army, which idea General Gates partially approved, and directed Colonel Campbell to proceed to Richmond with dispatches to Governor Jefferson on the subject, which matter was referred to the Congress of the United States by Governor Jefferson, and that body, on the 20th of November, expressed it as their opinion that the governors of the several States whose citizens were numbered among the prisoners should make such orders respecting the prisoners as the public security and the laws of the respective States may require. Acting under this recommendation of Congress, that portion of the prisoners that had not previously thereto escaped were either paroled or enlisted in the militia of the States of North and South Carolina. Governor Jefferson, upon receipt of General Gates' report of the battle of King's mountain, transmitted the same to the Congress of the United Colonies, which body, on the 15th of November, adopted the following resolution: "Nov. 13, 1780. "A letter of the 7th from Governor Jefferson was read, inclosing a letter of the first from Major-General Gates with a particular account of the victory obtained by the militia over the enemy at King's mountain, on the 7th of October, last, whereupon Resolved:— "That Congress entertain a high sense of the spirited and military conduct of Colonel Campbell and the officers and privates of the militia under his command, displayed in the action of October, 7th, in which a complete victory was obtained over superior numbers of the enemy advantageously posted on King's mountain, in the State of S. Carolina, and that this resolution be published by the commanding officer of the southern army, in general orders." On the 15th of the same month the Senate of Virginia passed the following resolutions: "Resolved, nemine contradicente, that the thanks of this House are justly due to Colonel William Campbell, of Washington county, and the brave officers and soldiers under his command, who, with an ardor truly patriotic in the month of September last, without waiting for the call of Government, voluntarily marched out to oppose the common enemy, at the time making depredations on the frontiers of North Carolina, and on the seventh day of October, by a well-timed, judicious and spirited attack, with a force inferior to that of Major Ferguson's, then advantageously posted on King's mountain, with upwards of eleven hundred men, and by a perseverance and gallantry rarely to be met with, even among veteran troops, totally defeated the whole party, whereby, a formidable and dangerous scheme of the enemy was effectually frustrated." On the 10th day of November the Legislature of Virginia adopted the following resolutions: "Resolved that the thanks of this House be given to Colonel William Campbell, of the county of Washington, and the officers and soldiers under his command, who spontaneously equipped themselves, and went forth to the aid of a sister State; suffering distress under the invasion and ravage of the common enemy, and who, combined with some detachments from the neighboring States, judiciously concerted and bravely executed an attack on a party of the enemy commanded by Major Ferguson, consisting of about 1,105 men, British and Tories, strongly posted on King's mountain, whereby, after a severe and bloody conflict of upwards of an hour, the survivors of the enemy were compelled to surrender themselves prisoners of war; and that Colonel Campbell be requested to communicate the contents of this resolution to the gallant officers and soldiers who composed his party." Joseph Jones, Richard Henry Lee and Colonel William Fleming were appointed a committee to communicate the foregoing vote of thanks to Colonel Campbell, which they did, to which Colonel Campbell was pleased to return the following answer: "Gentlemen,—I am infinitely happy in receiving this public testimony of the approbation of my country for my late services in South Carolina. It is a reward far above my expectations, and I esteem it the noblest a soldier can receive from a virtuous people. Through you, gentlemen, I wish to communicate the high sense I have of it to the House of Delegates. I owe, under Providence, much to the brave officers and soldiers who served with me; and I shall take the earliest opportunity of transmitting the resolve of your House to them, who, I am persuaded will experience all the honest, heartfelt satisfaction, I feel myself on this occasion." Upon the receipt of Colonel Campbell's answer, the General Assembly of Virginia adopted the following resolution: "Ordered that a good horse, with elegant furniture, and a sword, be purchased at the public expense and presented to General Campbell, as a farther testimony of the high sense the General Assembly entertain of his late important services to his country." This resolution was not carried into execution in the lifetime of Colonel Campbell, but the horse and sword were afterwards presented to William C. Preston, a grandson of Colonel Campbell's, and United States Senator for many years from South Carolina. The gratitude of the people of Virginia to Colonel Campbell and his brave men for the great service they had rendered their country was unbounded, and the General Assembly of Virginia exhausted every resource in their power to make evident the gratification of the people. On the 14th of June, 1781, the General Assembly of Virginia adopted the following resolution: "Resolved, that Wm. Campbell, Esq., be appointed a Brigadier-General in the militia of this Commonwealth, and the Governor elect do commission him accordingly." And on the 22d of November, 1783, after the death of General Campbell, the General Assembly adopted the following resolution: "Resolved, That after the lands given by law as bounties to the officers and soldiers shall be surveyed and laid off, five thousand acres of the surplus be granted to Charles Campbell, in consideration of the meritorious services of his late father, General Campbell." And on the 9th day of December, 1780, the General Assembly adopted the following resolution: "Resolved, That the Governor be directed to forward to Washington county, thirty bushels of salt and six hundred pounds cash, to be by the court of that county distributed among the widows and orphans of the slain and wounded officers and soldiers of the corps that fought at King's mountain, in such proportion as by the said court may be judged proper." It is doubtful whether there is another county in this Union, whose citizens, either voluntarily or by command of the government, rendered such valuable services to their country in a time of imminent danger, as did the citizens of Washington county upon this occasion, and you may search history in vain for another instance in which the government of this Union or of any State has shown such gratitude to the actors. Thomas Jefferson, in speaking of this expedition in after years, said: "I well remember the deep and grateful impression made on the mind of every one by that memorable victory. It was the joyful annunciation of that turn in the tide of success which terminated the Revolutionary war with the seal of our independence." And America's greatest historian, in speaking of this expedition and its effect upon the public mind, said: "The victory at King's mountain, which, in the spirit of the American soldiers was like the rising at Concord, in its effect like the success at Bennington, changed the aspects of the war. The loyalist no longer dared to rise. It fired the patriots of the two Carolinas with fresh zeal. It encouraged the fragments of the defeated and scattered American army to seek each other and organize themselves anew. It quickened the Legislature of North Carolina to earnest efforts. It encouraged Virginia to devote her resources to the country south of her border." The appearance on the frontiers of a numerous enemy from settlements beyond the mountains, whose very names had been unknown to the British, took Cornwallis by surprise, and their success was fatal to his intended expedition. He had hoped to step with ease from one Carolina to the other and from those to the conquest of Virginia, and he had now no other choice but to retreat."* * Bancroft. Before closing this account, it is but proper that there should be given an incident connected with one of Washington county's brave soldiers, who lost a leg and who was badly wounded in his arm in this battle. "Among the wounded left by General Campbell at Bickerstaff was William Moore. Upon the return of the Virginia troops to their homes, information was imparted to Moore's wife of the wounding of her husband, the brave part he had taken in the action and the disposition made of him at Bickerstaff, whereupon, she immediately mounted her horse and, alone traveled in the month of November the long and dangerous road from her home in the upper end of this county to Bickerstaff in North Carolina, where she found her husband, nursed him back to health and strength, and brought him back to his home, where he lived an honored life until the year 1826. Tradition says that he was an elder in the Ebbing Spring Presbyterian church, and that for many years before his death he constantly attended his church; and, at every meeting, immediately upon the conclusion of the services, he would take his position, upon his crutch, at the entrance to the church, and receive the contributions of the people. Many of the descendants of William Moore and his wife, who was equally as brave as he, at the present time live in the upper end of this county and are numbered among our best citizens. At the time Colonel Campbell decided to join the expedition against Colonel Ferguson, he was making the necessary preparations for an expedition against the Cherokee Indians, under orders from Governor Jefferson, which orders were as follows: In Council, June 22, 1780. Sir:— Orders have been sent to the county lieutenants of Montgomery and Washington, to furnish 250 of their militia to proceed in conjunction with the Carolinians against the Chickamoggas. You are hereby authorized to take command of said men. Should the Carolinians not have at present such an expedition in contemplation, if you can engage them to concur as volunteers, either at their own expense or that of their State, it is recommended to you to do it. Take great care to distinguish the friendly from the hostile part of the Cherokee nation, and to protect the former while you severely punish the latter. The commissary and quartermaster in the Southern department is hereby required to furnish you all the aid of his department. Should the men, for the purpose of dispatch, furnish horses for themselves to ride, let them be previously appraised, as in cases of impress, and for such as shall be killed, die or be lost in the service without any default of the owner, payment shall be made by the public. An order was lodged with Colonel Preston for 1,000 pounds of powder from the lead mines for this expedition; and you receive herewith an order for 500 pounds of powder from Colonel Fleming for the same purpose, of the expenditure of which you will render account. I am, sir, your very humble servant, THOMAS JEFFERSON.* * Gibb's Doc. His. of the American Revolution, Vol. 2. Colonel Campbell, in his certificate heretofore given, states this to have been his authority for taking his men upon the expedition against Ferguson. Upon the return of Colonel William Campbell and his forces from King's mountain, Colonel Arthur Campbell, the county lieutenant of Washington county, immediately proceeded to organize and carry on the expedition against the Cherokees, as directed by Governor Jefferson. Upon his return from this expedition, on the 15th of January, 1781, he made a report to the Governor of Virginia, which is so full and complete, that I here give it in the words of Colonel Arthur Campbell: "Sir:—The militia of this and the two western North Carolina counties have been fortunate enough to frustrate the designs of the Cherokees. On my reaching the frontiers I found the Indians meant to annoy us by small parties, and carry off horses. To resist them effectually, the apparently best measure was to transfer the war, without delay, to their own borders. To raise a force sufficient and provide them with provisions and other necessaries seemed to be a work of time that would be accompanied with uncommon difficulties, especially in the winter season; our situation was critical, and nothing but an extraordinary effort could save us and disappoint the views of the enemy; all the miseries of 1776 came fresh into remembrance, and, to avoid a like scene, men flew to their arms and went to the field. The Wattago men, under Lieutenant Sevier, first marched to the amount of about three hundred. The militia of this with that of Sullivan county made 400 more. The place of rendezvous was to be on this side of the French river. Colonel Sevier, with his men, got on the path before the others, and by means of some discoveries made by his scouts he was induced to cross the river in pursuit of a party of Indians that had been coming towards our settlements. On the 16th of December he fell in with a party, since found to consist of seventy Indians, mostly from the town of Chote, of which were killed thirteen, and he took all their baggage, etc., in which were some of Clinton's Proclamations and other documents expressive of their hostile designs against us. "After this action the Wattago corps tho't it proper to retreat into an island of the river. The 22d I crossed the French river, and found the Wattago men in great want of provisions. We gave them a supply from our small stock: and the next day made a forced march towards the Tenasee. The success of the enterprise seemed to rest on our safely reaching the further bank of that river: as we had information the Indians had obstructed the common fording places, and had a force ready there to oppose our crossing. The morning of the 24th I made a feint towards the Island Town, and, with the main body, passed the river without resistance at Timotlee. "We were now discovered, such of the Indians as we saw seemed to be flying in consternation. Here I divided my force, sending a part to attack the town below, and with the other I proceeded towards their principal town Chote. Just as I passed a defile above Toque, I observed the Indians in force, stretching along the hills below Chote, with an apparent design to attack our van there without our view; but the main body too soon came in sight for me to decoy them from off the hills. So they quietly let us pass in order, without firing a gun, except a few scattering shot at our rear; at a great distance from the Cleft, we soon were in possession of their beloved Town, in which we found a welcome supply of provisions. "The 25th, Major Martin went with a detachment to discover the route the enemy were flying off by. He surprised a party of Indians, took one scalp and seventeen horses loaded with clothing, skins and house furniture. He discovered that most of the fugitives were making towards Telico and the Hiwasee. The same day, Captain Crabtree, of the Virginia Reg't was detached with sixty men to burn the town of Chilhowee. He succeeded in setting fire to that part of it situated on the south side of the river, altho' in the time, he was attacked by a superior force. He made his retreat good. "The 26th, Major Tipton, of the Carolina Corps, was detached with 150 mounted infantry, with orders to cross the river, dislodge the enemy on that side and destroy the town of Tilassee. At the same time Major Gilbert Christian, with 150 foot, was to patrol the hills on the south side of Chilhowee and burn the remaining part of that town. This party did their duty, killed three Indians and took nine prisoners. The officer of the Horse, by unmilitary behavior, failed in crossing the river. This trip took two days. "In this time, the famous Indian woman, Nancy Ward, came to camp; she gave us various intelligence and made an overture in behalf of some of the Chiefs for peace, to which I avoided giving an explicit answer, as I wished first to visit the vindictive part of the nation, mostly settled at Hiwassee and Chistowee, and to distress the whole as much as possible, by destroying their habitations and provisions. "The 28th, we set fire to Chote, Scitigo and Little Tuskeego, and moved our whole force to a town on Telico River, Kai-a-tee, where I intended a post, for to secure a retreat and to lay up provisions in. This evening, Major Martin, on returning from a patrol, attacked a party of Indians, killed two, and drove several into the river. The same evening in a skirmish we lost Captain James Elliott, a gallant young officer, being the first and only man the enemy had power to hurt, on the Expedition. The Indians lost three men on the occasion. "The 29th, I set out for Hiwassee, distant about forty miles, leaving at Kai-a-tee, under Major Christian, a garrison of one hundred and fifty men. "The 30th, we arrived at Hiwassee and found the town of the same name abandoned. In patrolling the environs we took a sensible young warrior, who informed us that a body of Indians, with McDonald, the British agent and some Tories, were at Chistowee, twelve miles distant, waiting to receive us. I had reason to believe the enemy had viewed us from the hills above Hiwassee; for which reason I ordered our camp to be laid off, fires kindled, and other shews made, as if we intended to stay all night. At dark we set out with about three hundred men (the Wattago men refusing to go further), crossing the river at an unexpected ford, and that night got near the town. Early in the morning of the 31st, we found that the enemy had fled in haste the evening before, leaving behind them as they had done at the other towns, almost all their corn and other provisions, together with many of their utensils for agriculture and all their heavy household furniture, with part of their stock of horses, cattle and hogs. These towns, I expected, would have been contended for with obstinacy, as most of the Chickamogga people had removed hence after their visitation in 1779. Our troops becoming impatient and no other object of importance being in view, it was resolved to return homeward. Major Martin, with a detachment, was ordered to Sattago, and the other towns on the Telico river. In his route he took four prisoners, from whom he learnt that several of the chiefs had met a few days before in order to consult on means to propose a treaty for peace. As I found the enemy were humbled and to gain time, I took the liberty to send the chiefs a message, which was as follows: "Chiefs and Warriors:— We came into your country to fight your young men. We have killed not a few of them and destroyed your towns. You know you began the war, by listening to the bad councils of the King of England and the falsehoods told you by his agents. We are now satisfied with what is done, as it may convince your nation that we can distress them much at any time they are so foolish as to engage in a war against us. If you desire peace, as we understand you do, we, out of pity to your women and children, are disposed to treat with you on that subject and take you into our friendship once more. We therefore send this by one of your young men, who is our prisoner, to tell you if you are also disposed to make peace, for six of your head men to come to our agent, Major Martin, at the Great Island within two moons. They will have a safe passport, if they will notify us of their approach by a runner with a flag, so as to give him time to meet them with a guard on Holstein river, at the boundary line. The wives and children of these men of your nation that protested against the war, if they are willing to take refuge at the Great Island until peace is restored, we will give them a supply of provisions to keep them alive. "Warriors listen attentively. "If we receive no answer to this message until the time already mentioned expires, we shall conclude you intend to continue to be our enemies, which will compel us to send another strong force into your country who will come prepared to stay a long time, and take possession thereof, as conquered by us, without making any restitution to you for your lands. "Signed at Kai-a-tee the 4th day of January, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-one, by "ARTHUR CAMPBELL, Col. "JOHN SEVIER, Lieutenant-Col. "JOSEPH MARTIN, Agent &amp; Major of Militia." "The fulfillment of this message will require your Excellency's further instructions, and in which I expect North Carolina will assist, or that Congress will take upon themselves the whole. I believe advantageous promises of peace may be easily obtained with a surrender of such an extent of country, that will defray the expenses of war. But such terms will be best insured by placing a garrison of two hundred men under an active officer on the banks of the Tenasee. "Our whole loss on this expedition was one man killed by the Indians and two wounded by accident. It would have been very pleasing to the troops to have met the whole force of the nation at once on equal ground, but so great was the panic that seized them, after seeing us in order over the Tenasee, that they never venturned themselves in sight of the army, but on rocky clefts and other ground inaccessible to our mounted infantry. By the returns of the officers of the different detachments, we killed twenty-nine men and took seventeen prisoners, mostly women and children. The number of wounded is uncertain. Besides these, we brought in the family of Nancy Ward, whom for their good offices, we considered in another light. "The whole are in Major Martin's care at the Great Island until the sense of government is known as to how they are to be disposed of. "The towns of Chote, Scitigo, . . . . . . . . . . , Chilhowee, Toque Micliqua, Kai-a-tee, Sattooga, Telico, Hiwassee and Chistowee, all principal towns, besides some small ones and several scattering settlements, in which were upwards of a thousand houses and not less than fifty thousand bushels of corn and large quantities of other kinds of provisions, were committed to the flames or otherwise destroyed, after taking sufficient subsistence for the army whilst in the country and on its return. No place in the over-hill country remained unvisited, except the small town of Telasee, a scattering settlement in the neighborhood of Chickamogga, and the town of Caloogac, situated on the sources of the Mobile. We found in Oconostato's baggage, which he left behind in his fright, various manuscripts, copies of treaties, commissions, letters and other archives of the nation, some of which shew the double game that people have been carrying on during the present war. There seemed to be not a man of honor among the chiefs, except him of Kai-a-tee, whom I would willingly have excepted had it been in my power. Never did a people so happily situated act more foolishly in losing their livings and their country, at a time an advantageous neutrality was held out to them, but such is the consequence of British seductions. "The enemy in my absence did some mischief in Powell's Valley and on the Kentucky path, near Cumberland Gap, besides three small children that they scalped on Holstein, one of the perpetrators of which, we knocked up on our return, and retook a number of horses. The Botetourt and Montgomery militia were too slow in their movements to do any service. The Virginia militia that served with me on the expedition, expect to be paid in the same manner with those that served last year in Carolina. "What provisions were needed on our setting out were purchased on short credit, which will, I trust, be punctually paid on the first application. Your Excellency will please to excuse the length of this narration. I thought it my duty to give a circumstantial detail of the facts, as the undertaking had something singular in it and may lead to important consequences. "I am, sir, your most Ob't and very humble Serv't &amp;c., "ARTHUR CAMPBELL." On the 1st day of January, 1781, the army of Campbell, Sevier and Martin divided into small detachments and returned to their homes by different routes, after having laid waste all the country occupied by the over-hill Cherokees. In answer to the talk sent to the Indians, a number of chiefs met Colonel Martin at Chote, but nothing was accomplished at this time. Upon the return of Colonel Arthur Campbell to his home, he immediately communicated with General Greene, the Commander of the Southern Department, when General Greene appointed Arthur Campbell, William Preston, William Christian, Joseph Martin, on behalf of Virginia, and Robert Lanier, Evan Shelby, Joseph Williams and John Sevier, on the part of North Carolina, commissioners, to negotiate a treaty with the Cherokee Indians, at the Long Island of Holston river, on the 24th of March, 1781; on which day, Colonels Campbell, Martin, Shelby and Sevier met at the Long Island and sent off one of the Indian prisoners to the Indian nation proposing peace and fixing the 10th day of June as the time; which time of meeting was afterwards postponed until the 20th day of July, 1781, on which day the negotiations were completed. But at the instigation of British agents, the Indians continued their depredations upon the white settlers. On the 13th of January, 1781, a settler in Powell's Valley was killed and fourteen horses that belonged to a party of men coming from Kentucky were carried off. In the latter part of January, a considerable number of Indians attacked Fort Blackmore* * Now Scott county. in this county, and, about the middle of February, three men were killed in Powell's Valley and a considerable number of horses carried off. A company of militia was organized by Colonel Campbell and ordered to patrol Powell's Valley, under the command of Colonel Joseph Martin and Major Aaron Lewis. As this company of troops proceeded on their outward trip, they discovered a large body of Indians in Powell's Valley. The Indians discovering the presence of Major Lewis, made their escape, but several traces of smaller parties, all making towards the mouth of Powell's river, were discovered, and the one that appeared the freshest was followed by Colonel Martin and his men, for about thirty miles below Cumberland Gap, where the Indians were surprised and surrounded, but the cane was so thick they could not easily be detected or pursued on horseback. Thirty guns at least were fired upon them, and, while it was thought that some of them were wounded, there were none killed or left upon the ground. Martin's militia captured a number of shot pouches and blankets, upon one of which was found the name, John Brown, written in full, the said John Brown having been previously killed in Cumberland Gap. Colonel Martin and his men pursued the Indians for about seventy miles. In the latter part of March, a party of northward Indians came up on the Sandy river and penetrated as far as the settlement on Holston, where they carried off a son of Captain Bledsoe's, and the frontiers were invaded at numerous other points by the Indians. The settlements were threatened by an invasion from the united forces of the Cherokee and Creek Indians, assisted by the British agents and Tories. Colonel Arthur Campbell recommended to the Governor of Virginia the building of a fort at the junction of the Tennessee and Helston rivers, and was actively engaged in building the fort at Camberland Gap as previously ordered by the Governor. The Continental Congress and the officers of the Continental army having ascertained the value of the mountain militia, a pressing application from General Greene for men was received by Colonel Arthur Campbell, the county lieutenant of this county. Colonel Campbell immediately ordered out the militia of this county, notwithstanding their circumstances were ill-suited to such an expedition, as matters with the Cherokees were still unsettled and the Indians from the northward were constantly invading the settlements. On the 25th day of February, 1781, one hundred men under Colonel William Campbell set out to join the militia of Botetourt and Montgomery counties, on their march to General Greene's army. Colonel Arthur Campbell, in a letter to the Governor on the 28th day of this month, said: "A large number would have gone, were it not for the daily apprehension of attacks from the northward and southern Indians." Colonel William Campbell and his men marched to a point at or near the Lead Mines, where they were joined by the Montgomery militia. In the month of March, 1781, Colonel Arthur Campbell, county-lieutenant of Washington county, made a return of the militia of this county, from which it appears that there were, at this time, in this county, 2 battalions, 6 field officers, 55 commissioned officers, 48 non-commissioned officers, 953 rank and file. In addition there were about one hundred men residing between Walker's and Henderson's lines, who did duty at times as their inclination led them." Colonel Campbell, with his company of one hundred men proceeded from Abingdon by the Lead Mines and on into North Carolina, where, on March 2d, he joined General Greene with four hundred volunteers. Colonel Campbell was now to oppose Lord Cornwallis, who had imbibed a personal resentment towards him as the commander at King's mountain, and who had threatened that, should Colonel Campbell fall into his hands, he would have him instantly put to death, for his rigor against the Tories, evidently designing to hold him personally responsible for the execution of the Tory leaders at Bickerstaff. This, instead of intimidating Colonel Campbell, had the contrary effect, and Campbell, in turn, resolved that, if the fortunes of war should place Cornwallis in his power, he should meet the fate of Ferguson. It was not long until Campbell and his men were called into action. The Virginia militia, other than Colonels Preston's and Campbell's commands, while on the march to join General Greene, were threatened with an attack from Colonel Tarleton's cavalry, with four hundred infantry and two pieces of artillery sent out by Cornwallis to intercept them. General Greene had dispatched Colonel Otho Williams to protect the advancing reinforcements from his camp at Speedwell's Iron Works, on the upper waters of Troublesome creek. The Virginia militia were marching on a highway, running west from a point below Hillsborough, to General Greene's headquarters. Cornwallis was in camp on the Alamance creek, about thirty miles west from Hillsborough. The command of Colonel Williams was between the camp of Cornwallis and the advancing militia. The roads leading from Cornwallis's camp and Williams's camp to the position occupied by the militia, intersected each other at Whitsill's Mill, which was the nearest point at which Cornwallis could attack the advancing militia. It was the design of Cornwallis to attack and scatter this militia force and to destroy the three thousand arms they were bringing to General Greene's camp. General Greene moved his camp to Boyd's Mill, within fifteen miles of Cornwallis, and Colonels Williams and Pickens were on the flank of the enemy. General Greene anxiously awaited results at his camp, seven miles above Whitsill's Mill. Thus matters stood on the 6th of March, when Cornwallis made a sudden dash north, expecting to reach Whitsill's Mill in advance of Williams, and, passing north ten miles further, to intercept the militia reinforcements at High Rock Ford on Haw river, but Cornwallis had hardly left his camp before Colonel Williams received the news, and the race for Whitsill's Mill began. They were traveling on parallel roads, Williams with his light troops flying to the rescue of his friends, Cornwallis with his heavy wagon train, dashing through every obstruction with reckless speed, hoping to intercept and destroy General Greene's reinforcements. "As the patrols and scouts passed from one column to the other, apprising each of the advance of his competitor, the race grew more animated, the competitors more earnest and resolute. The goal was now getting nearer and the excitement greater, when Williams, putting forth his whole energy, urged his men to a triumphant speed and dashed down the hill and across the Reedy Fork, as the enemy appeared upon the crest in their rear, entering from the other road."* * Schenck's North Carolina, 1780-1781. Colonel Williams drew up his forces on the north bank of the stream, where he attacked the British and checked them in their onward march. Colonel Williams' command was composed of some North Carolina troops and the Virginia militia under the command of Colonels Campbell and Preston, who, as previously stated, had joined General Greene on March 2d, and the cavalry corps of Washington and Lee. The position occupied by Colonel Williams' forces was in front of the ford and some two hundred yards below the mill. As the British forces approached, their riflemen formed the front rank and fired at a distance, continuing to advance toward the creek until they were within eighty yards of the American line, when Campbell's and Preston's riflemen fired upon them with deadly effect. One of the British officers, when shot, bounding up several feet fell dead. The enemy continued to advance, and when within forty-five yards of the American line, they were again fired upon by the riflemen. The enemy used their small arms and field pieces, but, in every instance, their firing was too high, and took effect only among the limbs of the trees. The enemy's forces were on the hill, and their view was greatly obstructed by the smoke from the discharge of the guns of the Americans, who were below them. One of the principal objects which Colonel Williams had in view was the protection of Whitsill's Mill for a time sufficient to enable the provision wagons belonging to General Greene's army to load with provision, which was effected, and to prevent Cornwallis from surprising the reinforcements on their way to General Greene. The Americans, having accomplished their object, retired over the ford, which was about three feet deep, with a rapid current, a slippery, rocky bottom and a precipitous brushy bank on the northern side. While crossing the ford, Major Joseph Cloyd observed Colonel William Preston, his commander, on foot, Preston having lost his horse in the skirmish, whereupon Cloyd dismounted and assisted Colonel Preston into his saddle, when both escaped. The principal part of the fighting in this skirmish was done by Campbell's and Preston's riflemen and Lee's Legion. Colonel Campbell, in speaking of this engagement, said: "John Craig, one of his riflemen, acted with his usual courage," and General Greene, in speaking of the battle, said: "The enemy were handsomely opposed and suffered considerably." Cornwallis immediately withdrew his forces from the Alamance to a position on Deep river, not far from Jamestown, North Carolina, and the militia reinforcements proceeded on their way and reached General Greene's camp at High Rock Ford, on Sunday, March 11, 1781, four days before the battle of Guilford Courthouse. All preparations were made by General Greene to give Cornwallis battle at the first opportunity, and while Colonel Campbell took fewer men upon this expedition than any other commander, he was assigned one of the conspicuous parts in the subsequent campaign, and all of the forces under his command have been since spoken of as "Campbell's Corps." The aggregate number of the Virginia militia, outside of the regular army, that participated in the battle of Guilford Courthouse, was as follows: Colonel William Preston's command, 300 Colonel William Campbell's command, 60 Colonel Charles Lynch's command, 150 Watkins's dragoons, 50 Virginia militia, 1,693 Total 2,253 It is estimated that the number of forces commanded by General Greene at the battle of Guilford Courthouse was not less than 4,500 men. General Greene, having collected an army of not less than 4,500 men at the High Rock Ford of Haw river, began his march from that place, on Monday, the 12th day of March, determined to give battle to the enemy upon the first opportunity, and reached Guilford Courthouse on the evening of the 14th. He encamped about a mile above the town that night, while Corwallis was stationed about eight miles above the Courthouse. Guilford Courthouse, at the time in question, was the capital of Guilford county, North Carolina, and contained a population of about two hundred people. Its principal buildings were the courthouse, jail and a large coppersmith shop. In recent years, it is nothing more than an open field, the county seat having been moved to Greensboro. General Greene had inspected the battlefield at Guilford courthouse on the 10th of February, and pronounced it very desirable for his army. "It afforded a forest where the militia could fight from tree to tree, for shelter, and be protected from the charge of cavalry, and for the same reason, a solid column of bayonets could not be kept together, among the undergrowth of the trees. The roads that concentrated from the north, northeast and east, all afforded safe lines of retreat for his army to his supplies and reinforcements."* * Schenck's North Carolina, 1780-1781. General Greene, in forming his line of battle, placed Campbell's corps, consisting of about five hundred and forty men, under the command of Colonel William Campbell, of Virginia, on the left of Butler's line and obliquely to it in the woods, and in the rear of the angle formed by these two lines was placed Lee's Legion, and in the rear of this line, on the gentle slope of the hill and about three hundred yards distant to the east, were posted the Virginia militia. On the evening of the 14th of March, Colonels Campbell and Lynch, each in command of a corps of riflemen, and Lieutenant-Colonels Lee and Washington, in command of the Light Dragoons, were advanced about a mile in front of the army and within seven miles of Cornwallis's camp. The next morning early, it was ascertained that the enemy was in motion and advancing toward Guilford Courthouse, whereupon Colonel Lee, with his Legion and about thirty of Campbell's riflemen from Washington county under command of Captain William Tate, of Augusta county, advanced to meet the enemy, while the rest of the riflemen, with Colonel Washington's Horse, formed at their place of encampment on the preceding night, to support Lee and Tate upon their retreat. Lee and Tate with their men met the enemy within two miles of their encampment and began to skirmish with them, and continued fighting and retreating for about half an hour, which disconcerted and delayed the enemy very much. In the skirmish between the forces of Lee and Tate and the forces of Colonel Tarleton, a loss of about fifty men was inflicted upon the British forces, while the light infantry of the guard, after losing about one hundred of their number at the hands of the riflemen, were relieved by a portion of Tarleton's cavalry, which were ordered to their assistance. While this skirmish was in progress, the main body of Greene's army was formed about three-quarters of a mile in the rear of the position occupied by Campbell and Washington; and, upon the arrival of Lee and Tate, the advance guard was ordered back and directed to take the position assigned them in the line of battle by General Greene. Lee's Legion and Campbell's riflemen formed the corps of observation on the left flank, while the riflemen occupied a woodland position. About this time the enemy began a cannonade in the center, which lasted about twenty minutes, during which time they formed their line of battle by filing off to the right and left, and then immediately advanced upon the American troops. The battle lasted about two and one half hours. While the militia on the left of the American line had been driven from their position, Colonel Campbell, with his riflemen, made such a spirited attack on the British regiment on the right wing, that it was driven back, and the fire became so deadly that Colonel Norton, in command of the first battalion of British guards, was directed to join the British line on the right and oppose the advance of Campbell's Corps; and at this point the struggle became desperate. "As the Hessian regiment passed the line of militia, it wheeled to the right, and, in line with Norton, faced Campbell. Campbell was reinforced by many of Butler's brigade, who retreated in that direction, and by all of Forbes' men, who formed on Campbell's right. Lee's Legion was on that flank. The Seventy-first Regiment of Highlanders continued on its course up the road and soon engaged Stevens' brigade of Virginians. "It had been the intention of Campbell to fall back and put his corps in line on the left of Stevens, but the Hessians passed so rapidly in the front as to cut him off. He was also delayed by his conflict with Norton on the left. The riflemen, retiring deeper into the forest, took to the trees, and made it so hot for the guards that they were compelled to retreat in great disorder. Cornwallis came in person to their rescue, and by riding in their front and exposing himself to imminent danger, succeeded in rallying them. The Hessians, being now joined again by the guards, made a combined charge and drove Campbell to the south, and entirely separated his command from the American army, so that, in fact, two distinct battles were raging at the same time. "About one-quarter of a mile on the southeast of Campbell's first position Cornwallis, who was following up Norton and the Hessians, had a large iron gray horse shot under him. The spot is now marked by a persimmon tree, a century old, whose identity is well authenticated by tradition. "Campbell would retreat and fire, then the British would fall back, and, using the bayonet, push the riflemen back again; so it raged and alternated between them until Campbell was driven to a high range of hills, or a little mountain range as it is sometimes called, about one mile from Campbell's first position. Here the riflemen began to gain a decided advantage and to drive the Hessians before them, when Lee, unexpectedly, left Campbell's flank and Tarleton appeared on the scene."* * Schenck's North Carolina, 1780-1781 Lee suddenly left Campbell without warning, and was now an idle spectator of this scene from the courthouse hill, across Hunting creek, without notifying Greene of his presence or offering to cover the flanks. Colonel Tarleton had been sent by Cornwallis to rescue Colonel Norton, who was engaged by Campbell, and Tarleton, finding Campbell's rear unprotected, ordered the Hessians to fire, and rushed his cavalry on the riflemen under cover of smoke and cut them to pieces. "Colonel Campbell, with his Virginia and North Carolina riflemen, was the last to fire a gun on this bloody field, and was still firing when Greene sounded the retreat. They became scattered after Tarleton's charge upon them, and made their way as best they could to the camp of Greene next day."* Colonel Campbell was very much angered at Colonel Lee, and freely expressed his opinion of his conduct, charging that Colonel Lee, with his cavalry, rode off just as Tarleton began his charge upon the flanks of the riflemen. It is the opinion of many that, had Colonel Lee acted well his part in this battle, Cornwallis would have been defeated and possibly captured, instead of the American army being forced to retreat. General Greene, with his army, retreated in good order to Speedwell's Furnace, about ten miles below the battlefield, not being pursued by the enemy further than the heights above Guilford Courthouse. Cornwallis, with his army, remained on the battleground from Thursday until Sunday, and on the evening of that day began a retreat to the south. The loss of General Greene in this battle was 320 men killed and wounded, while the British killed and wounded exceeded 600. General Greene, on the 19th day of March, addressed the following letter to Colonel Campbell: "Headquarters, March 19, 1781. "Sir,— Your faithful services and the exertions which you made to second the efforts of the Southern army, on the 15th inst., claim my warmest thanks. It would be ungenerous not to acknowledge my entire approbation of your conduct, and the spirited and manly behavior of the officers and soldiers under you. Sensible of your merit, I feel a pleasure in doing justice to it. Most of the riflemen having gone home, and not having it in my power to make up another command, you have my permission to return home to your friends, and should the emergency of the southern operations require your further exertions, I will advertise you. "I am, sir, with great esteem, your most humble servant, "NATH'L GREENE. "Colonel Campbell." And Colonel Henry Lee, the officer who had so ingloriously deserted Colonel Campbell during the battle, had the audacity to address the following letter to Colonel Campbell: "March 17, 1781. "I am very happy in informing you that the bravery of your battalion, displayed in the action of the 15th, is particularly noticed by the General. It is much to be lamented that a failure took place in the line which lost the day, separated us from the main body and exposed our retreat. I hope your men are safe and that the scattered will collect again. Be pleased to favor me with a return of your loss, and prepare your men for a second battle. "I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant, "HENRY LEE, Jun. "Colonel Campbell." But, notwithstanding the kind words spoken and many urgent requests made, General Campbell, on the 20th of the month, resigned his commission and returned to his home, declaring he could not longer serve his country in the army with honor; and he would not serve in the army longer where Colonel Lee held a commission. Cornwallis, while he succeeded in forcing General Greene to retreat, was really the loser in this battle, and on the Sunday following, for the preservation of himself and army, he began an inglorious retreat that terminated at Yorktown, where he was compelled, on the 19th day of October, 1781, to surrender his sword and army to the American forces. Colonel William Campbell, immediately upon his return to his home, announced himself a candidate for the House of Delegates, to which position he was elected in the spring of the year 1781. The General Assembly met in Richmond in May of that year, but were forced to adjourn their proceedings first to Charlottesville and afterwards to Staunton to prevent capture by Colonel Tarleton. On the 14th day of June the House of Delegates appointed Colonel Campbell a brigadier-general of militia, to serve under Marquis de Lafayette, who was then in command of the Continental forces in Virginia. General Campbell immediately obtained a leave of absence and repaired to the army, where General Lafayette assigned him to the command of the Light Infantry and Riflemen. General Campbell became a great favorite with Lafayette, who placed a great deal of confidence in his judgment and ability. General Campbell was in command of a brigade marching in the direction of Yorktown through Cumberland county, Virginia. * * Col. John Redd MSS. One night he encamped his men near the residence of an old English parson by the name of McRea, who had been drawing his 16,000 pounds of tobacco for many years, and was quite wealthy. When the regiment pitched their tents General Campbell went a few miles to spend the night with a friend. The next morning when he returned, his officers informed him that old McRae had been down, and said all he could to discourage the soldiers. He had told them that they had not the most distant idea of the dangers they were about to encounter; that Cornwallis had a very large army, composed of the finest troops that had ever left England, and it was perfect folly to think of encountering them. He wound up by saying that they were going to a slaughter-pen, and his Lord Cornwallis would slaughter them like a parcel of beeves. As soon as Campbell heard this he sent three of his soldiers up to the house of McRea, with directions to tell him that he wished to see him, and if he refused to come they must bring him by force. McRea soon arrived at the camp. Campbell informed him that he had during his absence said all that could have been said to discourage his men, that he deserved corporal punishment, but on account of his old age he would not inflict that on him, but when his men started he would show him how his men and the rest of the patriots would serve his Lord Cornwallis. When the regiment was ready to start Campbell commanded McRea to lie down and stretch himself out full length across the road. As soon as the parson was stretched out full length every man stepped over him. Campbell informed him that was the way he intended to serve his Lord Cornwallis. The parson left our gallant general in such an ill humor that I am afraid his prayers did not accompany the gallant commander of the regiment."* * John Redd MSS. While Lord Cornwallis was encamped at Williamsburg and Lafayette was six miles distant towards Richmond, General Campbell, who was in command of a brigade of light troops connected with Lafayette's army, posted a picket guard at the Three Burnt Chimneys, about midway between the hostile camps. Upon several occasions the enemy sent out a superior body of horsemen and drove in the American pickets. Colonel Campbell saw in this an opportunity to strike the enemy a severe blow, and on the following morning he posted a large body of mounted riflemen with himself at their head in a grove by the roadside, a short distance in the rear of the Burnt Chimneys, and, as usual, the pickets were posted at the Chimneys, with instructions to retire on the approach of the British cavalry. As usual, a large force of British cavalry was sent to drive in the pickets, and in doing so they pursued them under whip and spur, but when they reached the grove they met with an unexpected reception. Campbell's riflemen welcomed them with a volley of rifle balls, which killed more than twenty of their cavalry and forty of their horses. It is useless to say that the American pickets were not again disturbed. Soon thereafter General Campbell was afflicted with a pain in his breast, which disabled him, when he was conveyed to the residence of Colonel John Syme at Rocky Mills, Hanover county, where, after a few days' illness, he expired on August 22, 1781, in his thirty-sixth year. When General Lafayette received the intelligence of the death of General Campbell he issued the following order: "The general has no doubt that the army will unite with him in regretting General Campbell's death, an officer whose services must have endeared him to every citizen, and in particular to every American soldier. The glory which General Campbell acquired in the affairs of King's mountain and Guilford Courthouse does his memory everlasting honor and insures him a high rank among the defenders of liberty in the American cause. "The general wishes it had been possible for himself and the officers of the army to pay him those honors to which his rank, but particularly his merit, so highly entitled him, but his great distance from the army and our present situation render it impossible. "The lieutenant of the county will assemble a corps to pay military honors to the deceased general. General Stephens is requested to name a deputation of four field officers, and will immediately repair to Rocky Mills, and, in the name of the army, pay General Campbell their last respects." General Campbell was buried in Hanover county, but his body was afterwards removed to Aspinvale, his home, near Seven-Mile Ford. The settlements on the Holston were now being constantly assailed by the Indians. Captain Moses Loony was captured and carried into captivity, where he remained with the Indians until August of this year, when he was sent by them to inform the authorities that they had collected all the prisoners they had taken, about fifty in number, at Chote, and were ready to deliver them to Colonel Martin; also that the Indian chiefs were ready to attend anywhere, and the whole nation was ready to make peace. In March of this year Colonels John Sevier and Isaac Shelby undertook an expedition against the Chickamogga Indians, and to assist in this undertaking 200 of the militia of Washington county joined Colonel Isaac Shelby and marched to the Big Island in the French Broad river, where the troops were rendezvoused, from which point they marched for the sources of the Mobile river, and after the third day they crossed the Tennessee river at Scitico, at which point they held a council with the friendly Indians. On the 6th day they encamped on the Hiwassee river, and on the 7th day they crossed the river and passed into the territory of the hostile Indians. Colonel Sevier, with his forces, marched immediately against Vann's Towns, which he reduced to ashes, and thence to Bull Town, at the head of Chickamogga creek. After the destruction of this town they marched to the Coosa river, where they killed a white man by the name of Clements, upon whose person was found papers from which it was ascertained that he was a sergeant in the British army, and it was believed that he instigated the Indians in their depredations against the frontiers. The army then proceeded to Spring Frog Town, thence up the Coosa river to Estanola, an Indian town, which they destroyed. After thus destroying the Indian towns and killing all the Indian warriors they could find, the troops returned to Chote, where a council was held with the friendly Indians, at the conclusion of which the troops were disbanded and returned to their homes. This may be said to be the last expedition against the Indians in which the militia of Washington county in any numbers participated. Washington county was not much longer to be considered a portion of the frontiers, and her citizens soldiery was soon to be deprived of an occupation which they always followed with avidity—that of waging war against the Indians and Tories. In April of this year a party of Northward Indians came into the settlement on Clinch and killed and scalped two daughters of Captain John Maxwell's and took nine prisoners. On the same occasion they visited the home of Captain Robert Moffett near the Clinch river. Two sons of Captain Moffett's being at a sugar camp near their home, were killed and scalped by the Indians. Thomas Inglis, who was reared at Draper's Meadows, had, with his family, some time previous to this time, settled in Burk's Garden on a piece of land that had been patented by his father, William Inglis, about thirty years previously. His nearest and only neighbor at this time was Joseph Hix, who lived about two miles from his home. A large party of Indians under the command of "Black Wolf," a noted Indian warrior, in April of this year visited Burk's Garden, and while Inglis was out on his farm surrounded his house and took his wife and three children and a negro man and woman prisoners, and, after loading the negroes with as much property as they could carry, they burned the house. Inglis, observing the size of the party, decided to make his way to the nearest settlement and obtain help. He, with a colored man, crossed the mountains to the settlement in the Rich Valley (now Smyth county), and arrived at that point at a very opportune time, the day being the muster day for the militia of the community. As soon as Inglis gave information of what had occurred, about twenty men volunteered to go in pursuit of the Indians, and immediately began the march for Inglis' home, which they reached the next morning about daybreak, to find nothing but a heap of ashes where Inglis' house had formerly stood. Joseph Hix, Inglis' neighbor, discovering the presence of the Indians in the community, immediately made his way to a small settlement, about six miles away, where he obtained about six volunteers and returned to Burk's Garden and joined the forces from Rich Valley. The company thus composed immediately began the pursuit of the Indians. Captain James Maxwell, who had during the same month lost two of his daughters at the hands of the Indians, was placed in command of the pursuers, and, after five days' cautious marching, the Indians were discovered in camp in a gap of Tug mountain. The pursuers were at once divided into two companies. Captain Maxwell, with about one-half the number, undertook to get in front of the Indians, while Thomas Inglis, with another party, was to attack them in the rear. Captain Maxwell failed to get in a position to attack the Indians by daylight, and Inglis and his party attacked them alone. As soon as a shot was fired the Indians began to tomahawk the prisoners. Thomas Inglis rushed into the Indian camp and reached the side of his wife. At that moment she received a terrible blow on the head with a tomahawk from an Indian, and in falling she protected the infant she held in her arms by covering it. In addition to Mrs. Inglis' injuries, Mary Inglis and William Inglis, children of Thomas Inglis, were scalped. The Indians, in making their escape, passed near Captain Maxwell and his men, upon whom they fired, one ball striking Captain Maxwell and killing him instantly. He wore a white hunting shirt, and was a good target for the Indian fire. The pursuers encamped upon the ground for the night, and proceeded to bury Captain Maxwell and William Inglis, the young boy who died from his wounds. The number of Indians killed at this time is not known. Maxwell's Gap, in the Tug Ridge, is the locality of this occurrence. Mary Inglis, the little girl, died a few days after the skirmish, but Mrs. Inglis entirely recovered from her injuries. In the same month the Indians killed a man on Bluestone and a woman at Culberson's Bottom, on New river. It is a remarkable fact that of the five houses visited by the Indians in this month four belonged to militia officers, and some of them were a considerable distance within the frontier settlements; from which fact it is reasonable to suppose that the Indians were prompted and led by Tory sympathizers in their assaults upon the frontiers. Major John Taylor, who was in command of the militia on the upper waters of the Clinch, pursued the different parties of invading Indians, but did not succeed in overtaking them, and Colonel Preston was compelled, for the protection of the settlements, to direct Colonel Joseph Cloyd to call out the militia and to station them at "David Doak's Mill" to protect the settlements. The consternation produced along the frontiers from Powell's Valley to the head of the Clinch was so great that the Governor directed Colonel William Preston to assemble the field officers of Montgomery and Washington counties at the Lead Mines at once to devise ways and means to protect the frontiers. This meeting of the field officers took place on July 6, 1782, on which day the following proceedings were had: At a meeting of the field officers of the militia of Montgomery and Washington counties, in conformity to instructions received from His Excellency, the Governor, etc., to concert and settle some proper plan for the defence of both counties. Present: Field Officers for Montgomery County. William Preston, Walter Crockett, Joseph Cloyd, Daniel Trigg, John Taylor, Abraham Trigg. Field Officers for Washington County. Arthur Campbell, William Edmiston, Aaron Lewis, James Dysart, and Major Patrick Lockhart, District Commissioner. It is the unanimous opinion of the Board of Officers that the 200 men permitted to be drawn out by His Excellency, the Governor, for the defence of the frontiers be disposed of into the following districts, namely, on New river, in the neighborhood of Captain Pearis, 30 men; Sugar Run, 20; Captain Moore's, head of Bluestone, 25; head of Clinch, 25 men. In Washington, at Richland, 20; Castle's Woods, 30; Rye Cove, 20; Powell's Valley, 30 men. The extent of the different districts, from Captain Pearis's to Sugar Run, 10 miles; to Captain Moore's head of Bluestone, 30; to Captain Maxwell's, head of Clinch, 16 miles, which is nearest the Washington line; to Richland's, 24; to Castle's Woods, 30; to Rye Cove, 28; to Powell's Valley Fort, 26 miles, in all 164 miles. We find the greatest difficulty in making any provision for the support of these men while on duty, as there is no specific tax brought into the place appointed for that purpose in either of the counties; the officers have therefore recommended Major Lockhart, the District Commissioners, to purchase 200 bushels of corn in Montgomery county, at the most convenient places where the militia are to do duty, at three shillings a bushel, being the current price, and an equal quantity in the county of Washington, for the use of the troops, etc., which we are convinced will be a great saving to the State, as the transporting from Botetourt, where there is some belonging to the public on hand, to the several districts where the militia are to do duty, will be attended with very great expense, the distance being from 60 to 160 miles, &amp;c. As objections have been made to that part of the Governor's instructions ordering the direction of the militia of both counties while on duty, under that of the county-lieutenant of Montgomery, who lives upward of one hundred and eighty miles from Powell's Valley and not less than ninety miles from Richland District, in Washington, which renders it impossible and useless for him to have these men under his directions, for which reason he declined that part of the command: Let it therefore be humbly recommended to His Excellency the Governor, to alter that part of his orders, by giving the superintendence of the troops in each county to the commanding officer of the same, as it will save the expense of a field officer being on duty, which otherwise would be necessary, and the defense of the frontier will in all probability be better conducted. The Board of Officers are unanimously of opinion that the counties of Montgomery and Washington will provide the number of men ordered for their defense, without calling on any of the neighboring counties for assistance, unless there is a real reason for doing so in some emergency or on the approach of a large body of the enemy. They also beg leave to suggest that the usual manner the Indians conduct their attacks on our settlements makes it necessary that a proper number of scouts be employed in each district to discover their approaches, for which reason it had induced the officers to direct that two be employed in each district for the immediate safety of the inhabitants. Pursuant to the recommendation thus made by the field officers of the two counties, the number of militia recommended were stationed at the places designated, and all placed under the command of Colonel Arthur Campbell, of Washington county. About this time the frontier settlement in Powell's Valley was much harassed by small parties of Cherokee Indians from the Chickamogga towns, who, in the spring of this year, killed two men, and had almost ruined the inhabitants by destroying or carrying off their stock. Captain Samuel Newell, who was in command of the militia in that locality, pursued the Indians on several occasions, and at one time had the good luck to overtake two of their parties, one about forty-five miles above the Cuttawa or Cumberland Gap, and firing upon them in camp, wounded some and retook everything. The other party was overtaken when asleep; when one was killed and another wounded, and the rest of the party were forced to make their way home naked. About this time, as two friendly Indians were coming up the Holston river, with a canoe loaded with skins for Colonel Joseph Martin at Long Island, they were killed by two of the settlers, who, in attempting to dispose of their skins, were detected, but the inhabitants in the community of Long Island would not permit the criminals to be brought to justice, alleging against the Indians in general the late depredations on the frontiers. In the year 1781, a company of eleven Indians visited the home of a Mr. Hamblin, on Clinch river, near Castle's Woods. Mrs. Hamblin, who was at home, barred the doors to her house and defended it against the attack of the Indians with an old musket-gun that would not fire. But in the spring of the year 1782, the Indians returned to her home, at which time they succeeded in killing and scalping Mrs. Hamblin and all her children except one, a little boy, whom they carried a prisoner into Canada. In July of this year, Oconostato, who was the principal chief of the Cherokee Indians, resigned his authority to his son, an Indian chief by the name of Tuckasee, and the frontier settlements had great hope of peace. On the 26th day of July, Ellis Harland, a noted Indian trader, returned from the Chickamogga Indians with the information that they desired peace, and that they were to set out for Chote with all their prisoners, the day he left them; and, in a few days thereafter, Springstone, an Indian trader, brought to the settlements two prisoners, one a woman taken from Green river in Kentucky, her name being Stanley, the other a boy about ten years old, a son of Thomas Steward, who was killed going down the river with Colonel Donaldson, when on his way to Cumberland. But, notwithstanding these professions of peace, a party of northward Indians penetrated this county in the month of August and killed two men; and on the 11th day of September, 1782, a party of northward Indians came as far as the settlement on the head of the Moccasin creek, within twelve miles of Abingdon, and attacked a family of fourteen persons, killing the husband on the spot, capturing the wife and six little children, three of whom were shortly afterward inhumanly murdered. One of the three, a young woman, survived the blows received from the Indians long enough to tell the tragic tale. Two, the wife and one child, made their escape the first day and night. A considerable booty in horses was carried off by the Indians. When news of this invasion reached the settlement, the militia on duty, with perseverance in pursuing through a most rugged and difficult way, overtook the Indians and wounded several of them, on McClure, in Buchanan county, Virginia, and recovered unhurt the wife and child, with the Indian baggage and all the plunder they had taken. In September of this year, the Chickamogga Indians met Colonel Joseph Martin, at the Indian town, Chote, and delivered to him all the white prisoners in their possession, except three, whom they could not possibly get to the Indian town by the time appointed; and Colonel Martin, in addressing Colonel Campbell in regard to this subject, said: "I believe that never people were more desirous of peace than the Cherokees." Notwithstanding the disposition of the Cherokees, and their efforts to bring about peace, their warriors were being constantly persuaded by the Tories, residing in their nations, to commit depredations upon the frontier settlements, and, during this year, in Kentucky county alone, eighty-five people were killed and scalped by the Indians. Colonel Campbell in the fall of this year, in a letter addressed to a Virginia official, said: "What if it should be the policy of the British ministry to drive from the other side of the Appalachian mountains all the settlers, before the signing of the preliminaries of peace?" and, in the same letter, he advised a strong expedition against the northward Indians, and declared that the state of our western affairs calls for the united wisdom and most serious attention of the Executive.' While the Continental army, with the assistance of the regular quota of troops from the Tranalleghany settlements, were repelling the attacks of the British and winning the liberty of our country, the frontiersmen of Western Viriginia and North Carolina were winning the great West and were repelling the assaults of the British and their Indian allies. On Christmas day, 1782, a party of Indians attacked the house of John Inglis, on Clinch river, and scalped and otherwise grievously wounded a young man by the name of Cox, whom they overtook in a field, and two days thereafter, near the head of Sandy river, this same company of Indians overtook three hunters, two of whom they killed. Early in the year 1783, about twelve years after the first settlement at Castle's Woods, a party of northward Indians invaded the settlement and attacked the fort at Hamblin's Mill. This fort was erected by Henry Hamblin, one of the first settlers in that section, in the year 1776, with the assistance of Henry Dickinson, Charles Bickley, William Robertson, William Russell, Patrick Porter, Henry Neece, William Wharton, Humphrey Dickinson, Frederick Fryley, James Bush, Archelas Dickinson, Samuel Ritchie, Jerry Harrold, Richard and William Long and William Bowlin, the first settlers in that section. The home of Henry Hamblin had, previously to this time, been twice invaded by the Indians, and in the spring of the year 1782, his entire family, with the exception of a little boy, who was carried into captivity, were killed and scalped, and now this fort was again assailed by a company of Indians numbering seventeen. The Indians first appeared in the community at the house of Joseph Ray, whom they killed and scalped along with several of his family and a neighbor by the name of Samuel Hughes, who happened to be at Ray's house at the time; besides killing these persons they made several others prisoners before they reached the fort. As they approached the fort they met a young woman by the name of Ann Neece, whom they tomahawked and scalped and left for dead. "They then approached the fort and were discovered by Simon Oscher, Henry Dickenson and Charles Bickley, who happened to be working at a mill near by. The Indians observing them about the same time and the white men being unarmed, their situation was a fearful one. It was now to be a struggle which party should get to the fort first. Charles Bickley remarked, "Boys, follow me," and they all started for the fort at full speed, the Indians halting to fire upon them. They got safely into the fort through a shower of balls, without receiving a scratch, thus literally running the gauntlet. There were but two guns in the fort, and with these Ocsher and Dickenson, each, killed an Indian. The balance of the savages knowing nothing of the strength of the fort, and their guns being empty, hastily picked up their fallen companions and fled into the woods. Meeting with a colored man who was hunting sheep, and who belonged to Henry Dickenson, they captured him and he was never heard of afterwards. Some hours after their departure, and while there were still apprehensions of their return by the few persons in the fort, Ann Neece was seen slowly approaching, as bloody as if she had been dipped in a pool of gore, with streams jetting from her head apparently as numerous as had been the hairs of her head before she was scalped, each jet about the size of a hair. She recovered, married and raised a family, and some of her descendants are still living in Russell county."* * Charles B. Coale. Colonel Daniel Smith, upon hearing of this invasion, gathered a number of men and marched to Hamblin's Mill, expecting to pursue the Indians, but when he arrived upon the scene, he ascertained that a party of fifteen men had some time prior to that time pursued the enemy. On the 21st day of March of the same year, notwithstanding every precaution had been taken by the militia officers to protect the people, a party of Indians had gotten in, undiscovered by the inhabitants of Clinch and Blue Lick, to Walker's creek, where they killed one man and took his wife and two children and two children of a widow prisoners. Two days thereafter a man was killed on Bluestone by the Indians. The Indians who made this raid were immediately pursued by experienced woodsmen, but were not overtaken. The locality of this Indian raid on Walker's creek is in Bland county, and the family whose head was killed and whose wife and children were carried into captivity, was named White. The following incident connected with the subsequent history of one of the children captured by the Indians that day and carried into captivity, is preserved: "A number of years after, during one of the expeditions by General Clarke to quell the Indians in Kentucky, he had encamped on the banks of the Ohio, awaiting the return of the scouts who had been sent out to reconnoitre. One of his men by the name of White, from Walker's creek, and brother of the boy that had been stolen, was out a short distance from camp in search of game, when he saw a solitary Indian sitting on a log mending his moccasins. His first impulse was to shoot him, as all the Indians in that region were hostile, but fearing the report of his gun might start up a score of red skins in the vicinity, and as the back of the savage was towards him, he concluded to approach stealthily, and capture him alive. He did so and took him into camp. From his hair and other indications, they supposed him to be a white man, and after compelling him to scrub the paint off, their suspicions were confirmed. They subsequently learned through an interpreter, as the captive had forgotten his native language, that his name was White, and that he had been stolen by the Indians from his home in Virginia, when a child. He eventually proved to be the brother of the man who captured him and came so near taking his life. "The brothers lived many years, settled in Kentucky, and he who had been so many years among the Indians was a delegate in the Legislature in the early organization of the State"* * Charles B. Coale. During the summer of 1780, Colonel William Campbell was recommended by the county court and commissioned by the Governor as Sheriff of Washington county, which office he declined, whereupon Daniel Smith was recommended and commissioned as Sheriff, which office he accepted, and named John Yancey and Matthew Willoughby, as deputy sheriffs of the county. In the spring of the year 1781, the militia of Washington county was reorganized and divided into two battalions, which battalions were officered as follows: First battalion, Colonel, Walliam Campbell; Lieutenant-Colonel, William Edmiston; Major, Aaron Lewis. Second battalion, Colonel, Daniel Smith; Lieutenant-Colonel, Joseph Martin; Major, Thomas Mastin. The first battalion was composed of the militia south of the Clinch mountain, and the second battalion of officers and men north of Clinch mountain; which arrangements continued without interference until the spring of 1782, some time after the death of General William Campbell, when the officers of the first battalion were as follows: Colonel, William Edmiston; Lieutenant-Colonel, Aaron Lewis; Major, James Dysart, and this arrangement continued until the end of the Revolutionary war. In the spring of the year 1781, a number of gentlemen qualified as deputies to Robert Preston, surveyor of Washington county, their names being: David Carson, Walter Preston, Andrew Lewis, Charles Campbell and Benjamin Sharp. Previously to the year 1781, it seems that the ministers of the dissenting churches were not authorized by law to perform the rite of matrimony between any of the citizens of the Commonwealth, and, if they did so, considerable doubt was expressed as to the legality of the marriage. It was necessary that the marriage ceremony, to be legal, should be performed by a minister of the Church of England, and that minister, in this portion of Virginia; was the Rev. Adam Smyth, who lived in Botetourt county, Virginia. I cannot ascertain whether our early settlers were united in marriage according to the prescribed method, or whether they were united by the dissenting ministers, but it is certain that the situation was such that the General Assembly of Virginia, at its October session, 1780, enacted a law declaring what should be considered a lawful marriage. The preamble to this act declares its object to be to encourage marriages and for removing doubts concerning the validity of marriages celebrated by ministers, other than those of the Church of England. By the act in question it was declared that it should be lawful for any minister of any congregation to celebrate the rite of matrimony according to the usage of the congregation to which the parties to be married respectively belonged, and declared such marriage, as well as those theretofore celebrated, to be good and valid in law. But the act provided that no person should be married without lawful license first had or thrice publication of bans in the respective congregations in which the parties to be married severally resided, and the fee of the minister was fixed at twenty-five pounds of tobacco, and no more. The minister was required to make a certificate of the fact of marriage and return it to the court, there to be recorded by the clerk. This same act provided that the courts of the different counties shall, and are hereby authorized, on recommendation of the elders of the several religious sects, to grant license to dissenting ministers of the gospel, not exceeding the number of four of each sect in any one county, to join together in holy matrimony, any persons within their counties only, which license shall be signed by the judge, or elder magistrate under his hand and seal. Pursuant to this act, the following ministers of dissenting congregations were granted license in this county: Rev. Charles Cummings, Presbyterian, Rev. Thomas Woolsey, Baptist, Rev. Simon Cockrell, Baptist, Rev. Joseph Rhea, Presbyterian, Rev. Ebenezer Brooks, Rev. Timothy Burgess, Baptist, Rev. Thomas Brown Craighead, Presbyterian, Rev. John Frost, Baptist, Rev. Jacob Snyder, Reg. Reformed. At the June term of the county court of this county, the following orders were entered: "Ordered that Francis Beattie and Jonas Smith view the way for a road from near the junction of a path that now goes by the Ebbing Spring Meeting-House, and mark the said road, with blazes, and that Francis Beattie be the overseer of said road." "On motion of Ann Meek, leave is granted her to keep an ordinary at her own house, she giving bond and security according to law." "Ordered that Adam Hope have leave to build a mill on his own land." And at the August term, 1781, the folowing order was entered: "Ordered that John Yancy have a bar, clerk's seat, sheriff's box, the upper floor laid, one pair of stairs, three windows and shutters, for the courthouse, and prepare the prison and finish the stocks." And at the March term, 1782, the following orders were entered: "Ordered that two sixpence be levied on each tithable for the purpose of purchasing a wagon for the use of the United States." At this time there existed a controversy between the citizens of Washington and Montgomery counties, as to the true location of the dividing line between the counties, and at the May term, 1782, the county court of this county, agreed with the court of Montgomery county to the appointment of Hugh Fulton to run the line dividing the two counties, which he did and made his report on the 6th day of May, 1783. The following is a copy of the courses, distances and boundaries between the counties of Washington and Montgomery, as fixed by this report: "Beginning at a white walnut and buckeye at the ford of Holston next above the Royal Oak, and runneth thence—N. 31 W. over Brushy mountain, one creek, Walker's mountain north fork of Holston, Locust cove, Little mountain, Poor Valley creek, Clinch mountain, and the south fork of Clinch to a double and single sugar trees and two buckeye saplings on Bare grass hill, the west end of Morris' knob, fifteen miles and three quarters. Thence from said knob north crossing the spurs of the same, and Paint Lick mountain the north fork of Clinch by John Hines' plantation, and over the river ridge by James Roark's in the Baptist Valley, to a sugar tree and two white oaks on the head of Sandy five miles, one quarter—twenty poles. "The beginning at said walnut and buckeye above the Royal Oak, and running south, crossing the middle fork of Holston, Campbell's mill creek, three mountains, the south fork of Holston above Jones' mill, his mill creek, four mountains, Fox creek to six white pines on the top of Iron mountain by a laurel thicket, eleven miles, three quarters and sixty poles. "The distance of said line from the head of Sandy to the top of the Iron mountain is thirty-three miles. "Executed and returned, May the 6th, 1783. "HUGH FULTON." In the spring of the year 1783 there was a requisition upon the county lieutenant of Washington county for a troop of horse, which troop was raised, and by order of the county court entered at the March term, 1783. Robert Campbell, William Dryden and Robert Kennedy were appointed officers of said company. In the early days of our history, when any one of our citizens was sued for debt, he was arrested by the sheriff and required to give good security or go to jail, and it must be very interesting to the reader of the present day to understand the obligation that a security assumed at that day, and we give the following order for the information of the reader. In the suit of William Houston vs. Thomas Smith, for a debt the following order was entered on the 19th day of September, 1782: "Abraham Fulkerson of this county came into court, and undertakes for the defendant, that in case he shall be cast in this suit, he shall satisfy and pay the condemnation of the court or render his body to prison in execution for the same, or that he, the said Abraham Fulkerson, will do it for him." The General Assembly of Virginia, by an Act passed in the year 1781, permitted certain citizens of the Commonwealth to pay their taxes in such stock and provisions as could be used by the Continental army, and in April of the year 1783 John Campbell was appointed a commissioner to receive these commutable articles at the town of Abingdon. At the same term of the court a gentleman qualified to practice law, who afterwards became distinguished in the history of Kentucky, the Honorable John Brown. In the early days of the history of this county, it was customary for the overseers of the poor to apprentice the poor orphan children of the county, and the order of the court authorizing such, is clearly shown by an order entered at the May term, 1783, in the county court of this county, which is as follows: "Ordered that James Stuart, an orphan child of Elizabeth Baker, be bound to John Greenway for the term of seven years to learn the art and mystery of blacksmith and cutler, during which time he is to learn him, the said Stuart, to read and write and the five common rules of arithmetic, and at the expiration of his apprenticeship he is to give him a good suit of clothes, and to get part of his learning in the three last years of his time." The members of our county court in those early days detested the law-breaker and never failed to impose upon the guilty the punishment prescribed by law, and their orders indicate that they insisted upon a speedy execution of their judgments. The following order was entered by the court on the 15th day of July, 1783, upon the trial of a citizen of the county: "This day came as well the attorney for the Commonwealth as the said defendant, whereupon, Mary Henderson was sworn and examined, and the defendant heard in his own defence, on consideration whereof, it is ordered that the said defendant pay ten pounds in half an hour, or receive twenty lashes on his bare back well laid on, at the common whipping post, &amp;c." The Continental Congress of the United Colonies received from the British government, early in the fall of 1782, a proposal for peace, and provisional articles were signed at Paris on the 13th day of November, 1782. A proclamation declaring a cessation of hostilities was published by the Continental Congress at Philadelphia on the 7th day of April, 1783, and by the Governor of Virginia on the 21st day of April, 1783; and a permanent treaty of peace Whipping Post. was concluded on the 19th of April thereafter, by which treaty the independence of the colonies was recognized. Our people had demonstrated to the world that they were patriots and worthy of their independence. They were now to demonstrate to the world that they were capable of forming a national character and that they were worthy of the blessings of liberty. The Continental Congress of the United Colonies, by a proclamation at a meeting on the 18th day of October, 1783, recommended to all the people of the colonies the celebration of the 2d day of December, 1783, as a day of public thanksgiving, in token of their gratitude to Almighty God for their deliverance and independence, and pursuant thereto, the people of the colonies celebrated the day in an appropriate manner. For some cause that I cannot now explain, William Edmiston, who was commissioned sheriff of Washington county, in the year 1782, refused to give security for the collection of the tax as directed by law, but he seemed to have been permitted to execute the duties of the office during the year and until the 16th of March, 1784, on which day, James Dysart produced the Governor's commission bearing date the 8th day of December, 1783, appointing him sheriff of Washington county, and took the oath of office, naming Alexander Donaldson, James Craig, Christopher Acklin and Joseph Snodgrass, deputy sheriffs, all of whom took the oath of office. At the same time the court required the sheriff to give security for the collection of the public tax for the year 1783, which security he refused to give, whereupon the court directed that the clerk certify this fact to the Governor, along with the names of the two next oldest magistrates in the commission of peace and who had not yet been commissioned sheriff, whereupon, the clerk, complying with the order of the court, certified to the Governor, the names of John Kinkead and James Montgomery, whereupon James Dysart excepted to the action of the court, by his counsel, John Brown, and gave the following reasons for his non-compliance, to-wit: "That he did not receive his commission until some time in February, and no court being held until the present date it was utterly out of his power to comply with the law in making the collection for the year 1783; that he is ready and will exert himself, if continued in office, to make the collection for the present year in which he received his commission, and would willingly undertake to collect arrears, if sufficient time would be given by amendment of the revenue law at the next meeting of the Assembly; that he humbly conceives that neither the letter nor the spirit of the law can operate so against him as to deprive him of his right secured by the constitution, the authority of which he trusts will always be deemed paramount to any particular act." The order of the court recommending John Kinkead and James Montgomery for the position of sheriff for the county is as follows: "Ordered that John Kinkead and James Montgomery be recommended to His Excellency the Governor as fit and capable persons for sheriff of Washington county, also, that Joseph Martin stands first in the commission of the peace, but he being a senator for Sullivan county in the State of North Carolina, we leave it to the Executive to judge right." Notwithstanding the protest of Captain Dysart, he lost his position, and the Governor, on the 5th day of June, 1784, commissioned John Kinkead, but he, in turn, failed and refused to give the bond required by law, whereupon, the county court of this county recommended James Montgomery and Thomas Mastin, as fit and capable persons for sheriff of the county, and James Montgomery was commissioned as such, and gave the bond required by law, on the 18th day of January, 1785. When Montgomery assumed the duties of this position, the people of Washington county had not paid their taxes for three years. While the reason is not known, it is fair to suppose from other facts that are known, that Colonel Arthur Campbell induced Edmiston, Dysart and Kinkead to refuse to give the security for the collection of the taxes, and that he prompted the people in their refusal to pay their taxes. Archibald Scott was one of the pioneers of that quiet and beautiful little valley that nestles between Powell's mountain and Wallen's ridge in Lee county, along which Wallen's creek winds its noisy and meandering way, and which is now the home of so many happy and prosperous families. This little valley was selected by the first settlers for its fertility, its water facilities, its superior range, romantic surroundings and remoteness from the usual route of predatory bands of Indians, who, at that day, occasionally left their towns beyond the Ohio to prey upon the scattered settlers on the Holston. Mr. Scott had married Miss Fannie Dickenson, of Russell county, many of whose relatives are still living there. Being the daughter of one of the brave and hardy pioneers of Castle's Woods, she had been reared among the dangers and excitements of frontier life, and hence was a companion upon whose coolness and fortitude her fearless and enterprising husband could depend in their new home on the verge of civilization. They removed to it in 1782 just five years after Daniel Boone had passed along the same trace with his family on their way to the wilderness beyond the Cumberland, and twelve years before the Indian raid on the Livingston family on Holston. He located a corn right to all that valuable tract of one thousand acres subsequently owned by Mr. Robert Duff, and still in the possession of Mr. Duff's descendants. Mr. Scott erected his cabin on the head waters of Wallen's creek, near the spot now occupied by the residence of Mr. Thomas D. Duff. Here, with his wife and little ones, he was living on the rewards of honest toil, and doubtless looking forward with prophetic vision to the day, not far in the future, when that rich and romantic valley, reposing so quietly among the mountains, would teem with wealth and a happy population. He bared his brawny arm and cleared the forest, and for three years his cabin was the home of contentment, plenty and domestic joys. On June 20, 1785, the family, after a day of toil and after partaking of their frugal meal, had retired to rest, without a thought perhaps of impending danger, and dreaming perchance of the luxuriant harvest so soon to be reaped and garnered. That pleasant summer day, as Mr. Scott was toiling amid the growing corn, he was seen and watched by a band of about twenty Shawnese Indians, who, by some means, had been diverted from their usual route, and, having observed the smoke rising from the cabin, were attracted towards it, and lay in ambush on the mountain side till night spread her curtain over the valley. When all was quiet they approached and entered, and the first notice that the husband and father had of their presence was the gleam of the tomahawk that killed him in his bed. The leader of the band was the notorious and cruel half-breed Benge, who was killed six years thereafter, not many miles from the same place, as he was making his way to Big Stone Gap, with the Livingston captives. After scalping Mr. Scott they murdered and scalped his five children, plundered and burned the cabin, took Mrs. Scott prisoner, and started back on their long journey to their towns beyond the Ohio. Her suffering during this journey over steep mountains and through deep and rapid streams was indescribable. When faint and weary and footsore, she failed to travel as rapidly as her captors desired, they would slap her in the face with the bloody scalps of her husband and children. Being a woman of great strength, activity and nerve, she bore up wonderfully, and even surprised the savages by her endurance. After traveling about two hundred miles and reaching one of their favorite hunting grounds in Kentucky, not far from the Ohio, they stopped a few days to rest and hunt. It was decided among them, that one of the Indians, when they reached their town on the Miami, should have their captive for a wife, and hence he was designated to guard her while the rest were engaged in the hunt. Some hours after they left, the Indian on guard fell into a profound sleep. Seeing which and making a noise that did not seem to disturb his slumbers, she determined to kill him with his own tomahawk which lay by his side, and then try to escape. She took the weapon and raised it above his head, but, being weak and nervous from fatigue and distress of mind, she feared she might not be able to strike a fatal blow and concluded to make an effort to escape. She made her way to a spring a short distance from the camp, waded along the branch to conceal her trail, and was soon safe from the pursuit of her guard in a thick cane-brake. Hearing those who were hunting not a great way off, she waited until their whooping died in the distance, when she started out on the long and perilous journey towards the Cumberland mountain, the dim outlines of which she had seen as she crossed an elevation. For weeks she wandered through the unbroken forest without food and almost destitute of raiment, subsisting on berries, barks and roots, and many days wandering so much out of her way as to make but a mile or two. Finally coming to a river (supposed to be the Kentucky), she found a path on the bank which she followed. One morning while following the path up the stream, she heard a hunting party meeting her, and seeing a large sycamore near the path, she stepped behind it and fortunately found it hollow where she concealed herself, until the Indians had passed. A day or two after this and before she had reached the head waters of the stream, she heard the Indians on her trail with dogs. She crawled into a hollow log that lay across the path, over which some of them jumped their ponies, and others passed around the end without discovering her. After the Indians had disappeared, she followed on very cautiously till she came to where the path forked. This perplexed her somewhat, not knowing which to take. She finally took the left, which seemed to be the plainest, when a bird flew past, touched her shoulder and lighted in the other path. She kept on, however, but had proceeded but a few steps when the bird repeated its singular action. This led her to stop and reflect, and, coming to the conclusion that the bird was the spirit of one of her murdered children come to guide her through the wilderness, she took the other path, which proved to be the right one, and led her through what is now known as Pound Gap. She eventually made her way into Castle's Woods, where many of her relatives resided and still reside. After some years, Mrs. Scott married Mr. Thomas Johnson, for whom the county of Johnson in Tennessee was called. She raised a family of children, all of whom married and became useful and respectable members of society. She lived to an advanced age, and her ashes now repose on a little hillock near the old blacksmith shop, not far from the base of Clinch mountain at Hayter's Gap, in Russell county, Virginia."* * Charles B. Coale. In addition to the facts contained in this account as preserved by Mr. Coale, we are able to give from reliable documentary authority, the following: "Another house stood by the residence of Archibald Scott, in which was a little girl eleven or twelve years old, with her brother some years younger than herself. "Into this house the Indians did not enter for some reason, but shot through the door and killed the boy, whereupon the girl sprang out at a window and hid in a nursery of young peach trees till the Indians were gone. She then re-entered the house, laid out her dead brother, and sat by him all night, and till late the next day, when a party of men arrived to bury the dead." The history of Washington county from this time henceforth, will be uninteresting as compared with that portion of our history with which we have been dealing. In April of the year 1784, a number of depredations were committed by the Indians in Powell's Valley and on the Kentucky road. A boy was killed and a girl taken prisoner in Powell's Valley, and a man and a woman and two children were killed in the winter of 1784, on the Kentucky road by a party of Cherokees under a young Indian chief by the name of Rattlesnake, and within the same year three men were killed near Cumberland Gap, by the Creeks, and a boy killed and scalped and an arrow left in his breast on Powell's river. In the year 1783, the Governor and Council of Virginia authorized the building of a fort at Cumberland Gap, on the Virginia side of the line, which fort was erected under the supervision of Colonel Joseph Martin in the fall of 1783. This fort was intended to e the residence of Colonel Joseph Martin, the Virginia Commissioner to the Indians, who of necessity had to remove from Long Island, then ascertained to be in the State of North Carolina. Into this fort there gathered about one hundred persons, and upon the outbreak of hostilities, it was with difficulty that they could be prevented from breaking up. Captain James Shelby had been killed near this station on his way to Washington county, and a man had been killed on the north fork of Holston river on the 5th of April, and ten days afterward a man was wounded with arrows on the head waters of Clinch. In September of the year 1784, a party of Shawnese Indians ascended the Sandy river and, passing over to the head of Clinch, divided into small parties to steal horses and annoy the settlers. One of these parties came to the present location of Tazewell courthouse, where they visited the home of Andrew Davidson. Davidson's family consisted of a wife and three children, two small girls and a boy and two orphan children by the name of Broomfield. Mr. Davidson was absent from his home at the time of which we are speaking. When the Indians appeared at the house they informed Mrs. Davidson that she must go with them to their home in the West, and there being nothing else that she could do, she took up her youngest child, the Indians carrying the others, and began the journey. Mrs. Davidson received kinder treatment at the hands of the Indians than she expected, and proceeded on the way to their homes beyond the Ohio. But, when the Indians arrived at their homes they took Mrs. Davidson's two little girls, tied them to trees and shot them before her eyes. The boy was given to an old Indian squaw and was soon afterwards accidentally drowned, Mrs. Davidson was sold to a Frenchman living in Canada, where she was found by her husband after several years and returned to her home. Another company of Indians at the same time killed William Whitley, who lived in Baptist Valley. They mutilated his body in a terrible manner; his bowels were torn out and stretched upon the bushes; his heart was in one place and his liver in another. Another company of this same band of Indians discovered Henry Harman and his two sons, George and Mathias, and George Draper hunting in a section of country through which the Indian trail led. Harman and his associates were not expecting Indians so late in the season, and early in the morning they built their camp. Harman's two sons had gone out to see whether they could find game, when, to their surprise, they discovered an Indian camp but a short distance from their own, with every indication of the very recent presence of the Indians. They returned to camp and reported what they had found; whereupon the hunters immediately proceeded to return to the settlements. They had not proceeded far before they were fired upon by the Indians from behind a log, whereupon, the Indians immediately advanced on Henry Harman, who fell back to where his sons stood ready to meet the Indians. A right brisk fight took place, a description of which is as follows: "The Indians immediately surrounded the white men, who had formed a triangle, each man looking out, of what would have been with men enough, a hollow square. The old gentleman bade Mathias to reserve his fire, while himself and George fired, wounding, as it would seem, two of the Indians. George was a lame man from having had white swelling in his childhood, and after firing a few rounds the Indians noticed his limping, and one who had fired at him, rushed upon him thinking him wounded. George saw the fatal tomahawk raised, and drawing back his gun prepared to meet it. When the Indian had got within striking distance, George let down upon his head with the gun, which brought him to the ground; he soon recovered and made at him again, half bent and head foremost, intending, no doubt, to trip him up, but as he got near enough, George sprang up and jumped across him, which brought the Indian to his knees. Feeling for his own knife and not getting hold of it, he seized the Indian's and plunged it deep into his side. Mathias struck him on the head with a tomahawk, and finished the work with him. "Two Indians had attacked the old man with bows, and were manœuvering around him, to get a clear fire at his left breast. The Harmans, to a man, wore their bullet pouches on the left side, and with this and his arm he so completely shielded his breast, that the Indians did not fire until they saw the old gentleman's gun nearly loaded again, when one fired on him and struck his elbow near the joint, cutting one of the principal arteries. In a second more the fearful string was heard to vibrate, and an arrow entered Mr. Harman's breast and lodged against a rib. He had by this time loaded a gun, and was raising it to his face to shoot one of the Indians, when the stream of blood from the wounded artery flew into the pan, and so soiled his gun that it was impossible to make it fire. Raising the gun, however, had the effect to drive back the Indians, who retreated to where the others stood with their guns empty. "Mathias who had remained an almost inactive spectator, now asked permission to fire, which the old man granted. The Indian at whom he fired appeared to be the chief and was standing under a large beach tree. At the report of the rifle, the Indian fell, throwing his tomahawk high among the limbs of the tree under which he stood. "Seeing two of their number lying dead upon the ground, and two more badly wounded, they immediately made off, passing by Draper, who had left his horse, and concealed himself behind a log."* * Bickley's History of Tazewell. Draper, as soon as the Indians had passed him, fled to the settlements and reported that Harman and his sons were killed. A number of people set out the next morning to bury the dead, when to their surprise they met Harman and his sons returning to their homes. This same body of Indians sent three of their number into Abb's Valley, where resided Captain James Moore and John Poage. Near the home of Captain James Moore, they captured his son, James Moore, Jr., a boy, fourteen years old. They took the young man to a field where his father's horses were running at large, and tried to capture the horses, failing in which they proceeded on their journey to the Ohio. When they came near their towns in Ohio, the Indians painted themselves black, but did not paint the boy. The chief sold young Moore to his half-sister, who afterwards sold him to a French trader at Detroit, where young Moore met a trader from Kentucky, who knew his father and whom he requested to write to his father and inform him of his situation. He remained in captivity until October, 1789, and returned to his home in Tazewell county three years after the murder and captivity of his father and family. Early in the year of 1786, another party of Indians visited the home of Captain James Moore in Abb's Valley, an account of which visit has been preserved, which I give in full: "In July, 1786, a party of forty-seven Indians, of the Shawnese tribe, again entered Abb's Valley. Captain James Moore usually kept five or six loaded guns in his house, which was a strong log building, and hoped, by the assistance of his wife, who was very active in loading a gun, together with Simpson, a man who lived with them, to be able to repel the attacks of any small party of Indians. Relying on his prowess, he had not sought refuge in a fort, as many of the settlers had; a fact of which the Indians seemed to be aware, from their cutting out the tongues of his horses and cattle, and partially skinning them. It seems they were afraid to attack him openly, and sought rather to drive him to the fort, that they might sack his house. "On the morning of the attack, Captain Moore, who had previously distinguished himself at Alamance, was at a lick bog a short distance from his house, salting his horses, of which he had many. William Clark and an Irishman were reaping wheat in front of the house. Mrs. Moore and the family were engaged in the ordinary business of housework. A man named Simpson was sick upstairs. "The two men who were in the field at work saw the Indians coming at full speed down the hill toward Captain Moore, who had, ere this, discovered them and started in a run for the house. He was, however, shot through his body and died immediately. Two of his children, William and Rebecca, who were returning from the spring, were killed about the same time. The Indians had now approached near the house and were met by two fierce dogs, which fought manfully to protect the family of their master. After a severe contest the fiercest one was killed and the other subdued. "The two men who were reaping, hearing the alarm and seeing the house surrounded, fled and alarmed the settlement. At that time the nearest family was distant about six miles. As soon as the alarm was given Mrs. Moore and Martha Ivens (who was living in the family), barred the door, but this was of no avail. There was no man in the house at this time except John Simpson, the old Englishman already alluded to, and he was in the loft sick and in bed. There were five or six guns in the house, but, having been shot off the evening before, they were then empty. They intended to load them after breakfast. Martha Ivens took two of the guns and went upstairs where Simpson was, and, handing them t him, told him to shoot. He looked up, but had been shot in the head through a crack and was then near his end. The Indians then proceeded to cut down the door, which they soon effected. During this time Martha Ivens went to the far end of the house, lifted up a loose plank, and went under the floor and requested Polly Moore (then eight years old), who had the youngest child, called Margaret, in her arms (which was crying), to set the child down and come under. Polly looked at the child, and clasped it to her breast, and determined to share its fate. The Indians, having broken into the house, took Mrs. Moore and her children—viz.; John, Jane, Polly and Peggy, prisoners, and having taken everything that suited them, they set it and the other buildings on fire, and went away. Martha Ivens remained under the floor a short time and then came out and hid herself under a log that lay across a branch not far from the house. The Indians having tarried a short time with a view of catching horses, one walked across on this log, sat down on one end of it and began to fix his gunlock. Miss Ivens supposing that she was discovered and that he was preparing to shoot her, came out and gave herself up. At this he seemed much pleased. They then set out for their towns. Perceiving that John Moore was a boy, weak in body and mind and unable to travel, they killed him the first day. The babe they took two or three days, but, it being fretful on account of a wound it had received, they dashed its brains out against a tree. They then moved on with haste to their towns. For some time it was usual to tie very securely each of the prisoners at night, and for a warrior to lie beside each of them, with tomahawk in hand, so that in case of pursuit, the prisoner might be speedily dispatched. "Shortly after they reached the towns, Mrs. Moore and her daughter Jane were put to death, being burned and tortured at the stake. This lasted some time, during which she manifested the utmost Christian fortitude and bore it without a murmur, at intervals conversing with her daughter Polly and Martha Ivens, and expressing great anxiety for the moment to arrive when her soul should wing its way to the bosom of its Saviour. At length an old squaw, more humane than the rest, dispatched her with a tomahawk. "Polly Moore and Martha Ivens eventually reached home, as described in the narrative of James Moore. "Several incidents in this narrative have been left out. When the Indians set fire to the house and started, they took from the stable the fine black horse Yorick. He was a horse of such a vicious nature that no one but Simpson could manage him. The Indians had not proceeded far when one mounted him, but soon the horse had him on the ground and was pawing him to death with his feet; for this purpose a few strokes were sufficient. Another mounted him and was served in like manner. Perfectly wild with rage, a very large Indian mounted him, swearing to ride him or kill him. A few plunges and the Indian was under the feet of the desperate horse, his teeth buried in his flesh, and uttering a scream as if he intended to avenge the death of his master, he had just dispatched the Indian when another, running up, stabbed him, and thus put an end to the conflict. `Alas! poor Yorick.' "It is said that Mrs. Moore had her body stuck full of lightwood splinters which were fired, and she was thus tortured three days before she died. "When Martha Ivens and Polly Moore were among the French they fared much worse than when among the Indians. The French had plenty, but were miserly, and seemed to care little for their wants. The Indians had little, but would divide that little to the last particle."* * Bickley's History of Tazewell. In April, 1786, Mathias Harman and Benjamin Thomas, two scouts employed by the authorities of Russell county, visited the house of a man by the name of Dials, now in Tazewell county. Dials kept liquor for sale, and Thomas and Harman were soon intoxicated. Mrs. Dials was making preparations for dinner, when Dials and Thomas left the house to obtain wood. When they reached the mouth of a lane about two hundred yards from the house, they were fired upon by a party of six or seven Indians; several of the shot struck Dials, and one of the warriors pursued him, in the direction of his house. When they approached the house the Indian gave up the pursuit, as he was aware of Harman's presence at the house, and Dials reached the corner of the house, where he fell dead against the chimney. Thomas was fired at, but was not shot; he was, however, during the pursuit, knocked down by the Indian, scalped and left for dead. Thomas died seven days thereafter. Harman, who was very much intoxicated at that time, ran out of the house, mounted his horse and pursued the Indians, challenging them to stop and fight, which they declined. About this time some Cherokee Indians killed two men near the the end of Clinch mountain. The militia from the surrounding country combined and marched within fifteen miles of their town, when they sent for Old Tassel, The Hanging Man and other Indian chiefs, to come to them, which they did, and informed the white people that this murder was done by two or three Indian fellows who lived in a town called Caw-a-tie, about twenty miles below Chote, and that they had been hired to do so by an old fellow from Chickamogga, who had two sons killed by the white people last spring. The Indian chiefs informed the white people that their desire was for peace, but the white people answered that they would have their lands, to which the Indians replied that they had no right to give them their land, whereupon the whites immediately marched into their towns, which they destroyed, along with a part of their corn, and killed and shot several Indians. About this same time, William Martin, a son of Colonel Joseph Martin, was killed by the Creek Indians while on his way to Georgia, and a whole company of settlers, except a woman, were killed near Chickamogga; and a son of Tom Wallen was shot near his father's home, but made his escape. The settlers on the Blue Stone (now in Tazewell county, Va.), being the principal sufferers by the Indian invasions, in August of this year forwarded a petition to the Executive of Virginia, stating their position on the frontiers and asking for protection against the Indians, "from whose cruelties they had lately been great sufferers. The settlement had become much weaker on account of these attacks and was not able to protect itself longer without prompt aid from the government. Upon the approach of danger, the inhabitants are required to betake themselves and families to the forts, thus exposing their effects and property to the marauders, and, being few in number and scattered, they are unable to pursue and punish their enemies. Unless some suitable and regular method for the defence of the county be adopted at once, they should be obliged to abandon their homes, and thus expose to the savages the more interior parts of the country." In answer to this petition, the Governor of Virginia directed the county-lieutenant of Russell county to call out forty men for the protection of the frontiers of the county and three sets of spies, one for the upper part of the county, one for the lower part of the county, and another at Castle's Woods. The frontiers of Russell county, at this time, were 140 miles in length, extending from the Montgomery county line to Martin's Station in Powell's Valley. On the 17th day of March, 1785, the Indians visited the house of John Wallen, about fifteen miles from Martin's Station, and killed and scalped his wife, and a Mrs. Cox was shot at by three Indians. On the 24th day of March two families were captured by three Indians in New Garden, about twenty miles from Abingdon, the two families consisting of fifteen persons. In the fall of this year the smallpox broke out in the Indian nation, spreading rapidly and causing so much distress that the "Raven of Chickamogga," the chief of the Chickamogga Indians, addressed a peace talk to the Virginia Commissioner, which was as follows: "Brother,— I am now going to speak to you about powder. I have in my towns six hundred good hunters, and we have very little powder. I hope you will speak to my elder brother of Virginia, to take pity on us, and send us as much as will make our fall's hunt. He will hear you. We are very poor, but don't love to beg, which our brother knows, as I have never asked him for anything else before. I thank him however for all his past favors to the old towns. I hope he will not refuse this favor I ask of him, I have taken Virginia by the hand, and I do not want to turn my face another way, to a strange people. The Spaniards have sent to me to come and speak to them. I am not going, but some of my people have gone to hear what they have to say. I am sitting still at home with my face towards my elder brother of Virginia, hoping to hear from him soon. I will not take of any strange people till I hear from him. Tell him that when I took hold of your hand, I looked on it as if he had been there. The hold is strong and lasting. I have with this talk sent you a long string of white beads as a confirmation of what I say. My friendship shall be as long as the beads remain white. "A STRING." Colonel Martin was disposed to listen to the professions of the Indians and was making preparations to furnish them with the powder which they requested, when a party of Indians appeared upon the Clinch and chased a son of Frederick Fryly and ran him until within sight of his father's house. Numerous signs of Indians were discovered down Sandy river, and the whole of the frontiers was thrown into great disorder. In July of the year 1785, several merchants from Baltimore opened a very large store at North Fork, two miles below the Long Island of Holston, this being the first store opened in that section of the country. At the election held in the year 1785, for Washington county, Colonel William Russell and Andrew Kincannon, were elected to represent Washington county, in the House of Delegates. One of the first measures proposed by Colonel Russell, upon the assembling of the General Assembly in the fall of that year, was a bill having for its purpose the division of Washington county, which bill was favorably reported and afterwards, on January 2, 1786, passed by the General Assembly of Virginia and approved by the Governor. By this bill it was provided that, from and after the first day of May, 1786, the county of Washington shall be divided into two distinct counties, that is to say: all that part of said county lying within a line to be run along Clinch mountain to the Carolina line, thence with that line to the Cumberland mountain, and the extent of the country between the Cumberland mountain, Clinch mountain and the line of Montgomery county, shall be one distinct county, and called and known by the name of Russell, and the residue shall retain the name of Washington. The same bill directed the first court of said county to be held at the house of William Roberson in Castle's Woods, on the second Tuesday in May, 1786. Pursuant to this Act of the Assembly, the first court of Russell county assembled at the house of William Roberson, in Castle's Woods, on May 9th, which court was composed of the following gentlemen: Alexander Barnett, David Ward, Samuel Ritchie, Henry Dickenson, Henry Smith, Andrew Cowan, Thomas Carter, John Thompson, and, subsequently within the same year, the following gentlemen were commissioned and added to the court: Charles Bickley, Richard Price, William Martin, Christopher Cooper, James Wharton, John Frazer, Charles Cocke, John Tate, John Bowen. At the same time the following officers qualified: Sheriff, David Ward. Deputy Sheriffs, Robert Craig, Charles Carter and John Carter. Clerk County Court, Henry Dickenson. Commissioners of the Revenue, Samuel Ritchie and Patrick Porter. County Surveyor, Henry Smith. County Lieutenant, Alexander Barnett. Colonel of Militia, Henry Smith. Lieutenant-Colonel of Militia, Andrew Cowan. Major, Charles Cocke. Captains of Militia. David Ward, William Dorton, Francis Browning, Samuel Ritchie, William Thompson, Charles Bickley, James Davidson, Josiah Fugate, William Martin. Lieutenants of Militia. John Bowen, John Tate, Samuel Roberson, Thomas Carter, Charles Hays, James Osbourne, Elisha Farris, Moses Skeggs, John Van Bebber. Ensigns of Militia. Samuel Young, Robert Tate, Solomon Litton, Benjamin Nichalson, John Thompson, Henry Hamblin, William Byrd, Joseph Johnston, William Ewing. Coroner, Francis Browning. The following lawyers qualified to practice in the court of Russell in the year 1786: Andrew Moore, Ephraim Dunlop, Francis Preston, James Blair, David Dunnan. The county court proceeded to select a permanent location for the courthouse, when Henry Dickenson, the clerk of the court, offered to give to the county a tract of land at what has since been known as Dickensonville, which offer the court accepted, and proceeded to erect the necessary buildings thereon, and the court of Russell county assembled at Dickensonville or Russell's old courthouse on the 20th day of September, 1787. By the organization of this new county a great extent of country and many valuable citizens were lost to Washington county. Information in regard to the history of Washington county subsequent to the year 1786 is exceedingly hard to obtain, as the minute books of the county court from the year 1786 to the year 1819 and from the year 1821 until 1832 were destroyed along with the courthouse by the Federal troops in December, 1864. Such history as I have been able to obtain for the period mentioned has been derived from the records at Richmond and from an examination of the files of the Holston Intelligencer and the Political Prospect, newspapers published in Abingdon and covering the period from 1810 to 1815.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I hereby certify that when I was ordered by the Executive last summer to take command of an expedition against the Cherokee Indians, it was left to my own choice whether to take the troops down the Tennessee by water, or on horseback, they were to be paid for such pack horses as might be lost without default of the owners. That expedition not being carried on, I was directed by His Excellency the Governor to take command of the militia ordered to suppress the Tories who were at that time rising in arms, and to apply to that purpose the same means and powers which I was invested with for carrying on the Cherokee expedition, under which direction I marched a number of mounted militia to King's mountain, S.

Sir:— We have now collected at this place about 1,500 good men, drawn from the counties of Surry, Wilkes, Burke, Washington and Sullivan counties in this State, and Washington county in Virginia, and expect to be joined in a few days by Colonel Clarke, of Georgia, and Colonel Williams, of South Carolina, with about 1,000 more. As we have at this time called out our militia without any orders from the Executives of our different States, and with the view of expelling the enemy out of this part of the country, we think such a body of men worthy of your attention, and would request you to send a general officer immediately to take the command of such troops as may embody in this quarter. Our troops being all militia and but little acquainted with discipline, we would wish him to be a gentleman of address and able to keep up a proper discipline without disgusting the soldiery. Every assistance in our power shall be given the officer you may think proper to take the command of us. It is the wish of such of us as are acquainted with General Davidson and Colonel Morgan (if in service) that one of these gentlemen may be appointed to the command. We are in great want of ammunition, and hope you will endeavor to have us properly furnished with that article. Colonel McDowell will wait upon you with this, who can inform you of the present situation of the enemy, and such other particulars respecting our troops as you may think necessary. * * (From original of "Gates papers" in possession of the New York Historical society.)

      <field name="fulltext">Wilkes county, Camp on Briar Creek, October 20, 1780. Dear Sir:— Ferguson and his party are no more in circumstances to injure the citizens of America. We came up with him in Craven county, South Carolina, posted on a height called King's mountain, about twelve miles north of the Cherokee ford of Broad river, about two o'clock in the evening of the 7th instant, we having marched the whole night before. Colonel Shelby's regiment and mine began the attack, and sustained the whole fire of the enemy for about ten minutes while the other troops were forming around the height upon which the enemy were posted. The firing then became general and as heavy as you can conceive for the number of men. The advantageous situation of the enemy—being on top of a steep ridge—obliged us to expose ourselves exceedingly, and the dislodging of them was equal to driving them from strong breast-works; though, in the end, we gained the point of the ridge, where my regiment fought, and drove them along the summit, nearly to the other end, where Colonel Cleveland with his country men were. There they were drove into a huddle, and the greatest confusion. The flag for a surrender was immediately hoisted; and as soon as the troops could be noticed of it, the firing ceased, and the survivors surrendered themselves prisoners at discretion. The victory was complete to a wish. My regiment has suffered more than any other in the action. I must proceed with the prisoners until I can some way dispose of them. Probably I may go to Richmond in Virginia. I am, &amp;c., WM. CAMPBELL, Col. Com.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"A statement of the proceedings of the western army, from the 25th day of September, 1780, to the reduction of Major Ferguson and the army under his command. On receiving intelligence that Major Ferguson had advanced up as high as Gilberttown, in Rutherford county, and threatened to cross the mountains to the western waters, Colonel Campbell, with 400 men from Washington county, Virginia, Colonel Isaac Shelby with 240 men from Sullivan county, North Carolina, and Lieutenant-Colonel John Sevier with 240 men from Washington county, North Carolina, assembled at Watauga on the 25th day of September, where they were joined by Colonel Charles McDowell, with 160 men from the counties of Burke and Rutherford, who had fled before the enemy to the western waters. We began our march on the 26th, and on the 30th we were joined by Colonel Cleveland on the Catawba river, with 350 men from the counties of Wilkes and Surry. No one officer having properly a right to command in chief, on the first day of October we dispatched an express to Major General Gates, informing him of our situation, and requested him to send a general officer to take command of the whole. In the meantime Colonel Campbell was chosen to act as commandant till such general officer should arrive. We marched to the Cowpens, on Broad river in South Carolina, where we were joined by Colonel James Williams, with 400 men, on the evening of the 6th of October, who informed us that the enemy lay encamped somewhere near the Cherokee ford of Broad river, about thirty miles distant from us. By a council of the principal officers, it was then thought advisable to pursue the enemy that night with 900 of the best horsemen, and leave the weak horse and footmen to follow as fast as possible. We began our march with 900 of the best horsemen about eight o'clock the same evening, and marching all night came up with the enemy about three o'clock, P. M., of the 7th, who lay encamped on the top of King's mountain, twelve miles north of the Cherokee ford, in the confidence that they would not be forced from so advantageous a post. Previous to the attack, on the march, the following disposition was made: Colonel Shelby's regiment formed a column in the center on the left; Colonel Campbell's regiment another on the right; part of Colonel Cleveland's regiment, headed in front by Major Winston, and Colonel Sevier's regiment formed a large column on the right wing; the other part of Colonel Cleveland's regiment, headed by Colonel Cleveland himself, and Colonel Williams' regiment, composed the left wing. In this order we advanced, and got within a quarter of a mile of the enemy before we were discovered. Colonel Shelby's and Colonel Campbell's regiments began the attack, and kept up a fire while the right and left wings were advancing to surround them, which was done in about five minutes; the greatest part of which time a heavy and incessant fire was kept up on both sides; our men in some parts, where the regulars fought, were obliged to give way a small distance, two or three times, but rallied and returned with additional ardor to the attack. The troops upon the right having gained the summit of the eminence, obliged the enemy to retreat along the top of the ridge to where Colonel Cleveland commanded, and were there stopped by his brave men. A flag was immediately hoisted by Captain DePeyster, their commanding officer (Major Ferguson having been killed a little before), for a surrender, our fire immediately ceased, and the enemy laid down their arms, the greatest part of them charged, and surrendered themselves to us prisoners at discretion. It appeared from their own provision returns for that day, found in their camp, that their whole force consisted of 1,125 men, out of which they sustained the following loss: Of the regulars, one major, one captain, two sergeants, and fifteen privates killed; thirty-five privates wounded, left on the ground not able to march. Two captains, four lieutenants, three ensigns, one surgeon, five sergeants, three corporals, one drummer, and forty-nine privates taken prisoners. Loss of the Tories: two colonels, three captains and 201 privates killed; one major and 127 privates wounded, and left on the ground, not able to march; one colonel, twelve captains, eleven lieutenants, two ensigns, one quartermaster, one adjutant, two commissaries, eighteen sergeants and 600 privates taken prisoners. Total loss of the enemy, 1,105 men, at King's mountain. Given under our hands at camp. (Signed) WM. CAMPBELL, ISAAC SHELBY, BENJ. CLEVELAND.</field>

You are hereby authorized to take command of said men. Should the Carolinians not have at present such an expedition in contemplation, if you can engage them to concur as volunteers, either at their own expense or that of their State, it is recommended to you to do it. Take great care to distinguish the friendly from the hostile part of the Cherokee nation, and to protect the former while you severely punish the latter. The commissary and quartermaster in the Southern department is hereby required to furnish you all the aid of his department. Should the men, for the purpose of dispatch, furnish horses for themselves to ride, let them be previously appraised, as in cases of impress, and for such as shall be killed, die or be lost in the service without any default of the owner, payment shall be made by the public. An order was lodged with Colonel Preston for 1,000 pounds of powder from the lead mines for this expedition; and you receive herewith an order for 500 pounds of powder from Colonel Fleming for the same purpose, of the expenditure of which you will render account.

      <field name="fulltext">"Chiefs and Warriors:— We came into your country to fight your young men. We have killed not a few of them and destroyed your towns. You know you began the war, by listening to the bad councils of the King of England and the falsehoods told you by his agents. We are now satisfied with what is done, as it may convince your nation that we can distress them much at any time they are so foolish as to engage in a war against us. If you desire peace, as we understand you do, we, out of pity to your women and children, are disposed to treat with you on that subject and take you into our friendship once more. We therefore send this by one of your young men, who is our prisoner, to tell you if you are also disposed to make peace, for six of your head men to come to our agent, Major Martin, at the Great Island within two moons. They will have a safe passport, if they will notify us of their approach by a runner with a flag, so as to give him time to meet them with a guard on Holstein river, at the boundary line. The wives and children of these men of your nation that protested against the war, if they are willing to take refuge at the Great Island until peace is restored, we will give them a supply of provisions to keep them alive. "Warriors listen attentively. "If we receive no answer to this message until the time already mentioned expires, we shall conclude you intend to continue to be our enemies, which will compel us to send another strong force into your country who will come prepared to stay a long time, and take possession thereof, as conquered by us, without making any restitution to you for your lands.

      <field name="fulltext">"The fulfillment of this message will require your Excellency's further instructions, and in which I expect North Carolina will assist, or that Congress will take upon themselves the whole. I believe advantageous promises of peace may be easily obtained with a surrender of such an extent of country, that will defray the expenses of war. But such terms will be best insured by placing a garrison of two hundred men under an active officer on the banks of the Tenasee. "Our whole loss on this expedition was one man killed by the Indians and two wounded by accident. It would have been very pleasing to the troops to have met the whole force of the nation at once on equal ground, but so great was the panic that seized them, after seeing us in order over the Tenasee, that they never venturned themselves in sight of the army, but on rocky clefts and other ground inaccessible to our mounted infantry. By the returns of the officers of the different detachments, we killed twenty-nine men and took seventeen prisoners, mostly women and children. The number of wounded is uncertain. Besides these, we brought in the family of Nancy Ward, whom for their good offices, we considered in another light. "The whole are in Major Martin's care at the Great Island until the sense of government is known as to how they are to be disposed of. "The towns of Chote, Scitigo, . . . . . . . . . . , Chilhowee, Toque Micliqua, Kai-a-tee, Sattooga, Telico, Hiwassee and Chistowee, all principal towns, besides some small ones and several scattering settlements, in which were upwards of a thousand houses and not less than fifty thousand bushels of corn and large quantities of other kinds of provisions, were committed to the flames or otherwise destroyed, after taking sufficient subsistence for the army whilst in the country and on its return. No place in the over-hill country remained unvisited, except the small town of Telasee, a scattering settlement in the neighborhood of Chickamogga, and the town of Caloogac, situated on the sources of the Mobile. We found in Oconostato's baggage, which he left behind in his fright, various manuscripts, copies of treaties, commissions, letters and other archives of the nation, some of which shew the double game that people have been carrying on during the present war. There seemed to be not a man of honor among the chiefs, except him of Kai-a-tee, whom I would willingly have excepted had it been in my power. Never did a people so happily situated act more foolishly in losing their livings and their country, at a time an advantageous neutrality was held out to them, but such is the consequence of British seductions. "The enemy in my absence did some mischief in Powell's Valley and on the Kentucky path, near Cumberland Gap, besides three small children that they scalped on Holstein, one of the perpetrators of which, we knocked up on our return, and retook a number of horses. The Botetourt and Montgomery militia were too slow in their movements to do any service. The Virginia militia that served with me on the expedition, expect to be paid in the same manner with those that served last year in Carolina. "What provisions were needed on our setting out were purchased on short credit, which will, I trust, be punctually paid on the first application. Your Excellency will please to excuse the length of this narration. I thought it my duty to give a circumstantial detail of the facts, as the undertaking had something singular in it and may lead to important consequences.

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. EFFORT TO ESTABLISH A NEW STATE. In the month of January, 1781, the General Assembly of Virginia passed a resolution expressing her willingness to cede her northwest territory to the Congress of the colonies, for the benefit of the United Colonies, upon the following condition, to-wit: that the territory so ceded shall be laid out and formed into States containing a suitable extent of territory, and shall not be less than one hundred nor more than one hundred and fifty miles square or as near thereto as circumstances will admit. That the States so formed shall be distinct republican States and be admitted members of the Federal Union, having the same right of sovereignty, freedom and independence as the other States. Colonel Arthur Campbell, immediately upon his acquisition of this information, with a vision that was almost prophetic, set about to organize a new State and to include Washington county in the same. He immediately proposed a scheme for obtaining the sense of the inhabitants of the western country on the subject of the Virginia resolution and the resolves of the Congress upon the same subject, his scheme being as follows: "First. That Selectmen or Deputies be chosen for the five southwestern counties of Virginia and the counties of Washington and Sullivan in North Carolina, to meet at Abingdon the third Wednesday in April, 1782. "Second. That in order that the representation be adequate, let the Deputies be in number in proportion to the number of farmers above eighteen years of age, allowing one Deputy for every hundred such farmers. "Third. That the election be held at the respective Court Houses, the third Tuesday in the month of March next, 1782, by the same officers and under the same regulations as elections for delegates are held. "Fourth. That the business and power of the deputies when convened be confined to the consideration of the late resolves of Congress respecting the Western Country, and that they adopt such measures as may be adjudged proper by a majority, for the interest and safety of their constituents as members of the American Union. "Fifth. That the representation continue one year, in which time the Deputies may adjourn from time to time, and to such places within the Western Countries as may be found most convenient. "The day appointed for the election is the second Tuesday in March, 1782." I am unable to state that the election was held at the time proposed by Colonel Campbell, on the third Tuesday in March, 1782, or that the Assembly proposed by him met at Abingdon on the third Wednesday in April, 1782, as therein proposed, but I can say that an election was held and that an Assembly met at Abingdon in this or the following year in the manner proposed by Colonel Campbell. I am of the opinion that this election was held in 1782, as proposed by Colonel Campbell, as four members of the Assembly that met at Abingdon were citizens of Sullivan county, North Carolina, and it is reasonable to suppose that had the State of Frankland been proposed or organized at the time of this election the Sullivan county citizens would have united with that State. The Assembly that met at Abingdon in the year 1783 adopted a memorial, which they addressed to the Congress of the United States of America, and which was as follows: MEMORIAL. To the Honorable the Congress of the United States of America: The memorial of the Freemen inhabitating the Country Westward of the Alleghany or Appalachian mountain, and Southward of the Ouasioto* * Indian name for Cumberland mountain. Humbly sheweth: That having been made acquainted with the several resolves and other Acts of Congress, respecting Western Territory, and having considered maturely the contents of the same, we are highly pleased with that equal respect for the Liberties of the people, which seems to influence the Councils of Congress. That nothing but a firm adherence to the principles of the Confederation, and a sacred regard to the rights of Mankind could produce the late Resolves for laying off new, Independent States, thereby pointing out such effectual measures, to prevent the encroachments of arbitrary power on the Asylums of Freedom. That we are happy to find so large a part of Territory already ceded to the United States for National purposes, and trust that every obstacle will speedily be removed for the completion of that business by the individual States affected thereby. That we are too much elated at the prospect before us not to wish that we may speedily enjoy the advantages of such a Government as will be exercised over a convenient territory, not too small for the support of authority, nor too large for the security of Freedom. That our situation is such, inhabiting valleys intermixed with and environed by vast wilds of barren and inaccessible mountains, that the same compensation of latitude allotted to the new States Northwest of the Ohio, might prevent us from ever being on an equal footing with our neighbors, blessed with so many natural advantages, navigable waters, and a level, fertile country. That the state bounded by a meridian line that will touch the confluence of Little river, near Inglis' Ferry, thence down the Kanawha to the Ronceverte or Green Briar river, thence Southwest to latitude 37 North, thence along the same to the meridian of the rapids of the Ohio, South along the Meridian until it reaches the Tenasee or Cherokee river, down the same, and eastwardly on that parallel to the top of the Appalachian mountains, and along the highest parts of the same, and the heights that divide the sources of the waters that fall into the Mississippi from those that empty into the Atlantic to the beginning. This, though not equal in quantity of habitable lands with the adjoining States, yet may be sufficient territory for a society that wishes to encourage industry and temperance as cardinal virtues. That in our present settlements we have maintained our ground during the late perilous war, and frequently gave effectual aid to our Brethren to the South and Westward; that we are first occupants and aborigines of this country, Freemen, claiming natural rights and the privileges of American citizens. Our prayer therefore is, that your Honorable Body, with a generous regard to the Rights of Mankind, would speedily erect the aforesaid described Territory into a free and independent State, subject to the Federal Bond, and likewise confirm and guarantee to its inhabitants all their equitable rights and privileges acquired under the laws of the States lately claiming this Territory; that the disposition of the vacant lands be under the power of the Legislature of the new State, in as full a manner as that exercised by such of the Eastern States having unappropriated lands, with this Reservation, that the monies arising from the sale of vacant lands shall be faithfully paid to the order of Congress, towards the payment of the National debt. And your Memorialists shall ever pray, &amp;c. Approved and subscribed by us in behalf of ourselves and the Freemen of our Respective Districts, whom we represent. Charles Cummings, Chairman.

John Davis, Gilbert Christian, David Looney, John Campbell, Robert Buchanan, William Tate, John Kinkead, Thomas Woolsey, Richard Brownlow, Matthew Willoughby, John Anderson, John Adair. At a subsequent meeting this Assembly addressed the Freemen of Washington county on the subject of their public affairs, which address is as follows: "To the Freemen of Washington County: "Your Deputies, after mature consideration, have agreed to address you on the subject of your Public Affairs, well knowing that there is only wanting an exact and candid examination into the facts to know whether you have been well served or abused by your Representatives, whether Government has been wisely administered and whether your rights and Liberties are secure. As members of the Civil Society, you will acknowledge that there are duties of importance and lasting obligation which must take place before individual conveniences or private interest, but it must be granted that in free Communities the laws are only obligatory when made consonant with the constitution or Original Compact; for it is the only means of the surrender then made, the power therein given and the right ariseth to Legislate at all. Hence it is evident that the power of Legislators is in the nature of trusts to form Regulations for the good of the whole, agreeable to the powers delegated, and the deposite put into the General stock, and the end proposed is to obtain the greatest degree of happiness and safety, not for the few but for the many. To attain these ends and these only, men are induced to give up a portion of their natural Liberty and Property when they enter into society. From this it is plain that Rulers may exceed their trust, may invade the remaining portion of natural liberty and property, which would be a usurpation, a breach of solemn obligation and ultimately a conspiracy against the majesty of the people, the only treason that can be committed in a commonwealth. A much admired writer on the side of Liberty begins his work with the following remarkable sentence, which we transcribe for your information, and entreat you to read and ponder well: "In every human Society there is an effort continually pending to confer on one part the height of power and happiness, and reduce the other to extremes of weakness and misery. The intent of good laws is to oppose these Efforts, and to diffuse their influence universally and equally. But men generally abandon the care of their most important concerns to the uncertain prudence and discretion of those whose interest it is to reject the best and wisest instructions, and it is not until they have been led into a thousand mistakes in matters the most essential to their lives and Liberties, and are weary of suffering, that they can be induced to apply a remedy to the evils with which they are oppressed. It is then they begin to conceive and acknowledge the most palpable truths, which from their very simplicity commonly escape vulgar minds, incapable of analyzing objects, accustomed to receive impressions without discretion, and to be determined rather by opinions of others, than by the result of their own examination." A few plain Questions you may honestly put to yourselves when in retirement, or when your heads are reclined on your pillows; For what end hath the Almighty wrought out such a wonderful revolution in the affairs of men as that of the Independence of America? What part ought I to act through the remaining part of my life, so as to be most pleasing to my Creator and the most useful to Society? Whether are my head and heart so enlightened and in such a frame as to attend to and receive the truth, whether it comes from a person I dislike or not? Is not the duty we owe the succeeding generation equal to that we owe the present; Several Mediums of knowledge are open to all diligent inquirers. The productions of the Printing Press, Literary Schools, and the meetings of the people to debate on public measures. The inhabitants of this county have, as hitherto, been peculiarly circumstanced. They became possessors of a Wilderness at a perilous Era: The greatest part of their time since has been necessarily employed merely to provide subsistence, coarse clothing and cheap dwellings, to defend their families from the inclemency of the weather, no time or money to spare to build elegant or convenient houses, to erect suitable places for public worship, to found Seminaries for classical learning, to promote the education of youth, that most indispensable of all obligatopms to children. It is also a prior duty to any you owe the state to provide food and raiment for your families. Plain fare and coarse clothing you might be content with, if it was necessary to part with all the superfluities to answer the real exigencies of the State, and did you see your fellows in more favorable situation pursuing the same course and also could you be persuaded that a judicious economy pervades all the disbursements of all the public money, then, and not till then, ought you to part with the produce of your Industry at the call of Rulers. It may be alleged by your enemies that you do not mean to contribute anything to alleviate the burthens of the Nation and support government. This charge will vanish on a fair enquiry into the various schemes of finance and the present state of the Public Funds. The following estimate of Taxes, and what has operated as taxes in the Western Country, will prove that you have contributed something, probably your full share. Treasury and pre-emption warrants, 16,000,000 pounds Taxes collected in the years 1778, '79, '80, '81. 180,000 pounds Bills lost, sunk or funded, 5,000,000 pounds Paper money, 21,130,000 pounds Cash paid commissioners in hard money reduced, $10,000 Composition money sent in with the plots, 70,000 One-sixth of the surveyor's fees, 5,000 Registers' fees prior to 1784, 30,000 Registers' fees prior to 1784, 3,000 Registers' fees prior to 1785, 10,000 Additional tax of 5s. per hundred on land, 25,000 Duty on salt will cost the western consumption 6s. per bushel, 1,500 Duties on imports on foreign goods and enumerated articles 2,500 Loyal Company's claim on W. &amp; M. counties, 8,000 Taxes on . . . . . . . . &amp;c., may produce annually, 2,000 Assessment subsequent to 1781, an enormous sum that it is impracticable, if not unjust, to collect, 172,000 Should the Legislature abolish assessment, and the above not be sufficient, you might endure taxing a few luxurious articles and some vices, that would increase the sum, and make it equal to your just proportion of expenditures. If your eastern neighbors were generous, they would make some allowance for the great losses sustained by the depredations of the Indians, and for the many valuable lives lost to keep them safe. The appropriations of your public money ought also to be a subject of serious enquiry, for if at any time it should be applied to the purposes of venality and corruption, you would then be feeding your destroyers, and enable them to make further invasions on your remaining rights and liberties, until you would have left nothing worth contending for, and you and your posterity would be obliged to stoop to an abject vassalage. "All is not lost yet, therefore beware in the future of the objection of either weak or interested men who would persuade you to a passive conduct under all the Measures of Government. Your Rulers, as well as those of other nations, are only fallible men. When they act well, honor and applaud, when wickedly, impeach and punish them. Disregard their impotent threats and ridiculous fallacies, and let them know that the little selfish cry of an individual is not to be heard when the loud sounds of the peoples' are publishing their wrongs. "Signed by order, "CHARLES CUMMINGS, Ch'm." A copy. This document is thus endorsed by the Governor: "Memo. James Montgomery put this paper into my hands, and can prove its authenticity, and that Arthur Campbell personally explained, enforced and inculcated its contents on the people, particularly the State of Taxes p'd by that country." Colonel Arthur Campbell and a large majority of the citizens of Washington county, from this time forward, made every possible effort to secure the approval of the Congress of the United States of their views in regard to the formation of a new State, and their views seemed to permeate and meet with the approval of all the citizens, with but few exceptions, living on the western waters. In the month of June, 1784, the General Assembly of North Carolina passed an Act ceding to the Congress of the United States all her western lands, including the counties of Sullivan, Washington, Greene and Davidson, now within the present limits of the State of Tennessee, and at the same session of the North Carolina Assembly, the Western Land Office was closed. Immediately upon the adjournment of the North Carolina Assembly, the four delegates from the western counties returned to their homes and gave intelligence to the people of the proceedings of the General Assembly of North Carolina, whereupon, it was proposed that the people should elect two representatives in each captain's company in the counties of Washington, Sullivan and Greene, as committeemen to deliberate upon the state of public affairs and to recommend a plan of action suited to the occasion. These committees met and recommended the election of delegates from the several counties, to meet in convention at Jonesboro, with power to adopt such measures as they thought necessary. The delegates were elected and assembled at Jonesboro on August 23, 1784, and elected the following officers: President, John Sevier; Secretary, Landon Carter. The convention immediately proceeded to appoint a committee to take into consideration the state of public affairs and the cession to Congress by North Carolina of her western territory. This committee, after a resolution had been offered by a member declaring the three western counties independent of North Carolina, unanimously adopted the following report, which was submitted to the convention: REPORT. "Your committee are of opinion and judge it expedient, that the counties of Washington, Sullivan and Greene, which the Cession Bill particularly respects, form themselves into an association and combine themselves together, in order to support the present laws of North Carolina, which may not be incompatible with the modes and forms of laying off a new State. It is the opinion of your committee that we have a just and undeniable right to petition to Congress to accept the cession made by North Carolina, and for that body to countenance us in forming ourselves into a separate government, and either to frame a permanent or temporary constitution, agreeably to a resolve of Congress in such case made and provided, as nearly as circumstances will permit. We have a right to keep and hold a convention from time to time, by meeting and convening at such place or places as the said convention shall adjourn to. When any contiguous part of Virginia shall make application to join this association, after they are legally permitted, either by the State of Virginia or other power having cognizance thereof, it is our opinion that they be received and enjoy the same privilege that we do, or shall enjoy. This convention has a right to adopt and prescribe such regulations as the particular exigencies of the times and the public good may require; that one or more persons ought to be sent to represent our situation in the Congress of the United States and this convention has just right and authority to prescribe a regular mode for his support." This report was received by the convention and adopted, and the convention, by a vote of 28 to 15, declared in favor of forming a separate and distinct State at this time, and appointed Messrs. Hardin and Cocke to draw up articles of association, which they did and which articles were approved by the convention. Pursuant to the Articles of Association, the first members of the General Assembly of the State of Franklin were chosen, and assembled at Jonesboro in the month of March, 1785, at which time officers were elected and laws adopted for the government of the State of Frankland. The officers elected were as follows: Governor, John Sevier. Secretary of State, Landon Carter. Treasurer, William Cage. Surveyor-General, Stockly Donaldson. Brigadier-Generals, Daniel Kennedy and William Cocke. Council of State, William Cocke, Landon Carter, Francis A. Ramsay, David Campbell, Daniel Kennedy and Colonel Taylor. Member of Congress, General William Cocke. The government as thus organized, proceeded in an orderly way to administer the affairs of the people. There can be but little question, that Colonel Arthur Campbell, the author of the idea of a new State, played a leading part in the organization of the State of Frankland. During the years 17831784, he was constantly engaged in organizing this new government and enlisting the sympathies of the people of Washington and Montgomery counties in behalf of the same. He drew up a Declaration of Rights and a Constitution for the new government, and while I am unable to obtain a copy of the Constitution that he proposed for the new State, still I am able to give the Declaration of Rights prepared by him, which is as follows: A DECLARATION OF RIGHTS. 1st. That all political power is vested in and derived from the people only. 2nd. That the people of this State ought to have the sole and exclusive right of regulating the internal government and police thereof. 3d. That no man, or set of men, are entitled to exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges from the community but in consideration of public services. 4th. That the legislative, executive and supreme judicial powers of government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other. 5th. That all powers of suspending laws, or the execution of laws, by any authority, without the consent of the representatives of the people, are injurious to their right and ought not to be exercised. 6th. That election of members to serve as representatives in General Assembly ought to be free. 7th. That in all criminal prosecutions, every man has a right to be informed of the accusation against him and to confront the accusers and witnesses with other testimony, and shall not be compelled to give evidence against himself. 8th. That no freeman shall be put to answer any criminal charge but by indictment or impeachment. 9th. That no freeman shall be convicted of any crime but by the unanimous verdict of a jury of good and lawful men in open court, as heretofore used. 10th. That excessive bail should not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel nor unusual punishments inflicted. 11th. That general warrants, whereby an officer or a messenger may be commanded to search suspected places, without evidence of the fact committed, or to seize any person or persons not named, whose offences are not particularly described and supported by evidence, are dangerous to liberty and ought not to be granted. 12th. That no freeman ought to be taken, imprisoned or disseized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed or exiled, or in any manner destroyed or deprived of his life, liberty or property, but by the law of the land. 13th. That every freeman restrained of his liberty, is entitled to a remedy, to enquire into the lawfulness thereof, and to remove the same, if unlawful; and that such remedy ought not to be denied or delayed. 14th. That in all controversies at law, respecting property, the ancient mode of trial by jury is one of the best securities of the rights of the people and ought to remain sacred and inviolable. 15th. That the freedom of the press is one of the great bulwarks of liberty, and therefore ought never to be restrained. 16th. That the people of this State ought not to be taxed, or made subject to payment of any impost or duty, without the consent of themselves or their representatives in General Assembly freely given. 17th. That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of the State; and as standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; and that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power. 18th. That the people have a right to assembly together, to consult for their common good, to instruct their representatives, and to apply to the Legislature for redress of grievances. 19th. That all men have a natural and unalienable right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences. 20th. That for redress of grievances and for amending and strengthening the laws, elections ought to be often held. 21th. That a frequent recurrence to fundamental principles is absolutely necessary to preserve the blessings of liberty. 22th. That no hereditary emoluments, privileges or honors ought to be granted or conferred in this State. 23th. That perpetuities and monopolies are contrary to the genius of a free State and ought not to be allowed. 24th. That retrospective laws punishing acts committed before the existence of such laws, and by them only declared criminal, are oppressive, unjust and incompatible with liberty; therefore no ex post facto law ought to be made." James Montgomery, when he accepted the commission of the Governor as sheriff of Washington county and gave security for the collection of the taxes due for the three preceding years, incurred the displeasure of Colonel Campbell and the majority of the citizens of the county, and, in turn, he became the bitter enemy of Colonel Campbell. The people had been advised and expected that they would be released from the payment of their taxes for the preceding years, upon the organization of the new State, which they confidently believed would take place. Early in the year 1785, James Montgomery, William Edmiston, Arthur Bowen, James Kincannon, Samuel Edmiston and James Thompson addressed the following communication to the Governor of Virginia, preferring charges of malpractices and misconduct, in his office, as justice of the peace, against Arthur Campbell. "Sir:—Viewing with concern the present situation of affairs in this country, throught attempts of ambitious men, thereby intending to incense the good people thereof against the laws of the State and proceedings of government requisite thereto, finally to effect a new State in this quarter of the country, we cannot any longer remain tacit beholders of the evils already generating among us, without the most alarmed sensations, which we think the ties of humanity and obligations to our country lead us to disclose. Most secret plans have been laid to delude the people, holding out to them the idea of oppressive acts imposed by the General Assembly, intended to burthen them unjustly with a weight of taxes. Small committees were contrived and convened by Colonel Arthur Campbell, the leader of this disorder, as early as February and March last, under pretext of seeking redress of grievances in behalf of the county the present year, and decrying the laws in general of the last Assembly. Notwithstanding every opposition made to his measures, he continued to convene his committees, and, not long after, in one of his committees at Major Dysart's disclosed his plan of representation to Congress, thereby aiming to fix a boundary to include a part of Virginia in the Frankland State. It is also notoriously known that Colonel Campbell did, in a convention of the North Carolina people, publicly propose to separate himself with the citizens of Washington and Montgomery in Virginia, and joining them declare themselves immediately independent of the States of Virginia and North Carolina, and moreover, stand in the front of the battle between these people and Virginia when necessary. His declaration to the people of this county at the March court, to elect no delegates to the General Assembly this year, together with his late opposition, at the July court, to the proclamation issued by your Excellency in Council the 10th of June last, may be sufficient to satisfy your Excellency and Honorable Council that the mischievous spirit prevailing here in opposition to the present collection and other proceedings of government, may have arisen from the licentious spirit of Colonel Campbell, conveyed to them through his artful insinuations daily since last court, exercised by public meetings in this county, intended to overset the designs of the Executive in the present arrangement of the militia; and there is reason to believe he is now aiming to effect associations to oppose the collection when attempted to be made. The charges herein contained can undoubtedly be supported by General Russell, Captain Andrew Kincannon, Captain Henry Smith and Captain William Cocke, of the Frankland settlement. We rest the charges herein contained for the discussion and ultimate decision of your Excellency and the Honorable Council, that if necessary he may be cited to answer the charges against him." When the attention of Governor Henry was called to the situation of affairs in this county, he removed the suspension of the operation of the militia law adopted by the Assembly at its session in the year 1784, and removed from office Colonel Arthur Campbell, the county lieutenant of this county, and such of the field officers, in the militia of this county, as were active partizans of the new State. Colonel William Russell was commissioned a brigadier-general of militia with a full quota of officers who were opposed to the formation of the new State. By this act, the Governor removed from office many of the men who had served at King's mountain, and such was the dissatisfaction produced by this action, that a number of the leading citizens of the county who had not taken part in the previous disturbances, addressed the following petition to the Governor and Council of the State: To His Excellency, Patrick Henry, Esquire, Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the Honorable Council of State: The petition of sundry freemen whose names are thereunto subscribed humbly sheweth, that being pleased with the name and wishing to glory in the reality of being citizens of a Commonwealth, it is with infinite concern that we are constrained to address your Excellency on a subject that we apprehend will eventually endanger our liberties—we mean the adoption of the new militia law. That we believe the Constitution is imperfect in some particulars; but whilst we retain it as an acknowledged plan, springing from a higher source than the ordinary Legislature, we ought to consider it, until altered by the same authorities, as the basis of the laws and all legitimate government, and besides our allegiance points out to us as a duty, to maintain it inviolate, that former examples both ancient and modern, our own experience and the reason of things tell us that if an infraction is once made, and that by a delegated power, then there will be no right, however sacred, that is possessed by the citizens, but may be usurped, and our government ere long terminate in anarchy or despotism, those mournful calamities that too soon befall the human race. To avert such direful events, to recur to first principles and to reinstate our liberties in their pristine vigor, we are encouraged to approach, with freedom and truth, a patriotic Chief Magistrate, and an enlightened Council, humbly praying that the powers with which your Honorable Board are invested may be now exercised by refusing to execute the aforesaid Act as being unconstitutional and oppressive; or, if need be, assemble the Legislature, at an earlier period than it stands adjourned to, that we may have an opportunity to seek redress from a legal tribunal. And your petitioners shall pray: Andrew Willoughby, Jr., James —, James Craig, Charles Cummings, Fra. Allison, Thomas Cummings, John Trousdale, James Dunlop, John Campbell, James Logan, Robert Montgomery, Joseph Acklin, George Finley, Robert Campbell, Samuel Acklin, Samuel Houston, John Preston, James Cummings, John Davis, James Moore, Gilbert Watson, John Christian, Robert Craig, Michael Higgins, Samuel Davis, John Cummings, David Kinkead, Andrew Davison, Thomas Osburn, Robert Johnston, Nath. Willoughby, David Watson, William Bradley, William Craig and others. The Governor being slow to act upon the charges preferred by James Montgomery and others against Colonel Arthur Campbell, in the summer of the year 1785, William Edmiston, James Kincannon, Samuel Edmiston, James Thompson and Arthur Bowen addressed the following letter to the Governor of Virginia, preferring additional charges against Colonel Campbell: "Please Your Excellency and the Honorable Council: "Sir,—A complaint being exhibited during the course of last summer against Colonel Arthur Campbell for mal-conduct, contrary to the most sacred ties of government, as well under his late county lieutenancy as judge of the court of Washington, in which he continues to act, we have consequently thereto, been honored by advice from our Lieutenant-Governor, that the charges would be attended to by the Executive which we still hope will meet your patronage in due season and the offender in your wisdom cited before a proper tribunal to answer the charges against him. Relying that the Executive will not suffer such atrocious insult to the Commonwealth of Virginia to pass unnoticed, we think it necessary to add fresh matter of complaint against Colonel Campbell that with the former now in your possession, his wicked and persevering conduct may be more clearly explained to your Honorable Board. When the decision of the Executive made it necessary to arrange the militia of Washington county under the law of eighty-four, and the Governor's proclamation was issued for that purpose, which being accompanied with the field officers' commissions were laid before Washington court, Colonel Campbell on the bench objected to the proclamation and power of the Executive, under the law, and quitting the bench addressed himself to the court, telling them that the militia law was arbitrary, tyrannical and oppressive; and after condemning the last Assembly for enacting the law, said that the power of enforcing the law was in the court, not in the Executive, and that the court should by no means suffer the field officers to qualify; he also hoped that the court and people of the county would pay no obedience to the law or proclamation. Colonel Campbell finding some opposition to his measures by the court, alleged that the Executive having suspended the operations of the law till January, 1786, he had not a right to take off that suspension, by which time, he made no doubt, the law would be repealed; and after finding some of the court opposed to his propositions, plead, (notwithstanding the danger of the frontiers) that the court should not suffer the field officers to qualify at that time. His constant endeavors to prejudice the citizens of this county ever since against the law, will appear from a petition to the Assembly which he promoted." And at the same time James Montgomery, who was a member of the Legislature from Washington county, preferred the following charges against Colonel Campbell: "1st. That he advised persons chargeable with public taxes to refuse payment thereof. 2d. That he advised freeholders against electing members to the General Assembly. 3d. That he attempted by various means, openly and secretly, to induce the inhabitants of Washington county to separate from this Commonwealth. 4th. That he left the bench on a day when the court was sitting and attempted to persuade the court that no regard ought to be paid to the militia law, or the Governor's proclamation for enforcing it." The Governor and Council, upon consideration of said charges, directed that the first Monday in April, 1786, be set apart for enquiring into the charges aforesaid, at the Council chamber in the city of Richmond, and that the said Arthur Campbell have notice of such intended inquiry and be furnished with a copy of the charges exhibited against him on or before the first day of February next, and that the parties be at liberty from that period to the 15th day of March next, to take depositions of witnesses, respecting the charges aforesaid, giving ten days' previous notice of the time and place of taking the same, and that when taken they be transmitted to His Excellency the Governor, under the hand and seal of the magistrate or magistrates who attended the taking of such depositions. In answer to Governor Henry's proclamation enforcing the militia law, Colonel Arthur Campbell, who had been particularly named therein, addressed the following letter to the Governor: "Sir,— After having been honored lately with the receipt of several of your Excellency's letters, particularly that of the 17th of May last, and the several communications made in consequence of them, particularly my letter of the 13th of June, the principal officers and the Whig interest in this county seemed to rest satisfied that an amicable and enlightened administration would pave the way to the Legislature and to Congress for the efficient and permanent redress of the principal, and in some cases the almost intolerable grievances of the western inhabitants. But while secure in this confidence, we have to lament that the voice of calumny and faction has reached the seat of supreme rule, and that, without a constitutional enquiry, without a fair hearing, it has been in some degree listened to, and had effect. It is hard to defend when it is not known what we are charged with, and at all times who can disarm private pique, or be able to withstand malice and envy without feeling some smart. But political fury, engendered by Tory principles, knows no bounds and is without a parallel. Bernard and Hutchison have exhibited to Governors and the world, examples that ought to teach wisdom to this and succeeding generations. We are told (but it is only from report) that we have offended government on account of our sentiments being favorable to a new State, and our looking forward for a separation. If such a disposition is criminal, I confess there are not a few in this county to whom guilt may be imputed, and to many respectable characters in other counties on the western waters. If we wish for a separation it is on account of grievances that daily become more and more intolerable, it is from a hope that another mode of governing will make us more useful than we are now to the general confederacy, or ever can be whilst so connected. But why can blame fall on us, when our aim is to conduct measures in an orderly manner, and strictly consistent with the Constitution. Surely men who have bound themselves by every holy tie to support republican principles, cannot on a dispassionate consideration blame us. Our want of experience and knowledge may be a plea against us. We deplore our situation and circumstances on that account, but at the same time firmly believe that our advances to knowledge will still continue slow, perhaps verge towards ignorance and barbarism, without the benefit of local independent institutions. But, sir, why may we not take courage and say we are right when adverting to our own constitution, to the different Acts of Congress, that of different legislatures, the opinion of the first statesmen in America, among whom we can number an illustrious commander, a great lawyer and judge in this State, and a Governor of Virginia himself? All that I have to ask, and it is all that I may ever crave, is that your Excellency may not, from invidious information, form such rash measures, so urge matters, at an untimely day to extremities, which only might gratify an angry individual, but would, by no means, promote the interest and peace of the Commonwealth, or its honor and dignity. I am, sir, with respect, your most obedient servant, ARTHUR CAMPBELL. The agitation continued until the meeting of the General Assembly of Virginia, on October, 1785, at which time, the Governor transmitted to the General Assembly a message in regard to the action taken by the people of this portion of Virginia, praying the establishment of an independent State. Accompanying the message was the memorial adopted by the Assembly that met at Abingdon, addressed to the Congress of the United States as heretofore given. The message of the Governor to the General Assembly was as follows: MESSAGE OF GOVERNOR PATRICK HENRY. "I transmit herewith a letter from the Honorable Mr. Hardy, covering a memorial to Congress of sundry inhabitants of Washington county, praying the establishment of an independent State, to be bounded as is therein expressed. The proposed limits include a vast extent of country, in which we have numerous and very respectable settlements, which in their growth will form an invaluable barrier between this country and those, who, in the course of events, may occupy the vast places westward of the mountains, some of whom have views incompatible with our safety. Already the militia of that part of the State is the most respectable we have, and by their means it is that the neighboring Indians are awed into professions of friendship. But a circumstance has lately happened, which renders the possession of the territory at the present time indispensable to the peace and safety of Virginia; I mean the assumption of sovereign power by the western inhabitants of North Carolina. If the people who, without consulting their own safety or any other authority known in the American Constitution, have assumed government, and while unallied to us and under no engagements to pursue the objects of the Federal government, shall be strengthened by the accession of so great a part of our country, consequences fatal to our repose will probably follow. It is to be observed that the settlements of this new society stretch into a great extent in contact with ours in Washington county, and thereby expose our citizens to the contagion of the example which bids fair to destroy the peace of North Carolina. In this state of things it is that variety of information has come to me stating that several persons, but especially Colonel Arthur Campbell, have used their utmost endeavors, and with some success, to persuade the citizens in that quarter to break off from this Commonwealth, and attach themselves to the newly-assumed government, or to erect one distinct from it. And to effect this purpose the equality and authority of the laws have been arraigned, the collection of the taxes impeded, and our national character impeached. If this most important part of our territory be lopped off, we loose that barrier for which our people have long and often fought; that nursery of soldiers, from which future armies may be levied, and through which it will be almost impossible for our enemies to penetrate. We shall aggrandize the new State, whose connections, views and designs, we know not; shall cease to be formidable to our savage neighbors, or respectable to our western settlements, at present or in the future. Whilst these and many other matters were contemplated by the Executive, it is natural to suppose, the attempt at separation was discouraged by every lawful means, the chief of which was displacing such of the field officers of the militia in Washington county as were active partizans for separation, in order to prevent the weight of office being put in the scale against Virginia. To this end a proclamation was issued, declaring the militia laws of the last session in force in that county, and appointments were made agreeable to it. I hope to be excused for expressing a wish that the Assembly, in deliberating on this affair, will prefer lenient measures in order to restrain our erring citizens. Their taxes have run into three years and thereby grown to an amount beyond the ability of many to discharge; while the system of our trade has been such, as to render their agriculture unproductive of money. And I cannot but suppose that if even the warmest supporters of separation had seen the mischievous consequences, they would have retraced and reconsidered that intemperance in their own proceedings, which opposition in sentiment is too apt to produce. The limits proposed for the new government of Frankland, by Colonel Arthur Campbell and the people of Virginia who aimed at a separation from this State, were expressed in the form of a constitution which Colonel Campbell drew up for public examination, and were these: Beginning at a point on the top of the Alleghany or Appalachian mountains, so as that a line drawn due north from thence will touch the bank of the New river, otherwise called Kenawha, at the confluence of Little river, which is about one mile above Inglis' ferry, down the said river Kenawha to the mouth of the Roncevert, or Greenbrier river, a direct line thence to the summit of Laurel mountain, and along the highest part of the same to the same point where it is intersected by the parallel of 37° north latitude; west along that latitude to a point where it is met by a meridian line that passes through the lower part of the river Ohio; south along the meridian to the Elk river, a branch of the Tennessee; down said river to its mouth, and down the Tennessee to the most southwardly part or bend of said river; a direct line from thence to that branch of the Mobile, called Tombigbee; down said river Tombigbee to its junction with the Coosawattee river, to the mouth of that branch of it called the Hightower; thence south to the top of the Appalachian mountain, or the highest land that divided the sources of the eastern from the western waters; northwardly along the middle of said heights, and the top of the Appalachian mountain, to the beginning. It was stated that the inhabitants within these limits agree with each other to form themselves into a free, sovereign and independent body politic or State, by the name of the Commonwealth of Frankland. The laws of the Legislature were to be enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Frankland; and all the laws and ordinances which had been before adopted, used and approved in the different parts of this State, whilst under the jurisdiction of Virginia and North Carolina shall still remain the rule of decision in all cases for the respective limits for which they were formerly adopted, and shall continue in full force until altered or repealed by the Legislature; such parts only excepted, as are repugnant to the rights and liberties contained in this Constitution, or those of the said respective States." As heretofore stated, early in the year 1785 the Governor removed Colonel Arthur Campbell, county lieutenant of Washington county and all the militia officers who advocated a new State, and commissioned General Russell as brigadier-general of militia and a number of other gentlemen who were opposed to the formation of a new State, as militia officers in Washington county; but when Colonel Russell and the other gentlemen holding commissions under the Governor appeared before the court and offered to qualify as required by law, Colonel Campbell, who was the presiding officer of the court, demanded of Colonel Russell and his friends to know by what authority they sought to qualify, when the commissions were produced, and Colonel Campbell, having read the commissions, left the bench and declared that he would not tamely submit to the orders of the Governor, and immediately proceeded to address the court, declaring the militia law to be in the highest degree oppressive and tyrannical, and that the Governor, having suspended the law until January, 1786, had no right to enforce it at this time. He pronounced the Governor's proclamation illegal, declaring the Governor and Council had exceeded their power, and that they had no right to enforce the militia law at that time, and he assured the court that the power to enforce law was in them and not in the Executive; and, notwithstanding the earnest protest of Colonel Russell, the court declined to permit the Governor's appointees to qualify. The General Assembly convened on the 3d day of October, 1785, and the first act passed by the Assembly was to amend the militia law enacted at the session in 1784, and to provide that the officers of the militia, who were displaced and removed from office by virtue of said act, are hereby reinstated and shall take precedency of rank agreeably to dates of the commissions they severally held prior to the passage of said Act. And this same Assembly passed several Acts having for their object the removal of the grievances complained of by Colonel Campbell and his followers in Washington county. By the Act of the Assembly above given, Colonel Campbell, once again, prevailed against his enemies and continued to discharge the duties of county lieutenant of Washington county for many years. The measures adopted by the Legislature were exceedingly moderate and conciliatory, and, as a result, all active opposition to the authority of the Virginia government ceased. The idea of forming a new government out of the western territory originated with Colonel Arthur Campbell and was adopted by the citizens of North Carolina at his suggestion. He was compelled to submit to the authority of the State of Virginia some time previous to the dissolution of the State of Frankland in North Carolina, because of the circumstances surrounding the two peoples. Colonel Campbell and his Virginia followers lived in that portion of the Commonwealth of Virginia which the State had never agreed to cede to the Continental Congress, and the sovereignty of which the Commonwealth, at no time, was willing to surrender to any other power, while the situation in North Carolina was entirely different. The General Assembly of that State had ceded all that portion of her territory embraced in the State of Frankland to the Congress of the United States, and the citizens of North Carolina felt but little interest in the matter, and as a result of this condition the Virginia seceders were promptly suppressed, while those in North Carolina were for some time permitted to pursue the even tenor of their way. The prosecution of Colonel Campbell continued with unabated vigor, and numerous depositions were taken to sustain the charges made against him. The deposition of Colonel William Russell, the chief prosecutor in the case, was as follows: "General William Russell, deposeth and saith: On the 12th day of January, 1785, at the house of William Colly in Washington county, your deponent attended a meeting of a number of inhabitants of said county. The people assembled, Colonel Campbell addressed them, saying he had called them together to explain to them the enormous sum of money paid by the people of this county to the State of Virginia, which he said repeatedly amounted to nearly two million more than was due from this county to the government. He said he was exceedingly alarmed to find that taxes were to be demanded of the people of Washington that year, then reduced to absolute certainty, the sheriff having given security for the collection. Your deponent well remembers Colonel Campbell told the people that sum of money operated upon them as a tax, and that the people ought to pay no tax till that sum was accounted for by the government to the people here. Your deponent then told the people that Colonel Campbell's deductions were drawn from erroneous calculations by the lump, intended to mislead and incense them against government. Your deponent then urged the people to pay half the tax then called for, and further told the people their compliance with that in future might perhaps favor them to procure an abatement, if not a final remittance, of the arrears by our Assembly. Colonel Campbell immediately replied, truly the gentleman preaches up to you passive obedience and non-resistance. Your deponent then informed the people the sheriff would take beef cattle for the collection, to make it easy for those who could not raise money to pay their tax. Colonel Campbell instantly replied, he liked such men who would take up arms rather than submit to so unjust a tax. Colonel Campbell then proposed that all for his measure should choose a committee, and with these retired aside. Your deponent attended a meeting at Major Dysart's on the 14th of the same instant, when Colonel Campbell addressed the people then present with the same explanation of statements he had offered on the 12th at William Colly's, urging that the people of this county had paid two millions money more than their just quota, and alleged it was unjust for us to pay tax till that was accounted for. Your deponent attended one other meeting at Sinking Spring Meeting House, on the 15th of the same instant, being Washington February court day, and your deponent supposeth nearly three hundred people were present at said meeting. Colonel Campbell addressed them as before in opposition to the collection of the taxes, and again alleged this county had paid nearly two millions over and above what ought to be paid to government, and recommended the people ought to pay no tax until that was settled by the State. Colonel Campbell said he was surprised to find in what manner measures had been taken to precipitate the collection by the sheriff and his sureties. Colonel Campbell observed, we had but lately escaped from British tyranny and he feared it was likely to take place in our own State. He exclaimed generally against the laws passed by the General Assembly in 1784, as tyrannical and oppressive. Your deponent once more observed to the people that Colonel Campbell's inferences led them to secede from government; that his insinuations and refusal to pay taxes led to rebellion, in which predicament, if led by him, we must either subjugate Virginia, or Virginia would reduce us. At July Washington court, 1785, the Governor's proclamation being read near the courthouse door, by the sheriff intended to enforce the militia law of 1784, your deponent and field officers, as by a late appointment by the Governor, went before the court, and applied to be qualified to their commissions. Colonel Campbell, then on the bench and judge of the court, he enquired to know what commission, of which your deponent informed him, and handed him the Governor's proclamation; he having read it, or part of it, took his hat, and leaving the bench, declared he would not tamely submit to it so. Colonel Campbell then addressed the court, and said that the Governor and Council had exceeded their power. He told the court the Governor's proclamation was not law. Your deponent observed to the court it was a power sufficient to enforce a law. Colonel Campbell then observed the militia law was in the highest degree oppressive and tyrannical, and the Executive having suspended the law till January, 1786, had no right to enforce it at that time, and he assured the court the power to inforce that law or not, was in them, and not in the Executive. It appeared to your deponent, that Colonel Arthur Campbell, supposing that he would be overruled by the court in his proposition, then proposed to the court to postpone the qualification of the officers till the August court. Your deponent then observed to the court the risk of the frontier would not admit of that delay, as depredations had been committed not long before on our frontiers by the savages. Colonel Campbell then replied that was not of much consequence, and further your deponent saith not. Depositions pro and con were taken in this case, at the town house, on March 6, 1786, at the house of Captain Thomas Price on Clinch, on the 10th day of March, and at Henry Herkleroads, on the 14th of said month. The following witnesses were examined against Colonel Campbell: Joseph Cole, Andrew Kincannon, Thomas Berry, James Thompson, Charles Bowen, Arthur Bowen, William Crabtree, Andrew Cowan, George Clark, James Kincannon and Robert Preston. And the following witnesses were sworn in behalf of Colonel Campbell: John Latham, Benjamin Sharp, James Dysart, Elisha Dungan, George Finley, Alex. Breckinridge, James Snodgrass, John Kinkead, Joseph Black and Robert Craig. These depositions were taken before David Ward, Andrew Cowan, John Latham, John Kinkead, John Lowry, James Fulkerson and Joseph Black. The principal deposition given in behalf of Colonel Arthur Campbell, and the one that best illustrates his defence, was that of Captain Robert Craig, which is as follows: "And the deponent further saith; that at July court, 1785, he was sent for to come into court, and when he came in saw Arthur Campbell standing on the floor, and after the said deponent, taking his seat on the bench, Colonel Russell, produced to the bench a commission which he was desirous of swearing in. Colonel Campbell wished the bench to consider the matter maturely first. Colonel Russell told the court they could not get over swearing the officers into this commission, as there was the Governor's proclamation enforcing the new militia law in this county. A member of the court was desirous of seeing the proclamation, upon which it was handed to the court, when Arthur Campbell raised some objections against it as it was an unusual manner in which it came; but however, Colonel Russell still insisted to swear into the commissions, urging that there was a necessity for swearing into them, as the frontier was in danger of being harassed by Indians. Arthur Campbell made answer that every necessary measure had been taken for the defence of the frontier, and said that the officers which had acted would not neglect doing every duty for the frontiers in their power until the August court, which was the longest time he wanted. That the then officers which were to swear into their commissions should not be opposed, if nothing was done by the Executive favorable to the old officers, for he was certain, he said, that there had been some misrepresentation sent to the Executive, or they never would have thrown out officers who had never been called to an account for any misconduct. He likewise further said that he would leave it to the choice of the people which could be known against the August court, and if the new militia law was the choice of a majority of the people, he would be heartily agreed, and could shoulder his musket as well as any of them; and then the said Arthur Campbell retired out of the house, and he does not remember of his returning into the house that day. He considered Arthur Campbell as acting as a private citizen merely in his course, and had never known of his having been guilty of misconduct as a justice of the peace, &amp;c., &amp;c. "The deponent being interrogated, what information James Montgomery gave, one of the days of the last court, respecting his reasons and motives for accusing Arthur Campbell for malpractices in his office as Justice of the Peace; Answers, on Wednesday the 2nd day of the court in conversation with James Montgomery, said Montgomery often urged that he had been ill used by Arthur Campbell, and particularly for that judgment which was obtained against him for holding a false Election in 1785, and for not getting justice in recommendations. As a Militia Officer, the said Deponent observed, that no judgment was yet obtained against him in Court, but he still insisted there was, and he blamed no other man but Arthur Campbell for it. And s'd Deponent asked said Montgomery why he and Arthur Campbell had so many disputes, as they were once good friends, and why they might not cordially drop these disputes and commence good friends again; said Montgomery answered that he had been willing to be good friends with him, but it was too late now, and if it had not been purely out of ambition and revenge he would never have raised a charge against Colonel Campbell. "And being further interrogated, if what he heard him say in his opinion, was in a dispute, depending before this Court or relative to the charges now pending before the Executive? The said Deponent answered that he understood it to be that which lay before the Executive. Being further interrogated, if he thought James Montgomery was in his proper senses, or if he thinks he was disguised with liquor at the time they had this Conversation; the deponent answers that he drank a share of a quart bowl of whiskey grog, and seemed as if he had been drinking freely before, but the said deponent cannot say he was drunk, although he expressed himself very noisy, but as sensible as usual. "The first depositions taken in this case were suppressed by the Governor and Council. The order of the Council suppressing these depositions was as follows: "Arthur Campbell, appearing in person and being attended by James Innes and Archibald Stuart, Esquires, his counsel, the Board resumed the consideration of the charges exhibited against him as a Justice of the Peace for the county of Washington, and, the charges being read, the said Arthur Campbell by his Counsel, objected to the jurisdiction of the Board to proceed to the enquiry, under the Act entitled `An Act to extend the powers of the Governor and Council,' as being repugnant to the eighth article of the declaration of rights, and the principles of the Constitution, which objection being overruled by the Board, the Counsel for the said Campbell proceeded to object to the nature and propriety of the testimony by Depositions, alleging the witnesses should personally appear and be examined `viva voce,' and that the depositions were taken in a partial manner, declaring at the same time that their client meant not to shrink from the charges being enquired into, if impartial persons should be appointed to take depositions respecting the charges, and transmit them to the Board. "Whereupon, the Board delivered their opinion, that as the certificate of the judges annexed to the depositions did not state the place as well as the time where the depositions were taken, in conformity to the notice given, they were not sufficient evidence. It was therefore ordered by the consent of the said Campbell and Alexander Montgomery, attending on the part of the accusers, that depositions respecting the charges aforesaid, as well on the part of the Commonwealth as the said Arthur Campbell be taken by either party at the Court House of said Washington County, between the first and last of next month, giving ten days' notice of the time and place of taking them, and that David Ward, Andrew Cowan, John Latham, John Kinkead, John Lowry, James Fulkerson and Joseph Black, Gentlemen, or any three of them being the commissioners chosen by the parties, attend the taking of the depositions of such witnesses as shall be produced, and that the commissioners transmit the depositions so taken, under their hand and seal, to the Governor on or before the second Tuesday in June next, at which time the parties are to be heard in the Council Chamber touching the charges aforesaid." These depositions were retaken pursuant to the above order of the Council and returned to the Governor of Virginia, whereupon Colonel Campbell addressed the following memorial to the Governor and Council: To His Excellency, the Governor of Virginia, and the Honorable the Council of State: THE MEMORIAL OF ARTHUR CAMPBELL. "Sheweth: that conscious of the purity of his intentions and the inoffensiveness of his transactions in 1785, he, last April, waived his undoubted privilege of viva voce testimony being produced against him before your Honorable Board. That he should not have waived such a benefit had it not been for the apparent sense of the Board in April last, and in confidence that the same rule for admitting evidence would be adopted before the commissioners appointed to take depositions, as are always adhered to in the Courts of Law, that such rules have been disregarded and such persons admitted to swear, who are parties in the dispute, and others interested and not credible witnesses—That as all your Memorialist's conversation complained of happened at public places, where were a large number of the inhabitants generally assembled, several of whom must have heard what words were spoken, as well as Colonel Russell, or any of the avowed complainants. That he has no objection, and it was really his desire to have a number of the most credible, disinterested persons in the county to say on their oath what they knew of the charges brought against your memorialist. However, he believes there are a sufficient number of such persons already qualified to make the truth appear to your Honorable Board, without being obliged to resort to the testimony indirectly obtained, and coming from such persons under the influence of such passions as always vitiate testimony in the Courts of Law. Your Memorialist therefore prays, that none of the depositions taken before the Commissioners, in Washington County, dated the third, fourth, and fifth days of this instant, may be admitted against him, because, however secure he may now conclude himself from the attack of malice, yet the precedent would be a dangerous one, and might one day return on the heads of those who are now so passionately anxious for the destruction of one who has really done the public no wrong. "And your Memorialist will ever Pray, &amp;c., &amp;c., "ARTHUR CAMPBELL." As far as I can ascertain, the Governor and Council sustained the charges against Colonel Campbell and removed him from the office of justice of the county court in August, 1786, but he was almost immediately reinstated upon the request of the court of this county. While Colonel Campbell's conduct in this matter may have been indiscreet and imprudent, there can be no question that he voiced the sentiments of a great majority of the citizens living in Washington county. At the next election for members of the House of Delegates from Washington county, held in the spring of the year 1787, he, along with Robert Craig, was overwhelmingly elected from this county, and Colonel Campbell for many years thereafter, retained the confidence of the people of this county and the State officials at Richmond.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Honorable the Congress of the United States of America: The memorial of the Freemen inhabitating the Country Westward of the Alleghany or Appalachian mountain, and Southward of the Ouasioto* * Indian name for Cumberland mountain. Humbly sheweth: That having been made acquainted with the several resolves and other Acts of Congress, respecting Western Territory, and having considered maturely the contents of the same, we are highly pleased with that equal respect for the Liberties of the people, which seems to influence the Councils of Congress. That nothing but a firm adherence to the principles of the Confederation, and a sacred regard to the rights of Mankind could produce the late Resolves for laying off new, Independent States, thereby pointing out such effectual measures, to prevent the encroachments of arbitrary power on the Asylums of Freedom. That we are happy to find so large a part of Territory already ceded to the United States for National purposes, and trust that every obstacle will speedily be removed for the completion of that business by the individual States affected thereby. That we are too much elated at the prospect before us not to wish that we may speedily enjoy the advantages of such a Government as will be exercised over a convenient territory, not too small for the support of authority, nor too large for the security of Freedom. That our situation is such, inhabiting valleys intermixed with and environed by vast wilds of barren and inaccessible mountains, that the same compensation of latitude allotted to the new States Northwest of the Ohio, might prevent us from ever being on an equal footing with our neighbors, blessed with so many natural advantages, navigable waters, and a level, fertile country. That the state bounded by a meridian line that will touch the confluence of Little river, near Inglis' Ferry, thence down the Kanawha to the Ronceverte or Green Briar river, thence Southwest to latitude 37 North, thence along the same to the meridian of the rapids of the Ohio, South along the Meridian until it reaches the Tenasee or Cherokee river, down the same, and eastwardly on that parallel to the top of the Appalachian mountains, and along the highest parts of the same, and the heights that divide the sources of the waters that fall into the Mississippi from those that empty into the Atlantic to the beginning. This, though not equal in quantity of habitable lands with the adjoining States, yet may be sufficient territory for a society that wishes to encourage industry and temperance as cardinal virtues. That in our present settlements we have maintained our ground during the late perilous war, and frequently gave effectual aid to our Brethren to the South and Westward; that we are first occupants and aborigines of this country, Freemen, claiming natural rights and the privileges of American citizens. Our prayer therefore is, that your Honorable Body, with a generous regard to the Rights of Mankind, would speedily erect the aforesaid described Territory into a free and independent State, subject to the Federal Bond, and likewise confirm and guarantee to its inhabitants all their equitable rights and privileges acquired under the laws of the States lately claiming this Territory; that the disposition of the vacant lands be under the power of the Legislature of the new State, in as full a manner as that exercised by such of the Eastern States having unappropriated lands, with this Reservation, that the monies arising from the sale of vacant lands shall be faithfully paid to the order of Congress, towards the payment of the National debt. And your Memorialists shall ever pray, &amp;c. Approved and subscribed by us in behalf of ourselves and the Freemen of our Respective Districts, whom we represent. Charles Cummings, Chairman.

      <field name="fulltext">"To the Freemen of Washington County: "Your Deputies, after mature consideration, have agreed to address you on the subject of your Public Affairs, well knowing that there is only wanting an exact and candid examination into the facts to know whether you have been well served or abused by your Representatives, whether Government has been wisely administered and whether your rights and Liberties are secure. As members of the Civil Society, you will acknowledge that there are duties of importance and lasting obligation which must take place before individual conveniences or private interest, but it must be granted that in free Communities the laws are only obligatory when made consonant with the constitution or Original Compact; for it is the only means of the surrender then made, the power therein given and the right ariseth to Legislate at all. Hence it is evident that the power of Legislators is in the nature of trusts to form Regulations for the good of the whole, agreeable to the powers delegated, and the deposite put into the General stock, and the end proposed is to obtain the greatest degree of happiness and safety, not for the few but for the many. To attain these ends and these only, men are induced to give up a portion of their natural Liberty and Property when they enter into society. From this it is plain that Rulers may exceed their trust, may invade the remaining portion of natural liberty and property, which would be a usurpation, a breach of solemn obligation and ultimately a conspiracy against the majesty of the people, the only treason that can be committed in a commonwealth. A much admired writer on the side of Liberty begins his work with the following remarkable sentence, which we transcribe for your information, and entreat you to read and ponder well: "In every human Society there is an effort continually pending to confer on one part the height of power and happiness, and reduce the other to extremes of weakness and misery. The intent of good laws is to oppose these Efforts, and to diffuse their influence universally and equally. But men generally abandon the care of their most important concerns to the uncertain prudence and discretion of those whose interest it is to reject the best and wisest instructions, and it is not until they have been led into a thousand mistakes in matters the most essential to their lives and Liberties, and are weary of suffering, that they can be induced to apply a remedy to the evils with which they are oppressed. It is then they begin to conceive and acknowledge the most palpable truths, which from their very simplicity commonly escape vulgar minds, incapable of analyzing objects, accustomed to receive impressions without discretion, and to be determined rather by opinions of others, than by the result of their own examination." A few plain Questions you may honestly put to yourselves when in retirement, or when your heads are reclined on your pillows; For what end hath the Almighty wrought out such a wonderful revolution in the affairs of men as that of the Independence of America? What part ought I to act through the remaining part of my life, so as to be most pleasing to my Creator and the most useful to Society? Whether are my head and heart so enlightened and in such a frame as to attend to and receive the truth, whether it comes from a person I dislike or not? Is not the duty we owe the succeeding generation equal to that we owe the present; Several Mediums of knowledge are open to all diligent inquirers. The productions of the Printing Press, Literary Schools, and the meetings of the people to debate on public measures. The inhabitants of this county have, as hitherto, been peculiarly circumstanced. They became possessors of a Wilderness at a perilous Era: The greatest part of their time since has been necessarily employed merely to provide subsistence, coarse clothing and cheap dwellings, to defend their families from the inclemency of the weather, no time or money to spare to build elegant or convenient houses, to erect suitable places for public worship, to found Seminaries for classical learning, to promote the education of youth, that most indispensable of all obligatopms to children. It is also a prior duty to any you owe the state to provide food and raiment for your families. Plain fare and coarse clothing you might be content with, if it was necessary to part with all the superfluities to answer the real exigencies of the State, and did you see your fellows in more favorable situation pursuing the same course and also could you be persuaded that a judicious economy pervades all the disbursements of all the public money, then, and not till then, ought you to part with the produce of your Industry at the call of Rulers. It may be alleged by your enemies that you do not mean to contribute anything to alleviate the burthens of the Nation and support government. This charge will vanish on a fair enquiry into the various schemes of finance and the present state of the Public Funds. The following estimate of Taxes, and what has operated as taxes in the Western Country, will prove that you have contributed something, probably your full share. Treasury and pre-emption warrants, 16,000,000 pounds Taxes collected in the years 1778, '79, '80, '81. 180,000 pounds Bills lost, sunk or funded, 5,000,000 pounds Paper money, 21,130,000 pounds Cash paid commissioners in hard money reduced, $10,000 Composition money sent in with the plots, 70,000 One-sixth of the surveyor's fees, 5,000 Registers' fees prior to 1784, 30,000 Registers' fees prior to 1784, 3,000 Registers' fees prior to 1785, 10,000 Additional tax of 5s. per hundred on land, 25,000 Duty on salt will cost the western consumption 6s. per bushel, 1,500 Duties on imports on foreign goods and enumerated articles 2,500 Loyal Company's claim on W. &amp; M. counties, 8,000 Taxes on . . . . . . . . &amp;c., may produce annually, 2,000 Assessment subsequent to 1781, an enormous sum that it is impracticable, if not unjust, to collect, 172,000 Should the Legislature abolish assessment, and the above not be sufficient, you might endure taxing a few luxurious articles and some vices, that would increase the sum, and make it equal to your just proportion of expenditures. If your eastern neighbors were generous, they would make some allowance for the great losses sustained by the depredations of the Indians, and for the many valuable lives lost to keep them safe. The appropriations of your public money ought also to be a subject of serious enquiry, for if at any time it should be applied to the purposes of venality and corruption, you would then be feeding your destroyers, and enable them to make further invasions on your remaining rights and liberties, until you would have left nothing worth contending for, and you and your posterity would be obliged to stoop to an abject vassalage. "All is not lost yet, therefore beware in the future of the objection of either weak or interested men who would persuade you to a passive conduct under all the Measures of Government. Your Rulers, as well as those of other nations, are only fallible men. When they act well, honor and applaud, when wickedly, impeach and punish them. Disregard their impotent threats and ridiculous fallacies, and let them know that the little selfish cry of an individual is not to be heard when the loud sounds of the peoples' are publishing their wrongs.

      <field name="fulltext">"Sir,— After having been honored lately with the receipt of several of your Excellency's letters, particularly that of the 17th of May last, and the several communications made in consequence of them, particularly my letter of the 13th of June, the principal officers and the Whig interest in this county seemed to rest satisfied that an amicable and enlightened administration would pave the way to the Legislature and to Congress for the efficient and permanent redress of the principal, and in some cases the almost intolerable grievances of the western inhabitants. But while secure in this confidence, we have to lament that the voice of calumny and faction has reached the seat of supreme rule, and that, without a constitutional enquiry, without a fair hearing, it has been in some degree listened to, and had effect. It is hard to defend when it is not known what we are charged with, and at all times who can disarm private pique, or be able to withstand malice and envy without feeling some smart. But political fury, engendered by Tory principles, knows no bounds and is without a parallel. Bernard and Hutchison have exhibited to Governors and the world, examples that ought to teach wisdom to this and succeeding generations. We are told (but it is only from report) that we have offended government on account of our sentiments being favorable to a new State, and our looking forward for a separation. If such a disposition is criminal, I confess there are not a few in this county to whom guilt may be imputed, and to many respectable characters in other counties on the western waters. If we wish for a separation it is on account of grievances that daily become more and more intolerable, it is from a hope that another mode of governing will make us more useful than we are now to the general confederacy, or ever can be whilst so connected. But why can blame fall on us, when our aim is to conduct measures in an orderly manner, and strictly consistent with the Constitution. Surely men who have bound themselves by every holy tie to support republican principles, cannot on a dispassionate consideration blame us. Our want of experience and knowledge may be a plea against us. We deplore our situation and circumstances on that account, but at the same time firmly believe that our advances to knowledge will still continue slow, perhaps verge towards ignorance and barbarism, without the benefit of local independent institutions. But, sir, why may we not take courage and say we are right when adverting to our own constitution, to the different Acts of Congress, that of different legislatures, the opinion of the first statesmen in America, among whom we can number an illustrious commander, a great lawyer and judge in this State, and a Governor of Virginia himself? All that I have to ask, and it is all that I may ever crave, is that your Excellency may not, from invidious information, form such rash measures, so urge matters, at an untimely day to extremities, which only might gratify an angry individual, but would, by no means, promote the interest and peace of the Commonwealth, or its honor and dignity. I am, sir, with respect, your most obedient servant, ARTHUR CAMPBELL.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. WASHINGTON COUNTY, 1787-1840. On the 8th day of March, 1787, a small party of Indians came to the settlement in Castle's Woods, where they killed a woman and two children, and made their escape in such a manner that they could not be pursued. A short while previous to this time the Indians had visited Lincoln county, Kentucky, and stolen a number of horses, and committed other depredations on the people, whereupon a company of militia, being about 100 in number, set out from Lincoln county, under the command of Colonel John Logan, to attack and destroy a small town inhabited by the Cherokees, on the north side of the Tennessee and below the Cumberland mountain, who were blamed for the depredations on the Kentucky Path and in the Kentucky country. This company, after a few days, came on a fresh trace of Indians, which they followed across Cumberland Gap, and they fell in with a company of Indians and killed seven, a chief and six warriors, and wounded several others, one of the Kentucky militia being killed and another wounded. This company of Indians proved to be from the friendly town of Chote. On the 9th day of July, 1787, a party of Indians came to the house of John Carter, on the Clinch, and killed his wife and six children, and, after plundering the house, placed the dead bodies in the same and burned the whole. About the same time a family of thirteen or fourteen were murdered by the Indians on the Clinch. During the spring of this year the Indians killed five persons on the head waters of the Clinch, two men and three women, and every indication pointed to war. The Spanish Government and the American people were, at this time, engaged in a controversy in regard to the navigation of the Mississippi river, and a gentleman writing from the Cherokee country to his friend in Virginia, on the 2d day of August, 1787, said: "Through a channel that may be credited, I am informed that Alexander McGillivray is using his utmost exertions to engage the Creek Indians in a War, not only with Georgia, but with the western parts of Virginia and No. Carolina. He has said to some of his friends that his object is to make the war as hot as possible at first, which will induce overtures for peace, and make the United States glad to grant advantageous terms, such as to acknowledge the independence and sovereignty of the Creek Nation, and admit them as members of the Federal Union. "A great number of Tories and other white desperadoes have taken refuge in the Creek country. McGillivray was a noted one, but has lately ingratiated himself into the good graces of the Spanish commandant at Mobile; is now agent for his Catholic Majesty in the Creek Nation, and a Colonel in the Spanish pay, and of late has usurped the regal authority over the Indians. McGillivray seems to be possessed of abilities, has an insatiable ambition for honor, and being aggrandized, and may not be much inferior to Hyder Ali had he the same opportunity. "Upon the whole there is reason to believe that the whole is a plan of the Court of Spain to curtail the United States in a part of their territory. If that be the case there cannot be too great care taken to disconcert them. If the Creek Nation was well humbled, and the nest of Tories that is settled among them routed and drove out of the country, I think we might have lasting peace; otherwise we may expect that, the longer it is delayed, our enemies will become more numerous and formidable." A large body of Creeks united and crossed the Hiwassee river, declaring their purpose to march for the Holston settlements. Colonel Arthur Campbell, who was in command of the defences of this and Russell county at the time, directed Captain Samuel Newell, with a detachment of men, to keep a vigilant outlook for the Creek Indians on the frontiers, and, for the purpose of retaining the friendship of the Cherokee Indians, he sent their chief the following talk: "Brother:— It is with great concern that we hear that a number of your Towns' people have lately been killed by some white men between Clinch river and Cumberland mountain, and that you blame the Virginians for it. As to who done it, I cannot certainly say, but have heard that one hundred men from Kentucky had gone towards Chickamogga Towns to take satisfaction for the murder that was done on the Kentucky path last October, and what made the people exceedingly angry, was that they heard their Captives, mostly women, were all burnt in the Chickamogga Towns. "You know when the Americans go to war, they kill no prisoners and try to save alive all the women and children. Warriors will only seek to fight with men; cowards may go to war with women. "Brother, listen attentively; ever since the year 1781, when your towns were all destroyed for joining the English, the Virginians buried the tomahawk deep, and never wish to raise it again against their brothers, the Cherokees, but are willing to live in friendship as long as the moon endures. It will be your fault if the friendship is broken. I venture to promise further, that none of the Virginians living on this side of the Cumberland mountains will molest the Cherokees without first obtaining orders from our Governor, who is a good man, and will see that you have justice done if you remain peaceable. He will also call the Kentuckians to account, if they have been guilty of destroying any of the friendly Cherokees. "Brother, call a Council of your head men, give them this Talk, exhort them to live peaceable, and wait until the Governor of Virginia can hear all the truth, and if his people are to blame, he will give him satisfaction and put a stop to former wrongs; but if you rashly go to war and kill innocent people, there may be a great deal of blood shed, for we can send a great army against you that may destroy you altogether. "Listen well. You must see that I have now given you good advice both for you and your nation. Send me in return an answer, a very long talk. Tell me all there is in your heart. If you are for keeping the chain of friendship bright, I will be your friend as heretofore, and do you all the good I can. It will give me pleasure to use means to heal the wounds and dry up the tears of those that have lost their friends, and be strong in endeavors to do justice to all the red people that keep the peace and love the Americans. "ARTHUR CAMPBELL. "To ye Great Warrior of the Cherokees." In the month of December, 1787, the Indians killed and scalped Stephen English, near Laurel river, on the Kentucky path, and William English and a young woman on Holston, and at the same time took a woman and four children prisoners, and made an incursion into Powell's Valley. They killed also, several men, women and children, and, with a number of horses, fled in the direction of the Cherokee country. During this year a large quantity of powder and lead was sent from the Holston to the Kentucky country, but it had to be guarded through the wilderness by fifty militia. In the fall of this year, Colonel Joseph Martin was discontinued from office as Indian agent for the State of Virginia, and was succeeded by Dr. — White. With the opening of the spring of 1788, the Indians began again to disturb the settlements, and on the 20th of April, came into the Rye Cove settlement and carried off three boys and a negro man, two of the boys being the sons of Thomas Carter, who then represented Russell county in the General Assembly. Early in the month of March, a party of Cherokees visited the settlements on the lower Holston, wounded one man and carried off about one hundred horses, and in the month of June, 1788, four men were killed in Russell county, and three men were killed and scalped on the Black mountain. One of the Elmires, three of the Breedings and Neal Roberts, from the New Garden settlements in Russell county, were found on Black mountain, killed and scalped. In the spring of this year the Governor requested the representatives from Montgomery, Washington and Russell counties to recommend the number of militia and scouts necessary for the protection of their several counties, when the following recommendations were submitted: "1st. That only one troop of horse are necessary to each regiment, and in some counties that might be dispensed with, and that the appointment of officers may be deferred until recommendations come from the respective counties. "2d. We believe six scouts will be sufficient for Washington and Russell, four for Montgomery, and the like number for Greenbrier. "3d. We hope that at least one full company of Rangers under an experienced officer will be allowed to do duty towards the Ohio, and, if attacks are apprehended from the Southern Indians, another company may be necessary in Powell's Valley on Clinch. Or the last-mentioned company might be raised by occasional drafts from the militia or detachments from the light companies of Washington, Montgomery and Russell. "We believe it would be an improvement were the ranging companies of one-half musket men, their guns and bayonets to be of a neat and light construction, something similar to those used by the British Highland regiments when in America. "The scouts ought to occasionally attend the ranging companies, and if Indians were to be pursued over the Ohio, horsemen, properly armed, would be useful. These are cursory thoughts; perhaps a more perfect plan and more economical might be formed, should your Excellency judge it proper to leave the consideration of the subject to a council of the field officers of the three Southwestern counties, to meet in February, except as to scouts, which we think ought to be ordered into service in February or early in March." In June of this year, a convention of delegates from the several counties of Virginia assembled in Richmond for the purpose of rejecting or ratifying the Constitution of the United States, as proposed by the Philadelphia Convention. The delegates from Washington county in this convention were Samuel Edmiston and James Montgomery. At this time such distinguished Virginians as Patrick Henry opposed the ratification of the Constitution as submitted by the Philadelphia Convention, but the Virginia Convention ratified the Constitution by a vote of 89 to 79, the delegates from Washington county voting against the ratification of the Constitution. Colonel Arthur Campbell and his followers were heartily in favor of the adoption of the Federal Constitution, and no doubt opposed the election of Edmiston and Montgomery. In the fall of the year 1788, Richard Pemberton, with his family, lived in Baptist Valley about five miles west of Tazewell courthouse. "On a Sabbath morning late in August, he started to his field, accompanied by his wife and two children, to see that his fences were not down and to repair any breach that might have been made. According to the custom of the times Mr. Pemberton had taken with him his gun, which was his constant companion. After satisfying himself that his crops were safe, the little party started back. They had gone but a few hundred yards, however, when two Indians armed with bows and arrows, knives and tomahawks, came yelling toward them at full speed. In an instant the pioneer's gun was leveled and the trigger pulled; it missed fire and in his hurry to spring the lock again, he broke it and of course, could not fire. Seeing him raise his gun to shoot caused the Indians to halt and commence firing arrows at him. Keeping himself between his wife and children and the Indians he ordered them to get on as fast as possible and try to reach a house at which a Mr. Johnson lived and where several men were living. This house was some half a mile distant, but he hoped to reach it and save those whom he held dearest, his wife and children. The Indians made every possible attempt to separate him from his family, all of which proved vain. They would retreat to a respectful distance and then come bounding back like so many furies from the regions of indescribable woe. When they came too near, he would raise his gun as if he were really reserving his fire, which would cause them to halt and try to surround him. But at every attack they shot their arrows into his breast, causing great pain. For nearly an hour this running fight was kept up; still the bloodthirsty savages pressed on. At last he was sufficiently near Johnson's house to be heard. He was heard, when he raised his powerful voice for succor. But no sooner did the men at the house hear the cry of "Indians," than they took to their heels in an opposite direction. At last he arrived at the house closely pursued by the Indians, and entering after his family, barred the door, and began to make preparation for acting more upon the defensive, when the Indians made a rapid retreat. Pemberton reached his own house the following day, where he resided many years, an eye-sore to those who had so ingloriously fled from his assistance. Many arrow points which entered his breast were never removed and were carried to the end of his life, as the best certificate of his bravery and devotion to his family."* * Bickley's History of Tazewell. Upon the ratification of the Constitution of the United States, the General Assembly of Virginia divided the State into ten congressional districts, the third district being composed of the following counties: Botetourt, Montgomery, Washington, Russell, Rockbridge, Greenbrier, Augusta, Rockingham, and directed that an election be held on the 2d day of February, 1789, at the court-house in each county in the district, for the election of a congressman. This election was held pursuant to the directions of the General Assembly of Virginia, and Andrew Moore, of Rockbridge county, was elected our first representative under the Constitution of the United States. On the 15th day of May, 1789, the Indians visited the home of Joseph Johnson, in the Rye Cove settlement, and destroyed nine members of his family, Johnson and his two sons making their escape. His wife and child were found about one-quarter of a mile from the house, killed and scalped, and the bones of another child were found burned in the house, and the rest were killed or carried into captivity. Johnson lived on Clinch river, where the old path crossed between the block-house and Rye Cove. On the first day of October, 1789, a party of Indians captured the family of one Wiley, who lived on the head waters of the Clinch. They killed and scalped four of his children and took his wife and youngest child into captivity. Mrs. Wiley soon made her escape, and upon her return made oath that the Indians told her that they would bring four hundred Indians against Clinch and Bluestone in the summer of 1790. In the fall of this year, William Whitely, who lived in Baptist Valley, on the line dividing Russell and Montgomery counties, had occasion to leave his home for a short distance in search of his horses, when a party of Indians fell on him and cut him into small pieces, which they strung on the bushes; they cut out his heart and flung it against the ground with so much violence that it covered itself in the soil. During this same year, a party of Shawnese Indians ascended the Dry fork of Tug river and fell upon the family of James Roark, who lived at a gap in the dividing ridge between the Clinch and Sandy rivers. Roark and two of his sons were not at home at the time. The Indians killed Mrs. Roark and several children. Roark's Gap, the scene of this massacre, is near Maxwell's station in Tazewell county, and the location of the house occupied by Roark and his family is still pointed out by the citizens to every passer-by. The house stood near a beautiful spring, and what is termed an "Indian mound" is found near by. During this same year, John Davidson, who lived on the head waters of the Clinch, was waylaid and killed by a band of Indians while feeding his horse at a cabin. The Indians were accompanied on this expedition by a white man, who robbed Davidson's saddle-bags of their contents. In October of the year 1789, Colonel Campbell made a return of the militia of Washington county, from which it was ascertained to consist of one county lieutenant, one colonel, one lieutenant-colonel, one major, fifteen captains, thirteen lieutenants, eleven ensigns, thirty sergeants, three drummers, two fifers, 675 rank and file, adding in his remarks, "no return from three companies." "In June, 1790, a predatory party of Indians came from the Rockcastle hills in Kentucky and made their appearance at the cabin of Isaac Newland, on the North fork of Holston, the place subsequently owned by Michael Fleenor and still in possession of his descendants, some eight miles north of Abingdon. Mr. Newland and his son were at work in a clearing near by, with no one at the cabin but his wife and her infant. The Indians captured the mother and infant, burnt the cabin and hurried away with their captives directly through the mountains toward Russell. The alarm being given Jacob Mongle (father of Colonel Abram Mongle), being the nearest neighbor, gathered a company in as short a time as possible and took the trail, which had been plainly marked by Mrs. Newland, who had the presence of mind to break twigs by the way and leave other signs. After reaching the valley in which Lebanon is now situated, and fearing that the powder in their flint guns had become dampened in passing through the thick undergrowth of the mountain, they discharged their guns for the purpose of reloading, in order to make sure work should they overtake the savages, but it unfortunately so happened that the Indians had halted, and hearing the report of firearms took the alarm, murdered their victims and made their escape. A few minutes after, the pursuing party came to where the mother and child were lying, the latter not quite dead. They brought them back to the settlements, Jacob Mongle carrying the infant, which died in his arms on the way. The alarm having reached the little settlement at Abingdon it produced great consternation and serious apprehensions as to what might befall the little community at Castle's Woods, as the Indians would probably return in that direction, it being in a line with their towns beyond the Cumberland. A young man by the name of Douglass living at Abingdon, a fearless and determined Indian fighter, proposed to cross the mountains to Castle's Woods, for the purpose of warning the settlers of the impending danger, and a young friend by the name of Benham, volunteered, against the expostulations of his relatives and friends, to accompany him on this perilous journey. "Everybody in this country acquainted with the old road through Little Moccasin Gap, will remember the large, square, flat, table-like rock, some five or six feet high, which stood on the lower side of the old trace along the creek not far from opposite the little mill now on the new road in the gap, the noisy machinery of which sends strange echoes along the surrounding peaks in these days of piping peace and corn dodgers. Douglass and Benham had reached that rock, and as was the custom of most wayfarers as long as that old road was the highway through the gap, had probably halted to eat a snack. At this moment the report of a rifle was heard, when Douglass fell mortally wounded. He at once told Benham that the shot was fatal and urged him to dodge into the laurel bordering the stream, make his escape to Castle's Woods and warn the settlers. Douglass saw the smoke of a rifle rise from a log between the stream and where the road now passes, and knowing that it was the habit of the Indian to lie still under such circumstances till the smoke cleared away, when he would cautiously raise his head to see the effect of his fire, he drew a bead upon the spot as he lay propped upon his elbow, and Benham afterwards stated that he had not gone fifteen yards when he heard the report of Douglass's rifle. Benham hurried on through the gap, reached Castle's Woods in safety, and gave the alarm. A company returning a day or two after found the body of Douglass lying where Benham left him, with his scalp gone, and on examining the place where the smoke of the Indian's rifle was seen, blood and brains were found upon the log, showing that Douglass at the instant he entered upon that journey from which no traveler returns, took an Indian with him on the solemn march. A grave was excavated among the rocks on the roadside where he fell, in which his body was deposited and still sleeps, amid the wildest and most romantic scenery of all our mountain gorges. It was the custom for each passer-by who knew the spot to drop a pebble upon the rude mound, to perpetuate the memory of the resting place of the brave pioneer who sacrificed his life for the safety of others perhaps unknown to him, but the vandalism of modern change, instead of rearing a monument to his memory on the spot, wantonly changed the location of the road to avoid a slight elevation, and thus obliterated forever the little hillock that marked the receptacle of the ashes of the hero and martyr.* * Wilburn Waters and Chas. B. Coale. Captain Isaac Newland was an active, thriving man, ambitious for preferment by his country, but the sad occurrence above given had such a bad effect upon him, that "grief for a time seemed to absorb all powers of his mind and body, and he settled down into a deep melancholy, regardless of every object or occurrence. He finally sought comfort in religion, and became a Baptist preacher."† † Chas. B. Coale. In the spring of the year 1790, a little boy, the son of John Frazer, of Russell county, was taken prisoner, and in the fall of this same year, the entire family of John Frazer was murdered on the Kentucky road. About the middle of August, 1790, six persons were killed by the Indians on Clinch river in Russell county. In the year 1791, Ensign Simon Cockrell recommended to the Governor the placing of ten men at Baptist's Valley, ten men at Richlands, ten men at New Garden, ten men at Glade Hollow, twenty men at Castle's Woods, ten men at crossing of Clinch and Kentucky road, ten men at Moccasin Gap, ten men at Rye Cove, as a protection against the invasion of the Indians, and as far as I can ascertain, the people of this section were exempt from Indian attacks until the fall of 1792. In the fall of 1791, the Governor instructed Captains Andrew Lewis and John Preston to recruit two companies of volunteer militia for the defence of the frontiers of Montgomery, Wythe and Russell counties, and by the 7th of February, 1792, their companies consisted of four musicians, two ensigns, eight sergeants, eight corporals, six scouts and one hundred and thirty-two privates, besides the captains and lieutenants, and with this force Captains Lewis and Preston very effectively defended the frontiers during the summer of 1792. In the year 1793, in the election for a representative in the Congress of the United States, the candidates before the people of the Fourth District of Virginia, which district was composed of the counties of Wythe, Greenbrier, Kanawha, Lee, Russell, Montgomery, Grayson and Washington, were Abraham Trigg, of Montgomery county and Francis Preston, of Washington county. Abraham Trigg was a Jeffersonian Republican, while Preston was a Washingtonian Federalist, and the contest between the candidates representing these diverse principles was bitter. The result was the election of Colonel Preston by a majority of ten votes. Colonel Trigg was not satisfied with the result and contested the election of Preston, and assigned the following grounds to sustain his contest. First. That the sheriff of Lee county closed the poll at 2 P. M. on the day of the election and refused to reopen the same. Second. That the sheriff of Washington county adjourned the poll two days instead of one as required by the law, and that nonresidents of the State voted for Colonel Preston in said election. Third. That Captain William Preston, a brother of Francis Preston, was stationed near Montgomery courthouse with sixty or seventy Federal troops, and that on the day of the election, Captain Preston's troops were marched three times around the court-house and were paraded in front of and close to the door thereof. Fourth. That said troops were polled in favor of Preston. That a part of the troops stood at the door of the courthouse and refused to let the electors favoring Trigg enter the house, and in one instance knocked down a magistrate who sought admission, being an advocate of Colonel Trigg. This contest was as hotly fought before Congress as the election had been before the people. The Elections Committee of the House of Representatives on the 17th day of April, 1794, reported in favor of unseating Francis Preston. This report was debated for many days, after which a vote was taken, which vote resulted in the report of the committee being rejected and Francis Preston was thereupon declared duly seated. Colonel Preston was returned a member of Congress from this district by successive elections till the year 1797. Thus our district early in its history witnessed a contest before the Congress of the United States. At the election held for a presidential elector, on the first Monday in November, 1792, for the district composed of the counties of Wythe, Washington, Russell and Montgomery, Claiborne Watkins was selected an elector from this district to vote for President and Vice-President of the United States. In the month of December, 1792, Captain Tate and forty men were passing through the wilderness on their way to Kentucky, when they were attacked by a company of Creek and Cherokee Indians, and, about the same time, several lesser encounters occurred, but I cannot ascertain the casualties on either side. In the fall of 1792, the citizens of North Carolina provoked a war with the Indians, and, in the month of October, John Watts, at the head of a thousand hostile Indians, threatened an invasion of the Holston settlements and the settlements in Powell's Valley. Watts, with his forces, began his march for the settlements and reached Buchanan's fort within five miles of Knoxville, where he was repulsed with a loss of fifteen men killed, Watts himself receiving a bad wound. After this repulse, Watts's army dispersed in small parties, declaring their purpose to invade the settlements and to attack the settlers out of their forts. It was the declared purpose of Watts and his followers, to drive off and destroy the whole of the inhabitants in Powell's Valley. The situation was truly alarming for the Virginia settlements in Powell's Valley, and the Governor of Virginia requested Colonel Arthur Campbell and Captain John Preston to submit to him their views as to the proper manner to proceed to place the western frontiers in a defensive position. Colonel Arthur Campbell submitted the following proposal: "That a company of fifty men as rangers, be engaged for three months from the first day of December next, to do duty at or near Cumberland Gap. As it is in the contemplation of the Executive of the State of Kentucky to have a fort built about half way in the wilderness, and place a garrison of fifty men in it, our troops, after they fortify their camp, may meet those rangers occasionally, and to the southward meet those under the direction of Governor Blount, which would form a chain of connection that might preclude the necessity of troops being stationed on Clinch river. As to attempts of the Southern enemy, the regulars on the Ohio may cover that frontier from the inroads of the Northern Indians. But it will be useless respecting the Southern war. The post at Cumberland Gap, besides covering a detached frontier settlement in Virginia, will divide the distance between Danville and Hawkins Courthouse and of course will facilitate the transportation of the mail and secure our intercourse with the army on the Ohio by land. This is a plan of economy, on account of the idea of the Executive of the general government. A full company ought to be the number for this service, as they may be assailed by large parties of Indians and as they will be more than one hundred miles from the settlement from which they can expect succour in case of extremity. It will be peculiarly mortifying, if the frontier of Virginia, exposed to the attacks of the Southern Indians, be neglected, when their neighbors in the Southwestern Territory, not so much in danger, have an ample force ranging around the settlements. The Virginians, without murmuring, pay duties to the general government; the citizens of the Southwestern Territory not a shilling; Georgia and South Carolina are arranging to oppose the same enemy, and will no doubt be paid for their services out of the Treasury of the United States." Captain John Preston proposed, that there should be stationed: "At the mouth of Greenbrier, an ensign, sergeant and sixteen privates. "At the five-mile fork of East river, a lieutenant, one sergeant, a corporal and twenty-four privates. "At Lincolnshire, on Clinch, a captain, a sergeant, a corporal and twenty-four privates. "At Hawkins, in the Baptist Valley, a sergeant and eight privates. "At Brown's or Fugate's, in the Richlands, a sergeant, corporal and twelve privates. "At Wilkinson's, in the New Garden, a lieutenant, sergeant and sixteen privates. "At the mouth of Dump's creek, an ensign, two corporals and twelve privates. "At Roberson's, in Castle's Woods, a captain, a sergeant, corporal and twenty-four privates. "At Blackmore's Station, a sergeant, corporal and twelve privates. "At Carter's, in Rye Cove, a captain, sergeant, corporal and twenty-four privates. "At Turkey Cove, a captain, sergeant, corporal and twenty-four privates. "At Martin's old station, an ensign, sergeant and corporal. "At Cox's, an ensign, sergeant, corporal and sixteen privates. "At Martin's lower station, sometimes called the blockhouse, where Robinson lives, which is the lower settlement of Virginia, and where the Kentucky road enters this State, a captain, two sergeants, two corporals and thirty-one privates. "At Blackwater branch, a place exposed to the south in Lee county, a lieutenant, sergeant, corporal and twelve privates. "And the scouts to be dispersed along the frontier as shall be deemed necessary, and changed when required." I cannot say which proposition was acted upon, but it is certain that steps were taken to protect the frontiers. Captain Matthew Willoughby and Ensign William Campbell were stationed in Powell's Valley. The trouble with the Indians began at the opening of spring in the year 1793. On Sunday about the first day of April, Ensign Moses Cockrell and two men were passing from Rye Cove to Powell's Valley, with several loaded horses. On the top of Powell's mountain they were fired on by twelve Indians. The two men who accompanied Cockrell were shot dead on the spot, and Cockrell himself was pursued to the foot of the mountain. Two of his horses were killed and all the loads lost. Captain Neal, with a party, pursued the Indians but did not succeed in overtaking them. The Chief who led this company of Indians was a half-breed Shawnese by the name of Benge. A writer in speaking of this occurrence says: "He was remarkable for his strength, activity, endurance and great speed as a runner. He was a man of more than average intelligence also, as well as of great bravery and strategy, and had more than once approached the settlements so stealthily and by a route so secret that he fell upon the scattered settlers without an intimation of his approach and retired to his wigwams beyond the Cumberland without leaving a trace of the route he had traveled, though rangers were constantly on the lookout for his trail. One of these rangers of the Holston settlements was a man by the name of Cockrell, and the writer must make a digression to record an incident in his history. He was famous for his size, activity and handsome person. Benge and himself were rivals in manhood and woodcraft, each jealous of the other's prowess and courage, and both anxious for an occasion to meet in single combat. Not many months before Benge's last incursion, they met on top of Powell's mountain, in what is now Lee county, each with a band of followers. The Indians were in ambush, having observed the approach of the whites, who were not aware of their proximity, and Benge instructed his companions not to kill Cockrell, so that he himself might run him down and capture him. At the crack of the Indian rifles two or three of Cockrell's companions fell; seeing which and at once comprehending the folly of a combat with a dozen savages, he sprang away down the mountain side, like an antelope, with Benge in close pursuit. Two miles away in the valley on Wallen's creek was the cabin of a pioneer, in reaching which Cockrell knew was his only chance of escape. Having two hundred dollars in specie in a belt around him, he found he was carrying two much weight for a closely contested race, and that Benge was gaining on him. Making a desperate effort, however, he increased his speed a little, and as he leaped the fence that surrounded the cabin, Benge's tomahawk was buried in the top rail before Cockrell reached the ground. Benge seeing that he had missed his aim, and not knowing how many men and rifles might be in the cabin, fled back to his companions, sadly disappointed. A few years after this Cockrell died on the north fork in this county, and during the "wake," while his body lay in the cabin, an old comrade who had been in many a hard pinch with him, thus gave utterance to his thoughts and feelings as he paced the puncheon floor in great sorrow: "Poor Cockrell, he is gone! He was a noble fellow after Injuns and varmints, and I hope he has gone to where there is as much game and as desperate good range as he had on Holston!"* * Coale's "Wilburn Waters." During the same week, fourteen persons were killed on the Kentucky road, near the Hazel Patch. The whites discovered the Indians and attempted to secure the first fire, but failed, and only two of the whites made their escape. The Indians lost five dead, and one white man with them killed. Both parties broke and ran at the same time in opposite directions. About the 15th of March, 1793, several emigrants were killed on the Kentucky road. Captain Andrew Lewis, to appease the settlers who were about to break up, placed a sergeant and twelve men at Dump's creek. At Rye Cove, a sergeant and seven men. At St. Mary's, with the French, a sergeant and seven men, which left twenty men at Fort Lee. On the 20th day of March, 1793, a party of Indians numbering twenty-three appeared upon the frontiers of Wythe and Montgomery, frequently showing themselves, to the terror of the inhabitants. John Davidson was murdered by them and a number of horses were stolen from Wolf creek, Bluestone and Island creek. The Indians made their escape, except a small party entrusted with the care of about eighty horses, from Island creek. This company was pursued by a large party from Bluestone and another from the head of Clinch, and were overtaken the next day, at the mouth of Little Cole, at what is called the Island of Guyandotte, where they were attacked by the whites. Three of their number were killed and scalped, all the horses retaken, with the arms and blankets of a part of their warriors. The number of Indians concerned in the murder of John Davidson at the Laurel fork of Wolf creek was about twelve. This party of Indians carried off a number of horses from that neighborhood and passed with them in daylight through the heart of the Bluestone settlement. Colonel Arthur Campbell, in the spring of the year 1793, was commissioned by the President of the United States as Indian agents, and in April of this year, communicated to the President of the United States a request from the Chickasaw Indians for the building of a fort and the settling of a strong garrison, at the Muscle Shoals,* * Near Chattanooga, Tenn. and, in commenting upon this request wrote: "I will observe on this invitation, that I am of opinion, from the best information, that the United States had never so great an offer made them, for the point of position which they will give peaceably into our hands commands a portage of sixteen miles only, between the Tennessee and the navigable waters of the Mobile, as well as an immense extent of country, which must shortly become the bone of Spanish contention, and facilitate the route to many angles on the Mississippi. It is Nature's masterpiece for an immense and powerful city. It intercepts the main communication between the hostile tribes of the North and South. It secures the Chickasaw and Choctaw Nations as effective light infantry in our service. It places the troops where they can be supplied with every necessary, even with native productions from the respective western settlements, and puts us in a condition to convey heavy artillery of our own casting as well as army and military supplies, with a degree of facility unsuspected by the Spanish, whenever the threatening harms shall burst on this devoted country, this field of contest." This extract from the writings of Colonel Campbell, is given to illustrate his character and foresight. In the same letter he says: "I have nearly completed a new map of all this country, as well as that of Kentucky and a part of the northwestern territory, and shall go on in a few days to lay it before the President." I am sorry indeed that I cannot find this map in any of the records I have been able to obtain. Colonel Isaac Bledsoe was killed on Cumberland in the month of April, and on the 20th of the month, a skirmish took place between twenty Indians and eight white men at Laurel river, in Kentucky, in which skirmish the white people were all killed, except McFarland, who escaped, and a number who were wounded. In the month of March, 1793, a considerable band of Indians were seen on the headwaters of the Clinch river attempting to steal horses. The Indians finally succeeded in stealing eight horses, and made off toward the Ohio. In the meantime Major Robert Crockett proceeded to gather a company to pursue the Indians, and while engaged in gathering them in he directed Joseph Gilbert and Samuel Lusk, two scouts, to follow the Indians, and, in case they found them, to give him information. Gilbert and Lusk had not followed the Indians more than an hour, when they came to a lick, at which the Indians had concealed themselves waiting for deer or elk. As soon as the scouts approached the lick they were fired upon by the Indians, and Lusk was wounded in the hand. Gilbert turned and started to run, when Lusk called him to stay and save his life, if possible. Gilbert, fired with all the noble instincts of true manhood, turned and shot the first Indian dead on the spot. The Indians surrounded him, and, his gun being empty, he dropped it and drew his hunting knife, and attacked the Indians with such spirit that they dared no longer get within his reach; but they used their tomahawks with such effect that he soon lay dead by the side of Lusk, who was now reviving. The Indians scalped Gilbert and carried Lusk off a prisoner. Major Crockett and his force came up after some time, but they were too late to accomplish any good. On the 25th of April, 1793, the first postoffice on the waters of the Holston or Clinch was established at Abingdon with Gerrard T. Conn as postmaster, this being the first time that the people of this portion of Virginia were given the privilege of mail facilities. Previous to this time the means employed by the people for communication was by sending their letters by the hand of some one going or returning. A citizen of Abingdon, contemplating a trip to Kentucky, or to the Valley, or Eastern Virginia, would advertise the fact, and the time when he would begin his journey, that he might be the bearer of letters and messages between the people. The settlements, as far as I can ascertain, were exempt from invasion by the Indians until the month of October of this year. On the third day of this month a party of Indians attacked two families who had lately settled on the road through the wilderness, on the Kentucky side of the Cumberland mountain, within three miles of Hawkins' Station. They killed one man and wounded two children, but were driven off by a man who occupied an adjoining house. In the fall of 1793, a party of eight Indians passed through the thinly-settled parts of Russell county, and captured a negro woman, the property of Paul Livingston, near Big Moccasin Gap, but before they could carry her beyond the settlements she made her escape and reached her home. On the 14th day of April, 1794, a number of citizens presented a petition to the Governor, which is as follows: "The memorial and petition of the subscribers, Inhabitants in the western part of Washington county, and the eastern settlements of Lee, near Mockison Gap,— "Humbly sheweth, That altho' we have been considered an interior settlement, yet, from various unfortunate occurrences, it must appear that we are equally exposed with the most distant frontier settlements. "That by attending to the geography of the Southwestern frontier, it will appear that from the western settlement of Russell county, on Clinch river, and the eastern of Lee in Powell's Valley, there is an uninhabited space of more than twenty miles nearly north of your petitioners' dwellings, which makes us to that extent a frontier to the State, "That the predatory parties of the Indians, always industrious in discovering the weakness of our settlements, have for years past made their inroads through this vacant or uninhabited space, and have committed several cruel murders in the neighborhood of your petitioners, as will appear by the following detail: "August 26, 1791, a party of Indians headed by a Captain Bench, of the Cherokee tribe, attacked the house of Elisha Ferris, two miles from Mockison Gap, murdered Mr. Ferris at his house, and made prisoner Mrs. Ferris and her daughter, Mrs. Livingston, and a young child together with Nancy Ferris. All but the latter were cruelly murdered the first day of their captivity. "April 1793, the same chief with a party of Indians, attacked and murdered the family of Harper Ratcliffe, six in number, about eight miles west of the above-mentioned gap. "March 31, 1793, the enemy attacked on Powell's mountain Moses Cockrell and two others, who had horses loaded with merchandise; killed two men, took all the goods, and pursued Mr. Cockrell nearly two miles. "July 17, 1793, Bench with two other warriors traversed the settlement, on the north fork of Holston for upwards of twenty miles, probably with the intention of making discoveries where were negro property. In this rout they fired at one Williams, and too prisoner a negro woman, the property of Paul Livingston, who after two days captivity made her escape. "And lastly, April 6, 1794, the melancholy disaster which befell Mr. Livingston's family and property, which has urged this application for assistance to prevent the depopulation of a considerable settlement. "From the above facts your Excellency and Council will be a judge of the justice of our claim, that such protection be afforded us, as the State may be able to afford and our necessities require. "All of which we submit with deference and your petitioners will ever pray. "A. BLEDSOE, "GEORGE WILCOX, "ABRAHAM FULKERSON, "JOHN V. COOK, "JAMES FULKERSON, "April 14, 1794." The disaster referred to in this communication as happening to Mr. Livingston's family, occurred on the 6th of April, 1794, near the present town of Mendota in this county. William Todd Livingston was one of the first persons to settle in this county and was the first and only man for many years in the county, who had more than one name. He had died some years preceding this occurrence, and his son Peter Livingston, had become the owner of his valuable lands and numerous negro slaves. The Indians, in making their incursions into the country, never failed to steal and carry off a negro slave, when possible, and there can be but little doubt that the presence of negroes at the Livingston farm, attracted the attention of the Indians. An account of this Indian raid was given by Mrs. Elizabeth Livingston, and put down in her presence nearly in her own words, and is as follows: "April 6th, 1794. "About 10 o'clock in the morning, as I was sitting in my house, the fierceness of the dog's barking alarmed me. I looked out and saw seven Indians approaching the house, armed and painted in a frightful manner. No person was then within, but a child of ten years old, and another of two, and my sucking infant. My husband and his brother Henry had just before walked out to a barn at some distance in the field. My sister-in-law, Susanna, was with the remaining children in an out-house. Old Mrs. Livingston was in the garden. I immediately shut and fastened the door; they (the Indians) came furiously up, and tried to burst it open, demanding of me several times to open the door, which I refused. They then fired two guns; one ball pierced through the door, but did me no damage. I then thought of my husband's rifle, took it down but it being double triggered, I was at a loss; at length I fired through the door, but it not being well aimed I did no execution; however the Indians retired from that place and soon after that an old adjoining house was on fire, and I and my children suffering much from the smoke. I opened the door and an Indian immediately advanced and took me prisoner, together with the two children. I then discovered that they had my remaining children in their possession, my sister Sukey, a wench with her young child, a negro man of Edward Callihan's and a negro boy of our own about eight years old. They were fearful of going into the house I left, to plunder, supposing that it had been a man that shot at them, and was yet within. So our whole clothing and household furniture were consumed in the flames, which I was then pleased to see, rather than that it should be of use to the savages. "We were all hurried a short distance, where the Indians were very busy, dividing and putting up in packs for each to carry his part of the booty taken. I observed them careless about the children, and most of the Indians being some distance off in front, I called with a low voice to my eldest daughter, gave her my youngest child, and told them all to run towards neighbor John Russell's. "They, with reluctance, left me, sometimes halting, sometimes looking back. I beckoned them to go, although I inwardly felt pangs not to be expressed on account of our doleful separation. The two Indians in the rear either did not notice this scene, or they were willing the children might run back. "That evening the Indians crossed Clinch Mountain and went as far as Copper creek, distant about eight miles. "April 7th, set out early in the morning, crossed Clinch river at McLean's fish dam about twelve o'clock, then steered northwardly towards the head of Stoney creek. There the Indians camped carelessly, had no back spy nor kept sentries out. This day's journey was about twenty miles. "April 8th. Continued in camp until the sun was more than an hour high; then set out slowly and traveled five or six miles and camped near the foot of Powell's mountain. This day Benge, the Indian chief, became more pleasant, and spoke freely to the prisoners. He told them he was about to carry them to the Cherokee towns. That in his route in the wilderness was his brother with two other Indians hunting, so that he might have provision when he returned. That at his camp were several white prisoners taken from Kentucky, with horses and saddles to carry them to the towns. He made enquiry for several persons on Holston, particularly old General Shelby, and said he would pay him a visit during the ensuing summer, and take away all his negroes. He frequently enquired who had negroes, and threatened he would have them all off the North Holston. He said all the Chickamogga towns were for war, and would soon be very troublesome to the white folks. "This day two of the party were sent by Benge ahead to hunt. "April 9th. After travelling about five miles, which was over Powell's mountain, and near the foot of the Stone mountain,* * Near Dorchester, Wise county. a party of thirteen men under command of Lieutenant Vincent Hobbs, of the militia of Lee county, met the enemy in front, attacked and killed Benge the first fire, I being at that time some distance off in the rear. The Indian who was my guard at first halted on hearing the firing. He then ordered me to run, which I performed slowly. He attempted to strike me in the head with the tomahawk, which I defended as well as I could with my arm. By this time two of our people came in view, which encouraged me to struggle all I could. The Indian making an effort at this instant pushed me backward, and I fell over a log, at the same time aiming a violent blow at my head, which in part spent its force on me and laid me for dead. The first thing I afterwards remembered was my good friends around me, giving me all the assistance in their power for my relief. They told me I was senseless for about an hour. "Certified this 15th day of April, 1794. "A CAMPBELL." Vincent Hobbs was a lieutenant in the militia of Lee county, and, at the time in question, he was attending the court of that county which was in session. Upon the arrival of the express with the news of the Indian invasion, the court immediately adjourned and a party was organized upon the spot, under the command of Hobbs, to waylay a gap in Cumberland mountain called the Stone gap, through which, it was supposed, the Indians were mostly to pass. On his arrival at the gap, Hobbs discovered that the Indians had just passed through before him; he therefore pursued with eagerness and soon discovered two Indians kindling a fire; these, they instantly dispatched, and finding some plunder with them, which they knew must have been taken out of Livingston's house, they at once came to the conclusion that these two had been sent forward to hunt for provisions and that the others were yet behind with the prisoners. "The object of Hobbs was now to make a quick retreat, to cover his own sign if possible, at the gap, before the Indians should discover it, and perhaps kill the prisoners and escape. Having gained this point he chose a place of ambuscade; but not exactly liking this position he left the men there, and taking one with him by the name of Van Bibber, he went some little distance in advance to try if he could find a place more suitable for his purpose. As they stood looking around for such a place, they discovered the Indians coming up with their prisoners. They cautiously concealed themselves and each singled out his man. Benge, having charge of the younger Mrs. Livingston, led the van, and the others followed in succession; but the Indian who had charge of the elder Mrs. Livingston was considerably behind, she not being able to march with the same light, elastic step of her sister. When the front came directly opposite to Hobbs and Van Bibber they both fired, Hobbs killing Benge, and Van Bibber the one next behind him. At the crack of the rifle the other men rushed forward, but the Indians had escaped into a laurel thicket, taking with them a negro fellow. The Indian who had charge of the elder Mrs. Livingston tried his best to kill her, but he was so hurried that he missed his aim. Her arms were badly cut by defending her head from the blows of his tomahawk. The prisoners had scarcely time to recover from their surprise before the two Livingstons, who heard the guns and were now in close pursuit with a party of men from Washington, came running up and received their wives at the hands of Hobbs with a gust of joy. Four Indians were killed and five had escaped, and it appears they were separated into parties of three and two. The first had the negro fellow with them, and, by his account, they lodged that night in a cave, where he escaped from them and got home. In the meantime a party of the hardy mountaineers of Russell collected and proceeded in haste to waylay a noted Indian crossing place high up on the Kentucky river. When they got there they found some Indians had just passed. They immediately drew the same conclusion that Hobbs had done, and hastened back to the river for fear those behind should discover their sign. Shortly after they had stationed themselves, the other three made their appearance; the men fired upon them, two fell and the other fled, but left a trail of blood behind him, which readily conducted his pursuers to where he had taken refuge in a thick canebrake. It was thought imprudent to follow him any further, as he might be concealed and kill some of them before they could discover him. Thus eight of the party were killed and the other perhaps mortally wounded."* * MSS letter of Benj Sharp. Colonel Campbell communicated to the Governor of Virginia the circumstances attending this raid by the Indians; along with the written statement of Mrs. Livingston, as heretofore given. Colonel Campbell in his letter to the Governor, says: "The scalp of Captain Benge, I have been requested to forward to your Excellency, as a proof that he is no more, and of the activity and good conduct of Lieutenant Hobbs, in killing him and relieving the prisoners. Could it be spared from our treasury, I would beg leave to hint that a present of a neat rifle to Mr. Hobbs would be accepted, as a reward for his late services, and the Executive may rest assured that it would serve as a stimulus for future exertions against the enemy." The General Assembly of Virginia, pursuant to this recommendation, voted Lieutenant Vincent Hobbs a handsome and costly silver-mounted rifle. Many of the descendants of Lieutenant Hobbs live in Southwest Virginia at this time, and are highly respected and patriotic. One of the principal creeks in the county of Wise, at this day bears the name of the Indian chief, Benge. This is the last recorded invasion of Southwest Virginia by the red men. On the 2d of June, 1794, Colonel Campbell reported the militia of the county to the Governor of Virginia as follows: Regiment No. 70, brigade No. 17, division No. 3, 1,287 free white males of sixteen years and upwards, completely organized. In August of this year William King and James Caldwell, natives of Ireland and merchants by profession, took the oath of fidelity to the Commonwealth in the county court of this county. William King, who at this time became a citizen of Washington county, afterwards became one of the wealthiest and most influential men who ever lived in this county and left a large number of relatives. The General Assembly of Virginia, on the 28th day of December, 1794, passed an act requiring the people of Washington county to pay their taxes for the years 1782-1783-1784, and appointed Thomas Mitchell to collect the same as the officer of the State, and after some time, he succeeded in collecting all that was due the State from the people of the county. In the year 1795, a number of the citizens of Washington and Russell counties emancipated their slaves; among the number Elizabeth Russell, sister of Patrick Henry and wife of General William Campbell, Francis Preston, Charles Bickley and others. The deeds executed by Mrs. Russell and Francis Preston are as follows: Whereas by the wrong doing of men it hath been the unfortunate lot of the following negroes to be slaves for life, to-wit: Vina, Adam, Nancy sen., Nancy, Kitty and Selah. And whereas believing the same have come into my possession by the direction of Providence, and conceiving from the clearest conviction of my conscience aided by the power of a good and just God, that it is both sinful and unjust, as they are by nature equally free with myself, to continue them in slavery, I do, therefore, by these presents, under the influence of a duty I not only owe my conscience, but the just God who made us all, make free the said negroes hoping while they are free of man they will faithfully serve their Maker through the merits of Christ. Given under my hand and seal this 21st day of July, 1795. ELIZABETH RUSSELL, (L. S.) To all whom it may concern: Whereas my negro man John (alias) John Broady, claims a promise of freedom from his former master General William Campbell, for his faithful attendance on him at all times, and more particularly while he was in the army in the last war, and I who claim the said negro in right of my wife, daughter of the said General William Campbell, feeling a desire to emancipate the said negro man John, as well for the fulfillment of the above-mentioned promise, as the gratification of being instrumental of prompting a participation of liberty to a fellow creature, who by nature is entitled thereto, do by these presents for myself, my heirs, executors and administrators fully emancipate and make free to all intents and purposes the said negro man John (alias) John Broady from me forever. As witness my hand and seal, this 20th day of September, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-three. FRANCIS PRESTON, (L. S.) From an inspection of the records of our court at the time in question, it seems that there was a strong sentiment prevailing among the people of this section of Virginia in favor of abolishing slavery. The next occurrence of importance was the organization of a Masonic lodge, at the house of James White, in the town of Abingdon, on the 3d day of October, 1796, by virtue of a dispensation from the Grand Master of Virginia. This lodge of Masons was organized through the influence of William King, Daniel Murphey, Robert Johnston, Charles Carson, William Preston Skillem, Francis Preston, Claiborne Watkins and Joseph Hays. The lodge thus organized is still in existence, and has exercised a wonderful influence for good in the history of our county. Upon the death of General Washington, in the year 1799, information of which reached Abingdon, in January, 1800, the Masonic Lodge, at their regular stated meeting on the 21st day of January, adopted the following resolutions: "The lodge, viewing with a lively regret the loss the world and particularly Masonry has sustained by the death of our beloved brother, `the great Washington,' and being desirous to exhibit a testimonial of its exalted opinion of its virtues, "Resolved, That the Worshipful Master, Francis Preston, be requested to deliver an eulogium on the 22d day of next month, at the courthouse, adapted to the occasion." And at a stated meeting of the lodge on the 18th of February, 1800, the following resolutions were adopted: "On motion of Brother Smith, seconded by Brother Tate, ordered that a committee be appointed by the Worshipful Master, consisting of five members of the lodge to meet a committee of the citizens of Washington county in order to enter into regulations for the celebration of the memory of the great Washington on the 22d instant, so that the Mason and the soldier may be united with ease and ornament. That the said committee do meet the citizens forthwith; whereupon the Master appointed Brothers William Tate, Robert Preston, Francis Smith, William King and Joseph Hays to form the said committee. "Resolved, That on the 22d instant the Masons meet at their hall and march in procession from the lodge to the court-house, after which, each Mason acting as captain of the militia, will proceed to his company with his Masonic apparatus, uniting in the man the Mason and the soldier." While there is no documentary evidence of the fact, there can be but little doubt that a great concourse of the citizens of Washington county assembled at Abingdon on the 22d day of February, 1800, to pay a last tribute to the memory of the great Washington. Upon the reassembling of the Masonic lodge on the evening of the same day, a committee was appointed with instructions to draft an account and a sketch of the proceedings of the day, and to have the same published in the "Virginia Argus," a newspaper published in Richmond, Virginia, along with the address of Francis Preston delivered upon the occasion. At the March term, 1799, of the court of Washington county, Virginia, William King, James Armstrong, John Eppler and Robert Craig, were appointed a committee to report to the next court the plan of a stone prison and the probable expense of building the same. This committee reported at the April term, 1799, and the contract for the building of the new jail or prison house was let to James White, at the sum of $1,536.21. He was paid a large part of the contract price for building this jail, out of the moneys derived from the sale of lots in the town of Abingdon, and the balance was paid by a levy upon the citizens of the county. In this year the militia of Washington county was rearranged, the Seventieth Regiment of militia was divided, and the One Hundred and Fifth Regiment of militia organized, Colonel Francis Preston commanding the Seventieth and Colonel Robert Campbell the One Hundred and Fifth Regiment of militia of Washington county upon its reorganization. By the year 1803, William King and other enterprising citizens of the county were actively engaged in the manufacture of salt at Saltville, Virginia, and through the influence of these gentlemen the General Assembly of Virginia undertook the first internal improvement upon the public account in Southwestern Virginia. On the 28th day of December, 1803, the General Assembly of Virginia incorporated the Abingdon and Saltville Turnpike, and appointed William King, Francis Preston, William Tate, William Poston, Samuel Edmiston, James White and David Campbell, commissioners to mark out and let to contract the building of a turnpike road from Abingdon to Saltville. This Act of the Assembly provided that "the tolls received from the said road should be subject to the order of the General Assembly of Virginia," and by the same Act the tolls to be charged for the use of said road was prescribed as follows: One loaded wagon and team, 25c. On every cart, per wheel, 5c. On every saddle-horse, 6c. On riding carriages per wheel, 6c. On every head of cattle, 1c. This road was for many years the best to be found in our county. Some time between the years 1800-1810, a new court-house built of brick was erected in the town of Abingdon on the southeast corner of the present public square. The date of the erection of this court-house, its dimensions and cost, along with the name of the contractor, cannot be ascertained, as the records of the court covering this period have been destroyed. Nothing of sufficient importance to be recorded occurred in this county, so far as I can ascertain, from 1803 until the year 1806. On the 4th day of January, 1806, John G. Ustick published the first newspaper, so far as I can ascertain, in Washington county, the title of which was the "HOLSTON INTELLIGENCER AND ABINGDON ADVERTISER," a four-column, four-page paper, a copy of which is preserved, a very creditable paper indeed, giving the local news of the county, the proceedings of Congress and foreign news. Abingdon has not been without a newspaper from January 4, 1806, until the present time, except the period from December 15, 1864, when the town was burned by the Federal troops, to December 8, 1865. THE WAR OF 1812-1815. By the opening of the year 1812, the situation of affairs was such as to strongly indicate war between the United States and Great Britain. The American public was greatly excited and seemed to be anxious for the conflict. The government of the United States was making every preparation for war. In the spring of the year 1812, the Congress of the United States passed a resolution by a vote of 79 to 49 declaring war against Great Britain, over the protest of the Federalist members of Congress, among the number being Daniel Sheffey, the member from this district, and on the 18th day of June, 1812, the Senate of the United States, by a vote of 19 to 18, concurred in the resolution of Congress, and war was formally declared. On July 6, 1812, David Campbell was commissioned a major in the Twelfth Regiment of Infantry, A. S. A., and, raising all recruits possible, he proceeded to Winchester, Virginia, where he joined his regiment. The Twelfth Regiment of Infantry was officered as follows: Colonel, Thomas Parker. Lieutenant-Colonel, James Patton Preston, of Montgomery county. Major, David Campbell, of Washington county. Captains: John Gibson, James Charlton, Charles Page, Willoughby Morgan, Archibald C. Randolph, Thomas P. Moore, A. L. Madison, James Paxton. Lieutenants: L. B. Willis, Lockville Jackson, Richard P. Fletcher, J. G. Camp, Angus McDonald, R. G. Hite. Second Lieutenants: Russell Harrison, John Keys, Matthew Hughes, O. W. Callis, William Stone, John Kenny, John Towles, Robert Houston. Ensigns: J. W. McGavock, John Shommo, Philip Wagoner, Isaac Keys, Bailey Bruce, W. C. Parker, Thomas B. Barton. On the 10th of April, 1812, President Madison issued an order for 12,000 men for the regular army from Virginia, which men were to be taken from the several militia regiments of the State. To make up this number, the Seventeenth Brigade was required to furnish 488 men, of which Captain Francis Preston's rifle company was to furnish fifty men, Captain Tupper's company, of Montgomery county, fifty men; Captain Hale's rifle company, Grayson county, fifty men; Captain Steffey's company, of Wythe county, fifty men. It is probable that the forces thus levied accompanied Major David Campbell to Winchester. Upon the arrival of Major David Campbell at Winchester, he immediately proceeded to assist in drilling and recruiting the regiment, which regiment, on the 29th day of August, 1812, marched for the lakes of Canada, where it was placed under the command of Alexander Smyth, of Wythe county, who, on the 6th day of July, 1812, was commissioned by the President of the United States, inspector-general with the rank of brigadier. General Smyth, on the 15th day of June, 1812, was in Washington city, and addressed a letter to a gentleman in Abingdon in which he stated: "It is whispered, and I have no doubt of the fact, that to-day the Senate passed the bill from the House of Representatives for declaring war against Great Britain. "The recruits west of the Blue Ridge in Virginia are intended for the North. Considering this circumstance together with the land bounty, the abolition of corporal punishment, &amp;c., I shall expect the recruiting service to succeed well." Upon the first intimation of war, many of the citizens of this county immediately volunteered their services to their country. In March of the year 1812, a volunteer troop of cavalry was formed within the bounds of the One Hundred and Fifth Regiment, and was officered by Captain William Duff and Lieutenant Samuel Brown. On the 31st day of March the following order was published by the officer of the troop: ATTENTION! WASHINGTON VOLUNTEER TROOP OF CAVALRY. "Our muster, of course, is at Abingdon, on Saturday the 11th day of April, when you are to appear in uniform with your arms and accoutrements in good order, at 11 o'clock A. M., with six rounds of blank cartridges, for the purpose of exercising. "At a crisis like the present, when war is more than anticipated, we presume your patriotic spirit will not suffer a single member to be delinquent. "By order of the Captain. "SAMUEL BROWN, Lieut. "March 31, 1812." The next order that we find in regard to this company was issued on September 12, 1812, and was as follows: "ATTENTION!" "THE VOLUNTEER TROOP OF CAVALRY, attached to the One Hundred and Fifth Regiment. You are hereby requested to attend private muster at Abingdon, on the last Saturday in this month, for the purpose of exercising and for other purposes that the times demand. "SHOW YOUR VALOR—BE PATRIOTIC. "WM. DUFF, Captain." On the 25th day of April, 1812, the following advertisement appeared in the Political Prospect: "THE TOCSIN OF PATRIOTISM. "A MEETING of the young men of the county of Washington is requested at the tavern of Mr. Soule's, on Saturday, the 2d day of May, 1812. The object of the meeting is of the highest importance, and it is desired and hoped, that every young man, whose bosom burns with the holy fire of patriotism and feels the multiplied wrongs of his country, will be present at this meeting. "April 23, 1812." The young men of the county met, pursuant to this notice, and organized a company of infantry, and selected Peter Mayo captain, to which was given the name of the Light Infantry Company, and passed a resolution appointing the 16th day of May, 1812, as the time and the Bell Tavern in Abingdon as the place of meeting to select non-commissioned officers, and directed their captain to issue his orders accordingly, which order was as follows: "INFANTRY! "Pursuant to a resolution entered into on Saturday last, notice is hereby given, that there will be a meeting of the Light Infantry Company on that day two weeks, precisely at 11 o'clock, at the Bell Tavern in the town of Abingdon, for the purpose of choosing non-commissioned officers, and of making other arrangements for the regulation of the company. All those whose names are enrolled on the list of the said company are requested to attend without fail, as the objects of the meeting are of much importance to its prosperity. Those who feel a disposition to become members of the company may do so by attending and enrolling themselves on that day. "P. MAYO, Captain. "N. B.—It is requested that all those who have guns of any description will bring them on that day." On the 15th day of June, 1812, Captain Spotswood Henry, of the Second Regiment of Artillery, U. S. A., arrived in Abingdon, and proceeded to recruit men for the regular army, and by the 6th day of September, 1812, he had recruited a full company of regulars. The Political Prospect, in speaking of the departure of Captain Henry and his recruits from Abingdon, says: "On Sunday last Captain Spotswood Henry marched from this place for Philadelphia with a full company of regulars enlisted in Abingdon and the surrounding country. Captain Henry was not quite three months enlisting his men, and we venture to say no officer in the same period of time ever enlisted as fine a company of men, most of them young, active and strong, a large majority of them sober and men of good character. We believe it may be said with truth that during their stay in Abingdon their conduct (with a few exceptions) has been good, infinitely better than that of any other body of new recruits we ever saw. Captain Henry, though a new officer, seems to possess the art of being both loved and feared by his men. He is true to the cause he is engaged in, and we trust, should he ever be brought in contact with the enemy, he will not disgrace his country. "They were accompanied on their road about two miles, by almost every citizen of Abingdon, and after partaking of some refreshments at Captain W. Jones', they continued their march, accompanied by the prayers of all who witnessed their departure, for their success and happiness." The services of the companies organized by Captains Mayo and Duff were not accepted by the government, and it is very probable that numbers of their men enlisted with Captain Henry. I cannot definitely ascertain what disposition was made of Captain Henry's troops upon their arrival at Philadelphia, but it can be stated with some certainty, that most of the recruits from Southwestern Virginia, in the regular army, were in the Second Regiment of Artillery and the Twelfth and Twentieth Regiments of Infantry, commanded by Colonels Parker and Randolph and Generals Smythe and Van Rensselaer. No further efforts were made to organize and equip additional troops from this county this year, so far as I can ascertain. In April of the year 1812, in the contest for member of Congress from this district and for members of the Legislature from this county, Honorable Daniel Sheffey was elected a member of Congress, defeating the Honorable Edward Campbell, of Hall's Bottom, by a considerable majority, Campbell's majority in Washington county being seventeen. The vote for members of the House of Delegates from this county was as follows: Colonel Francis Preston, 344 Captain Reuben Bradley, 314 Captain James Meek, 266 Mr. John Fulton, 151 On the 24th day of February, 1812, the General Assembly of Virginia appointed the following persons, for Washington county, to conduct the presidential election to be held in November of this year: Francis Preston, James White, David Campbell, Benjamin Estill, Francis Smith, John Preston and George Dixon. But, for some reason, the commissioners thus appointed did not act, as will appear from the following notice: To the Freeholders of the County of Washington. Citizens:—You are hereby notified to attend at your court-house, on the first Monday in November next; for the purpose of voting for twenty-five electors to CHOOSE A PRESIDENT AND VICE-PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES. At this important crisis of affairs, it is hoped that no citizen of Washington will show the smallest backwardness in coming forward on that day with a determination of supporting our Republican ticket. FRANCIS PRESTON, HENRY ST. JOHN DIXON, ROBERT PRESTON, Commissioners. September 19, 1812. At the election held in November, being the first hotly-contested presidential election in the history of our country, the counties of Southwestern Virginia, between James Madison and DeWitt Clinton, the contesting candidates, voted as follows: Madison. Clinton. Washington, 355 80 Lee, 67 00 Montgomery, 181 58 Wythe, 129 19 Russell, 126 00 Giles, 60 04 Grayson, 73 45 Early in this year Captain Henry Dixon organized a corps of volunteer riflemen, which was attached to the First Battalion of the One Hundred and Fifth Virginia Regiment of Militia. Many of the young men living in the vicinity of Abingdon joined this corps, the lieutenant of which was George W. Dixon. The patriotism of the people was unbounded, and it was arranged to celebrate the Fourth of July, 1812, at Abingdon, in a manner in accord with the sentiments of the people. The citizens of the upper end of the county likewise celebrated the day in a manner befitting patriots. The 4th of July, 1812. * * Political Prospects. "This day was celebrated by Captain Dixon's Company of Volunteer Riflemen and a number of the citizens of the town of Abingdon with their accustomed conviviality and mirth. The declaration of war had fired the breasts of that band of citizen soldiers with an unusual portion of pride of country, and they consequently expressed with great freedom their determination to rally to the standard of their country in defence of its rights, liberties and laws. Captain Mayo's company of infantry were invited by the riflemen to join in the entertainments of the day, in which they displayed an equal degree of patriotic ardor and love of country. The rifle company met at the court-house at 8 o'clock in the morning, and, after performing several evolutions and firing a number of rounds, marched to Captain Dixon's quarters, and fired three rounds, then to the eastern extremity of the town and did the same, then, returning to the court-house, were dismissed until ten o'clock, when they again assembled, at which period they were joined by Captain Mayo's company of infantry. After mustering through the town and performing several evolutions and firing, which occupied until one o'clock, they were marched to the camping ground at Piper's Spring, where they partook of an elegant dinner furnished by Mr. R. Soule. Colonel Francis Preston was called to the chair and Colonel James King chosen vice-president. After the cloth was removed the following toasts were drunk with great cordiality of sentiment. 1st. The Day. May its celebration only cease with our national existence. 2. The President. May he continue to deserve the confidence of a free, enlightened people. 3d. Congress. In declaring war against Great Britain, they have echoed the voice of the nation. 4th. The Heads of Departments. May the spirit of '76 animate their councils. 5th. The Memory of Washington. May we look upon his like again. 6th. The Venerable Clinton. He will still live in the hearts of his countrymen. 7th. The Heroes of the Revolution. May their posterity inherit their virtue and their valor. 8th. The Union of the States. Liberty's surest pledge—Hail Columbia. 9th. The army of the United States—Composed of freemen, it cannot fail to merit the glorious boon of independence. 10th. The navy of the United States. The choicest sons of Neptune will brave every danger in defence of their liberty. 11th. The volunteers of the times. Hailed by your countrymen as the gallant defenders of their dearest rights. 12th. The Heroes of Tippecanoe have set their countrymen a glorious example—Soldiers return. 13th. The Militia of the United States will defend their rights when assailed by tyrants. 14th. The Tree of Liberty, may its branches ever succor its supporters. 15th. John Randolph, D. Sheffey, &amp;c. May their constituents furnish them with a suit of Tory uniform, tar and feathers! Rogue's March! 16th. The 18th of June, 1812. The day that adds solidarity to the foundation of our independence. 17th. The Impressed American Seamen. May they return to the bosom of their country, with their hands imbrued in the blood of their enemies. 18th. The Fair Daughters of Columbia. Their smiles will reward their defenders. The volunteer toasts were very numerous, but we have been able to collect only a few of them. VOLUNTEERS. By Colonel Francis Preston—God bless these United States— May he who attempts their disunion meet the fate of Percival. By Colonel James King—All hands and all hearts. By Captain Dixon—Our war—May it lead us to conquest and glory, and return us to peace and happiness. By Lieutenant Dixon—The Rising Company of Light Infantry of the One Hundred and Fifth Virginia Regiment—May success attend the soldiers of this union. By Captain Robert Craig—Our Government—May they be decisive in their councils, and every party spirit done away, and may the spirit of '76 animate every breast. —Our Manufactures—May they be persevered in until they make us completely independent of all other nations. By Mr. L. L. Henderson—The Commerce of the United States— Like an April shower, the day clouds for a moment, but to return with resplendent vigor. By Andrew Russell, Esq.—Neutral Rights—May all governments be compelled to respect them. By Mr. Isaac Whitaker—Randolph, Sheffey &amp;c.—May they be compelled to eat the crumbs that fall from republican tables. "Saturday last being the anniversary of our national independence, a number of inhabitants of the upper end of this county collected at Seven-Mile ford for the purpose of celebrating the day in some manner, however plain and simple. The fore part of the day was occupied by Captain Hopkins in exercising his military students; in the evening the company retired to a spring convenient to the ford, where they partook of an elegant barbecue which had been prepared for them. After dinner the following toasts were given: By Captain William Love—The Fourth of July—May it ever be held in grateful remembrance by the free-born sons of America. Two guns. By Captain William Byars—The Declaration of War by Congress on the 18th of June last, against Great Britain—May it progress with successive victories on our part, and may it ultimately procure us that justice for which we contend. Three guns. By Major William Davis—The Spirit of '76—May it inspire the breast of every free-born American with such zeal as may support the dignity of the present measures of our general government. Four guns. By Captain Hopkins—The patriots of the United States Army— May they always be actuated by virtue and crowned with victory. Four guns. By Captain George Byars—May the American eagle subdue the British lion. Four guns. By Mr. Parker Smith—The memory of Captain Nathan Hale, who fell a martyr in the cause of his country with the firm intrepidity of an American and the amiable resignation of a Christian hero—May his worth and memory be enshrined in the hearts of his countrymen as long as we enjoy that liberty and independence for which he freely gave up his life. Five guns. By Mr. John Phaup—The Virtuous Sons of Freedom—May they never taste the bitter apples of affliction. Four guns. By Mr. Campbell Anderson—The Federal Compact—May it stand firm and unshaken as the pillars of heaven. Two guns. By Mr. Pleasant Smith—The Honest Farmer—May his industry always be rewarded with an abundant harvest. Five guns. By Captain Andrew Edmiston—The tyranny of Great Britain. May it be completely subdued and American independence reign forever. Three guns. By John Byars, Esq.—General Montgomery—May we never want such men to march to the plains of Abraham, to teach the enemies of our free and happy country that we will not submit to the insults heretofore practised on us. Five guns. By Mr. Robert Beattie—The Memory of General Washington— May his courage and patriotism be an example to our generals of the present day. Four guns. By Mr. James Robinson—James Madison, President of the United States. Two guns. By Mr. Daniel Hughes—May we all stand united and firmly agree to rally around the standard of sweet liberty. Two guns. By Captain James Cole—The Tree of Liberty—May it continue to produce unfading blossoms, and may its branches extend to the remotest part of our wide extended territory. Five guns. By Mr. A. K. Love—Thomas Jefferson—May his virtues be an example to his countrymen, and may his patriotic services be held in grateful remembrance. Four guns. This account of the celebration of the 4th of July by the citizens of Washington county is obtained from a copy of a paper published in Abingdon at that time, and, if we may judge from this account, the sentiments of the people of the county must have been strongly in favor of war; and their enthusiastic devotion to their country unexcelled. John Gibson, a citizen of Abingdon and a partner in business with Connally Findlay, was, on March 12, 1812, commissioned a captain in the regular army and was assigned to the Twelfth Regiment of Infantry; as a result, a dissolution of partnership between himself and Findlay was rendered necessary, and soon thereafter the following notice appeared in the Abingdon paper: NOTICE! "The partnership between the two persons involved, Of Gibson and Findlay, is this day dissolved; With hearts smooth and easy right onward we went, And this day we part by mutual consent. All those who have claims come to Findlay for pay, And those who owe us must not long delay, But to pay their accounts, I hope they'll agree, And not trouble Gibson, but pay them to me; The business henceforward I mean to conduct, And all my good customers freely instruct; That all sorts of saddles, neat boots and fine shoes, They may come and examine and buy what they choose; With saddle-bags, bridles and best tanned leather, Which shall brave the hard clods and defy the bad weather; And pray, gentle friends, let me tell you besides, I'll purchase your skins and buy all your hides, For which I will pay you the cash in a trice, For every article at market price; And now you may think what I say is but fun, You all may trust me, but, faith, I'll trust none. "JOHN GIBSON, "CONNALLY FINDLAY." On Saturday, the 2d day of May, 1812, the settlements on the western extremity of this county were visited by a most tremendous hail-storm. Robert Preston suffered the loss of an extensive crop of rye and much other damage done to his plantation. Several others in the same neighborhood suffered severely. On the Jonesborough road, was the greatest loss suffered, though Joseph Gray and others were severely handled. Large trees were torn up by the roots and fences destroyed in all directions. Some of the largest of the hail that fell on Saturday was gathered on Sunday and carried to Abingdon, where it was still as large as the largest nutmeg. The track of this cyclone and hail-storm was perceptible as late as the year 1882. This county was again visited by very severe hail-storms in the year 1814. The American army, stationed near Buffalo, experienced some pretty hard fighting about this time, and the soldiers from this county bravely maintained the reputation of our people. In the month of October, they had a skirmish near Fort Erie, an account of which is given by Major David Campbell, in a letter written to a friend in Abingdon, and is as follows: "We last night took two vessels from the British, when they were at anchor immediately under the guns of Fort Erie. The vessels were taken by volunteers from our brigade and some sailors in two row-boats, and 150 men. Our men rowed alongside, fastened their boats to the ship under fire from her, they also firing, and boarded her sword in hand—we have lost eight men—the British number not known, it is supposed, however, 50 to 40. One of the vessels was immediately brought safe to shore. Her cargo has been taken out, and is estimated by General Smyth at $150,000. The other they ran aground in the river near a small island—she is the Brig. Adam, laden with 2,000 stand of arms taken from Hull, and the cannon taken there also. This morning early a messenger came to camp and informed General Smyth, that 2,000 British had landed. We immediately paraded and marched to the scene. The cannon was roaring from both shores. When we got there we found no enemy on this side. They had been at the vessel nigh the island, but had left her. We left the Fifth and part of the Eighteenth regiments to protect the vessel and returned. They have made two other attempts during the day to retake the vessel, and have been completely repulsed with great loss. We have not, since morning, lost a man. It has given me great pleasure to retake the arms taken at Detroit. We have also retaken thirty or forty prisoners, our brave countrymen taken there." Among the plunder captured by the American forces at this time, was a bell, from one of the British vessels, which bell was brought by General Smyth to his home in Wytheville, and by him given to Wythe county to be used as a court-house bell. This bell is at this day in the old court-house at Wytheville, in an excellent state of preservation, and bears the following inscription: "De Welfahrt van Het. Schip. De I. Iffrauw. ElisabethVoor De HeerenCasper, Voice &amp; CompagniCaptain Daniel Joachim. Rahlap Anno 1781. Me-Ioh: iven-in Hamburg." Which being translated, is: "The welfare of the ship. The Lady Elisabeth. For the Sirs. Casper, Voice &amp; Co. Captain Daniel Joachim Rahlap. Anno 1781. `Me' Ioh' iven' in Hamburg." On the 10th of October, 1812, the volunteer rifle company, commanded by Captain Henry Dixon, was ordered to assemble at Captain Robert Davis's, which order was as follows: "ATTENTION! "The volunteer rifle corps attached to the First Battalion, One Hundred and Fifth Virginia Regiment, are directed to attend the regimental muster at Captain R. Davis's on Friday, 16th instant, (completely armed and equipped) at 11 o'clock A. M. Each member will furnish himself with ammunition and one day's rations. "GEORGE W. DIXON, Lieut. "Comdt. V. R. C. 105th regt." At this meeting, the following order was published: "COMPANY ORDERS! ATTENTION RIFLEMEN! "The Battalion Court of Inquiry for the assessment of fines in the First Battalion of the One Hundred and Fifth Virginia Regiment, is ordered to meet at Mr. James Crow's on Friday the 23d instant. The regimental court will assembly at Captain Robert Davis's on the 5th day of November next, at which times and places, excuses to offer for delinquencies, may attend. A correct list of all the delinquents in the Rifle Corps will be left with the printer of the Political Prospect, for the inspection of its members. "G. W. DIXON. "Comdt. V. R. C. 1st Bat. 105th R. "October 17, 1812." And on the 28th day of February, 1813, Captain Dixon issued the following order: VOLUNTEER RIFLEMEN. The members of the Volunteer Rifle Company of the One Hundred and Fifth Regiment will punctually attend at the court-house in Abingdon, on Saturday the 6th day of March, without uniform, on business of importance. H. DIXON, Captain. This company of riflemen were not called into service until the summer or fall of 1814. On the 20th of April, 1813, Lieutenant Peter C. Johnston, of the regular army began recruiting in the town of Abingdon, but what success attended his efforts I am unable to ascertain. Captain L. L. Henderson had organized a company of artillery in the upper end of Washington county, and an order was issued effecting this company on May 3, 1813, which order was as follows: "ATTENTION! "The members of the artillery company commanded by Captain L. L. Henderson will attend a battalion muster at Mr. James Crow's on Friday, the 28th of this month. "WILLIAM SMITH, "Lieutenant of Artillery." This company was not mustered into service until the year 1814. On the 12th of March, 1813, Major David Campbell was promoted and became Lieutenant-Colonel of the Twentieth Regiment United States army, and participated in the arduous campaigns on the St. Lawrence and near Lake Champlain, which position he resigned on the 28th of January, 1814. Upon his return to his home in Virginia, he again entered the service of his State, as aide de camp to Governor James Barbour, and rendered valuable assistance in organizing the large force of troops called into service in the neighborhood of Richmond and Petersburg, in the summer of 1814. The General Assembly at its session in the year 1814, provided for the raising of ten thousand troops, and, under this law, Colonel Campbell was elected general of the Third Brigade. On the 25th of January, 1815, he was appointed colonel of the Third Virginia Cavalry, but was afterwards transferred to the Fifth Regiment of Cavalry. Under the law enacted by the General Assembly in 1814, most of the companies from Washington county proceeded to Richmond, which point they reached about the 9th day of September, when information reached Richmond that the enemy had landed on the Northern Neck. The forces from Washington county formed a part of the Third Brigade, and upon receipt of the news that the enemy had landed, three companies of riflemen and one troop of cavalry, under the command of Colonel Coleman, were ordered to the Northern Neck. This force marched to the place directed and were out sixteen days. They marched day and night to attack the enemy, but failed to overtake them. They frequently encamped on the same ground a few hours after the enemy had marched. Upon this expedition, the first encampment was one mile from Richmond, at Camp Mitchell. About this time the militia was transferred from the State's service to the service of the United States, to serve six months. A portion of the Washington county militia marched for the city of Washington a few days after Colonel Coleman marched for the Northern Neck, and, upon the return of Coleman's forces to Fort Mitchell, the field and staff officers of his command were ordered to Washington city. The troop of cavalry and riflemen were ordered to Charles City courthouse, from which point they passed to Camp Snowden near Snowden's Iron Works, Maryland, at which place the troops were newly equipped with guns and ammunition, from which point they marched to Camp Cross-Roads, Maryland, where they were encamped on the 15th of November. At this point our forces were commanded by General James Breckenridge as brigadier, and Major-General Pegram. The health of the Washington companies was fairly good, although 109 men were sick on the morning of the 14th of November, 1814. A very few of the number were dangerously sick. A number of the Washington county troops, in the fall of this year and the spring of 1815, marched to Norfolk, under the command of General Francis Preston and other militia officers, but as to their services I cannot obtain any information. It is lamentable that no record has been preserved of the services of our countrymen upon this expedition to Norfolk. We publish in the appendix to this book, an official statement of the militia officers of Washington county, for the years 18101815; which gives, beyond queston, authentic information of the officers, with their rank, during this war. Peace was proclaimed by the President of the United States on the 18th day of February, 1815, one month and ten days subsequent to the battle of New Orleans. With the exception of the battle of New Orleans, the record of this war, as far as it effected the land fighting, is humiliating indeed, to the average American citizen. The failure of our military expeditions during this war must not be attributed to the want of patriotism or valor on the part of our people, but was due to the ideas of our rulers, none of whom, either by principle or practice, was fitted to conduct a successful war. In this war Colonel James Campbell died in the service at Mobile, Alabama, and Colonel John B. Campbell fell at the battle of Chippewa, where he commanded the right wing of the army under General Winfield Scott. Both were sons of Colonel Arthur Campbell, the "Father of our County." Colonel Arthur Campbell himself died at his home, the present location of Middlesborough, Kentucky, in the year 1811, and his body was buried at that place according to the directions of his will, which is of record in the county clerk's office of this county. When Middlesborough, Kentucky, first attracted the attention of the business people of this country, and great developments were in progress at that point, the grave of Colonel Campbell was discovered in an out-of-the-way place, and his remains were removed by his Tennessee relatives, and the grave newly marked. The grave of Colonel Arthur Campbell was marked with an iron slab, upon which the following inscription was found: "Sacred to the memory of Colonel Arthur Campbell, who was born in Augusta county, Virginia, November 3, 1743, old style, and after a well-spent life, as his last moments did and well could approve, of sixty-seven years eight months and twenty-five days, ere a constitution preserved by rigid temperance, and otherwise moral and healthy, could but with reluctance consent, the lamp was blown out by the devouring effects of a cancer on the 8th day of August, 1811, leaving a widow, six sons and six daughters to mourn his loss and emulate his virtues. Here lies entombed a Revolutionary sage, An ardent patriot of the age, In erudition great, and useful knowledge to scan In philanthrophy hospitable, the friend of man, As a soldier brave. Virtue his morality. As a commander prudent. His religion charity. He practised temperance To preserve his health. He used industry to acquire wealth. He studied physic to avoid disease. He studied address to please. He studied himself to complete his plan. For his greatest study was to study man. His statue tall, His person portly, His features handsome, His manners courtly. Sleep, honored sire, In the realms of rest, In doing justice to thy memory A son is blest. A son inheriting in full thy name One who aspires to all thy fame. COLONEL ARTHUR CAMPBELL." At a meeting of the General Assembly in the fall of the year 1814, a new county was formed from the territory of Lee, Washington and Russell counties, to which was given the name of Scott county, in honor of General Winfield Scott. The boundaries of the new county as fixed by the Act of Assembly, of date November 24, 1814, were as follows: Beginning at the head of Reedy creek, where the wagon road crosses the same in Washington county; thence down the Tennessee line to the south fork of the Clinch river; thence northward passing the Flag Pond to the top of Powell's mountain, in Lee county; thence along it to the Russell county line; thence along the Russell county line to the Kentucky line; thence along Cumberland mountain to the head of Guesses' river; thence down it to Clinch river; thence to Kendrick's Gap, in Clinch mountain; thence by the western end of Samuel Hensley's plantation to the beginning. The boundaries of Scott county as thus given were altered at the same session of the General Assembly. By the same Act, John McKenney, Reuben McCully and James Wallen, of Lee; Jonathan Wood, Samuel Ritchie and James Moss of Russell; Andrew McHenry, Jacob Severs and Abraham Fulkerson, of Washington county, were appointed commissioners to select a permanent location for the county seat of Scott county. The first County Court of Scott county assembled at the house of Benjamin T. Hollans, at Big Moccasin Gap, and organized with the following officers: Justices of the Peace. John Anderson, Samuel Ritchie, James Gibson, John McKenney, John Montgomery, Jacob Severs, Benj. T. Hollans, William George, Reuben McCully, James Albert, John Berry, James Moss, Richard Fulkerson, Isaac Skillem, James Wallen. Sheriff, John Anderson. Deputy Sheriffs, Isaac Anderson and Isaac Skillem. Clerk, William H. Carter. Deputy Clerk, Alfred McKenney. County Surveyor, Jonathan Wood. Commonwealth's Attorney, Andrew McHenry. County Militia. County Lieutenant, Henry Livingston. Lieutenant-Colonel, John Wood. Majors, Robert Gibson and Isaac Anderson. Captains of Militia. Richard Fulkerson, John McHenry, William Fugate, Cornelius Fugate, George George, Hiram Kilgore, John Berry, James Watson. Lieutenants of Militia. Jonas Wolfe, Goldman Davidson, Wood Osborn, Robert Spear, Elijah Carter, Isaac Low, Jeremiah Culbertson. Ensigns of Militia. John Martin, Clinton Godsey, Meshack Stacy, Daniel Wallen, James Gibson, Jr., George McConnell, William Bickley. The commissioners appointed to ascertain the proper place for holding the courts and erecting the public buildings for the new county made their report on May 9, 1815. The lands donated by James Davidson, Sr., the present site of Estillville, or Gate City, were selected, and the public buildings erected thereon; and this is still the county seat of Scott county. By this Act Washington county lost a considerable extent of valuable territory and many valuable citizens. In the year 1816, a convention assembled at Staunton, for the purpose of devising measures for obtaining a Constitutional Convention for the State. Thirty-five counties west of the Blue Ridge were represented in this convention, but if Washington county had a representative present, I cannot ascertain his name; but the object of the convention affected Washington county as much as any of the territory west of the mountain. The object in view in amending the Constitution of the State was to correct the inequalities in the representation of the different sections of the State in the General Assembly of Virginia. This convention, by a vote of 61 to 7, adopted a memorial in favor of a convention to amend the Constitution. The country west of the Blue Ridge at that time contained a white population of two hundred and twelve thousand and thirty-six, with four senators; while the territory east of the mountain contained a white population of one hundred and sixty-two thousand seven hundred and seventeen and had thirteen senators. General James Breckenridge was elected president of this convention and Erasmus Stribbling, secretary. This subject has been agitated in Virginia from the earliest time, but the people of western Virginia have never succeeded in obtaining a fair representation in the General Assembly of Virginia, and, to-day, the inequality of representation between the two sections is greater than it has been at any time heretofore in our history; considering the wealth and population of Western Virginia. In the election of members to the General Assembly from Washington county, in the spring of the year 1819, the certificates of election were awarded to Peter Mayo and William Poston. The election was contested by William Preston Thompson. The depositions were taken by Thomas Edmondson, William Snodgrass, Reuben Bradley, John Goodson and Charles Tate, commissioners appointed by the County Court of Washington county for that purpose, and upon the final hearing of the case in the General Assembly, Mayo was unseated and Thompson awarded the certificate, but in the following year Peter Mayo and Nathaniel Dryden defeated Thompson by a good majority. On the first day of July, 1819, the County Court of Washington county tried a negro by the name of Sam for larceny, found him guilty and ordered him to be burnt in the hand in the presence of the court, and that he receive ten lashes on his bare back at the public whipping-post. By Act of the General Assembly of Virginia approved March 10, 1819, a voting precinct was established at the house of James Meek, on the north side of the middle fork of the Holston river in the upper end of this county. From the organization of the county until this time, every voter in the county was required to attend the election at Abingdon, the only voting precinct in the county. In the month of May, 1819, John Preston, Jr., was commissioned colonel of the One Hundred and Fifth Regiment of infantry, and James White, lieutenant-colonel of the same regiment. William P. Thompson was commissioned lieutenant-colonel of the Seventieth Regiment, while David Campbell was commissioned colonel of the Third Regiment of cavalry of the militia of Virginia, and in the following year Robert Beattie was commissioned major of the Seventieth Regiment. The number of tithables in Washington county in 1820 was 3,137, and the proportion of the tax due from each tithable was fifty cents. The taxes collected from the people in the years 1819-1820 so far exceeded the expenditures of the county that no taxes were levied for the year 1821. On the 15th of May, 1821, the County Court of Washington county entered the following order in regard to the width of the roads of the county. "Ordered that the public roads of this county be of the following widths, to-wit: The main Island road, the main Kentucky road, the Wataga road below Abingdon, the Blountville road, the Russell road by Michael Fleenor's, the main Saltworks road from Abingdon, the River road above the Saltworks, through Lyon's Gap, remain as at present established, thirty-three feet wide each, and that all the other public wagon roads in this county be twenty feet wide." By order of the county court of date June 22, 1820, a new road was ordered to be established, leading from near Smith's cabin (now Greendale), to the north fork of Holston, said road to be eight feet wide and to be located at or near the "Lawyer's Path."* * The early name of the road from Abingdon leading through Little Moccasin Gap. Colonel James White at this time was operating several iron furnaces in this county and in Johnson county, Tennessee. A considerable forge known as "White's Grove Forge," and a furnace known as "Elizabeth Furnace," had been established on the north fork of the Holston river, some miles apart, and business among the citizens of the county was excellent, and had been so since 1815. It is to be regretted, that the minute books of the County Court of Washington county covering the period from 1821 to 1837 were destroyed in 1864. For this period I have been able to gather but few facts of historical importance, and such as I have gathered are principally from the Acts of the General Assembly of Virginia. By Act of the General Assembly of Virginia, of date January 15, 1823, Henry Bowen, John Smith and John Cecil were appointed commissioners to locate and open a wagon road from the Kentucky line on the north fork of Sandy river to the Richlands in Tazewell county. In 1823 a dispute arose as to the correct location of the boundary line between Washington and Russell counties from Hayter's Gap, east to the Tazewell line, and the General Assembly on the 28th day of February, 1824, authorized the county courts of Washington and Russell counties to appoint one commissioner each, to run and mark the line between the two counties, but, for some reason which I cannot now ascertain, the boundary line was not run. On the 26th day of January, 1825, the General Assembly of Virginia appointed John H. Fulton, of Washington county, and George W. Johnson, of Russell county, commissioners to run and mark the line between the counties, beginning on the top of Clinch mountain, where the road from Abingdon to Lebanon crosses the same at Hayter's Gap, and from thence east to the Tazewell line. Pursuant to this order, the line was run and marked in the same year. By an Act of the General Assembly of Virginia of date, January 4, 1826, it was declared that all that part of the counties of Washington and Wythe known by the name of Poor Valley within the following bounds, to-wit: Beginning on the top of Clinch mountain at the highest point opposite to the plantation of Major John Ward; thence a south course until it strikes the top of Little Piney mountain in the county of Washington, and with the top of said mountain, running east to Wilson's Gap, in the county of Wythe, thence north to the Tazewell line, shall be a part of the county of Tazewell. By an Act of the General Assembly the third election precinct in this county was established at the house of John Shaver, at Three Springs, in the lower end of this county, on January 2, 1829. By the year 1828, the sentiment of the people of Washington county was decidedly democratic; and to such an extent that in the presidential election of that year, General Andrew Jackson received every vote cast in the county, except thirteen. By the beginning of the year 1830, a healthy disposition had grown up among the people in favor of public improvements, and the General Assembly of Virginia, on the 19th day of February, 1830, incorporated the Abingdon Turnpike Company and authorized the building of a turnpike road from the forks of the road west of William Carpenter's to the forks in Abram Bradley's lane. This company was authorized to receive subscriptions, and the Act of the Assembly authorized and directed the following citizens to solicit and receive subscriptions to this enterprise at the town of Abingdon: James White, David Campbell, Francis Preston, John M. Preston, John H. Fulton, Charles C. Johnston, Peter J. Branch, Benjamin Estill, John N. Humes, John Gibson, Andrew Russell and Abram Bradley. While I have no evidence of the fact, it is reasonable to believe that this effort to build a turnpike road in Washington county was successful. The General Assembly of Virginia, on April 5, 1830, incorporated the Lynchburg and New River Railroad, the object of which was to connect Southwestern Virginia with the eastern portion of the State. The Act of the Assembly incorporating the road authorized public subscriptions to the enterprise and appointed the following commissioners to solicit and receive subscriptions at Abingdon: Francis Preston, Francis Smith, James White, James Campbell, Benjamin Estill, John H. Fulton, John M. Preston, John C. Greenway, Charles C. Johnston, Andrew Russell and Charles H. Preston. This effort to build a railroad was, so far as Southwestern Virginia was concerned, a failure. From the date of the convention that assembled at Staunton in 1816 to this time, the demand for a convention to revise the Constitution had constantly grown throughout the State. The citizens of Virginia living west of the mountains were opposed to the basis established for the exercise of suffrage by the Convention in 1776, which excluded all persons from voting who were not free-holders. Another question that presented itself was whether the representation in the General Assembly should be apportioned on the basis of the white population, or on the basis of population and property combined. The citizens of Eastern Virginia favored a restricted suffrage and an apportionment on the basis of population and property, while the people west of the mountains favored an unrestricted suffrage and an apportionment on the basis of population alone. From the year 1816 to 1829 these questions were discussed throughout the State with vehemence, ability and eloquence. The General Assembly, on the 31st day of January, 1828, submitted to the voters of the State the question of calling a convention, and in the election that followed 21,896 votes were polled for, and 16,637 against, calling a convention. The convention was accordingly called, and most hotly contested elections for delegates to this convention took place throughout the State. As a result of the issues involved, this convention was composed of many of the most brilliant gentlemen throughout the State. It has been said that it is doubtful whether any representative body ever convened in the world's history, before or since, which included so much talent, eloquence, experience and intellectual power, as did the convention of 1829-1830. In the election of delegates to this convention the State was divided into districts, of which, Washington, Lee, Scott, Russell and Tazewell composed one district. The delegates elected from this district were John B. George, of Tazewell; Andrew McMillan, of Lee, and Edward Campbell and William Byars, from Washington. The convention assembled on October 5, 1829, and remained in session until January, 1830, and was presided over by James Monroe and Philip P. Barbour. On the 14th of January the draft of the Constitution was adopted by the convention and submitted to the people of the Commonwealth for ratification or rejection. The vote of the counties of Southwest Virginia upon the ratification or rejection of this Constitution was as follows: For. Against. Giles, 21 556 Grayson, 70 649 Lee, 330 99 Montgomery, 194 670 Russell, 86 240 Scott, 155 297 Tazewell, 35 423 Wythe, 41 625 Washington 556 175 The Constitution of 1829-'30 extended the right of suffrage to a considerable extent, but the basis of representation, which was bitterly contested in the convention, was but slightly altered, and a great majority of the citizens of Western Virginia were opposed to the new Constitution for that reason. The Constitution was adopted by the people of the State by a vote of 26,055 for ratification to 15,563 for rejection—a majority of 10,492 in favor of the Constitution. Thus the people of Western Virginia were denied an equal representation with the citizens of Eastern Virginia in the representative bodies of the Commonwealth. By Act of the General Assembly of Virginia approved February 23, 1832, a new county was formed from the counties of Wythe and Washington, to which was given the name of Smyth county. The boundaries of the new county were as follows: Beginning on the Main Stage road at a bridge in a hollow at the point where the spring branch of Philip Greever, deceased, crosses the same; thence a direct line passing equi-distant between Preston &amp; King's salt wells, to the line of Russell county, and from said point on Main Stage road aforesaid, where said spring branch crosses the same, running south 25 degrees east to the southern boundary of Washington county, and beginning on the Main Stage road leading by Abingdon and Wythe courthouses, ten miles by said road, from the line dividing Washington and Wythe counties, running thence northwest to the northern boundary of Wythe county, and southeast to the southern boundary of Wythe county, the said line through Wythe county running precisely parallel with the line aforesaid through Washington county. The Act establishing this county directed Isaac J. Leftwich, of Wythe, Edward Fulton, of Washington, and John Campbell, of Smyth, to run and mark the boundary line of said county. The Act of Assembly establishing Smyth county directed that the county court of that county be composed of fifteen justices to be commissioned by the Governor, and directed the first court of the county to meet at the house of John Thomas on the first Monday in April, 1832. By this same Act Charles L. Crockett, of Wythe; John H. Fulton, of Washington; William Price, of Russell; Samuel McCamant, of Grayson, and Thomas Peery, of Tazewell, were appointed commissioners to select a permanent location for the county seat of said county upon which to erect the necessary public buildings. This committee selected the present location of Marion as the county seat of the county. The first county court of Smyth county assembled at the house of John Thomas, at the Royal Oak, on Monday, the 2d day of April, 1832, pursuant to the Act of the General Assembly of Virginia, at which time the following officers took the oath prescribed by law and entered upon the discharge of their duties: Justices of the Peace. Charles Tate, Samuel Williams, Hatch D. Poston, Henry B. Thompson, Thompson Adkins, Joseph P. Bonham, James Taylor, George W. Davis, Joseph Adkins, William Porter, Robert Houston, Abraham B. Trigg, Isaac Spratt. Clerk of the County Court, Robert Beattie. Deputy Clerk, James F. Pendleton. Sheriff, Charles Tate. Commonwealth's Attorney, Charles E. Harrison. County Surveyor, Charles Taylor. Coroner, George Byars. The following lawyers qualified to practise their profession on the first day of the court: John H. Fulton, David McComas, John Foster, Isaac J. Leftwich, Charles E. Harrison and Andrew S. Fulton. By the formation of this county a large portion of the most valuable lands included in the original bounds of Washington county were lost to the county, and the representation of the county in the General Assembly was reduced to one member, and the county of Washington did not send more than one member of the Legislature to the General Assembly again until 1852. This is the last instance that we will have to record of the mutilation of the territory of Washington county, although considerable efforts have been made within the last fifteen years to form a new county out of parts of Washington, Russell and Scott counties. The representatives from Washington county in the General Assembly of Virginia, at the date of the formation of Smyth county, were John H. Fulton in the Senate, and John Kellar and Thomas McCulloch in the House of Delegates. Smyth county was named in honor of General Alexander Smyth, who served as brigadier-general in the war of 1812, and represented this district in the Congress of the United States for twelve years, and died while a member of Congress in the year 1830. A dispute arose as to the correct location of the boundary line between Washington and Smyth counties in the year 1896, whereupon the County Court of Washington county appointed W. B. Robertson, J. G. Breckenridge, James Broady, William Galliher and John D. Blackwell, commissioners on the part of Washington county, and the County Court of Smyth county appointed C. D. Carter, A. F. St. John, T. W. Buchanan and W. N. McGee, as commissioners on the part of Smyth county to run said line from Greever's Bridge near Chilhowie to the Russell county line. The commissioners ran said line and filed their report on June 27, 1896. The line as fixed by the report of the commissioners was marked by a planted stone at Greever's Bridge, and ran from that point, N. 37 degrees 15 minutes W. to Jamison's Gap, where a second stone was planted, and said line was continued on the same degree to the Russell county line, and stones were planted on the farm of Vint Thomas, at the Rich Valley road, on Chestnut Ridge, at Saltville between the salt wells, on both sides of the Holston river, on Little mountain, and in Poor Valley to mark said line.* * M. B. 31, page 11-13, County Court Washington county. In the election held in the year 1831 for a representative in the Congress of the United States, from the Twenty-second Congressional District of Virginia, composed of the counties of Scott, Wythe, Lee, Tazewell, Grayson and Washington, the Honorable Joseph Draper, of the county of Wythe, and the Honorable Charles C. Johnson, of the county of Washington, were the opposing candidates. Mr. Draper had been elected to fill the unexpired term of General Alexander Smyth, in the year 1830. Charles C. Johnson was one of the most talented and brilliant men that Washington county had ever produced. The canvass was one of the most exciting ever held in this district, and the result was a majority of seventy-eight votes in favor of Johnson, upon the face of the returns. The vote in the several counties of the district was as follows: Johnson. Draper. Russell county, 347 247 Scott county, 495 115 Wythe county, 43 786 Lee county, 342 265 Tazewell county, 208 392 Grayson county, 44 750 Washington county, 1,270 116 Totals, 2,749 2,671 Johnson's majority, 78. Mr. Draper was not satisfied with the result and contested the election of Johnson, charging many irregularities, the principal irregularity being the fact that the Sheriff of Washington county held the election in said county for four days instead of closing the poll on the third day, as required by law, thereby giving to Johnson eighty-eight votes more than he was entitled to, that being the number of electors voting in Washington county on the fourth day of the election. Mr. Johnson on the other hand charged and proved many irregularities in Wythe county, the result being that a majority of the Committee on Elections on the 13th of April, 1832, made a report recommending that, in justice to the electors of the district, the seat be declared vacant and a new election ordered, while the minority of the committee reported in favor of Charles C. Johnson, the sitting member. The vote was taken upon the majority and minority reports and the Congress of the United States, by a vote of eighty-five to thirty-five, declared Charles C. Johnson entitled to the seat. In the fall of the year, 1832, Charles C. Johnson was drowned in the Potomac river while crossing from Alexandria to Washington city. An election was held to fill the vacancy, at which election Joseph Draper was returned the representative from this district in the Congress of the United States. General Jackson, upon his inauguration as President of the United States, nominated Colonel John Campbell, of Hall's Bottom, in this county, as Treasurer of the United States, which position Colonel Campbell accepted, and discharged the duties of the same with honor to himself and credit to his native county. Colonel John Campbell was the second native-born citizen of Washington county to occupy a position of great honor in the government of the United States, the other, General John Armstrong, Secretary of War in the Cabinet of President Madison, was born in the town of Abingdon. The County Court of Washington county, in the year 1832, was composed of a very distinguished body of men, the fathers and grandfathers of many of the present generation, and it may be of interest to many persons to know the appearance and character of the members of that court, given by a writer who was personally acquainted with each of them and who was a very competent judge of men. In speaking of the members of this court the writer says:* * Rev. L. F. Cosby. One of nature's noblemen is presiding. He is of large stature, has a full suit of white hair, of florid complexion, and possesses a fine, Colonel John Preston, of Walnut Grove. clear and somewhat musical voice. His manners are easy and refined, and you will pronounce him the very soul of dignity. That is Colonel John Preston. See him as he grasps the arm of the old justice's seat. Does a lawyer quibble or travel from the record to make out his case? He mildly recalls him from his wanderings, as he remarks: "You must confine yourself, sir, to the law and to the testimony in the case." Near by are two brothers, of large stature, of Roman forms, gray heads and mild demeanor. Their judgments are well balanced, and their opinions are worthy of the highest respect. Those are Major Abram and Thomas Fulkerson. The venerable James Keys, Esq., you observe, is very feeble and but seldom is on the bench; he is sent for frequently, however, to sign important proceedings of the court. On the right of the chair is sitting a low, corpulent gentleman with full round features, thin hair, a little bald, and his gold spectacles thrown back on his head. His utterances are ready and clear, springing from a mind quick in its preceptions of right. That is Captain Francis Smith. That gentleman near him, of large frame, of Atlas-like proportions—as though he could bear up a whole community on his shoulders, is Colonel James White. He is somewhat Colonel James White, of Abingdon. silent and meditative at times, but delivers his opinions (often presiding) with force and independence. His hair is also gray and inclined to curl over his broad forehead. Next you see a gentleman, once tall but now bent with age—head quite white and face ruddy. He speaks mildly and seems to regret that the stern arbitrament of law is necessary to compel to do right towards their fellow-creatures. That is General Francis Preston. That justice on the right, very tall and very erect, of excellent form, sandy hair, red face, and of fine mind, is William Rhea, Esq. The next is a large gentleman with round, full head and face, hair black, with a mixture of gray. That is Jonathan King, Esq. He is quite unobtrusive, but firm and decided in his opinions. That mild-looking gentleman to the left, well set, of medium height and good judgment, is Peter Minnick, Sr., Esq. Next to him is quite a tall, strongly-built gentleman; that is Joseph Miller, Esq. That tall and slender, light complexioned justice, sitting near, is William Shaw Logan, Esq. Among the group of justices on the left, you see two brothers of large stature and strong features. They are of peculiar mould and utterly disregard the vain blandishments of the world, and deal only in realities. These are Major Abram and Captain Reuben Bradley. That very tall, square-shouldered gentleman, sitting near Colonel Preston, with elongated features, and smiling as he speaks earnestly, is Tobias Smith, Esq. He loves his position, and renders his gratuitous services freely for the good of his country, and no man has served it more faithfully than he. Near by is sitting Robert E. Lowry, Esq. He has a very mild countenance, his eyes resting in repose. He exhibits great good nature, and is very modest in expressing his opinions. Near him is a short gentleman with round features, and of rather retiring demeanor. That is Lewis Smith, Esq. Next is a man of great solid worth, of medium height, of sterling integrity, of excellent mind and heart. That is William Buchanan, Esq. Two other justices you discover on the right of the chair. They are brothers and above the ordinary height. The first, Robert E. Cummings, Esq., has round features, is well proportioned, shoulders droop a little. The other, James Cummings, Esq., is slender, of good form, and generous bearing. Indeed they possess fine qualities of mind and heart, and kindness is stamped upon their very natures; they are very deliberate and express their opinions cautiously. Next to the justices just named, there sits another remarkable man, of commanding personal appearance. The flash of his dark eye, his compressed but somewhat protruding lips, indicate great firmness and determination of character. He speaks but seldom; when necessary, however, he utters his opinions with great force and independence. That is John M. Preston, Esq. He hates a meanness in any one as he does his Satanic Majesty, and is firm in meting out strict justice to all men. Integrity is one of his cardinal virtues. There on the right you see sitting near one another Colonel John Kellar, Major Henry B. Thompson and Colonel Thomas McCulloch. The first is dark complexioned, has blue eyes, is quick-spoken and is of excellent judgment. He is noted for his fine social qualities and kindness of heart. What man or woman in this section of the country that does not revere and love the memory of Colonel Kellar? That he is a bachelor is to be regretted. His erect form and fine personal bearing are doubtless attractive. Major Thompson is very good looking, has a fine eye, and an excellent disposition. Colonel McCulloch's appearance is fine; he is of genial nature, and is an excellent officer. All three, subsequently, were members of the General Assembly of Virginia. That corpulent justice on the left, with full round face and white hair, is John Duff, Esq. But few magistrates transact more business at "Warrant tryings" than he, and general satisfaction is given. That very tall, venerable and clerical-looking gentleman near Mr. Duff and from the same region of the county, is Edward Latham, Esq. His fine suit of black velvet, for which he has a great partiality, and his white flowing hair combed back over his head, well formed, and his countenance lighted up with a smile, render his appearance very imposing. He possesses an excellent mind, and generally arrives at very correct conclusions. Those two justices just taking their seats are Major James Taylor and Hatch D. Poston, Esq. They reside in the upper end of the county and are gentlemen of excellent minds. In person they are fine looking, and as officers of the county, they are highly esteemed. Next you see a heavy, well-set justice. In his manner, he is very pleasant and agreeable, of good natural qualities, of well-balanced mind, of sound and correct judgment. That is William Davis, Esq. Esteemed for his manly firmness and excellent nature, you see a tall and slender gentleman to the right of Mr. Davis. That is John McCulloch, Esq. Abram Nordyke, Samuel Moore and Thomas McChesney, Esqs., sit next. Those gentlemen are deservedly honored, and held in high esteem. They take rank among the substantial men of the country. On the extreme left you are attracted by three gentlemen comparatively young; we may say in the prime of manhood. They seem to take their position deferentially to the venerable men from whom they would learn lessons of wisdom in their new vocation. The first exhibits a fine personal appearance, ready in his utterances, and bends gracefully forward as he expresses an opinion, his red face sparkling with smiles, and he takes care to indulge, meanwhile, in an occasional sally of wit and good humor. His genial, happy nature leads him to think well of the denizens of this world, and sometimes, even on the bench, he will illustrate his opinions by the relation of an appropriate anecdote. Intelligent and wise in council, the county has long been favored with his services. The justice referred to is John N. Humes, Esq. The second is a slender gentleman, very neat in his dress, sits quite erect and frequently turns his quick, penetrating eye towards the senior members of the court. He seems to measure his words, which are fitly spoken, when uttered, a valuable member of the court, very commendably polite, and extremely graceful in his manners. That member is Peter J. Branch, Esq. The third gentleman is very easy and social in manner and disposition. His shoulders droop a little as he sits on the bench; his opinions are communicated with unreserved freedom and with a sincere desire that right and justice shall prevail. His face is somewhat elongated when he is looking serious, but pleasant and social as he is generally, he will often give you the benefit of one of his old-fashioned jokes. That valuable citizen and justice is Colonel Samuel E. Goodson. Pity some amiable lady had not long since won his heart, for, unfortunately for his country's good, he is a bachelor! Since a Representative in the State Legislature. Thomas McChesney, Esq., occupies his seat near the three last-named gentlemen. His tall, slender figure, his intellectual, gray head, forehead sloping back, give him an appearance at once commanding respect. He performs a great deal of private business for his countymen in writing documents, and is a very useful citizen. Near Mr. McChesney sits Captain John Moffet. He is a gentleman of fine sense, plain and unostentatious in manner. He is about five feet eleven inches high, with a full developed form, and has a very pleasant and genial appearance. In dispensing justice, he is decided, but always mild and courteous. The following lawyers composed the Abingdon bar in 1831, including those not residents of the county: Henry St. John Dixon, Edward Campbell, John H. Fulton, Peter C. Johnston, Peter Mayo, David McComas, Charles C. Johnson, Joseph Draper, William M. Fulton, Samuel Logan, Dale Carter, Andrew S. Fulton, Charles E. Harrison, Charles S. Bekem, Beverly R. Johnston and John Hall, Esqs. The General Assembly of Virginia, on March 11, 1836, incorporated the Lynchburg and Tennessee Railroad, and authorized subscriptions to the enterprise at different points from Lynchburg, west. The commissioners appointed to solicit and receive subscriptions at Abingdon were: David Campbell, James White, Andrew Russell, John M. Preston, John C. Greenway, Francis Smith, John Preston, William Byars, Samuel E. Goodson, Jonathan King and John W. C. Watson. So far as I can ascertain, no effort of any consequence was made to build or complete the railroad as contemplated by the foregoing Act. In the year 1837 the construction of a turnpike road from Pond Gap of the Cumberland mountain on the Kentucky line to the Fincastle and Cumberland Gap road was begun, and John Preston, William Byars, Charles S. Bekem and Charles J. Cummings, were appointed commissioners to solicit subscriptions to this enterprise by the county court of this county. Some time previous to the year 1837, the county court of this county decided to erect a new building to be used as a jail for this county, and appointed John M. Preston, Samuel Chastain and Elias Ogden a committee to superintend the erection of said building, and on the 28th day of May, 1838, the county court of this county authorized the erection of a stone kitchen twenty feet square from out to out, on the public lot on which the new jail was situated, and appointed John M. Preston, Elias Ogden and Jacob Lynch commissioners for the purpose of contracting for and superintending the building thereof. The court directed this stone kitchen to be erected out of stone from the old jail of the county, which old jail was built at a very early date in the history of our county. The new county jail was completed on the 23d day of October, 1838, and received by the county. This jail was destroyed by the Federal troops in December, 1864. It stood upon the lot at the intersection of Valley and Court streets. In the year 1837, Colonel John Keller, the representative from this county in the Senate of Virginia, and a member of the county court of this county, departed this life. Whereupon the county court of this county adopted the following resolutions: "Authentic information of the recent death of our highly-esteemed fellow-citizen, Col. John Keller, late our Representative in the Senate of Virginia and a member of this Court, having reached the court of Washington county, whilst in session, and the court and bar being desirous of testifying their sense of the worth and excellence of Col. Keller, as well as their sorrow for his loss by this afflicting dispensation of Divine Providence, in removing from us in the prime of manhood, a citizen so distinguished for his worth and usefulness and so generally esteemed and beloved for his amiable deportment and sterling integrity; it is therefore resolved that in token of respect for the memory of the late Col. John Keller and regret for his loss, the members of this court and bar will wear crape for the next month on the left arm. And it is further resolved that these proceedings be entered amongst the minutes of the court and published in the Virginia Statesman." Colonel Keller was succeeded in the Senate of Virginia by the Honorable Fayette McMullen, who represented this senatorial district for the term of ten years without a break. At the same time and for the same term the Hon. George W. Hopkins represented this district in the Congress of the United States, and the Hon. Samuel E. Goodson represented this county in the House of Delegates of Virginia, three Democrats of the Jacksonian type and three of the most successful politicians in the history of our country. On the 22d day of October, 1838, Colonel James White, one of the distinguished citizens of this country, departed this life. Upon receipt of the news of the death of Colonel White, the county court of Washington county adopted the following resolutions: "The death of Colonel James White, a most enterprising, useful and worthy citizen of this county, who has long been an able, enlightened, just and firm member of this court, being announced, and this court and its officers and the members of the bar being desirous of expressing their deep grief for his loss and the high respect which they entertain for his memory, unanimously adopt the following resolutions, which are ordered to be spread upon the records of the court. "1st. Resolved, That the court, its officers and the members of the bar have heard with unfeigned regret of the death of Colonel James White. "2d. Resolved, That in the death of Colonel James White society has lost a worthy, intelligent and excellent member, and the county an upright, just and efficient public officer. "3d. Resolved, That as a mark of respect for the memory of the deceased, the court, its officers and the members of the bar will wear the usual badge of mourning for 30 days. "4th. Resolved, That they tender their sincere condolence to the widow and children of the deceased, and that they sincerely join with them in deploring the loss of the husband, father and friend. "5th. Resolved, That the clerk of this court do furnish a copy of these resolutions to the widow of the deceased and that he also cause a copy of them to be furnished the Virginia Statesman, with a request that the same be inserted. "6th. Resolved, That this court do now adjourn and that they, its officers and the members of the bar will attend the funeral of the deceased to-morrow at ten o'clock." Colonel White was the architect of his own fortune, and at the date of his death the wealthiest man that has lived in Washington county. Alexander Findlay, E. S. Watson and Peter J. Branch were selected to appraise and divide his property between his heirs-at-law, and their report shows that his personal property and landed estate was worth $669,085.05.* * Deed Book 21, page 8, Washington county. As an evidence of the superstition even now occasionally existing among the lower class of the country, there resided in 1838, in the hills, a few miles from Abingdon, a man by the name of Marsh, who was deemed by his neighbors not only honest and industrious, but possessed of as much intelligence as most people in the lower walks of life. This man was severely afflicted with scrofula, and imagined his disease to be the effects of a spell or pow-wow practiced upon him by a conjurer or wizard in the neighborhood by the name of Yates. This impression taking firm hold of Marsh's mind, he was thoroughly convinced that Yates could, if he chose, remove the malady. The latter, termed an Indian doctor, was sent for and administered his nostrums. The patient, growing worse, determined to try another remedy, which was to take the life of Yates. To accomplish this he sketched a rude likeness of Yates upon a tree, and shot at it repeatedly with bullets containing a portion of silver. Yates, contrary to his expectations, still survived. Marsh then determined to draw a bead upon the original, and accordingly charged an old musket with two balls, an admixture of silver and lead, watched an opportunity and shot his victim as he was quietly passing along the road, both balls entering the back of the neck. Yates, however, survived, and Marsh was sent to the penitentiary.† † Campbell MSS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Brother:— It is with great concern that we hear that a number of your Towns' people have lately been killed by some white men between Clinch river and Cumberland mountain, and that you blame the Virginians for it. As to who done it, I cannot certainly say, but have heard that one hundred men from Kentucky had gone towards Chickamogga Towns to take satisfaction for the murder that was done on the Kentucky path last October, and what made the people exceedingly angry, was that they heard their Captives, mostly women, were all burnt in the Chickamogga Towns. "You know when the Americans go to war, they kill no prisoners and try to save alive all the women and children. Warriors will only seek to fight with men; cowards may go to war with women. "Brother, listen attentively; ever since the year 1781, when your towns were all destroyed for joining the English, the Virginians buried the tomahawk deep, and never wish to raise it again against their brothers, the Cherokees, but are willing to live in friendship as long as the moon endures. It will be your fault if the friendship is broken. I venture to promise further, that none of the Virginians living on this side of the Cumberland mountains will molest the Cherokees without first obtaining orders from our Governor, who is a good man, and will see that you have justice done if you remain peaceable. He will also call the Kentuckians to account, if they have been guilty of destroying any of the friendly Cherokees. "Brother, call a Council of your head men, give them this Talk, exhort them to live peaceable, and wait until the Governor of Virginia can hear all the truth, and if his people are to blame, he will give him satisfaction and put a stop to former wrongs; but if you rashly go to war and kill innocent people, there may be a great deal of blood shed, for we can send a great army against you that may destroy you altogether. "Listen well. You must see that I have now given you good advice both for you and your nation. Send me in return an answer, a very long talk. Tell me all there is in your heart. If you are for keeping the chain of friendship bright, I will be your friend as heretofore, and do you all the good I can. It will give me pleasure to use means to heal the wounds and dry up the tears of those that have lost their friends, and be strong in endeavors to do justice to all the red people that keep the peace and love the Americans. "ARTHUR CAMPBELL. "To ye Great Warrior of the Cherokees."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"August 26, 1791, a party of Indians headed by a Captain Bench, of the Cherokee tribe, attacked the house of Elisha Ferris, two miles from Mockison Gap, murdered Mr. Ferris at his house, and made prisoner Mrs. Ferris and her daughter, Mrs. Livingston, and a young child together with Nancy Ferris. All but the latter were cruelly murdered the first day of their captivity. "April 1793, the same chief with a party of Indians, attacked and murdered the family of Harper Ratcliffe, six in number, about eight miles west of the above-mentioned gap. "March 31, 1793, the enemy attacked on Powell's mountain Moses Cockrell and two others, who had horses loaded with merchandise; killed two men, took all the goods, and pursued Mr. Cockrell nearly two miles. "July 17, 1793, Bench with two other warriors traversed the settlement, on the north fork of Holston for upwards of twenty miles, probably with the intention of making discoveries where were negro property. In this rout they fired at one Williams, and too prisoner a negro woman, the property of Paul Livingston, who after two days captivity made her escape. "And lastly, April 6, 1794, the melancholy disaster which befell Mr. Livingston's family and property, which has urged this application for assistance to prevent the depopulation of a considerable settlement. "From the above facts your Excellency and Council will be a judge of the justice of our claim, that such protection be afforded us, as the State may be able to afford and our necessities require. "All of which we submit with deference and your petitioners will ever pray. "A. BLEDSOE, "GEORGE WILCOX, "ABRAHAM FULKERSON, "JOHN V. COOK, "JAMES FULKERSON, "April 14, 1794."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"April 6th, 1794. "About 10 o'clock in the morning, as I was sitting in my house, the fierceness of the dog's barking alarmed me. I looked out and saw seven Indians approaching the house, armed and painted in a frightful manner. No person was then within, but a child of ten years old, and another of two, and my sucking infant. My husband and his brother Henry had just before walked out to a barn at some distance in the field. My sister-in-law, Susanna, was with the remaining children in an out-house. Old Mrs. Livingston was in the garden. I immediately shut and fastened the door; they (the Indians) came furiously up, and tried to burst it open, demanding of me several times to open the door, which I refused. They then fired two guns; one ball pierced through the door, but did me no damage. I then thought of my husband's rifle, took it down but it being double triggered, I was at a loss; at length I fired through the door, but it not being well aimed I did no execution; however the Indians retired from that place and soon after that an old adjoining house was on fire, and I and my children suffering much from the smoke. I opened the door and an Indian immediately advanced and took me prisoner, together with the two children. I then discovered that they had my remaining children in their possession, my sister Sukey, a wench with her young child, a negro man of Edward Callihan's and a negro boy of our own about eight years old. They were fearful of going into the house I left, to plunder, supposing that it had been a man that shot at them, and was yet within. So our whole clothing and household furniture were consumed in the flames, which I was then pleased to see, rather than that it should be of use to the savages. "We were all hurried a short distance, where the Indians were very busy, dividing and putting up in packs for each to carry his part of the booty taken. I observed them careless about the children, and most of the Indians being some distance off in front, I called with a low voice to my eldest daughter, gave her my youngest child, and told them all to run towards neighbor John Russell's. "They, with reluctance, left me, sometimes halting, sometimes looking back. I beckoned them to go, although I inwardly felt pangs not to be expressed on account of our doleful separation. The two Indians in the rear either did not notice this scene, or they were willing the children might run back. "That evening the Indians crossed Clinch Mountain and went as far as Copper creek, distant about eight miles. "April 7th, set out early in the morning, crossed Clinch river at McLean's fish dam about twelve o'clock, then steered northwardly towards the head of Stoney creek. There the Indians camped carelessly, had no back spy nor kept sentries out. This day's journey was about twenty miles. "April 8th. Continued in camp until the sun was more than an hour high; then set out slowly and traveled five or six miles and camped near the foot of Powell's mountain. This day Benge, the Indian chief, became more pleasant, and spoke freely to the prisoners. He told them he was about to carry them to the Cherokee towns. That in his route in the wilderness was his brother with two other Indians hunting, so that he might have provision when he returned. That at his camp were several white prisoners taken from Kentucky, with horses and saddles to carry them to the towns. He made enquiry for several persons on Holston, particularly old General Shelby, and said he would pay him a visit during the ensuing summer, and take away all his negroes. He frequently enquired who had negroes, and threatened he would have them all off the North Holston. He said all the Chickamogga towns were for war, and would soon be very troublesome to the white folks. "This day two of the party were sent by Benge ahead to hunt. "April 9th. After travelling about five miles, which was over Powell's mountain, and near the foot of the Stone mountain,* * Near Dorchester, Wise county. a party of thirteen men under command of Lieutenant Vincent Hobbs, of the militia of Lee county, met the enemy in front, attacked and killed Benge the first fire, I being at that time some distance off in the rear. The Indian who was my guard at first halted on hearing the firing. He then ordered me to run, which I performed slowly. He attempted to strike me in the head with the tomahawk, which I defended as well as I could with my arm. By this time two of our people came in view, which encouraged me to struggle all I could. The Indian making an effort at this instant pushed me backward, and I fell over a log, at the same time aiming a violent blow at my head, which in part spent its force on me and laid me for dead. The first thing I afterwards remembered was my good friends around me, giving me all the assistance in their power for my relief. They told me I was senseless for about an hour.

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. WASHINGTON COUNTY, 1840-1870. About this time political lines were closely drawn in Washington county, and the zealous work of the advocates of the Whig and Democratic parties has not been surpassed in the history of our county. Freeholders were the only qualified voters, and the great effort of the advocates of the two parties was to enfranchise every male citizen sympathizing with their respective parties. * * B. K. and M. H. Buchanan. Two brothers, prominent citizens of this county, were opposed in their political views, one being a Whig and the other a Democrat. They were the owners of a large tract of land situated in this county. The Whig brother conveyed his interest in the said land to a large number of persons of Whig sympathies, qualifying them to vote, and thereupon the Democratic brother conveyed his lands to an equal number of male citizens of Democratic proclivities, and Governor David Campbell, who was the owner of the south side of Clinch mountain from Little Moccasin Gap to Mendota, executed numerous deeds to his political friends for the purpose of enfranchising them. In many instances the grantee never knew the location of his land nor did he care. In the presidential campaign in 1840 William Henry Harrison was elected President of the United States, and there was great rejoicing among the Whigs of this section. The Whig ticket in that campaign was as follows: REPUBLICAN WHIG TICKET. For President, WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON, of OHIO. For Vice-President. JOHN TYLER, of Virginia. Districts. Electors. 1. JOHN W. MURDAUGH, of Norfolk county; 2. JOHN URQUHART, of Southampton; 3. WILLIAM S. ARCHER, of Amelia; 4. RICHARD KIDDER MEADE, of Dinwiddie; 5. HENRY E. WATKINS, of Prince Edward; 6. JAMES C. BRUCE, of Halifax; 7. WHITMELL P. TUNSTALL, of Pittsylvania; 8. THOMAS R. JOYNES, of Accomack; 9. NORBORNE E. SUTTON, of Caroline; 10. WILLOUGHBY NEWTON, of Westmoreland; 11. JAMES LYONS, of Richmond City; 12. VALENTINE W. SOUTHALL, of Albemarle; 13. JOHN S. PENDLETON, of Culpeper; 14. JOHN JANNEY, of Loudoun; 15. ANDREW HUNTER, of Jefferson; 16. PHILIP WILLIAMS, JR., of Frederick; 17. WILLIAM SEYMOUR, of Hardy; 18. BRISCOE G. BALDWIN, of Augusta; 19. BALLARD SMITH, of Greenbrier; 20. EDWARD JOHNSTON, of Botetourt; 21. JOHN N. HUMES, of Washington; 22. GEORGE W. SUMMERS, of Kanawha; 23. WAITMAN T. WILEY, of Monangalia. There were but three precincts in Washington county at this time, to-wit, Joseph Meek's, the courthouse and Three Springs.

Hanby, John Horn, Isaac Stoffle, Zachariah Jourdan. Upon the death of President Harrison, in 1841, the 14th of May, 1841, was, pursuant to the proclamation of John Tyler, President of the United States, observed as a day of fasting and prayer by the citizens of Washington county; and on the 13th day of May, 1841, the Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery of this county entered the following order—Judge Estill presiding: "To-morrow being the day of fasting, humiliation and prayer appointed by proclamation, to be observed by the people of the U. S. in testimony of a nation's sorrow for the death of William Henry Harrison, late President of the United States, and this court and bar intending so to observe the said day, it is therefore ordered that this court be adjourned till Saturday next, at nine o'clock in the morning." A similar order was entered by the circuit court of Washington county, Virginia, upon the death of President McKinley in the year 1901. The cost of supporting the poor of the county had, by the year 1841, increased to such an extent that the county court of this county decided to sell the poorhouse and maintain the poor by having them supported in their homes, and a committee was appointed for the purpose of selling the lands occupied by the poorhouse of the county, but soon thereafter and before the lands were sold, the order directing the sale of the property was, for some reason, revoked, and between this time and the year 1860 considerable improvements were made upon the poorhouse farm, which consisted of the lands now occupied by J. A. P. Ryan. By order of the county court during this year the commissioners of the revenue were directed to omit from their lists the students of the Abingdon Academy and of Emory and Henry College. The country at the time in question was greatly agitated over the Texas revolution and the attitude of Mexico toward the United States. The Democratic party, advocating war and the annexation of Texas, nominated James K. Polk for President, and the Whigs nominated Henry Clay. The contest between the parties in this election was bitter from the start, but resulted in the election of James K. Polk. As a result of this election war was inevitable, and from the spring of 1845 to the summer of 1846 the youth of Washington county were monthly drilled and trained in the art of war. The Government at Richmond furnished the militia officers of Washington county with a cannon and a number of guns, and Abram Mongle, colonel of the One Hundred and Forty-sixth regiment, was given permission by the county court, on the 28th day of April, 1845, to erect a shed on the public lot for the protection and preservation of the artillery allowed the county, and on the 25th day of March, 1846, A. C. Cummings was permitted to erect a house on the public square for the preservation of a cannon allowed the militia of the county by the State authorities, and twenty dollars was appropriated by the county court to pay for the house. Upon the breaking out of the Mexican War, three large companies of volunteers were organized in Washington county, one in the lower end of the county, officered by Captain Frank Campbell and Lieutenant Samuel V. Fulkerson; another at Abingdon, officered by Captain Arthur Campbell Cummings and Lieutenant James T. Preston; another in the upper end of the county, the names of the officers of which I cannot ascertain. General Peter C. Johnston took an active interest in enlisting the young men of the county in these companies, and during the time, accompanied by a number of young men from Washington county, visited Lebanon on a court day, and took with him the cannon that was at that time in the possession of the militia officers of Washington county. When the three companies above mentioned were completed, their services were tendered to the Governor of the State, but were declined, as the State had furnished its full quota of men. The only opportunity for the citizens of this county to serve their country in this war was to secure their commissions from the President and enlist in the regular army. In the spring of the year 1847, President Polk commissioned Arthur Campbell Cummings, a graduate of the Virginia Military Institute and an attorney at the Abingdon bar, a captain in the regular army. Upon the receipt of his commission Captain Cummings proceeded to enlist all volunteers possible for the regular army, and on the 27th day of April, 1847, with fifteen recruits, left Abingdon for Mexico. The night of the first day was spent at Hansonville, the night of the second day at Virginia City, with James Dickenson; the night of the third day at Wise Courthouse with Captain Samuel Salyers; the night of the fourth day one mile over the Cumberland mountains with a Mr. Mullin; the night of the fifth day fifteen miles east of Pikeville, Kentucky, and from Pikeville, Kentucky, Captain Cummings and the troops proceeded by water to Newport, Kentucky; thence by the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to the Gulf of Mexico, and thence to Vera Cruz, Mexico, where he joined his command. Captain Cummings and his men were assigned to Company K of the Eleventh regiment of the United States Infantry, which regiment was officered as follows: Colonel, Albert C. Ramsey, of Pennsylvania. Lieutenant-Colonel, — Graham, killed in the battle of Moline del Rey. Lieutenant-Colonel, John H. Savage, Tennessee, succeeded to command upon the death of Graham. Captain, Arthur Campbell Cummings. Privates. James Dickenson, killed, Abingdon, 1865. William Haley, served in C. S. A.; died at Winchester, 1862. Wesley Hubbard, Tazewell county. Moses Hubbard, died Pueblo, Mexico, 1847. John S. Lynch, Washington county, killed Passo Ovejas, Mexico; buried there. — Pawpaw, wagoner, died Pueblo, Mexico, 1847. John Slaughter, Washington county; served in C. S. A.; died near Banhams in 1898. James J. Shelton, Washington county; served in C. S. A.; married a daughter of George Garrett; killed at Chancellorsville. Hezekiah Smallwood, Scott county; killed accidentally in Scott county. — Snead, Scott county. Robert Wilson, died near Lynchburg. James Wynn, Tazewell county; emigrated to Missouri. Marvel White, Scott county. W. S. Wood, Scott county, brother-in-law of Fayette McMullen. In addition to the volunteers accompanying Captain Cummings, the following Mexican veterans lived in this county, so far as I can ascertain: John Dinsmore, John M. Cunningham, William Rhea, Samuel Davis, Tex., Rev. William E. Jones, John P. Johnston, John C. Deadmore, Tex., Rev. Madison Leedy, Tex., Rev. The successful conclusion of the Mexican War gave great impetus to the emigration from this section of Virginia to Texas, large numbers of the young men of the county emigrating thither. The building of a new courthouse for the county was considered by the county court of this county in the fall of 1847, and the Legislature of Virginia, on the 15th of January, 1848, authorized the County Court of Washington county, Virginia, to borrow ten thousand dollars for the purpose of erecting a new courthouse. The county court at the June term, 1848, decided to borrow ten thousand dollars and erect a new courthouse, and appointed John M. Preston, William Y. C. White and John D. Mitchell, commissioners, to borrow the money and superintend the erection thereof. The building of the new courthouse was let to Herbert M. Ledbetter and William Fields, contractors, and, by the spring of 1850, the courthouse was completed and Jacob Lynch and Connally F. Trigg were appointed a committee to purchase the necessary tables, chairs, carpets, etc., for the new courthouse. The courthouse thus completed served the county until the 15th of December, 1864, at which time it was destroyed by the fire that burnt the town of Abingdon. In the year 1848, General Zachary Taylor and General Lewis Cass were the Whig and the Democratic candidates for the presidency, while the Honorable Fayette McMullen and Samuel E. Goodson were the Democratic candidates and Andrew S. Fulton the Whig candidate for Congress from this district. The Whig ticket was as follows: For President, MAJ.-GEN. ZACHARY TAYLOR, OF LOUISIANA. For Vice-President, MILLARD FILLMORE, OF NEW YORK. Electoral Ticket. 1. John J. Jones, Isle of Wight. 2. George W. Bolling, of Petersburg. 3. Henry P. Irving, of Cumberland. 4. Joseph K. Irving, of Lynchburg. 5. W. Martin, of Franklin. 6. B. Johnson Barbour, of Culpeper. 7. Robert E. Scott, of Fauquier. 8. H. T. Garnett, of Westmoreland. 9. John A. Meredith, of Richmond City. 10. Robert Saunders, of Williamsburg. 11. Andrew Hunter, of Jefferson. 12. A. H. H. Stuart, of Augusta. 13. S. McD. Moore, of Rockbridge. 14. Connally F. Trigg, of Washington. 15. G. W.

Grayson, Dr. Robertson. Lee, John M. Crockett. Russell, Dale Carter. Scott, William Spear. Smyth, Thomas L. Preston. Tazewell, John A. Kelly, Wythe, P. S. Buckingham. Washington, Charles S. Bekem. In the contest for the seat in Congress, the Honorable A. S. Fulton defeated his Democratic opponents and represented this district until the year 1849. The Honorable Fayette McMullen represented this district for a number of years in the Congress of the United States, and while he had but little ability as a statesman, he was one of the most popular men and effective canvassers that ever lived in this district. He kissed the babies, joked with the men and flattered the women upon all occasions. He knew, personally, nearly every voter in the district. Numerous anecdotes are told of Colonel McMullen, the best now recollected being told by Senator Vest, of Missouri. This anecdote was told by the Senator to illustrate the propensity on the part of some people for speech-making. "It occurred in Virginia," said Vest. "Old Fayette McMullen was canvassing his district for a nomination for Congress, years ago, and during the canvass a man was hung in that locality for murder. About ten thousand men collected to witness the scene, and among them old Mac, who, by the favor of the sheriff, occupied a place on the platform in the rear of the gallows, his oratorical mouth watering at the sight of the magnificent audience in front. When everything was ready, as is usual in such cases, the sheriff asked the culprit if he had anything to say before the sentence of the law was passed upon him; to which the condemned responded that he would say nothing. Whereupon old Mac stepped forward, rubbing his hands, and remarked: `Mr. Sheriff, if the gentleman will yield his time to me, I will embrace this occasion to make a few remarks on the political situation, and announce myself a candidate for Congress.' " Major Robert E. Bradley, a distinguished and popular citizen of this county, died in the month of November, 1849, and the county court of this county out of respect to his memory adopted appropriate resolutions. The Constitution of 1829-1830 had never been satisfactory to a large majority of the people of Virginia in this, that the right of suffrage was restricted to a greater extent than the times demanded, and the representation, as between the sections, was so unequally apportioned as to give dissatisfaction to all the people of Western Virginia. By the year 1850, Western and Northwestern Virginia had increased in population and wealth so rapidly that in this year this section of Virginia succeeded in having adopted a resolution by the General Assembly submitting to the people the question of the calling of a Constitutional Convention. This question was submitted to the people on the fourth Thursday in April, 1850, and resulted in the calling of a Constitutional Convention. The election for members to this convention was held in the summer of 1850. This district was composed of Wythe, Smyth and Washington, and the candidates before the people in said election were: George W. Hopkins, B. R. Floyd, Thomas M. Tate, Democrats. Connally F. Trigg, Andrew S. Fulton, James W. Sheffey, Whigs. The two first named were elected by an average majority of three hundred and forty-one, while the majority of Thomas M. Tate, Democrat, over James W. Sheffey, Whig, was fifty-five. At the time in question, George W. Hopkins was a member of the General Assembly of Virginia, and, upon the convening of the General Assembly in the fall of the year, he was elected Speaker of the House of Delgates, and resigned his position as a member of the Constitutional Convention, and the Honorable Connally F. Trigg was elected without opposition to fill the vacancy. This Convention assembled in the hall of the House of Delegates at Richmond, on October 14, 1850. It was controlled in nearly all of its proceedings by what was known at the time as "Reformers." This convention extended the right of suffrage to every white male citizen of the Commonwealth of the age of twenty-one years, who had been a resident of the State for two years, and of the county, city or town where he offered to vote, for twelve months, excluding persons of unsound mind, criminals, etc. It was provided therein that the vote should be given openly, or viva voce, and not by ballot. It will be observed that this was a radical change from the provisions of the former constitution of the State, property qualifications of all kinds were dispensed with, and manhood suffrage, for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, was made a part of the organic law of the State. The question of the apportionment of representation was deferred by this Constitution until the year 1865, and was never put into operation, as in the year 1865 the Commonwealth was in great turmoil. Had the provisions of this Constitution become effective as to representation, this question would have been settled in a manner satisfactory to the citizens of Western Virginia. By this Constitution, the Governor, Lieutenant-Governor and Attorney-General were made elective by the people, the Governor and Attorney-General of the State having been theretofore selected by the Council of State and the General Assembly. This was a great change from the former conditions existing in Virginia and was antagonistic to the old system and former institutions of the State. All the judges and justices were made elective by the people. Each county was to be laid off into districts, and four justices were to be elected from each district. This Constitution was submitted to the people for ratification or rejection, and all persons qualified to vote under the proposed Constitution were permitted to exercise the right of suffrage in said election. The vote resulted in the ratification of the Constitution by the people in the month of October, 1851, the vote being 75,748 for, and 11,060 against the new Constitution. The vote in Washington county was 1,083 for and 12 against the ratification of the Constitution, the twelve votes against the Constitution being polled at Abingdon precinct. In the fall of this year the Democratic and Whig parties nominated their strongest men for Governor and the Legislature, George W. Summers, of Kanawha county, being the Whig, and Joseph Johnson, of Harrison county, the Democratic candidates for Governor, while in this county, Isaac B. Dunn and William King were the Democratic candidates and John A. Campbell and James Orr, the Whig candidates for the Legislature. The result was the election of the Democratic candidates in the State and the county by a greatly-reduced majority. This was the first time in the history of the Commonwealth that the Governor of the Commonwealth was elected by popular vote and Virginia's first experience with manhood suffrage. At the same election the following county officers were selected: Clerk of the County Court, Jacob Lynch. Commonwealth's Attorney, Samuel Logan. Sheriff, Matthew H. Buchanan. County-Surveyor, James C. Black. Commissioner-Revenue, upper end, Robert H. Henderson. Commissioner-Revenue, lower end, James L. F. Campbell. At the same time twenty-four members of the county court were elected by the people. In the year 1852, Washington county was divided into magisterial districts by Jonathan King, Washington Bishop, Robert B. Edmondson, Alexander Findlay, James C. Fulcher, James L. Davis, Michael W. Weathers, John M. Hamilton, L. L. Waterman, Peter S. Hanby and Whitley Fullen, commissioners appointed for that purpose, and the members of the county court were divided into classes and held the court in the order arranged. From this time forward, the magnificent specimen of manhood that so often adorned the old county court of this county gradually disappeared, and their places, in many instances, were filled by men who were able to control the voters, either by an appeal to party passion or corrupt measures. The members of the county court were elected from this time until the year 1870, at which time the old county court system was abolished. In the fall of the year 1850, a considerable revival was evidenced among the agricultural portion of the people of Washington county. After notice, a number of the citizens of the county assembled at the courthouse for the purpose of organizing an agricultural society for this county. At this meeting, upon motion of Connally F. Trigg, Colonel William Byars was elected chairman and John A. Campbell secretary, and the following resolution was adopted: That the chair appoint a committee of five gentlemen to prepare and report a constitution to our next meeting, under which the agricultural society for Washington county shall be organized. Thereupon the chairman appointed the following committee: Connally F. Trigg, chairman; Wyndham Robertson, F. H. Preston, Samuel E. Goodson and William Y. C. White. The meeting then adjourned to the 28th day of September, 1850, on which day a large number of the leading citizens of the county met at the courthouse and adopted a constitution and by-laws and elected the following officers of the agricultural society. President, William Byars. Vice-Presidents, David Campbell, William C. Edmondson and James L. Davis. Secretary, John A. Campbell. Treasurer, John M. Preston. Executive Committee, William Y. C. White, Lewis F. Cosby, Isaac Horne, F. H. Preston and John Baker. The agricultural interest of Washington county was closely looked after, and prospered to a considerable extent for many years. The General Assembly of Virginia at its session in the year 1849, incorporated the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad Company, and interest throughout this section of Virginia in the building of this railroad was greatly stimulated. A railroad meeting was held at Abingdon on the first day of July court, 1849, for the purpose of electing delegates to a convention to be held at Christiansburg on the 7th of August. Governor Wyndham Robertson was elected chairman and Leo Shaver, secretary of the meeting, and on motion of John A. Campbell the chairman appointed John M. Preston, Dr. Snead, Jacob Lynch, C. F. Trigg and John A. Campbell a committee to draft resolutions expressive of the sense of the meeting. The meeting was addressed by Governor Robertson, who dwelt upon the paramount importance of the road to this section of Virginia. John A. Campbell, chairman of the committee, reported the following resolutions, which were adopted: "Resolved, That we, the people of Washington county, respond cordially to the invitation made us by the county of Montgomery, to appoint delegates to the convention proposed to be held at Christiansburg on the 7th of August, next, to take measures in aid of, and to promote subscriptions of stock to, the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. Resolved, That both local and general considerations urgently recommend this great work to the enlightened self-interest and the patriotism of the people of the whole Southwest. Resolved, That twenty delegates be appointed in behalf of this county to attend the said convention; and that they be charged to coöperate heartily in any measure proposed by said convention, calculated to attain the desired object. Pursuant to the third resolution, the chairman appointed the following-named gentlemen delegates to said convention: John M. Preston, Colonel William Byars, Major John Campbell, William King Heiskell, William C. Edmondson, William Y. C. White, C. F. Trigg, Thomas L. Preston, John Gray, Charles B. Coale, John A. Campbell, Colonel Ota H. Ward, C. S. Bekem, John D. Mitchell, Colonel James L. Davis, Dr. N. Snead, William B. Byars, Dr. A. R. Preston, John C. Cummings and Colonel Abram Mongle. The convention was held at Christiansburg, and in the month of April, 1850, a corps of engineers were engaged in making a survey preparatory to the location of a railroad through this county. Another mass meeting of the citizens of the county was held in Abingdon on the 25th day of August, 1850, for the purpose of electing delegates to a railroad convention to be held in the town of Wytheville on the 11th of September, 1850, at which meeting Dr. Daniel Trigg presided and James T. Preston acted as secretary. On the 20th of September, 1850, a railroad meeting was held at Elizabeth Chapel at Saltville, having for its object the election of delegates to a railroad convention to be held at Jeffersonville, on the 17th of October. The object of this convention was to have the Virginia and Tennessee railroad located from New river along Walker's creek and Holston Valley, passing Saltville. The proceedings of said meeting were as follows: "On motion, Major A. B. Trigg was called to the chair and William P. Bishop and William King were appointed secretaries. The object of the meeting was explained by Dr. Robert Thurman, and the following-named persons appointed to report resolutions for the action of the meeting: Dr. Alex. McCall, Major Thomas Tate, Dr. Robert Thurman, H. D. Poston, Theo. G. Pearson, D. M. Hunter and John Roberts. The committee retired and afterwards reported the following resolutions which were unanimously adopted: Resolved, That it is expedient for the carrying out of the objects of this meeting that the committee hereby appointed shall solicit the concurrent support of the people of Russell, Tazewell, Washington, Smyth, Wythe, Mercer, Giles, Boone, Monroe, Logan, Wyoming, Kanawha, Fayette and Greenbrier counties, in behalf of obtaining a survey for the Virginia and Tennessee railroad from New river along Walker's creek and Holston Valley, passing the Gypsum bank and Salt Works to the Tennessee line for intersection with the Tennessee railroad at the most convenient point. Resolved, That a general meeting of the citizens of the aforesaid counties and others interested be held on the 17th day of October next, at Tazewell Courthouse, in aid of the aforesaid objects. Resolved, That the following-named persons be appointed delegates to said convention: Tobias Smyth, James Kelly, W. W. Harvey, James McNew, J. M. Ropp, Wyndham Robertson, Alex. McCall, D. M. Hunter, Thomas L. Preston, James T. Morehead, Robert Thurman, James Saunders, T. G. Pearson, H. D. Poston, Whitley Fullen, O. H. Ward, John Roberts, Charles C. Taylor, Charles C. Campbell, Jerome Campbell, Jezrell Harman, P. C. Buchanan, Jr., Joseph Sexton, A. H. Cox, James Cox, Ransom Tilson, Martin Davis, William P. Milner, C. F. McDonald, G. W. Buchanan, John B. Tate, C. J. Shannon, P. C. Buchanan, Sr. and J. F. Baugh. Resolved, That the names of the chairman and secretaries be added to the said delegation. Resolved, That the Abingdon Democrat, Abingdon Virginian, Jeffersonville Democrat, Wytheville Republican and other papers friendly to the objects of this meeting be requested to publish its proceedings at the earliest time practicable. On motion, the meeting adjourned. A. B. TRIGG, Chairman. W. P. BISHOP, WILLIAM KING, Secretaries. The County Court of Washington county, on the 28th of July, 1851, directed the election officers of this county to submit to the qualified voters of the county, at the next general election, the question whether the court of this county, on behalf of the county, should subscribe to the stock of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad Company the sum of $33,400, on condition that said road be put under contract to the Tennessee line the ensuing fall, and in the month of October, 1851, a great railroad meeting was held in Abingdon, at which meeting delegates attended from most of the counties of Southwestern Virginia and East Tennessee. The proceedings of this meeting are here given. On Wednesday last, pursuant to previous notice, a great railroad convention was held in Abingdon. It met at 12 M. and was temporarily organized by the call of Major John Campbell as chairman, and the appointment of Charles B. Coale and William King Heiskell as secretaries. On motion of C. F. Trigg, a committee of seven was appointed to select and report officers for the convention, whereupon the chairman appointed the following gentlemen said committee—viz.: C. F. Trigg, I. B. Dunn, W. Y. C. White, P. J. Branch, J. L. Davis, Dr. T. M. Tate and Colonel William Byars.

Trigg to conduct the president-elect to the chair, who promptly and cheerfully performed that duty, when the president indulged in a few brief and eloquent remarks explanatory of the object of the convention, and closed by calling upon the president of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad Company (General O. G. Clay) for an exposition of the condition and prospects of the work. General Clay, having complied, stated that but the comparatively insignificant sum of $200,000 was wanting to complete the work from Lynchburg to the Tennessee line. On motion of C. F. Trigg, Esq., Professor Edmund Longley, who was present, and who had been appointed a delegate to this convention, by a meeting of the students of Emory and Henry College, was invited to take a seat and participate in the deliberations of the convention. It was moved by Wyndham Robertson, Esq., that a committee of seven be appointed to prepare a series of resolutions for the consideration of this convention; whereupon the president appointed the following gentlemen said committee: W. Robertson, Esq., Dr. S. B. Cunningham, Colonel S. E. Goodson, Hon. A. McClellan, Thomas L. Preston, Esq., Captain J. A. Campbell and William King Heiskell, Esq. The committee having retired, in response to a call made upon him, Colonel L. C. Haynes, of Tennessee, entertained the audience for more than an hour, with a most thrilling, eloquent and unanswerable address, in advocacy of this great improvement; at the close of which (the committee not having returned), Colonel William M. Burwell, of Bedford, was loudly called for and briefly, but eloquently, addressed the convention. The committee returned, but not having accomplished their work, On motion, the convention adjourned till to-morrow morning at ten o'clock. The convention, in pursuance of adjournment yesterday, assembled at ten o'clock. A number of ladies were present on the morning of the second day, blessing and cheering the members of the convention and those in attendance, with their smiles and presence, urging us on to renewed efforts in behalf of this great work, for their sakes, at least, if not for our own. Colonel John McGaughey, being called upon for that purpose, occupied the stand for a short time, during which he advocated the speedy completion of this great railroad line, and deprecated that want of energy and nerve that has lost to so many forlorn bachelors a prize worth more than all the gold of California; and the lack of which is so detrimental to the interests of our great railroad. After Mr. McGaughey concluded, the committee appointed yesterday, through its chairman, Wyndham Robertson, Esq., submitted the following resolutions—viz.: Resolved, That all history has shown, and all experience still attests, that an easy and convenient means of intercourse between men and of a ready interchange of the products of labor, if not the main spring, is yet the indispensable condition of human progress and national power, and of all the ameliorations, social, moral, political and material, that follow in their train. Resolved, That from the introduction of railroads to the present day, a like unvarying experience, wherever they have been tried, has fully established their vast and yet unrealized importance to the cause of civilization and of natural and individual wealth— outstripping in their results, year after year, all previous calculations of their capacity for usefulness, and that, in view of the overwhelming array of concurrent proof, we feel authorized to declare, that, in our opinion, the value of the railroad is no more than the value of light and heat, of the steamboat or mariner's compass, open to question. Resolved, That among the projected railway communications of the day, we recognize the great southwestern national route—passing through Southwest Virginia and East Tennessee—which purposes to connect, through the most favorable depression of the Alleghanies, the waters and people of the West and South with the waters and people of the East and North, which, in particular, by the most direct location possible across the Union connects New Orleans with the seat of the national government and the eastern cities, and which promises at no distant day to offer the most direct practicable connection between our Pacific and Atlantic borders, as second in importance to no other, exerting, as it must, a great and most beneficent influence on all the great interests of our country—commercial, social and political. Resolved, That the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad and the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad, occupying the very throat of the pass between the West and East, form a most interesting portion of this great line and must largely share in the mighty results to flow from it; and yet more, because, viewed in its local aspects, their result must inevitably be to augment production, cheapen transportation, increase population and diffuse knowledge, they pre-eminently deserve the fostering care of the States in which they lie, and present the strongest claims on them and on the people along the line, to a most liberal support. Resolved, That, connected by the strong ties of vicinage with our sister State of Tennessee and by the bond of a common interest in the prosecution of this great line of improvement, this convention feels at liberty and does most earnestly appeal to the authorities of the State to lend their liberal aid and coöperation to our fellow-citizens of East Tennessee, who are now laboring, with inadequate means, but enlightened and patriotic spirit, to construct the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad. Resolved, That the Legislature of Virginia, by its generous participation in the expenses of the construction of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, by the liberal charter granted it and by the wise policy it encourages by authorized county subscriptions to public works, has well and wisely discharged a high public duty, and receive the merited tribute of the acknowledgments of this convention. Resolved, That while we consider the ultimate completion and triumphant success of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad as beyond all contingency, we yet deem its early construction throughout the line to its western terminus to be of the highest importance, and to insure that, it is only necessary to put forth renewed exertions; that we entertain no doubt whatever of the great value of its stock, and, confidently recommending it as a safe and valuable investment, we earnestly invite present subscribers, so far as they can, to enlarge their subscriptions, and particularly appeal to those who are able to aid in the enterprise and situated so as necessarily to share its benefits, but who from whatever reasons have heretofore held back, now that its final completion is certain, to come up to the work and no longer refuse to share its preliminary burdens. Resolved, That we recommend the appointment of committees for the various counties interested in this improvement to solicit individual subscriptions and a standing central committee in the county of Washington, and that such subscriptions be on the condition that steps be taken by the company during the present fall to place the road under contract through its whole length. Resolved, That in the opinion of this convention, the counties along the line of the road will derive benefits from a subscription to the road in increased wages to the laborer, increased prices of the farming products and lands, in the increased amount of circulating money, in increased variety of employments, and the early and permanent reduction of county taxes, so great as to render a small temporary provision for any required loan scarcely felt as a burden, and felt in all time after as the source of unmixed benefits. Resolved, That the company shall apply its present resources first to completing and putting in operation the first division terminating at Salem; secondly, the grading and masonry of remaining divisions to the Tennessee line; relying upon the remaining resources after the said grading and masonry shall have been completed and upon further subscriptions to purchase the iron necestion. Resolved, That we deem the uninterrupted prosecution and earliest possible completion of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad to be commended by every consideration of sound policy; that we applaud the energetic policy which has heretofore marked its management, and express the undoubting confidence that a persistence in it will insure within a period of three years from this day its triumphant consummation. A call being made for Hon. William Ballard Preston, he arose and took the stand and entertained a large and attentive audience for two or three hours, with a speech of great force and eloquence, in which he showed the importance of this road, not only as a local or State work, but as a great national work, and as an important link in the great chain of railway communication that is destined to convey the productions of the Eastern Hemisphere to Europe, and to the Eastern shores of this country. On motion the convention adjourned until this evening at half past four o'clock. EVENING SESSION. The first business in order was the report of the Committee on Resolutions, but before any action was taken thereon, a call was made on the "distinguished gentleman from Bedford," Mr. William M. Burwell, who entertained the convention for more than two hours with a masterly address in favor of the great line from New Orleans to Norfolk. The convention now took a recess for one hour. On reassembling at candle-light, Sidney Baxter, Esq., having appeared as a delegate from the city of Richmond and being introduced to the convention, proceeded to address it for a short time. After Mr. Baxter "wound up," the resolutions of the Committee on Business coming up in order, they were unanimously adopted. Thomas L. Preston, Esq., then introduced the following resolution: Resolved, That this convention highly approve of the proposed General Railroad Convention to be held at New Orleans, on the first Monday in January next, and request the appointment by the president, on its behalf, of five delegates thereto. Hon. William Ballard Preston, submitted the following, which was adopted: Resolved, That a committee of seven be appointed by the chair, to prepare, after the adjournment of this body, an address to the country setting forth the character, advantages and relations, State, National and international, of the Southwest Virginia and East Tennessee Railroad, and that the same, with the resolutions adopted by this convention, be respectfully presented, on its behalf, to the legislatures of the two States. Mr. Robertson moved that the President have leave to appoint the several committees required under different resolutions of the convention, after its adjournment, which motion was agreed to. The following resolution was on motion of Mr. McGaughey unanimously adopted: Resolved, That the thanks of this convention are due to the people of Abingdon and its vicinity for their bountiful hospitality, and to the ladies for their countenance and support to this convention. The president being requested to vacate the chair, Colonel William M. Burwell was requested to occupy it for a few minutes, when on the motion of John A. Campbell, Esq., "the thanks of the convention were unanimously tendered to Hon. Seth J. Lucky, for the dignity, ability and impartiality with which he presided over the deliberations of this convention." The president in a few brief remarks signified his appreciation of the honor conferred upon him, and invoked the united efforts of all in favor of the railroad. On motion the convention then adjourned sine die. SETH J. LUCKY, President. CHAS. B. COALE, WILLIAM K. HEISKELL, LEONIDAS BAUGH, Secretaries. On the 24th of November, 1851, the county court, upon motion of the president and directors of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad Company, appointed James Edmondson, John Eakin, James Orr, Michael W. Withers and James K. Lowry commissioners to ascertain a just compensation to the owners of lands upon the line of the proposed railroad through this county. The election at which the question of voting the subscription to the railroad was considered was held on June 1, 1852, a considerable majority of the citizens of the county voting for said subscription. The advocates of the subscription held public meetings at the six precincts in Washington county on the day of the election, at which meetings the following gentlemen addressed the people: follows: Abingdon, Colonel S. E. Goodson. Three Springs, C. F. Trigg. Jones's Mill, J. H. Earnest. Meek's, Dr. N. Snead. Ward's Store, A. C. Cummings. Fleenor's, J. A. Campbell. The county court of this county on the 28th of June, 1852, subscribed, on behalf of the county of Washington, $33,400 for three hundred and thirty-four shares of the stock of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad Company, and appointed William Y. C. White the agent for said county to subscribe said sum in three annual instalments of $11,1331/3 each, and authorized the said agent to issue the bonds of the county payable twenty years after date bearing six per cent. interest from date, and to sell the same for the purpose of paying the subscription to the railroad, the said bonds to bear interest from June 28, 1854. The railroad was completed to the town of Abingdon in the fall of the year 1856. At the February term, 1852, of the County Court of Washington county, Virginia, Green, a slave, the property of Thomas Wilson, was tried, convicted and sentenced to be hung for the murder of Tom, a slave, the property of William Y. C. White, but, by a subsequent order of the court, his sentence was commuted and he was transported from the Commonwealth. In the spring of the same year, Campbell and Benjamin Smith were arrested, and, at the April court, were tried for rape. Campbell Smith was sentenced to be hung, and on the 23d of October, 1852, was executed pursuant to his sentence. An account of the execution is here given: "Campbell Smith, a free negro, was hung yesterday (Friday) near this place, in pursuance of the sentence pronounced upon him by his Honor, Judge Hopkins, at the late term of the Circuit Court for this county. The crime of which Campbell Smith was found guilty was one of so heinous and diabolical a character, committed as it was by two stout negroes, and upon a young respectable white girl, that but little sympathy was manifested for the prisoner by any one present. The culprit himself seemed indifferent to his fate, almost as much as many of those present to witness his execution. He was taken from the jail about twelve o'clock and followed to the place of execution by between 3,000 and 4,000 people. After arriving at the gallows, the Rev. George R. Barr, at the request of the prisoner, engaged in a short and appropriate religious service with him, having previously addressed a few remarks to the large crowd assembled around the gallows. The prisoner stated, through Mr. Barr, that he became religious six years ago, and continued faithful for four years, when in an evil hour, through the influence of intoxicating liquor, he lost the image of his Maker, and now found himself condemned to die for an offense which he told Mr. Barr, had it been committed by another, he would call as loudly as any in the crowd for his execution. He said he died at peace with all the world and trusted in the mercy and forgiveness of the Saviour of the world. He struggled for some time after the wagon was driven from under him. On the 25th of July, 1853, the County Court of Washington county, on behalf of the county, subscribed $4,000 to the old courthouse and Abingdon turnpike, and appointed Jacob Lynch the agent of the county to make said subscription, and on the 23d day of October, 1854, the court subscribed $2,250 to the Abingdon and Pattonville turnpike, and appointed C. S. Bekem the agent of the county to make the subscription. At this time in our history the attention of our public men was, to a great extent, directed to the internal improvement of the country, to the building of turnpikes, MacAdam roads and railroads. At the August term, 1853, of the County Court of this county, Peter C. Johnson, A. C. Cummings, I. A. McQuown, Andrew Edmondson and Washington Bishop were appointed commissioners to run and mark the boundary line between the counties of Washington and Grayson, and in the month of October these commissioners made their report, which was received and recorded on the 29th day of November, 1853. Among the public improvements that attracted the attention of the people of Southwest Virginia, and the one that was of greater importance to this section of Virginia than all others combined, was the Southwestern Turnpike road. On the 28th of January, 1846, the General Assembly of Virginia incorporated the Southwestern Turnpike road, which road was to be a MacAdamized road from Salem, Virginia, by the way of Christiansburg, Newbern, Wytheville, Marion and Abingdon to the Tennessee line, and appropriated seventy-five thousand dollars to carry into effect the object of the act. The said road was to be graded to a width not less than twenty-four feet, and to be MacAdamized to a width not less than twenty-two feet. This act provided for the condemnation of the lands over which the road was to pass, said road to be, at no point, on a grade exceeding three degrees. An engineer, who was also to be superintendent of the road, was to be selected by the president and directors of said company, and it was made the duty of the engineer to make all contracts for the opening and constructing of said road, erecting bridges and whatever else was necessary for finishing the same, but all such contracts were to be approved by the president and directors of said company. The construction of this road was begun during the same year and the work upon the road was carried on with commendable speed until the year 1848. In January of this year, the road had been completed as far as Wytheville, and there was an urgent demand for its immediate completion to the Tennessee line, by the citizens living in the counties of Smyth, Wythe, Washington and Scott, and the General Assembly on the 17th of January, 1848, appropriated the sum of three hundred thousand dollars to complete said road, not exceeding seventy-five thousand dollars of said sum to be expended in any one year. The superintendent and engineer of the Southwestern Turnpike let the contract from Wytheville west to the Tennessee line to William L. Lewis, and this contract was approved by the president and directors of said company in the fall of the year 1848. At the fall session of the General Assembly in the year 1848, and, on the day of the approval of said contract as above stated, E. R. Watson, a member of the General Assembly from Albemarle county, introduced a resolution in the Legislature to suspend the work upon the Southwestern road west of Wytheville. A large majority of the Legislature were in favor of the resolution, but in view of the fact that the Board of Public Works had signed a contract for the construction of this road, the resolution was defeated and work was continued upon the road. Fifty thousand dollars of the public money appropriated for the construction of this road was paid to William L. Lewis, the contractor, but for some reason, which cannot now be explained, the work of constructing said road was delayed, and but little progress was made until the year 1851. The road was surveyed and located to the Tennessee line by the spring of 1850. By an Act of the Assembly adopted on the 29th of March, 1851, it was provided that unless William L. Lewis, the contractor, should complete a section of the road twenty miles west of Wytheville by the first day of April, 1851, it should be the duty of the Board of Public Works within ninety days thereafter to take legal steps upon the bond of the said Lewis and his sureties to recover damages for his default, with the proviso that the sureties of the said Lewis might become undertakers to complete the twenty miles of road according to the tenor of the said contract, and in that case action on the bond of the said Lewis should be suspended for one year. This same Act provided that, should the said William L. Lewis, abandon or forfeit any other portion of his contract for constructing the said road to the Tennessee line, the Board of Public Works were directed and instructed to relet said road to the sureties of the said William L. Lewis. And in the event the said sureties did not become the undertakers of said road under this act, the Board of Public Works should not give the said Lewis any further time to complete his contract, but should, so soon as any part of his contract for constructing said road is abandoned or forfeited, proceed forthwith to relet the same in sections of not more than five miles. As a result of this act, Lewis, or his sureties, completed said MacAdamized road as far west as Seven-Mile Ford in Smyth county, Virginia. Such was the condition of affairs on the 5th day of April, 1851, at which time a resolution was offered by Colonel Hopkins, directing the Board of Public Works to relet said road, to which resolution Mr. Stovall, a member of the Legislature, offered the following substitute: "Resolved, by the General Assembly, That the Board of Public Works be and they are hereby authorized and required to suspend the further construction of the Southwestern Turnpike road, except so much as may be necessary to finish any intermediate sections between the eastern part of said road which has been finished, and the extreme western part of said road upon which the contractors may have commenced work." This substitute was eloquently and energetically opposed by Colonels Hopkins and Imboden, but was adopted by a vote of fifty-two to forty-four, and the friends of the road were unable to obtain a reconsideration of the vote. A number of unsuccessful efforts were made by the friends of this road to have work on the same resumed, but without success. The newspapers of Abingdon charged that Governor Johnson and the Board of Public Works were responsible for the suspension of work upon this road, and Governor Floyd was severely censured for his course in the matter. The road was never completed west of Seven-Mile Ford, and while Southwest Virginia and Washington county have had to bear their portion of the great public debt created for public improvements previous to 1860, they have received no benefit therefrom. The failure to complete this road has been attributed to different causes, among the number being: First. The anticipated construction of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. Second. The principles actuating Governor Johnson and his advisers, which principles were opposed to internal improvements by the Commonwealth and favored a strict construction of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. Third. The indisposition of the representatives from Eastern Virginia to interest themselves in the welfare of Western Virginia. It will be nothing more than an act of justice to this section of Virginia, if the General Assembly of Virginia should yet complete this road. In the year 1855 the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad Company decided to build a branch railway from Glade Spring to Saltville, to be known as the Saltworks Branch, and on the 27th day of February, on motion of the railroad company, the county court appointed William A. Preston, Lewis F. Cosby, Isaac Horne, James Orr and Pleasant Smith commissioners for the purpose of ascertaining a just compensation to the owners of the lands through which the Saltworks Branch would pass. This road was built shortly thereafter and the town of Glade Spring had its beginning. About this time, at the instance of John M. Preston, a number of citizens contributed a sum of money sufficient to MacAdamize the main road leading east from Abingdon to near the railroad crossing at McConnell's Switch. Some evidence of this work is still to be seen. On the 23d of July, 1855, the county court of this county, upon receipt of information of the death of Samuel Logan, who had for Samuel Logan. many years been the very efficient attorney for the Commonwealth in this county, adopted the following resolutions: "Resolved, That in the removal from amongst us of Samuel Logan by an all-wise Providence, this court has been deprived of an able and efficient officer, the members of the bar of a courteous and gentlemanly practitioner, the community of a laborious, able and well-informed lawyer, and his family of a kind and indulgent husband and father. "Resolved, That the court, its officers and the members of the bar extend their warmest sympathies to the bereaved widow and children of the deceased in this most afflicting dispensation of Divine Providence. "Resolved, That these resolutions be entered upon the minutes of the court, and that the clerk furnish a copy thereof to Mrs. Logan, and also to each of the newspapers of Abingdon for publication." Nothing of any importance occurred until November, 1858, at which time John S. Mosby, who had settled in the town of Goodson, qualified to practice law in the courts of this county. The abolition sentiment in the meantime was fast obtaining prominence throughout the Union, and by the fall of the year 1860 excitement was at fever heat, and the feeling between the sections had grown to such an extent that war was inevitable. The Democratic Convention held in this year for the purpose of nominating a candidate for President was not harmonious, and as a result three candidates for President were nominated by three different conventions held by the Democratic party, viz., John C. Breckenridge, John Bell, and Stephen A. Douglas, while Abraham Lincoln was nominated by the Republican party. The campaign preceding the election was exceedingly bitter, and the election resulted in favor of Lincoln and the Republican party. The effect of the election of Lincoln was to create great excitement throughout the South and advocates of secession, peaceable, if possible, by force, if necessary, were heard and applauded throughout the Southern States; but such were not the sentiments of the people of Washington county. Four hundred patriots from the county of Washington had assisted in the erection of the Union. Their descendants long hesitated before lending their assistance to any movement that had for its object the dissolution of that Union and they did not give their consent nor lend their assistance to the movement until President Lincoln called upon the States for seventy-five thousand men to invade and overcome the Southern country. It must not be understood from what is here stated that the people of this county were unanimous in their opposition to secession, for it is a fact that numbers of our citizens were strong advocates of secession from the beginning. War Between the States—1861-1865. In the month of December, 1860, or January, 1861, a volunteer company was organized in Abingdon and was known as the Washington Mounted Riflemen, and the county court of this county, on the 29th of January, 1861, entered an order permitting this company to use and occupy the rooms on the third floor of the courthouse as an armory, and from this time on, during the spring and summer of the year 1861, the sole theme of conversation was the organization of companies of volunteers and preparations for war. At the election for members of the General Assembly in the year 1859 George W. Hopkins and Jacob Lynch were elected to the Assembly from Washington county, and Ben Rush Floyd, of the county of Wythe, was elected to the Senate from this district, but Jacob Lynch soon thereafter became president of the Exchange Bank of Abingdon, Va., resigned his seat in the Assembly, and Dr. A. R. Preston was elected to fill the vacancy. The one subject that engrossed the Assembly at its meeting in the year 1860-1861 was the secession of the Southern States from the Union, and on the 14th of January, 1861, the General Assembly called a convention and directed that an election be held on the 4th day of February, 1861, to select delegates to the convention thus called. This Act directed that the sense of the qualified voters be taken as to whether any action of said convention dissolving the connection of the State with the Federal Union or changing the organic laws of the State should be submitted to the people for ratification or rejection. In other words, the Legislature, by submitting to the voters at this time the last question stated, did so for the purpose of securing their ratification of the action of this convention in advance of any action by the convention. The candidates for the position of delegates to this convention from Washington county were: John A. Campbell and Robert E. Grant opposed to secession, and William Y. C. White for secession. The result of the election held on the 4th of February, 1861, was an overwhelming triumph for Campbell and Grant, the vote in this county being as follows: WASHINGTON COUNTY—Official. WAIT-A-BIT. SECESSION. Precincts. Campbell. Grant. White. Floyd. Ref. No Ref. Courthouse 307 236 154 79 209 92 Clark's Mills 11 9 13 13 10 13 Davis' 36 34 18 16 35 17 Waterman's 121 113 33 30 120 27 Three Springs 173 169 61 60 169 60 Gobble's 83 83 10 9 92 1 Craig's Mill 125 125 4 21 127 1 Worley's 103 92 13 00 105 00 Williams' 48 26 28 4 47 6 Morell's 48 39 39 37 62 14 Fullen's 58 54 32 38 59 34 Matt Clark's 56 19 69 90 50 68 Kelley's 51 50 33 33 52 32 DeBusk's 75 74 17 18 69 19 Arch. Orr's 64 64 41 39 61 43 Miller's 122 119 34 37 119 31 Good Hope 9 7 2 1 9 1 Green Spring 65 62 21 23 66 17 1555 1375 622 529 1551 476 While Governor Floyd was not a candidate, he was voted for in this election, being a strong advocate of secession, and Secretary of War in the cabinet of President Buchanan. It will be observed from an inspection of the returns from this election that the people of the county were overwhelmingly opposed to secession and to permitting the convention to proclaim its action without referring the same to the people. At this time South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama and Georgia had adopted ordinances of secession, and excitement was at fever heat. At the February court following this election a tremendous crowd of people were in Abingdon, and an incident occurred that might, under other circumstances, have definitely fixed the sentiment of the people of this county against secession and have placed this section within the State of West Virginia. A few over-zealous advocates of secession on the morning of the day in question obtained a Confederate flag and placed it upon a rope stretched across Main street from the residence of John D. Mitchell to what is known as the White House, on the south side of the street. When the presence of this flag was observed it greatly enraged the citizens of the county who were opposed to secession, and William B. Clark,* * Grandson of James Hillan. who fought at King's mountain. one of the best and bravest men this county has ever produced, proposed to the anti-secession men present that they immediately tear down what he termed "that d—d rag," saying, "Boys, it is not the flag of our fathers," and immediately proceeded to execute his threat. At the same time the advocates of secession appeared, and war seemed imminent, but by the advice and counsel of Joseph T. Campbell, Judge Campbell, Charles S. Bekem, and others the disturbance was quelled. It is proper to be stated at this point that as soon as Virginia had seceded from the Union and the homes of our people were threatened with invasion, the men who that day proposed to tear down the Confederate flag were the first to enlist in the service of their State, were the bravest in battle and the last to surrender, William B. Clark himself dying in the service of his country. The convention assembled in the city of Richmond on the 13th day of February, 1861, and on the 17th of April, 1861, by a vote of 81 to 51, adopted an ordinance to repeal the ratification of the Constitution of the United States by the State of Virginia, and to resume all the rights and powers granted under said Constitution. This act of the convention was submitted to the people for ratification at an election held on the fourth Thursday of May, 1861, at which election the ordinance of secession was ratified. Washington county voted for the ratification by an overwhelming majority. On the 15th of June, 1861, the convention agreed to a permanent Constitution for the State, but this Constitution, when submitted to the people, was rejected by a small majority, and the Constitution of 1850 remained the fundamental law of the State. The convention that adopted the ordinance of secession elected five gentlemen to represent Virginia in the Confederate Congress, then in session at Montgomery, Alabama, Judge Waller R. Staples being the representative from this section of Virginia. While the delegates from Washington county sent to Richmond were opposed to secession, they afterwards voted in favor of the ordinance of secession in view of the course pursued by President Lincoln and his cabinet. In the month of March President Jefferson Davis formed his cabinet, which was confirmed by the Senate of the Confederate States, and was composed of the following gentlemen: Robert Toombs, C. C. Memminger, L. P. Walker, S. R. Mallory, J. H. Reagan and J. P. Benjamin. On the 24th of December, 1860, the county court of Washington county, upon motion of the president and directors of the Virginia and Kentucky Railroad Company, appointed James L. Davis, L. L. Waterman, John Gobble, Roland T. Legard and William Fields commissioners to ascertain a just compensation to a number of land owners through whose land said road was proposed to be constructed, and these commissioners made their report to the county court on the 24th of February, 1861. This was the inception of the efforts that resulted in the building of the Virginia and Southwestern railroad from Bristol to Big Stone Gap. At the January term of the county court in 1861 the court gave permission to Thaddeus Harris, Samuel Merchant, Barbary Beverly and Senah Richmond, free persons of color, to remain in the county for the space of ninety days for the purpose of settling their business, the authorities having theretofore required all free persons of color to leave the county, but, notwithstanding this provision, many free persons of color remained in the county throughout the entire war by having some responsible white man stand security for their good behavior. At the April term of the court of this county the sum of fifteen thousand dollars was voted by the county court for the purpose of securing necessary supplies for the support, equipment and arming of the volunteer companies of the county, which companies were at that time being formed, and James K. Gibson, William Y. C. White, John W. Johnson, T. G. McConnell, James C. Greenway and Thomas S. Stuart were appointed a committee and authorized to borrow said money and to issue the bonds of the county for the same, said bonds to be paid in one, two and three years, or upon longer time if said committee should think proper. At the May term of the county court the court adopted a plan to police the county for the protection of the citizens, the order of the court being as follows: 1st. The magistracy of this county shall constitute a vigilance committee, who shall be always on the alert and at all times more prompt and active than ever in the performance of their duties under the law in the protection of the rights and interests of the citizens. 2d. The county court shall have control over all measures of home protection and defence. 3d. There shall be a central vigilance committee in each district, composed of four magistrates and two other discreet gentlemen, to be appointed by the court within the bounds of every district. This committee shall have power to direct and dispense all measures of protection and defence within the sphere of their actions, and make a report in writing at least once a month to the county court of all matters worthy of note. 4th. There shall be one or more volunteer companies of not less than forty men within each district to be commanded by a captain and two lieutenants and four sergeants, respectively, which officers shall be selected by the men of the companies and confirmed by the court. Each man shall be armed with his own rifle, musket or shot-gun, or with arms of like character, loaned or furnished him by the citizens of each district from the house, stock or lands or otherwise. In like manner he to furnish or have procured to him a sufficiency of ammunition. The companies shall be divided into two platoons, extending from the center to the extremities of the district as nearly as practicable, and shall act as a general patrol within the proper bounds and under their proper officers at least once a week, performing alternate turns of duty. The company, or companies, of the district shall assemble semi-monthly at some central point, under the command of the captain, for the purpose of drill and instruction. At these meetings a report of the general operations of the company, and especially the condition of things within the districts as regards the peace, security and good order of the ctiizens, shall be made to the captain, and by him reduced to writing and forwarded to the central committee. 5th. The district committee shall have power to order out, when in their opinion deemed necessary, an additional police to act independently of, or in conjunction with, the armed police. 6th. The needy families of all the volunteers absent in the service of the State shall be provided for, and with this view the magistrates of each district shall be appointed by the court a committee whose duty it will be to inquire into the condition and necessities of said families, and provide at once for the same, if necessary, and report in writing to the next and every succeeding county court, and thereupon the proper allowance will be made. 7th. In the event of invasion or for the purpose of suppressing insurrections within the county, this court will at once proceed to appoint a field officer, who shall be empowered to call out and command the voluntary forces provided for, or so much thereof as may in his opinion be deemed necessary for the purpose of repelling such invasions or suppressing such insurrection. The court then proceeded to the appointment of the additional committee under the third clause, and thereupon John L. Bradley and Jacob Neff were appointed in district No. 1; Henry Roberts and Francis Preston, in district No. 2; John Gobble and A. M. Apling, in district No. 3; Jeriel D. Linder and John J. Scott, in district No. 4; Alex. G. Thompson and David M. Stuart, in district No. 5; Benj. K. Buchanan and Robert B. Edmondson, in district No. 6; Andrew Edmondson and James Kelly, in district No. 7; Thomas M. Preston and John Eakin, in district No. 8; Robert L. Berry and Lilburn O. Byars, in district No. 9. The court then unanimously elected James T. Preston colonel or field officer under the seventh clause. A number of muskets had been furnished the county by the State authorities early in the year, and had been distributed throughout the county, but in such a manner as to render them of little value to the authorities, and at the May term of the court the sheriff of the county was directed to collect and deposit them in Abingdon. During the spring and summer of 1861 ten companies were organized in Washington county, which were officered as follows: The Washington Mounted Rifles—Captain William E. Jones. The Mountain Boys—Captain William White. The Glade Spring Rifles—Captain R. P. Carson. Washington Independents—Captain Dr. James L. White. Company B, Forty-eighth Virginia Regiment—Captain Milton White. Company I, Forty-eighth Virginia Regiment Captain James C. Campbell. Company H, Thirty-seventh Virginia Regiment—Captain Robert E. Grant. Goodson Rifle Guards—Captain John F. Terry. Floyd Blues—Captain David C. Dunn. Company F, Forty-eighth Virginia Regiment—Captain D. A. P. Campbell. The Washington Mounted Rifles were sent to First Virginia Cavalry, Stuart's command, while the companies of Captains Terry, Carson, Grant, James L. White and William White formed a part of the Thirty-seventh regiment, commanded by Colonel Samuel V. Fulkerson, and the companies officered by D. A. P. Campbell, James C. Campbell and Milton White formed a part of the Forty-eighth regiment, commanded by Colonel John A. Campbell, of Abingdon, and D. C. Dunn's company formed a part of Floyd's Brigade. Captain A. C. Cummings was commissioned colonel by a committee composed of Governor Letcher, Judge Allen and Francis Smith, in the month of May, 1861, and was ordered to report at once to General Jackson at Harper's Ferry, which he did, and was there assigned to the command of the Second regiment, afterwards the Tenth Virginia regiment, but was soon thereafter placed in command of the Thirty-third Virginia regiment. At the June term of the county court Thomas G. McConnell was appointed by the court to visit all the volunteer companies from this county then in the service of the State or thereafter to be formed, and to provide for their wants out of any money that might be in the hands of the committee appointed by the court at the April term. About this time Charles Eckerbusch was arrested and committed to jail upon the suspicion that he was not true to the institutions of the South, but was discharged by the court upon his taking the following oaths, to-wit: "I declare myself a citizen of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and solemnly swear that I will be faithful and true to the said Commonwealth, and will support the Constitution thereof so long as I continue to be a citizen thereof, so help me God." "I do solemnly swear that I will obey all orders of the legally constituted authorities of the State of Virginia and of the Confederate States, and that I will in no wise give aid and comfort to the enemies of the State or Confederate States either directly or indirectly, so help me God." On Sunday night, September 1, 1861, at about 10 o'clock a collision occurred on the railroad, about one mile west of Abingdon, between trains loaded with troops. The first train, carrying a part of the second regiment of the Polish Brigade from Louisiana, was ascending the grade west of the depot when a shackle pin broke, and the cars descended to the level at the bridge over Wolf creek. At this time the second train, heavily loaded with soldiers, ran into the front section at the bridge, the result being one soldier killed and seventeen wounded, one of the wounded soldiers afterwards dying. The wounded soldiers were removed to the houses of the Rev. James McChain, Messrs. T. G. McConnell, J. M. Ropp, and Judge S. V. Fulkerson, and were attended by Drs. Preston, Barr, Heiskell and Pitts. On the 28th of October, 1861, the county court of this county appropriated an additional sum of $2,500 for the purpose of supplying the volunteers of this county in the service of the Confederate States, and directed the committee theretofore appointed to borrow said sum of money and apply it to the purposes mentioned, At the same term of the court William B. Dickenson was appointed quartermaster for the eastern and John M. Hamilton for the western district of the county, and they were directed to aid the committee appointed by the court in applying the sums above voted to the purposes directed. On Thursday, November 6, 1861, an election was held throughout the Confederate States for President, Vice-President and members of Congress. Jefferson Davis and Alexander H. Stephens had no opposition for the offices of President and Vice-President of the Confederate States of America, but in this district the Hon. Walter Preston, of Abingdon, and the Hon. Fayette McMullen, of Scott county, were opposing candidates. Polls were opened at all the voting precincts in the county, and, in addition thereto, at Camp Dickenson, Camp Cooper and at the Confederate camp at Abingdon, soldiers being stationed in this county at the places mentioned. Preston was elected a member of the Confederate Congress by a considerable majority. On the 25th of March, 1862, the sheriff and his deputies and the commissioners of the revenue were directed to enroll, as soon as possible, all able-bodied free negroes in the county and report the same to the clerk of the court. By this time the families of the absent soldiers were beginning to feel the burden of the war, and a number of the wealthier citizens of the county by voluntary contributions undertook to relieve their situation. The following citizens contributed the sums set opposite their names to this cause: 1862. April 28. Henry Preston, $ 300 00 1862. April 28. Stuart, Buchanan &amp; Co., 1,000 00 1862. Dec. 22. Mrs. Wyndham Robertson, 100 00 1863. Oct. 26. Wyndham Robertson, 500 00 The General Assembly of Virginia, on the 29th of March, 1862, passed an Act authorizing the counties to issue notes of less denomination than five dollars, and the county court of this county, on the 28th of April, 1862, deciding to avail itself of the advantages of this law, appointed a committee, consisting of James K. Gibson, Thomas G. McConnell and William King Heiskell, to ascertain and report to the court, First. A design for said notes. Second. Whether a supply of suitable paper could be procured and on what terms. Third. The terms upon which said notes could be printed and the amount and denomination of the notes necessary to be issued. This committee on the following day made their report, which report was filed, and, upon consideration of said report, the county court ordered that this county issue $15,000 of these notes of the following denominations and amounts: Nine thousand ten-cent notes. Six thousand fifteen-cent notes. Eighteen thousand twenty-five-cent notes. Three thousand four hundred and fifty one-dollar notes. Six thousand fifty-cent notes. Three thousand seventy-five-cent notes. The form of said notes as prescribed by the court is shown by the fac-simile of a one-dollar note and a twenty-five-cent note. John G. Kreger, clerk, whose name appears to said notes, was required by the court to issue the same as soon as practicable, and was appointed treasurer for the purpose of exchanging said notes for other funds to pay the indebtedness of the county. The court, on the 24th of June, directed the clerk not to issue the ten-cent notes as provided for by their former order, but to issue twenty-one thousand six hundred notes of the denomination of twenty-five cents instead of eighteen thousand as provided by their former order, and John G. Kreger, the clerk, on the 24th of February, 1863, was allowed one thousand dollars for issuing and redeeming said notes. On Tuesday, the 4th of April, 1862, a company of Confederate soldiers was organized in Abingdon, to which was given the name of the Abingdon Confederates. This company was officered as follows: Captain, William L. Hunter. First Lieutenant, Milton W. Humes. Second Lieutenant, William McChesney. Third Lieutenant, James H. Smith. This was Company A, and formed a part of the Sixty-third Regiment, Virginia Volunteers. On the 11th day of April, 1862, the Methodist Protestant church and the Protestant Episcopal church of Abingdon delivered the bells used by the respective churches to the ordinance department of the Confederate States for use in manufacturing cannon, and on the 25th of April of the same year the Presbyterian and Methodist Episcopal churches, South, performed a like service. In the spring of the year 1862, the armies of the Confederate States were reorganized, and upon the reorganization of the Thirty-seventh and Forty-eighth regiments Colonels Fulkerson and Campbell, as well as Lieutenant-Colonels Carson and Garnett, were reelected. Major Williams was re-elected in the Thirty-seventh, and Captain James C. Campbell, of Abingdon, succeeded Major Stuart in the Forty-eighth regiment. In the companies there was a considerable change as follows: Captain Grant was succeeded by Sergeant Duff. Captain William White was succeeded by Lieutenant B. P. Morrison. Captain James L. White was succeeded by Captain James Vance and Captain Vance was succeeded by Sergeant T. M. Gobble. Captain Milton White was succeeded by Lieutenant W. Y. C. Hannum. Captain D. A. P. Campbell was succeeded by Lieutenant W. T. Greenway. At the October term of the county court, in the year, 1862, the court appointed agents in the several magisterial districts of this county to solicit subscriptions in their districts of articles of clothing, shoes, etc., for the use of the volunteers in the service of the Confederacy. At this time a great scarcity of salt prevailed in the county as a result of the State authorities taking charge of the salt works, and the county court appointed John N. Humes a committee to correspond with Governor Letcher and seek to have the contract of Stuart, Buchanan &amp; Company, made with the county authorities in July of this year, enforced, but the court obtained no relief in this particular. On the 27th of June, 1862, Colonel Samuel V. Fulkerson, of the Thirty-seventh Regiment, was mortally wounded near Richmond on the second day of the great battle before Richmond, and died the next day. Upon the receipt of the news of his death, a public meeting was held at the courthouse of this county for the purpose of offering a tribute of respect to the memory of the deceased. "On motion, J. N. Humes, Esq., was called to the chair, and William King Heiskell appointed secretary. The object of the meeting was explained by Adjutant Joseph T. Campbell in brief but appropriate remarks, and, on his motion, a committee of ten gentlemen was appointed as an escort of honor to meet the remains at Wytheville. The following gentlemen were appointed: Adjutant J. T. Campbell, Hon. Walter Preston, William King Heiskell, Colonel A. C. Cummings, Thomas G. McConnell, G. V. Litchfield, Jr., William Y. C. White, James C. Greenway, J. G. Kreger and D. M. Stuart." This committee met the remains of Colonel Fulkerson at Wytheville and accompanied the same to Abingdon. Colonel Fulkerson, at the time of his death, was judge of the Seventeenth Circuit of the Superior Court of Law and Chancery, and soon thereafter an election was held in this circuit to fill the vacancy, at which election John A. Campbell, John W. Johnson, William B. Aston and W. P. Cecill, were opposing candidates. Judge Campbell was elected by a considerable majority and served until removed by the military authorities of the United States in the year 1869. In May, 1862, President Jefferson Davis issued his proclamation setting apart the 16th day of May, 1862, as a day of fasting, humiliation and prayer, and, on the day appointed, the several congregations of the town united in regular services at the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, at eleven o'clock in the morning, and at the Methodist Protestant Church at four o'clock in the evening. On the 4th day of October, 1862, in the lower end of this county, on the farm of Colonel John Preston, William McDaniel, a very respectable citizen was brutally murdered by Jerry and Jim, two negroes, the property of James Allen, of Tennessee. These negroes had left their homes and were scouting in the woods, with a lot of stolen property in their possession, when they observed McDaniel approaching. After meeting McDaniel and engaging in a conversation with him, as to what they were doing there, and where they were going, Jack, one of the negroes, struck and seriously wounded McDaniel, and the negroes hid his body until night came on and then returned and carried it to the creek and placed it therein. They were tried, and Jim and Jerry were sentenced to be hung on the 23d of January, 1863, on which day they were executed pursuant to the sentence of the court. The Abingdon paper in describing the scene in Abingdon on that day says: "At an early hour the people began to pour into town from the farthest limits of this and adjoining counties, and from the gorges and coves of the mountains. They came by railroad, in wagons, on horses and mules, and hundreds came wading up to their knees in mud. Some rode bare-back, others on sheep-skins, and again others with halters and blind bridles. Little boys and negroes galloped into town almost breathless, bespattered with mud and wild with excitement to see two negroes choked to death. But stranger still was it to see probably not less than a thousand hearty, robust young men jostling and elbowing their way through the dense mass of humanity towards the field where the scene was to be enacted; and when we saw them working and twisting their tortuous way like so many eels in the mud, we wondered if they would have been as eager and as hurried if there had been a squad of Yankees in that direction. If Stonewall Jackson had them, he would cross the Potomac in a week." This execution took place in the Academy field west of Abingdon and was the last execution of any person in this county for any offense. The Provost-Marshal at Abingdon at this time was Colonel John H. Earnest. In October of this year President Lincoln issued his proclamation emancipating all negroes after the first day of January, 1863, which information greatly excited the slave owners of the county. Some idea of the conditions existing during this time may be gathered from a diary kept by a very aged citizen of Abingdon, from the summer of 1861 to the fall of 1862, which diary is here given. "1861. July 1st. The evening train had about 150 troops; 100 from Arkansas, the balance from Georgia, remnants of companies gone on. "1861. July 2d. At dark I saw the comet for the first time, but it was seen the night before by others. It is the largest I have ever seen; it was high up north of west, at ten o'clock it was large, the tail was broad and appeared to be 250 feet long, the body of it appeared the size of a common hat. "1861. July 3d. The evening train had 200 Arkansas troops. "1861. July 4th. This day eighty-five years ago since the Declaration of Independence of the old U. S. It's gone, and to-day there is another declaration going on for independence, the South against the North, and it must and will end the same way the first declaration did against old England. The South must be independent of the North, her cause is more just, etc. In 1775 there were two parties, one for immediate independence from old England, the other was for no separation from the mother country, as they called it. But independence was declared on the 4th of July, 1776. The party that went for independence of the mother country and fought for it and got it was called Whigs and the party against independence was the Tory party and fought against it, but was defeated; yet they remained Tories, for I can remember hearing one of them in Wythe county when he got drunk, "halloo" for King George, &amp;c. The present revolution for independence and a separation from Northern tyrants, or rather Northern Goths and vandals, against Southern rights is tenfold greater than the first revolution, and in all respects like it, as to the parties Whig and Tory. But I believe it will end just like the first revolution. "1861. July 4th. Cold all day. The evening train took Captain David Campbell Dunn's company to General Floyd's Brigade at Wytheville, seventy-eight men and boys. "1861. July 16th. To-day awful news from General Garnett's command at Beverly, Randolph county. Fulkerson's regiment is part of it. Colonel Fulkerson's regiment is composed of five companies from Abingdon and county, two from Russell, one from Davis and one company from Lee county. The news is that all are killed and taken and that General Garnett is killed. "1861. July 23d. News this morning of a great battle fought on the 21st, last Sunday, at Manassas, between the Southern forces and Lincoln's Northern or black army, in which the latter lost 25,000 men killed, the South 15,000. If this be true it beats Waterloo, for the South had only 60,000, while the North had 95,000. "1861. July 26th. Colonel John A. Campbell's regiment left for Staunton to-day, ten companies, three companies from Washington county, nine companies of old Washington county now in the field. Colonel Campbell has Captain White's and David Campbell's and J. C. Campbell's companies. "1861. August 31. This morning at five o'clock the house trembled and shook, the window sash rattled so much that it awakened all, the rocking of the house awakened me. I never felt such a sensation before, the house appeared to be standing on something, the house would quiver and rattle like it would fall. "1861. September 1st. Two trains at ten o'clock with 1,100 troops, one company of eighty-two from Mobile, Alabama, and the balance from New Orleans, mashed up at the bridge west of Abingdon depot, killing one and wounding twenty odd, the front engine with the conductor cut loose and went on towards Lynchburg, the other engine was mashed up in the wreck, but the engineer and conductor left rather suspiciously. "September 3d. The soldier scalded in the mash up died last night. "1861. September 21st. John M. Preston died this morning at Seven-Mile Ford. "1861. September 24th. Charles G. Preston, son of F. H. Preston, died on the 15th. He belonged to the Greenbrier Cavalry, was in the retreat from Laurel Hill in July last when General Garnett was killed. "1861. September 28th. No trains from the East yesterday, no mail, the rivers were higher yesterday than any one recollects, houses were taken off where never known before. The whole roof of one house was left on the bank of the river below Mr. Cole's on the Middle Fork. The Holston river was six feet higher than ever known before. "1861. October 1st. Part of a company of horse got here last evening from Kentucky. "1861. October 3d. Hon. John C. Breckenridge and William Preston, of Kentucky, got to Abingdon to-day. "1861. October 14th. A company of horse, 111 from Kentucky by way of Pound Gap, got here this evening, all armed with double-barreled shot-guns, under Captain Desha. "1861. October 15. I was wrongly informed as to the arms of the Kentuckians, they have Minnie rifles and muskets, and were a part of the State guard. Three thousand dollars reward for the above-mentioned Captain Desha; his father is here with him. "1861. October 30th. The Kentucky company took the cars for General Buckner's headquarters by way of Nashville, Tennessee, and all took the oath this morning. One of the Kentuckians by accident shot himself through the arm above and below the elbow. "1861. November 13th. This day the Cherokee artillery of Georgia got here from Goldsboro, North Carolina. The train with most of the regiment ran off near Senter depot last night and killed three and hurt several. They have three brass six-pounders and one iron rifled six-pounder. "1861. November 25th.

The balance of the regiment is behind. "N. B.—The above regiment is said to be the Fifty-seventh Virginia, and that a battalion from North Carolina went about the same time after night and stopped at Bristol. "1861. December 8th. There are now at the depot six cannon, two of them rifled, and twenty-four carriages. "1861. December 31st. Mrs. Humes died to-day, General Floyd's Brigade has been going for the last week on the railroad from the Tory mountains of Virginia to Bowling Green, Kentucky. "1862. March 16th. Jacob Lynch died this morning at two o'clock, his brother Daniel died at Estillville, Scott county, the 16th of March, 1843, at 12 o'clock. "1862. May 18th. Adam Hickman died this morning at twenty minutes past nine o'clock, has been in bad health for about ten years. "1862. July 1st. It rained very hard at sundown, just after the train got to the depot with the remains of Colonel Fulkerson, who was shot the evening of the 27th, in the battle below Richmond in a charge on the enemy's battery, which was taken, but the Colonel died the 28th, at twelve o'clock at night. His place cannot be filled in Southwest Virginia, and I doubt if it can be in the State. He was buried July 2d at twelve o'clock. "1862. November 6th. — got home to-day from Kentucky; has been there almost two months; brought a fine Bowie knife of a Union Tory and his cap (tip too) — killed him.

William Fields died the 22d of November, 1862, in the fifty-second year of his age, no better man has lived or died in Washington county. His father died New Year's morning 1829, just such a man." By the fall of the year 1862, the Southern sympathizers living in the State of Kentucky were compelled to leave their homes, and the provisional Governor of that State, after being inaugurated at Frankfort, Kentucky, on the 4th of October, was forced to leave his State and had his headquarters in Abingdon on the 31st of October. In the month of December, 1862, shoes in Abingdon brought from $10 to $12 per pair, boots from $20 to $30 per pair, a pair of jeans pants, $20; a jeans coat, $30 to $40; a bushel of corn, $2.50 to $3; a bushel of wheat, $4; a barrel of flour, $25, and a bushel of sweet potatoes, $5. The people of this county were greatly excited by the invasion of East Tennessee by about fifteen hundred Federal troops under the command of General Carter. At the time, General Humphrey Marshall with his brigade was at Abingdon, and immediately started in pursuit, accompanied by a volunteer company from this county under Lieutenant Warren M. Hopkins. The invaders succeeded in destroying the railroad bridge across the Holston and Watauga rivers and made their escape. In January, 1863, the Governor of Virginia made a requisition upon the authorities of Washington county for one hundred and twenty slaves to work upon the fortifications around Richmond, which request was complied with, after some time. The court directed the sheriff and his deputies to ascertain the number of slaves in the county of all ages and sexes and the number of male slaves between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years. The sheriff and his deputies and the commissioners of the revenue reported, ascertaining the number of slaves in this county to be twenty-seven hundred and eighty-seven, and the number of male slaves between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years to be six hundred and fourteen; thereupon the court directed Tobias Smith, John N. Humes, Abram Mongle and Joseph W. Davis to apportion the one hundred and twenty slaves required from this county, upon the male slaves between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years, and required the slave-holders of the county to deliver his or her quota of slaves to the sheriff of this county at Abingdon, Goodson and Glade Spring on the 21st of February, 1863, and John L. Bradley and Moses Brooks were appointed agents or overseers for such slaves, and Floyd B. Hurt was directed to notify the railroad company of the number of slaves to be sent from this county to Richmond. At the same term of the court an order was entered appointing the Rev. Thomas Catlett agent for the county to proceed to North Carolina to purchase cotton yarn and domestic for the destitute families of soldiers in this county. In the summer of the year 1863, the portion of salt allotted to this county from the Saltworks was distributed among the people by T. G. McConnell, William R. Rhea and Robert C. Allison, in quantities not less than ten bushels and at $2 per bushel. On Thursday evening, the 10th of September, 1863, Rebecca Lynch and Elizabeth Murray, of this county, were under an oak tree near Lynch's Spring on the turnpike at the head of McBroom's mill-dam, with two Confederate soldiers, during a storm. Lightning struck the tree under which they had taken shelter and the four persons were killed. In the fall of the year 1863, Washington county was overrun by stragglers and deserters from the army, claiming to belong to the cavalry service. These men traveled about and over the county in bands of from two to twenty, and robbed the citizens indiscriminately of their money, clothing, horses, saddles, bridles, their grain and forage, by force and actual violence, and such was the condition of affairs that the County Court of Washington county appealed to the General Assembly of the State for a remedy, stating that they had appealed to the military authorities, but without avail. In the fall of 1862 and the spring and summer of 1863 several companies of infantry and cavalry were organized in this county— viz.: Company E, of the Sixty-third Virginia Regiment, Captain David O. Rush; Company F, of the Sixty-third Virginia Regiment, Captain James Snodgrass; Company C, of the Twenty-first Virginia Regiment, Captain R. J. Preston; Company —, Twenty-first Virginia Cavalry, Captain Fred Gray. In the fall of this year another requisition was made upon the county authorities for eighty slaves to work upon the fortifications at Saltville. The county had been threatened with an invasion by the enemy during the fall of the year and had been overrun as before described, and the County Court, at the October, term, petitioned the Governor to exempt this county from the requisition, but their petition was refused and the slaves were furnished early in the year 1864. At the same term of the court an order was entered appointing John Roberts a general agent for the county to purchase supplies for the families of soldiers who were in indigent circumstances, and district agents were appointed in the several districts of the county with authority to purchase supplies for the same purpose and to draw upon John G. Kreger for such sums of money as were needed for the purpose. At the November court, 1863, the districts of the commissioners of revenue for the county were designated, pursuant to an Act of Assembly, the Western District being No. 1, and the Eastern District No. 2. By December, 1863, the condition of affairs was such that the people of the county were threatened with a famine for bread, and the County Court entered an order calling the attention of the Confederate authorities at Richmond to the condition of affairs in this county and asking their aid in every legitimate way to prevent any further appropriation of the means of the people of this county to the support of the army. On the 16th of September, 1863, a company was organized at Abingdon for home defence. This company was officered as follows: Captain, Peter C. Johnson. First Lieutenant, Joseph T. Campbell. Second Lieutenant, Charles F. Keller. Third Lieutenant, W. R. Trigg. A full complement of sergeants and corporals were appointed and Saturday was fixed as the day for drilling. This was the second company organized for home defence in the town, the first company having been organized on the 22d of June, 1863, and was officered as follows: A. C. Cummings, captain. John A. Campbell, first lieutenant. G. V. Litchfield, second lieutenant. Charles F. Keller, first sergeant. James L. Davis, second sergeant. Henry Roberts, third sergeant. John Leach, fourth sergeant. James A. King, fifth sergeant. James S. Munsey, first corporal. These two companies undertook the protection of this community upon ordinary occasions and discharged their duties well. In the spring of this year, Colonel William E. Peters was elected to represent this district in the Senate of Virginia, while Colonel A. C. Cummings and Captain George Graham were elected to represent the county in the House of Delegates, but, in the fall, Colonel Peters resigned his position as a member of the Senate of Virginia, and Colonel Joseph J. Graham, of Wythe, was elected to fill the vacancy. The threatened invasion by the Federal troops from the West was so imminent that on the 16th of October, 1863, Abingdon was honored with two major and six brigadier-generals—to-wit: Ransom, Samuel Jones, Corse, Wharton, Williams, W. E. Jones, Jackson and Crittenden. By January 1, 1864, this county had furnished at least two thousand men, nearly all volunteers, to the army of the Confederate States, and had been subjected to the necessity of having quartered on them large numbers of troops, and provisions and forage were scarcer in the county than they had been for many years. Serious apprehensions were felt that the poor of the county and the families of soldiers would suffer. During the fall of 1863, the brigades of Generals Corse, Jones and Wharton were encamped near Abingdon for more than a month, and had consumed large quantities of provision and forage. There were at this time about one thousand sick and wounded soldiers in the three hospitals in the county. But, notwithstanding the situation of the people of the county, in the month of March, 1864, officers were impressing in the lower end of this county all provisions to be found except five bushels of grain and fifty pounds of beef or bacon to each adult of the family, and one-half the quantity for those under fourteen years of age, for use by General Longstreet's forces, and by the summer of this year, wheat sold at $30 per bushel and corn at $24. It seems that such a condition of affairs would have been unbearable, but such was the patriotism and loyalty of our people to their Commonwealth, that they, with but little hesitation, furnished the officers of the Confederate government the greater portion of all the grain and provision that they could possibly secure. General Buckner and General Morgan were both in Abingdon on the first of April, 1864. A portion of General Morgan's Brigade were encamped for a few days near our town. On the 5th day of February, 1864, a young man by the name of Jacob Mullens, of Wise county, Virginia, was shot by order of Colonel Prentiss, in West Abingdon, at the location of the colored graveyard. Mullens had deserted from his company and joined the enemy. The Abingdon paper in speaking of Mullens says: "He was an exceedingly ignorant young man, almost a heathen, having never read the Bible, nor heard it read until after his conviction, and never heard a sermon in his life. The chaplain of the post and several other ministers here gave him the benefit of their counsel and consolation, and he seemed to be penitent. He was greatly affected on the day of his execution, but exhibited a good deal of firmness and composure after arriving at the place of execution. He was sitting upon his coffin with his fingers in his ears when the order to fire was given. He expired almost immediately, five balls having pierced his breast."* * "Abingdon Virginian." This is but one instance of the many that happened during the war, such executions being necessary to enforce discipline and to render the armies of the Confederacy effective. The first day of April, 1864, was set apart as a day of humiliation, fasting and prayer throughout our Southland, and that day was observed by all our people. On the same day James K. Gibson resigned his office as Confederate States Depositary at Abingdon, and Floyd B. Hurt was appointed his successor. The County Court at its April term, 1864, directed that $50,000 be levied upon the county to buy grain in Georgia or elsewhere to be distributed among the poor and the families of soldiers who were in indigent circumstances in this county, and Aaron L. Hendricks was appointed to purchase the said corn and have it conveyed to this county, and committees were appointed in each of the magisterial districts of the county to solicit subscriptions and relieve the sufferings of the people as far as possible. The County Court at this time had on hand six hundred and eighty bushels of salt, which was much more valuable than the Confederate currency and county scrip, and the court directed Jonas S. Kelly to convey this salt to Tennessee and exchange the same for corn, to relieve the suffering families of the soldiers of this county. The indebtedness of Washington county on the 23d of May, 1864, was ascertained to be $53,648.66. To add to the sufferings of the people of the county, small-pox in a dangerous form appeared in the vicinity of Abingdon, producing a great deal of uneasiness among the people. On the 3d day of September, 1864, General John H. Morgan, who had been of great service to the people of this county, was foully murdered at the residence of Mrs. Dr. Williams in Greenville, Tennessee. He was betrayed by a young Mrs. Williams, who had left her home upon the coming of General Morgan, and informed the Federal troops of the whereabouts of General Morgan and the number of guards on duty, and on Sunday morning the 3d, the house where General Morgan was sleeping was surrounded by Federal troops, and in attempting to escape General Morgan was shot through the right breast and killed, his body thrown across a horse and paraded through the streets of the town. On Monday night the remains of General Morgan arrived at Abingdon, and were taken to the residence of Judge Campbell in the vicinity,* * Acklin, home of Mr. Mingea. where Mrs. Morgan with one or two relatives were sojourning. On Tuesday evening at 4 o'clock, funeral services were performed by Chaplain Cameron, and the procession formed by General George B. Crittenden. It was the largest and most imposing procession of the sort ever seen in this part of the country. The order was as follows: 1st. Hearse, with the body and guards on each side, without arms. 2d.

As the sun went down behind dark masses of clouds in the West, emblematic of the sorrow and gloom that pervaded the vast concourse in attendance, all that was mortal of the immortal John H. Morgan was consigned to the rest of the tomb, there to sleep, unmindful of the clash of arms and the terrible tread of armies, until the trump that marshals the buried millions shall break his slumbers. The remains of General Morgan were interred in Sinking Spring Cemetery, but were subsequently removed to his home in Kentucky. General Morgan was succeeded in his command by General Duke, of Kentucky, but from this time forward the people of this county were without hope and calmly awaited the inevitable. The subscription price of the "Abingdon Virginian," at this time was $8 per year. BATTLE OF SALTVILLE. Major-General Burbridge, in command of about five thousand Federal troops, at this time entered Virginia by way of Pikeville, Kentucky, and proceeded up the Big Sandy and crossed the mountains into Tazewell county at Richlands. At the same time General Gillem, at the head of a considerable force of Federal troops, was making every effort to enter Virginia from East Tennessee, but the progress of Gillem was greatly retarded by the efforts of General Vaughan, who was in command of a considerable body of Confederate troops in that section. It was known that the destination of General Burbridge and General Gillem was the Saltworks in this county, and the reserves of this county (being boys under seventeen and men over forty-five years of age) were called upon to organize for the purpose of defending their homes, and, by the 30th day of September, four companies were ready for service under the command of Colonel James T. Preston, as follows: Company I, Captain Thomas Patterson. Company C, Captain William B. Campbell. Company E, Captain John W. Worley. Company F, Captain William Barrow. A portion of these companies were organized some time previous to this time. At the same time, General Vaughan with his forces was ordered to Saltville from East Tennessee, where he had, until this time, successfully opposed the advance of General Gillem's Brigade. When it was known that General Vaughan had been ordered to Saltville, such a stampede as occurred among the people of this section had never before been witnessed in this county. The roads were crammed and blocked with cattle, sheep, negroes, wagons, buggies and great numbers of citizens with their families. The scene was almost indescribable, and Abingdon was deserted, with the exception of a very few old men, women and children. About seven hundred reserves had gathered at Saltville under the command of Colonel Robert Smith, of Tazewell; Colonel Robert Preston, of Montgomery; Colonel James T. Preston, of Washington, and Colonel Kent, of Wythe. Colonel Robert Trigg, of the Fifty-fourth Virginia Regiment, being at Saltville at that time, took charge of this force and was actively engaged in organizing it when General A. E. Jackson arrived and took command and began to plan the defences of the place. General Burbridge had followed the State road from Kentucky into Tazewell county and from Richlands directed his course by Cedar Bluff toward the Saltworks. Giltner's Brigade, composed of the Fourth Kentucky, Johnson's Battalion, Jenkin's Battalion, Clay's Battalion, the Tenth Kentucky Cavalry and the Sixty-fourth Virginia Regiment, met Burbridge's army at Cedar Bluff, and from that point disputed his advance at every opportunity from the 30th day of September until he had passed Laurel Gap in Clinch mountain on Saturday, October 1, 1864. This brigade of Confederate troops was composed of probably the best soldiers in the Confederate army and numbered about twelve hundred men. They not only assailed Burbridge's army at every opportunity, but cut trees across the road and placed every obstruction in the way that could be thought of to retard the progress of the Federal army through Tazewell county, and, notwithstanding the superior forces commanded by Burbridge, the Federal army was unable to pass through the Laurel Gap in Clinch mountain for more than a day. When Giltner's Brigade had, by superior strength, been driven from the Laurel Gap, it was divided into two sections of about equal numbers, the first section passing down the Poor Valley road destroying bridges and obstructing the road in every possible way. This force was commanded by Dr. E. O. Guerrant, of Giltner's staff, and Colonel Pryor, of the Fourth Kentucky, while the second section crossed the river and followed the Valley road to Saltville, and was under the command of Colonel H. L. Giltner. Colonel Giltner expected Burbridge with his army to march to the Saltworks that night, and if he had, the capture of the works would have been inevitable, but, to the surprise of the Confederate forces, Burbridge's army went into camp in the bottom on the south of Laurel Gap and remained until the following morning, Sunday, October 2, 1864. The Federal forces began their march to Saltville and arrived on the north side of the river near Governor Saunder's residence between nine and ten A. M. of that day, and in the meantime and on the morning of the same day, General John S. Williams, of Wheeler's Cavalry, arrived at Saltville, with his division, which was composed of Robertson's Brigade, of soldiers from Texas, Dibrell's Brigade and the Ninth Kentucky Cavalry commanded by Colonel William C. P. Breckenridge. The Confederate forces at Saltville at this time were as follows: Colonel H. L. Giltner's Brigade, composed of the Fourth Kentucky, commanded by Colonel Pryor; Tenth Kentucky, commanded by Colonel Edwin Trimble; Johnson's Battalion, Kentucky troops; Clay's Battalion, Kentucky troops; Jenkins' Battalion, Kentucky troops; the Sixty-fourth Virginia Regiment, commanded by Colonel A. L. Pridemore; Brigadier-General John S. Williams' Brigade, composed of Robertson's Brigade, commanded by General Robertson; Dibrell's Brigade, commanded by General George Dibrell; Ninth Kentucky Cavalry, commanded by Colonel William C. P. Breckenridge; First Kentucky, commanded by Colonel Griffith; the Thirteenth Battalion of Virginia reserves, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Smith, of Tazewell county, the ranking colonel then present. This battalion was composed of the following companies: Company A, Smyth county, commanded by Lieutenant James Golahon. Company B, Tazewell county, commanded by Captain Samuel L. Graham. Company C, Washington county, commanded by Lieutenant J. S. Booher. Company D, Smyth county, commanded by — Anderson. Company F, Washington county, commanded by Captain William Barrow. Company G, Russell county, commanded by Captain A. P. Gilmer. Company H, Tazewell county, commanded by Captain George E. Starnes. Company I, Washington county, commanded by Captain Thomas E. Patterson. Company E, Washington county, commanded by Captain Henry B. Roberts, was on duty at Abingdon, and did not reach the battleground until about sundown of October 2d. Kent's Battalion, commanded by Colonel Kent and Major Hounshell, of Wythe. This battalion was composed of several companies of militia from Wythe, Carroll and Grayson counties; the officers' names I do not know. The forces at Saltville were under command of General A. E. Jackson until about 9:30 of the morning of the day of the battle, when he was succeeded by General Williams, who arrived at that time, and took command of all the forces then at Saltville. General Williams began his preparations for the battle and arranged his forces as follows: Colonel James T. Preston, with one hundred and twenty reserves, was directed to form a skirmish line along the river and to defend the ford one-half a mile above the lower works. The line of battle was formed from right to left on the south side of the river, the right wing of the army fronting the residence of Governor Saunders, the forces being arranged in the following order: To the north of the road and on the extreme left the First Kentucky, Colonel Griffith, and, in the order named, to the right, the Ninth Kentucky Cavalry, Colonel William C. P. Breckenridge, Giltner's Brigade, as follows: Fourth Kentucky, Colonel Pryor; Johnson's Battalion, Colonel Thomas Johnson; Jenkins' Battalion, Captain Jenkins; Clay's Battalion, Colonel Clay; Sixty-fourth Virginia Regiment, Colonel A. L. Pridemore; Tenth Kentucky, Colonel Edwin Trimble—this last regiment defending the ford. To the south of the road and facing Governor Saunders' residence, in the order named, the Thirteenth Battalion of Virginia Reserves, Colonel Ro. Smith; Kent's Battalion, Colonel Kent; Robertson's Brigade, General Robertson, and Dibrell's Brigade, General George Dibrell—this last brigade forming the extreme right of the army, while the artillery under the command of Captain John W. Barr, was placed on Church Hill, north of the public road near the position occupied by the First Kentucky and in a position that commanded the advance of the enemy. William King's Battery was to the south of Robertson's Brigade and south of the ridge, and did not have an opportunity to take part in the battle. The Federal forces were partly on the north side of the river and partly south of the river and east of Dibrell's Brigade. Such was the position of the opposing forces when an overwhelming force of Federal troops, colored soldiers, assaulted Dibrell's Brigade, which brigade retired to the west side of Cedar creek, and had every advantage of the attacking forces. A part of Kent's Battalion of Reserves commanded by Major Hounshell and stationed east of and near to Governor Saunders' house, thinking that Dibrell's Brigade were acting in a cowardly manner and not being themselves accustomed to war, refused to leave their position and for some time and without any assistance maintained the contest against overwhelming numbers, suffering the loss of a number of excellent men, Major Hounshell himself exhibiting a bravery never excelled, but after some time this force was induced to retire to the west side of Cedar creek, and at this point the battle began in earnest, and in a few moments the colored regiment was repulsed with great numbers killed, Colonel Dibrell's Brigade being especially effective in mowing down the advancing enemy. About the time of the attack on Dibrell's Brigade the Federal troops attempted to force the ford at the position occupied by the Tenth Kentucky, and the right wing of Colonel Giltner's Brigade, notwithstanding the fact that they fought with determined bravery, were gradually pressed back a short distance from their position by a whole brigade of the enemy commanded by Colonel Hanson, and every field officer of the Tenth Kentucky was killed or wounded at this time. Colonel Trigg, seeing the situation of Giltner's Brigade, detached two companies from Kent's Battalion, Wythe and Carroll companies, and sent them forward under the command of Colonel Kent to reinforce Colonel Giltner. The two companies thus sent to the assistance of Colonel Giltner were soon in the thickest of the fight and lost twenty-four men, including Captain Shockley and First Lieutenant Bolt of the cavalry company. The artillery, under command of Captain Barr, did very effective work. The reserves under the command of Colonel Robert Smith, Colonel Robert Preston and Colonel Kent, were in the thickest of the fight, and their gallantry and bravery upon this occasion were highly commended at the time and have since been the pride of all the citizens of Southwest Virginia. The force commanded by Colonel James T. Preston was attacked at about two o'clock by a brigade of infantry and a regiment of cavalry under Colonel Charles Hanson, but held their position from two o'clock in the afternoon until dark, with the assistance of about one hundred men from the Tenth Kentucky Regiment. About one-half an hour before dark, Colonel Hanson, who commanded the enemy's forces, was wounded and thereupon withdrew. The battle lasted from ten o'clock in the morning till sundown of the same day, and resulted in the precipitate retreat that night of General Burbridge to Kentucky by the road that he had come, hotly pursued by the Confederate forces. The forces engaged in this battle were, according to the official report of General Burbridge, four thousand eight hundred picked troops on the Federal side, while not more than three thousand men, including the reserves, were on the Confederate side. The Federal loss in killed and wounded in this battle was about three hundred and fifty, the number of prisoners captured is variously estimated at from three to twelve hundred. The Federals left dead upon the field one hundred and four white and one hundred and fifty-six negro soldiers. The Confederate loss was eight killed and fifty-one wounded, among the killed being Colonel Trimble and Lieutenant Crutchfield, of the Tenth Kentucky Regiment. General John C. Breckenridge, who was in command of this department at that time, reached the field of battle about sun-down, and General Vaughan, who had made a forced march from East Tennessee, with his own and Duke's and Cosby's Brigades, reached the field of battle just as the enemy began to withdraw and in time to hear the shout of victory given along the lines of this gallant army of Confederate soldiers. It was thought at the time that the bravery exhibited in this contest by the reserves from Southwest Virginia was equal to the bravery exhibited by the citizens of this county at King's mountain in 1780. General Burbridge was not only hotly pursued by the victorious forces, but he was assailed at all points upon his retreat, and escaped into Kentucky with great loss. This victory, if it could have been the fortune of our country to take advantage of it, as did our forefathers of the battle of King's mountain, might have turned the tide of the war and won for the South her independence. But the condition of our country at this time was hopeless. The greater portion of the South had been overrun by the Federal forces, and the armies of the Confederacy were starving and naked, while the families of the soldiers with the greatest difficulty kept starvation from the door. The County Court of this county at the November term, 1864, appropriated $10,000 to be used for this purpose. The last call for troops was made by the Confederate States in the month of November, and met with a hearty response from our authorities, but, as the county was about drained of its male population, the court of this county petitioned the Secretary of War of the Confederate States to exempt from this call two to four men in each of the nine districts of the county, blacksmiths, wagonmakers, coffin-makers, shoemakers, tanners, one physician, and one miller. The names of the men thus asked to be exempted were furnished to the Secretary of War and entered of record by said court. General Burbridge, shortly after his return to Kentucky, united his forces with those of Generals Stoneman and Gillem, making an army of at least ten thousand men, and again began the march for Southwest Virginia. The people of this county were informed of the movements of the Federal troops, but were so reduced by the poverty and want that surrounded them upon all sides and the almost total absence from the county of men able to bear arms, that the march of the Federal troops met with but little resistance. The people were expecting the arrival of the Federal troops for several days preceding the 14th day of December, 1864, and on the evening of the 14th at about nine-thirty o'clock, the report of the guns of the Federal pickets was heard at the western outskirts of Abingdon. A part of General Duke's command of Confederate soldiers was encamped at the farm of James A. Bailey, a few miles northeast of Abingdon, and a number of soldiers from that camp were in Abingdon at the time the fire of the Federal pickets was heard. These soldiers undertook to delay the Federals in entering the town, but a company of the Federal troops advanced up Main street, firing at intervals, and when they had reached a point opposite the residence of S. N. Honaker, a discharge from their guns in the direction of the court-house caused Duke's men, who had formed a line at the intersection of Court and Main streets to rapidly disperse in the direction of their camp at Bailey's. General Stoneman, after taking possession of the town, passed on rapidly in the direction of the Lead Mines, having directed the burning of the Virginia and Tennessee depot, Hurt's store, Sinon's wagon-shop, Musser's wagon-shop, the county jail and the barracks opposite the jail, at the corner of Court and Valley streets. All of the places thus burned were occupied by the officials of the Confederate States and in all of them were stored Confederate supplies. The Federal commander issued orders forbidding the troops to enter private houses or to plunder or burn any portion of the town other than the places mentioned. A number of Federal soldiers and stragglers remained at a blacksmith shop in the east end of the town on the morning of the 15th for the purpose of having their horses shod. A company of Confederate soldiers numbering about twenty men, being a part of Colonel Lee's regiment from Mississippi, had become detached from their regiment and were following in the rear of Stoneman's army, capturing, plundering and harassing the enemy to as great an extent as possible. This company reached Abingdon some time during the night of December 14th, and encamped on the Glebe land back of the reservoir, and early on the morning of the 15th, sent one of their number disguised in Federal uniform into the town to see what was going on. About the time this messenger reached Abingdon, a straggler from the Federal army by the name of James (Tites) Wyatt, who had been reared in this community and had served as an apprentice to Gabriel Stickley, rode into town, dressed in Federal uniform, and declared his purpose to burn the town, because, as he said, "Noble I. McGinnis, a prominent citizen of the town and a member of the County Court, had some time previous to the war, punished him for an offence of which he was not guilty." He dismounted in front of the court-house, had a negro to hold his horse, went to the cupola of the court-house and set it on fire. He then remounted and proceed to fire all the buildings on the south side of Main street, riding into the buildings and firing them as he went. After he had partially completed his work, he halted his horse at the intersection of Main and Court street, in front of the store now kept by Nidermaier &amp; Barbee, put his leg across the horn of the saddle and watched the fire as it rapidly devoured the buildings on either side of the street. He would not permit any one to extinguish the flames. In the meantime the messenger from the camp of the Confederate soldiers had returned and reported the presence in the town of the Federal soldiers at John G. Clark's blacksmith shop, and the firing of the town by Wyatt. While Wyatt was occupying the position last stated, this company of Confederate soldiers, partially disguised in Federal uniform, were seen rapidly galloping down the hill fronting Jackson Institute, and from that point they began to disperse, a part of the soldiers turning to the right and to the left at Hayes and Slaughter streets. After passing Slaughter street, two of the number kept up Main street, the others following Valley and Water streets to the east end of the town. The two that came up Main street were named John and Samuel Findlay, and were from Holly Springs, Miss. When they had reached a point near the residence of N. K. White, Samuel Findlay asked a number of boys as to the whereabouts of the man who was firing the town. In answer, a boy by the name of Deady pointed out Wyatt at the corner of Main and Court streets. Thereupon Findlay began to fire upon him, and Wyatt began to call to Findlay that he was shooting at his own men, but Findlay continued to fire, and Wyatt, getting himself in position, rushed his horse by the Findlays, going toward the west end of the town. Samuel Findlay thereupon turned his horse and pursued Wyatt to Hayes street, when Wyatt's horse turned to the left and Wyatt fell to the ground, mortally wounded. Findlay captured Wyatt's horse, and soon joined his fellows in the east end of the town. John Findlay did not halt his horse as he passed Wyatt at the court-house, but rapidly proceeded to the east end of town. Before he had reached the intersection of the street at Webb's store, the Federal troops at Clark's blacksmith shop had been charged by the Confederate soldiers that came down Valley street, and Findlay joined in the pursuit One of the Federal soldiers, beyond question a brave man and bolder than the rest, turned in his saddle as he started east from Webb's store and deliberately fired upon his pursuers, and, as a result he was shot from his horse near the residence of A. B. Trigg, the horse making its escape. The Confederate soldiers thereupon returned to Abingdon. The fire started by Wyatt consumed all the buildings, including the courthouse, on both sides of Main street from the Court street to Brewer's street. This account of the circumstances attending the burning of Abingdon was given me by an eye-witness of the transaction.* * W. H. Mitchell. The Federal troops continued their march to the Lead Mines in Wythe county, which they destroyed, and from that point they returned to Seven-Mile Ford and thence to the right to Saltville. When they had reached Saltville, some slight resistance was offered by a number of Confederate soldiers and reserves who were at the place at that time, but the town was easily captured and the works destroyed. The particulars of the last visit of the Federal troops to Saltville it is impossible to obtain at this time, as all newspaper plants in this country had been destroyed previously thereto, and the accounts given by persons present at the time are so conflicting and unreliable that I do not undertake to state the facts. On the 29th of December, 1864, the County Court of this county appointed Peter J. Branch, John G. Kreger, Joseph T. Campbell and James Fields, a committee to procure suitable rooms for a courthouse and clerk's office, and to report at that term of the court. On the same day this committee reported that they had procured Dunn's store-house, (now the old Arlington Hotel), for one year, at the price of $1,500. This report was accepted by the court and the committee before named were directed to proceed at once and have said building fitted up in a proper manner for the courthouse and clerk's office, and the jail of Smyth county was adopted as the jail of Washington county. Dunn's storehouse, at the time, was occupied by Captain J. G. Martin, commandant of the military force at this place, as a guard house, and he declined to surrender possession to the committee appointed by the County Court, which fact the committee reported to the court, and the court at its January term, 1865, issued a rule against Captain Martin, summoning him to appear before the court at once, and show cause why he should not surrender the possession of the building to the court. This rule was issued, and Captain Martin appeared before the court and answered that he had made a report to Major-General Breckenridge and had received a communication from Adjutant J. Stoddard Johnston directing him to hold possession of the rooms, and that he intended to obey the order, and immediately retired to an adjoining room and ordered his guard under arms, some of whom went into court with arms in their hands. The court evidently thought that this action was taken to intimidate the court, for thereupon an order was entered referring the matter to the Governor of the Commonwealth, requesting that a sufficient force be ordered out by the Governor to enforce the order of the County Court of this county. Nothing more of importance occurred in this county until the close of the war in the following April. This county, in addition to furnishing more than three thousand soldiers to the armies of the Confederate States, produced a number of officers who won distinguished honors in their several spheres, among them being Generals Joseph E. Johnson, John B. Floyd, William E. Jones, William Y. C. Humes, John S. Preston and Colonels John S. Mosby, Samuel V. Fulkerson, John A. Campbell, John F. Terry, R. P. Carson, A. C. Cummings, D. C. Dunn, Connally F. Lynch, James W. Humes, Abram Fulkerson and many others, all of whom were citizens of this county by birth or by choice. The Confederate officers stationed in Abingdon during the war, so far as I can ascertain, were M. B. Tate, William Rodefer and E. Crutchfield, quartermasters; R. A. Williams and Francis Smith, commissaries; John H. Earnest, D. B. Baldwin and J. G. Martin, provost marshals; James K. Gibson and Floyd B. Hurt, Confederate States depositaries. A hospital was maintained in the White House, opposite the residence of Mrs. John D. Mitchell, during the greater part of the war, and Dr. Lightfoot, of Kentucky, was the principal surgeon in charge, in 1864. The wounded soldiers at this hospital were attended by Drs. Barr, Heiskell, Pitts and Preston, and received every attention possible from the ladies of the town. The close of the war found the people of this county in as deplorable a condition as could be imagined—without money, credit, clothing or the wherewithal to eat, with hundreds of wounded and disabled soldiers, their farm houses, fences, and farming utensils destroyed, and with grave apprehensions as to the future. RECONSTRUCTION, 1865-1870. Upon the surrender of the Confederate armies, the people of Virginia accepted the situation in good faith and were ready and willing to resume their former position in the Union and to loyally discharge all the duties imposed thereby. The victors in this contest had insisted that the one object in view was the preservation of the union of the States, and the people of Virginia supposed that it was their duty to proceed with their government as formerly, and did not anticipate any interference therewith from the victors. The people of Washington county, pursuant to the proclamation of Governor Pierpont, held an election for county officers in this county on the 3d day of August, 1865, at which election David C. Cummings was elected clerk of the circuit court and James C. Campbell clerk of the county court of this county, and Rees B. Edmondson Commonwealth's attorney; James Fields, sheriff; Commissioners of the Revenue, District No. 1, John F. Terry; District No. 2, D. A. P. Campbell and members of the county court, constables, and overseers of the poor. Soon after this election the attorney-general of the State gave it as his opinion that all persons who had held office under the Confederate States Government were ineligible to office, and as a result a number of officers elected in July were compelled to resign in the latter part of this year. The county court thus elected held several meetings and transacted some business of importance. This court, on the 28th of August, 1865, took into consideration the building of a new jail and courthouse for this county. James Fulcher, William C. Edmondson and Joseph W. Davis were appointed a committee to contract for the erection of the new county jail, while John A. Campbell, Newton K. White and W. W. Blackford were appointed a committee to ascertain on what terms a courthouse and clerk's office could be erected upon the public square; and on the same day the court proceeded to classify the justices for the performance of their duties in court. Governor Pierpont, by proclamation, appointed John N. Humes and Charles J. Cummings commissioners to reorganize the government of the county, and pursuant to this authority they administered the oaths of office required by law to the members of the county court. Governor Pierpont, acting upon the opinion of the attorney-general, ordered new elections to be held in the counties of the State to fill the vacancies occasioned by the resignation of all county officers who had held Confederate commissions. The county court, on the 26th day of September, 1865, directed the commissioners of election of this county to hold an election in said county on Thursday, the 12th day of October, 1865, for the election of a representative in the Congress of the United States, a member of the Senate, members of the House of Delegates, and to take the vote of the electors upon the question, "Shall the next General Assembly be clothed with power to alter or amend the third article of the Constitution according to law?" In this election Daniel Hoge, of Montgomery county, Edmund Longley and Thomas J. McCulloch, of Washington county, were candidates for Congress, the election resulting in favor of Daniel Hoge. Joseph W. Davis was elected to the State Senate, and Charles S. Bekem and Josiah Teeter were elected to the House of Delegates, and a considerable majority was given in favor of clothing the General Assembly with power to alter or amend the third article of the Constitution. The Congress of the United States and the General Assembly of Virginia assembled in December of this year. Daniel Hoge was not permitted to take his seat in Congress, and Virginia was deprived of representation in the Congress of the United States from this time until January 24, 1870. But the representatives from this county in the Senate and House of Delegates were permitted to take their seats, and the business of the General Assembly proceeded without interruption. Governor Pierpont, pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution, adopted for the State at Alexandria, Virginia, nominated Judge John A. Campbell to preside over this circuit, which nomination was confirmed by the Legislature on the 22d of February, 1866, Judge Campbell receiving the unanimous vote of the General Assembly. Rees B. Edmondson, James Fields and John F. Terry were compelled to resign the offices to which they were elected, and at a special election held on January 11, 1866, Rees B. Edmondson was elected Commonwealth's attorney, James L. Campbell sheriff, and Ben C. Clark commissioner of the revenue in District No. 1. At the November term, 1865, of the county court of this county, orders were entered letting to contract the building of a new jail and directing the fitting up of the Temperance Hall for the use of the court until a new courthouse could be built, and the court was held in the Temperance Hall from the spring of the year 1866 until the year 1868. The action of the court in occupying the Temperance Hall was authorized by proclamation of Governor Pierpont in the month of October, 1866. The government of the county as thus reorganized was in the hands of the best citizens of the county, men who in nearly every instance had been active supporters of the Government of the Confederate States. In the month of December, 1865, York A. Woodward, first lieutenant Twenty-fourth V. R. C., assistant superintendent Eighth District of Virginia, arrived in Abingdon for the purpose of organizing the Freedmen's Bureau. His district was composed of the counties of Washington, Russell, Buchanan, Wise, Scott and Lee. He established his headquarters at Abingdon and had his office in the Swedenborgian Temple on Main street, but subsequently his office was removed to the courthouse by permission of the county court. The Freedman's Court for Washington county was organized at the December term of the county court of this county, and was constituted as follows: Lieutenant, York A. Woodward, of the Freedman's Bureau; John N. Humes, Esq., selected by the county court; Colonel D. C. Dunn, selected by the freedmen. This court held weekly sessions, commencing Saturday morning of each week at 9 o'clock. The purpose of this court was to determine all matters of difficulty, civil and criminal, that arose between the whites and the freedmen, to take a census of the freedmen in the district, to celebrate the rites of matrimony between freedmen and freedwomen and to require all the able-bodied freedmen and freedwomen to enter into written contracts for their services and to see that the contracts were faithfully observed by both parties. The organization of schools for the instruction of freedmen and freedwomen was also undertaken by this court. In this year a white man, by the name of Parks, and his wife came to Abingdon at the instance of the Freedmen's Bureau and for some time conducted a school for colored children in the building now occupied by the colored Masons of Abingdon, on the south side of Water street, the land having been purchased for the purpose, Colonel D. C. Dunn, of his own volition, contributing one-half the cost. The object sought to be obtained by the Freedmen's Bureau was accomplished to a great extent in this community, and the conduct of Captain Woodward was such as to command the respect of all good citizens. Captain Woodward remained in Abingdon for some time and was succeeded by Captain Sherwood. Upon his departure the Abingdon Virginian said: "The people of Abingdon and Washington county will regret to hear of the transfer, as the official conduct of Captain Woodward has been such as to entitle him to the respect and confidence of those with whom he had business transactions. The system here worked well under his direction and, in the main, gave the fullest satisfaction to both races. The Freedmen's Bureau was abolished in the year 1869. In January, 1866, the General Assembly of Virginia authorized the county court of Washington county to sell and dispose of its stock in the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad Company, and the county court of this county, pursuant to this Act, at the May term of said court, appointed A. C. Cummings, J. C. Greenway and James K. Gibson a committee to ascertain for what price these bonds could be sold and upon what terms a courthouse could be built. This committee reported, and the contract for the erection of the new courthouse was awarded as follows: To Messrs. James and David Fields, the plastering; Mr. Hockman, of Harrisonburg, the carpenter's work; Messrs. Keller &amp; Grim, the roofing; Messrs. Morrison and Vaughan, the painting. The courthouse thus let to contract was completed in November, 1868, and was occupied by the courts of the county in December of the same year. Elections were held throughout the county on the 24th of August, 1866, for field officers in the militia regiments of the county, pursuant to an Act of the General Assembly passed on the 2d day of March, 1866. At this election the following officers were chosen: One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Regiment—Colonel, James L. F. Campbell; Lieutenant-Colonel, David O. Rush; Major, Joel W. Hortenstine; One Hundred and Twenty-sixth Regiment—Colonel, D. A. P. Campbell; Lieutenant-Colonel, Robert J. Keller; Major, W. W. Hurt. The officers elected in the One Hundred and Fifth Regiment I cannot ascertain. The militia organization of the county, an organization that had existed from the earliest times, was abolished by the Constitution of 1868. The "loyal" citizens of Virginia were very much dissatisfied with the manner in which the State and county governments were reorganized and undertook to have the Congress of the United States set aside the government thus organized in Virginia and to establish a territoral government in its place. The thirteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States had been adopted in the year 1865 without opposition from the people of this State, but no sooner had the amendment been adopted than the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution was proposed. This amendment had been vetoed by President Johnson, but was passed over his veto by a two-thirds vote of both Houses of Congress. The General Assembly of Virginia declined, with one dissenting vote, to ratify this amendment. The Congress of the United States, on the 20th day of February, 1867, passed the Shellabarger bill, which provided that whenever the people of any of the States lately in rebellion should adopt a Constitution framed by a convention of delegates elected by the male citizens of said State twenty-one years of age and upwards, of whatever race, color or previous condition (excepting therefrom such persons as were disfranchised for participation in rebellion), and when the General Assembly of said State should ratify the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution, their representatives should be admitted to seats in the Congress of the United States. On the 22d day of March, 1867, another Act was passed over the veto of the President providing for the registration of the voters and the calling of constitutional conventions in the States lately in rebellion. By the provisions of the Acts in question a great majority of the white citizens were denied the right to participate in the elections contemplated, and great uneasiness prevailed, as there was strong probability that the persons lately freed would be able to control the State and county organizations. The Southern States were divided into military districts, this portion of Virginia being District No. 1, commanded by General Schofield, and, pursuant to the authority vested in him by the Congress of the United States, on April 2, 1867, he issued an order suspending all elections by the people until the registration of the voters had been taken as required by the Act of Congress. The Registration Board for this county was appointed by General Schofield, and Captain John O'Neal was elected President of the board for this county. The registration of the voters of this county began on the 22d day of June and ended on the 19th of July, 1867. The result of the registration in the nine districts of this county was as follows: White. Colored. First District, 276 170 Second District, 336 84 Third District, 351 42 Fourth District, 278 15 Fifth District, 309 59 Sixth District, 280 106 Seventh District, 201 38 Eighth District, 279 34 Ninth District, 112 19 Total, 2,422 567 Upon the conclusion of the registration of the voters in this county, by order of General Schofield an election was ordered to be held throughout Virginia on the 22d day of October, 1867, for the purpose of selecting delegates to a Constitutional Convention to be held in Richmond in December, 1867, and by the same order the counties of Washington and Smyth were made one district and were entitled to two representatives. The two parties existing at this time were termed Conservatives and Radicals, and the candidates voted for in this election were Joseph T. Campbell and J. H. Thompson, Conservatives, and G. G. Goodell and Henry C. White, Radicals. The vote of this county for delegates in this election and upon the question of the holding of the convention was as follows: White. Colored. Campbell (Con), 1,180 5 Thompson (Con), 1,175 5 Goodell (Rad.), 416 500 White (Rad.), 417 498 For Convention, 422 500 Against Convention, 1,154 5 Campbell and Thompson were elected to represent this district in the Constitutional Convention. This convention assembled in the city of Richmond on the 3d day of December, 1867, and was composed of a hundred and five delegates, thirty-three of whom were Conservatives and seventy-two Radicals. The Constitution proposed by this convention embodied many praiseworthy principles, and while some objectionable features were found in the instrument as originally proposed, it may be truthfully stated that the Constitution as ratified has given greater satisfaction to the majority of the people of Virginia than any similar instrument adopted in the history of our State. The one serious objection to this Constitution, in the opinion of many, was the enfranchisement of a great body of illiterate voters, while on the other hand it provided for the free school system and gave all the guarantees necessary to the enjoyment of personal liberty to its fullest extent. This Constitution was submitted to the people at an election held on the 6th day of July, 1869. At the same time an election was held for Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, Attorney-General, Congressmen, Senator and Representatives in the House of Delegates. At this election the vote of the county was as follows: For the Constitution, 2,539 Against the Constitution, 35 For Clause 4, 491 Against Clause 4, 2,109 For Section 7, 492 Against Section 7, 2,115 For Governor—G. C. Walker, 1,971 H. H. Wells, 569 For Lieutenant-Governor—J. F. Lewis, 1,969 J. D. Harris, 521 For Attorney-General—J. C. Taylor, 2,042 T. R. Bowden, 663 For Congress—J. K. Gibson, 2,026 A. C. Dunn, 13 George S. Smith, 573 For Congress at Large—Joseph Segar, 1,876 A. M. Crane, 564 For State Senate—R. B. Edmondson, 860 J. S. Greever, 1,163 Charles McDougall, 517 For House of Delegates—George Graham, 1,675 John F. Terry, 1,702 Harry Remine, 497 M. L. Ingram, 629 Jeriel D. Linder, 98 White voters, 2,212 Colored voters, 389 2,601 The Constitution was ratified by the people, and Gilbert C. Walker, John F. Lewis, J. C. Taylor, J. K. Gibson, Joseph Segar, James S. Greever, George Graham and John F. Terry were elected to the respective offices for which they were candidates. James K. Gibson was permitted to take his seat in the Congress of the United States on the 24th of January, 1870. Early in the year 1868, the Conservative party in Virginia nominated a ticket for Governor, Lieutenant-Governor and Attorney-General, which ticket was as follows: For Governor, Robert E. Withers, of Lynchburg. For Lieutenant-Governor, James A. Walker, of Pulaski. For Attorney-General, John L. Marye, of Fredericksburg. The object of the Conservative party was not only to elect their ticket, but to defeat the Constitution proposed by the convention that adjourned on the 15th of April, 1868. Numerous canvassers were appointed throughout the State and every preparation was made to defeat the Constitution proposed, but in March of the year 1869 the Radical convention assembled in Petersburg and two tickets were nominated, headed by H. H. Wells and Gilbert C. Walker, respectively, the latter being termed the nominee of the Liberal Republican party. The State Executive Committee of the Conservative party, believing this to be the opportunity to accomplish their object, withdrew their ticket and decided to support the ticket headed by Gilbert C. Walker, with the result that Walker was elected by an overwhelming majority. On the first day of January, 1868, the term of office of Governor Pierpont having expired, General Schofield appointed H. H. Wells Governor of the State, and on the 27th of March, 1869, an order was issued by the military authorities removing Wells and vesting all executive power of the State in General Stoneman. The Congress of the United States, on the 23d day of January, 1869, adopted a resolution directing the removal of all persons holding civil offices under the provisional governments of Virginia and Texas, who could not take the oath prescribed by an act of Congress passed on the 22d of July, 1866, and conferring upon the military authorities the power to fill all vacancies from persons who could swear that they had not engaged in the rebellion against the United States. In the month of February, 1869, Judge John A. Campbell, of the Circuit Court, was removed and John W. Johnson, whose disabilities had been removed, was appointed Judge of this Circuit, and the following persons were appointed to fill vacancies occasioned by the removal of the officers of the county. Clerk of the Circuit Court, John O'Neal. Clerk of the County Court, Charles McDougall. County Surveyor, Leonidas Baugh. Sheriff, W. A. Dunn. Commonwealth-Attorney, Henry C. Auvil. At the same time members of the County Court, constables and overseers of the poor were appointed by General Stoneman. The Constitution, as originally proposed by the convention of 1868, contained many objectionable clauses, and, had the same been adopted as proposed, it would have been very disastrous and humiliating to Virginia, but through the intercession of a committee of nine prominent citizens of this State, among the number being Governor Wyndham Robertson, of Abingdon, General Grant, soon after his inauguration on the 4th of March, 1869, by the direction of the Congress of the United States, issued a proclamation appointing July 6, 1869, as the day for the people of the State to vote upon the question of the ratification or rejection of the proposed Constitution. By the terms of this Act of Congress General Grant was authorized to submit to the voters of the State, separately, such clauses of the proposed Constitution as he might think proper, and, pursuant to this authority, clause four and section seven of the proposed Constitution were submitted to the people to be voted upon separately and, as a result, the only objectionable clauses contained in this Constitution were eliminated. The General Assembly elected on the 6th of July, 1869, assembled in Richmond on October 5th, of the same year, and, after organizing, ratified the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the Constitution of the United States, elected two United States senators and adjourned to meet again on the 8th of February, 1870. On the 28th of January, 1870, the Congress of the United States passed a bill admitting the representatives from the State of Virginia to their seats in the Congress of the United States. When the General Assembly re-assembled on the 8th of February, 1870, they proceeded to reorganize the government of the State under the Constitution. John A. Kelly, of Smyth county, was elected judge of the Circuit Court and R. M. Page, judge of the County Court of this county. County officers were elected on the 8th of November, 1870, as follows: Clerk of the Circuit Court, L. T. Cosby. Clerk of the County Court, W. G. G. Lowry. Commonwealth-Attorney, James L. White. Sheriff, James L. F. Campbell. Treasurer, George R. Barr. The last term of the old County Court was held on the 9th day of April, 1870, with the following members present: Henry Davenport, John D. Rose and Jacob B. Kent. This court, during its existence, was one of the most valued institutions in the State, being well suited to the genius of our people and affording a reliable and speedy remedy for wrongs. For a number of years immediately subsequent to the close of the war, an organization existed in this county and in many portions of the South, known as the Ku-Klux-Klan, having for its object the restriction of that large body of freedmen found in every section of the South, and, in many instances, very difficult to control, the object being to restrain the vicious without the commission of any wrong against the well-meaning freedman. The terror created in the minds of the ordinary freedmen by the mention of the word Ku-Klux-Klan would be hard to describe. The following notice was published in the Abingdon paper on the 3d of April, 1868: "NOTICE. TO THE UNTERRIFIED KU-KLUX-KLAN. Meet at the Smoky Den of Destruction to hear what the royal avenging Giant has to say for the good of this Klan; be prompt to be there at 2 o'clock on the 1st April (night).* * This notice was published along with a representation of a skull and cross bones. By order of the 4th Demon now in the land." In the month of January, 1869, a depot was erected by the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad Company near Goforth's Mill, six miles east of Bristol, and since that time a considerable town has grown up at this point and is now known as Wallace's Switch. A Law Library Association was organized in Abingdon in October, 1869, by James W. Humes and other prominent citizens of the town, but for some reason this association was short lived. On the 24th of November, 1870, the sense of the people of this county was taken upon a proposition for a county subscription of $200,000 to the Norfolk and Great Western railroad, and the proposition was negatived by a vote of nine hundred and ninety-five against, to two hundred and thirty-eight for. The county of Washington, previous to the year 1872 divided into nine districts, was changed in that year, pursuant to an Act of the General Assembly, and was divided into six districts by M. H. Buchanan, I. A. McQuown, D. A. P. Campbell, John Roberts, John M. Hamilton and W. P. Wallace, commissioners appointed by the County Court of this county for that purpose. The names of the districts as thus established were Glade Spring, Saltville, North Fork, Abingdon, Goodson and Kinderhook Districts. In 1876, by order of the County Court of this county, Holston District was established and became the Seventh District of the county. At this point I will close the history of the county, as it has oftentimes been truly said: "Nations only begin to look after the history of their founders and search into their origin when they have outlived the memory thereof." EDUCATION. By far the most creditable chapter in the history of Abingdon and the people of Washington county, has been the effort of the people to afford excellent facilities for the education of the youthful inhabitants of Abingdon and the surrounding country. William Webb was the first schoolmaster that taught an English school in the vicinity of Abingdon. He was an Englishman and came to America in the employment of Lord Fairfax, in whose land office in the Northern Neck of Virginia he wrote for many years at the same time that George Washington, with whom Mr. Webb was well acquainted, was surveying for Lord Fairfax. He came to Abingdon in 1782 or 1783 with a wife and nine children and was employed by John Campbell, clerk of the county, in recording deeds and doing other work in the clerk's office. Soon after his arrival Mr. Campbell had a school made up for him, and a schoolhouse was built just across the creek from Mr. Findlay's old tan-yard, at the head of Black's mill pond, and near where a good spring came out from between rocks. The ground was the floor and the seats for the scholars were made of hewn slabs placed on forks driven into the ground around the walls, and their writing table was of the same material placed on forks in the middle of the room. Such was the furniture of the first school-house in Abingdon. Mr. Webb was a very small man, with a round face and sparkling black eyes. He was talkative, lively and intelligent, and though feeble, was very independent in his opinions, and when aroused was as bold as a lion. He had a ready use of his pen and wrote a most beautiful hand, as is evident from an inspection of his work now to be found in the clerk's office of Washington county. Mr. Webb removed to Russell county in 1786, and settled near the present location of Tazewell Courthouse, Virginia, and taught school until his death in the year 1818. The next teacher of any distinction that came to the vicinity of Abingdon was Turner Lane, an Irishman, who had previously thereto taught school at the Royal Oak, where Marion, in Smyth county now stands. He began to teach school in Abingdon in the year 1786, in a house on the land of John Bradley. In 1788 or 1789 a school-house was built for him near the meeting-house spring, at a location within the present enclosure of the Sinking Spring Cemetery. At this location he taught for several years, and subsequently removed to Tennessee and settled near Sparta. He was a man of good size and appearance, very orderly in his requirements in school, but not tyrannical.* * Gov. David Campbell MSS. At this location a school was conducted until the organization of the Abingdon Male Academy in the year 1802. ABINGDON MALE ACADEMY. At the fall session of the General Assembly of Virginia in the year 1802, Robert Craig, Sr., a member of the Legislature from Washington county, at the request of a number of prominent citizens of Abingdon, introduced a bill in the Legislature of Virginia having for its object the incorporation of the Abingdon Academy. This bill became a law on the 13th of January, 1803, and provided that: John Campbell, Richard White, James Bradley, William King, James White, Andrew Russell, Henry Dixon, Robert Craig, Sr., Robert Campbell, Gerrard T. Conn, Francis Preston, Claiborne Watkins, William Tate, Frederick Hamilton and David Campbell, should constitute a body politic and incorporate by the name of the Trustees of Abingdon Academy, and by that name should have perpetual succession, a common seal, and sue and be sued. They were given the power to make rules and regulations, to appoint officers and remove the same, in the establishment and conduct of the proposed Academy, and vacancies occurring on the Board of Trustees were to be filled by the surviving trustees." By this same act the trustees of the town of Abingdon and their successors, or the majority of them, were authorized to raise, not exceeding $2,000, by lottery or lotteries, to be applied by them in purchasing a library, philosophical and mathematical apparatus, and anything else necessary for the use of the said Academy. The school as thus chartered was opened in the Masonic Hall,* * This hall stood on the lot now occupied by the new county jail on Water street. in the town of Abingdon, in the fall of the year 1803, and the Academy was conducted in the same hall until about the year 1820. Every member of the Board of Trustees appointed by this act was personally interested in the success of the Academy, each contributing everything possible to the institution and the success of the same. Four members of the Board of Trustees of the town of Abingdon met at the courthouse in the town of Abingdon on the 18th of June, 1803, and, pursuant to the provisions of the Act of the Assembly of date January 13, 1803, had the following proceedings: "At a meeting of the trustees of the town of Abingdon, at the courthouse of Washington county, on Saturday, the 18th day of June, 1803. Present, Robert Campbell, Andrew Russell, Frederick Hamilton and James White. By an act of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia, passed the 13th day of January, 1803, it is enacted that it shall and may be lawful for the trustees of the said town, and their successors or a majority of them, to raise by lottery or lotteries, a sum, not exceeding two thousand dollars, to be applied by them in purchasing a library, philosophical and mathematical apparatus, and anything else necessary for the use of the said Academy. In pursuance whereof we have adopted the following scheme of a lottery to be denominated `The Abingdon Academy Lottery,' to raise the sum of two thousand dollars for the purposes aforesaid, by account of twenty per cent. on prizes alone. 1 Prize of $1,000, $ 1,000 2 Prizes of $500, 1,000 15 Prizes of $100, 1,500 40 Prizes of $50, 2,000 50 Prizes of $20, 1,000 700 Prizes of $5, 3,500 808 Prizes, $10,000 1192 Blanks, 2,000 Tickets@$5, $10,000 The drawing will commence in the Abingdon Academy as soon as the tickets are sold, and continued from day to day until finally completed; immediately after which the prizes will be paid to the fortunate adventurers. Such as shall not be demanded within six months after the close of the drawing will be considered as relinquished. We have adopted the following form of the tickets: Abingdon Academy! This ticket, No. — entitles the drawer to the first prize annexed to its number subject to a discount of twenty per cent. thereon. ROBERT CAMPBELL, ANDREW RUSSELL, FREDERICK HAMILTON, JAMES WHITE, Trustees. There can be no question that the drawing under this lottery took place, but with what success it is impossible to ascertain. The first principal of the Abingdon Academy is unknown, and the success attending the Academy previous to 1820 is equally unknown; but it is probable that the institution received considerable patronage and to some extent at least met the object of its projectors. William King, a young man who had been identified with the town of Abingdon since an early day in its history, became very much interested in the Abingdon Academy, and being a man of considerable means, at the time of the execution of his will he made the following provision for the Academy—to-wit: I also leave and bequeath to the Abingdon Academy the sum of ($10,000) ten thousand dollars payable to the trustees in the year 1816, or lands to that amount, to be vested in said Academy with the interest or rents thereon forever." His will was probated on the 20th of December, 1808. William King was an Irishman and a self-made man in every particular, but evidently had received a good English education himself. By this act he rendered a great service to many generations of people, and his name will be intimately associated with the history of his adopted home as long as education is appreciated by our people. In the fall of the year 1812, the following advertisement appeared in the "Political Prospect," a newspaper published in Abingdon: ABINGDON ACADEMY. "The trustees of this institution have the happiness to announce to the friends of Erudition, that the muses are about to pour out their treasures from the Pierian Spring in this Seminary. To the American Youth who thirst for literary acquirements, they offer the draughts of: LANGUAGE AND SCIENCE. Under The REV. THOMAS ERSKINE BIRCH, WHOSE TALENTS as a preceptor have been so universally authenticated that any encomium is unnecessary. PRICES FOR TUITION. For a novitiate, $10 00 Reading and writing, 12 00 English Gram., Arithmetic, &amp;c., 15 00 Language &amp; Mathematical Science, Elocution, Philosophy, Belles-Lettres and Astronomy, Book-keeping, geography and Navigation, &amp;c., 20 00 Nothing more is known of the Academy at this time. The trustees of the Abingdon Academy in the year 1819 instituted a suit in the court of this county having for its object the enforcement of the provision made by William King in his will for Abingdon Academy. Matthew Willoughby, Edward Latham and James Vance were appointed commissioners by the court to ascertain the lands owned by William King in Abingdon and vicinity, and to ascertain the value of said lands and report to the court. These commissioners reported to the court at the October term thereof, and by a decree of said court entered on the 22d of December, 1819, the following lands were directed to be conveyed by the adult heirs of William King, deceased, and by Jacob Lynch, commissioner of the court, to the trustees of the Abingdon Academy, 99 acres and 31 poles; 29 acres and 80 poles; 10 1-2 acres; 20 3-4 acres; 32 acres and 59 poles; 32 acres; 40? acres; 15 acres and 120 poles; 17 acres and 88 poles; 8¼ acres; 100 acres; 10 quarter-acre lots in the Robert Craig addition to the town of Abingdon, and being lots Nos. 31, 35, 33, 37, 38, 39, 40, and 43; 10 quarter-acre lots in the David Craig addition to said town, and being lots Nos. 15, 16, 17, 18, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30." Deeds were executed pursuant to this order of the court, and the trustees of the Academy set about in earnest to make the institution of great service to the community. Soon after the determination of this suit, the trustees of Abingdon Academy employed Nathaniel Holley as principal of the Academy, and rented a room for the school to be taught in until the Academy building could be erected. In the year 1824, the Board of Trustees appointed Francis Smith, James Cummings and Earl B. Clapp, curators for the Academy land, and in the same year appointed David Campbell, James White and Francis Smith, a committee to select a location for the Academy and have the site for the Academy cleared out, and in the following year, Francis Smith, John M. Preston and David Campbell, were appointed a committee to let the contract for the erection of a brick Academy to cost $2,000, and at the same time the Board of Directors directed that the cost of the erection of this Academy be paid by money raised by private subscription. In the year 1826, when the brick Academy was nearing completion, the Board of Trustees of the Academy sold and conveyed to General Francis Preston, all their interest in the old Academy building on Water street, and in the year 1827, occupied the new Academy building, and elected William Ewing principal. The brick Academy erected in this year was situated upon the location of the present Academy building, and was one of the best school buildings in Western Virginia at the time. William Ewing served as principal of the Academy until 1833, and during his occupancy the attendance was considerable and the Academy prosperous. From the year 1833 to 1837, Professor Peter McViccar, formerly a professor in Hampden-Sidney College, was principal of the Academy, and received for his compensation $1,300 yearly. The tuition fee was $10 per session and the number of students exceeded forty. In the year 1833, the trustees of Abingdon Academy decided that it would be advisable to unite the male and female schools of the town, and appointed a committee to ascertain the practicability of selling the Academy lands and uniting the two schools, but this undertaking of the trustees evidently failed, as there is no evidence that the two schools were ever united. In the year 1833 there were four schools for boys in the town of Abingdon, conducted by the Rev. David Spyker, Rev. F. L. B. Shaver, Samuel Baillie and a Mr. Hathaway, and one school for girls. In the year 1774, Dr. Thomas Walker conveyed to the minister and congregation of Sinking Spring and their successors fifty-five acres of land, now in West Abingdon and including Sinking Spring Cemetery, and a portion of Fruit Hill and Taylor's Hill. In the year 1800 the validity of this deed was questioned by some, and on the 11th of January, 1800, Colonel Francis Walker, as executor of Dr. Thomas Walker, conveyed this same land to the Rev. Charles Cummings and others and their successors. In the year 1840, the validity of this last conveyancee was questioned, and on the 23d of May in that year, William C. Rives and his wife, Judith P. Rives, Mann Page, and Jane F. Page, the heirs-at-law of Dr. Thomas Walker, conveyed these lands to the trustees of Abingdon Academy and their successors. Subsequently it was decided that the first deed executed by Dr. Walker was valid and, consequently, all subsequent deeds void. The next information that we have of the Academy is in the year 1849, at which time W. A. Woodson and B. F. Ficklin were principals. During the administration of Woodson and Ficklin the Academy was a military institution, and for a number of years thereafter. The students were uniformed and daily drilled. The uniform worn by the students was as follows: A coatee of gray cloth with white metal buttons, with pantaloons of the same material for winter, and white linen or cotton for summer and a blue cloth cap. The attendance during this period in the history of the school was large, and the school was exceedingly prosperous. W. A. Woodson and J. M. Brockenbrough were the principals of the Academy in the year 1851, but they disagreed, and J. M. Brockenbrough during the following year conducted a school for boys in the basement of the Temperance Hall. To this school he gave the name of Washington Institute, but the school ceased to exist after the first year. The principals of the Abingdon Academy from 1822 until the present time have been as follows: 1822-1827, Nathaniel Holley. 1827-1833, William Ewing. 1833-1837, Peter McViccar. 1837-1838, Rev. Ephraim D. Saunders, Cumberland county. 1838-1840, George Clive, Albemarle county. 1840-1843, Rev. Samuel Matthews. 1843-1849, John G. Winniford. 1849-1850, B. F. Ficklin and W. A. Woodson. 1850-1851, W. A. Woodson and J. M. Brockenbrough. 1851-1852, W. A. Woodson and W. Y. C. Humes. 1852-1853, J. E. Blankenship. 1853-1854, Rev. Thomas Brown. 1854-1855, Rev. Henry T. Lee. 1855-1856, Stephen J. Pendleton, Williamsburg. 1856-1859, Rev. Thomas Brown. 1859-1860, Charles T. Brown. 1860-1861, R. H. Hall. 1861-1865, William Farmer. 1865-1871, Robert P. Carson. 1871-1872, John H. McRae. And since 1872, Robert P. Carson, J. B. Baker, A. P. Wilmer, J. W. Cole and B. R. Smith in the order named. It is worthy of mention at this point that John G. Winniford, who for a number of years successfully conducted the Abingdon Academy, was the son of the principal contractor in the building of Emory and Henry College, and probably the first graduate of that institution. Mr. Hall, the principal of this Academy in the year 1861, resigned his position as principal of the Academy and enlisted in the service of the Confederate States. Robert J. Preston, Samuel B. Paston and James G. McChain, in the order named, were assistant professors at the Academy during the administration of Robert P. Carson. In the spring of the year 1861, the volunteers from Scott county were permitted to occupy the Abingdon Academy temporarily, but this permission was abused, and the trustees of the Academy petitioned the Secretary of War of the Confederate States to prohibit the use of the Academy by the soldiers, and in June, 1862, this petition was granted and the soldiers forbidden to occupy the Academy. By the year 1872 the Academy buildings by neglect and bad usage had cracked and were in a very dilapidated condition, and the Board of Trustees, because of the necessity above stated, began the erection in that year of the present Academy building and the brick residence near thereto. The corner-stone of the Academy was relaid jointly by Waterman Lodge, No. 219, and Abingdon Lodge, No. 48, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, on the 15th day of July, A. L., 5872, A. D., 1872, conducted by P. G. M. Thomas F. Owens. The program was as follows: Robert E. Withers, Grand Master of Virginia. Waterman Lodge, No. 219. John C. Campbell, Master. John G. Clark, S. W. William White, J. W. George R. Barr, Secretary. Charles B. Coale, Treasurer. Abingdon Lodge, No. 48. John A. Barrow, Master. P. C. Landrum, S. W. John D. Cosby, J. W. G. V. Litchfield, Secretary. W. F. Barr, Treasurer. Committee of Arrangements: R. M. Page, Lodge No. 219. George R. Barr, Thomas K. Trigg, G. V. Litchfield, Lodge, No. 48. John D. Cosby, John A. Barrow, Trustees of Abingdon Academy: E. M. Campbell, President. John G. Kreger, Secretary and Treasurer. James K. Gibson, John A. Campbell, A. R. Preston, Charles J. Cummings, T. G. McConnell, James Fields, C. S. Bekem, A. C. Cummings, George V. Litchfield, Sr., N. K. White, D. G. Thomas, S. N. Honaker, James L. White. Contractors: James Fields, Masonry. Frank Smith, carpenter. The buildings thus begun were completed in a short time, and at this day are in use by the authorities of the Academy. The trustees of the Academy in the meantime had sold and conveyed the property derived under the will of William King, and, previous to 1861, had used the interest arising from this endowment fund in discharging the current expenses of the school, but by the depreciation of the securities held by the Board of Trustees for this fund, the entire fund was exhausted by the erection of the buildings before mentioned and since that time the school has been without an endowment fund. Since the close of the war the following gentlemen have acted as principals of the Academy in the order named: Colonel R. P. Carson, J. B. Baker, A. P. Wilmer, J. W. Cole, and B. R. Smith. This Academy is situated within view of the Norfolk and Western Railway and about one-quarter of a mile from the depot thereof. The grounds consist of about eighteen acres of land, and the Academy buildings are situated on a high hill in the midst of a splendid grove of poplar, oak and chestnut trees overlooking the town of Abingdon, and from this hill a splendid view may be had of all the surrounding country. Many of the distinguished men produced by this county and this section of Virginia have been students of this Academy, and under its present very efficient management many of the sons of this section of Virginia are being prepared for a life of usefulness and honor. What this Academy most needs is an endowment fund that will enable the trustees to extend the sphere of usefulness of the institution, and if some of our well-to-do citizens could be impressed with the fact that wealth transmitted to descendants has an enervating effect and oftentimes destroys the usefulness of excellent men, maybe they would be impelled to confer a small portion at least of their wealth upon this institution, and thereby forever merit the love and respect of their fellow-citizens and their posterity. The provision contained in the will of William King, as above set out, has done more to perpetuate his memory and to instill into the minds of his posterity and fellow-citizens a sublime respect for his character as a man than all the great wealth that passed at his death to his relatives. Female Education. As early as March, 1840, the General Assembly of Virginia incorporated the Abingdon Female Academy with a capital of $50,000, under the management of the following trustees: David Campbell, Alexander Findlay, John N. Humes, Jacob Lynch, Samuel H. Wills, Jeremiah Bronough, John M. Preston, John W. C. Watson, Fairman H. Preston, Daniel Trigg, William Y. C. White, John C. Greenway, John Dunn. This school was for many years conducted in a room in the Masonic Hall, which was located on Valley street, on now the vacant lot between the Presbyterian manse and the residencee of Mrs. S. M. Withers. This school for many years was under the supervision of Miss Melville and Miss Agnes Mitchell (the latter won distinction by her production entitled the "Smuggler's Son"), and afterwards by Miss Bettie Litchfield, and at one time by the Rev. Thomas Brown. In the year 1851, Miss Bettie Litchfield conducted the school at the Masonic Hall, and Misses Sallie C. and Elizabeth Balfour conducted a school for young ladies in the Methodist Protestant church. In February of the year 1851, a committee appointed by the Holston Conference met in Abingdon and discussed the propriety of establishing a female college within the bounds of the conference; and while this committee failed to establish a school in Abingdon, the subject was extensively discussed and was finally brought to the attention of McCabe Lodge, No. 56, I. O. O. F., of Abingdon, and, as a result, the lodge, in the year 1853, projected a plan for the erection of a first-class female college in Abingdon, to which was given the name of MARTHA WASHINGTON COLLEGE. This name was suggested by Colonel John Campbell, of Hall's Bottom, who, in speaking of this enterprise, said: "If the name of your county was the first honor of the kind paid to General Washington, Martha Washington College, Abingdon, Va. the name you are about to give to your female college will be the first of the kind paid to his wife, who shared with him his anxieties and hopes in our struggle for liberty and whose domestic virtues made her a perfect model of female excellence. By thus conferring the name you will do honor to the bosom friend of Washington, who consoled him during his wonderful career. You will also do honor to the first settlers of Washington county, who proved themselves in the darkest hours of the revolution to be worthy the name that had been selected for their county." The Odd-Fellows Lodge that undertook this worthy enterprise was organized on the 27th of June, 1847, the following persons being charter members: James D. McCabe, John C. Campbell, F. L. B. Shaver, Matthew Davis and Charles B. Coale. The growth of the lodge was rapid, and its usefulness was unbounded, and by the year 1853 most of the leading citizens of Abingdon were active members. When the lodge had decided to undertake this enterprise committees were appointed to select the location for the college and ascertain the cost thereof, to solicit subscriptions from the citizens of the town and county and from other lodges, and shortly thereafter the lodge purchased from William Y. C. White about ten acres of land on the hill north of the county courthouse for the sum of twelve hundred dollars, the purchase money being paid in cash. W. W. Blackford, a member of the lodge, was employed to furnish the plan for said college, which plan was reported and adopted, and contracts were let for the building of a large three-story building intended as the main building of the college. In the meantime the General Assembly of Virginia, on the 3d day of March, 1854, incorporated the proposed college under the name and style of the Trustees of the Martha Washington College, the following gentlemen being named as trustees: B. R. Johnston, James H. Dunn, James Fields, David C. Dunn, John L. Bradley, Samuel Garner, George R. Barr, Samuel Logan, William K. Heiskell, Thomas L. Preston, Peter E. B. C. Henritze, Henry W. Baker and John C. Cummings, to which board were subsequently added Charles B. Coale and John G. Kreger. This board organized by the election of Thomas L. Preston as president of the board. The ladies of the town were interested, and conducted several fairs for the benefit of the college. A Gift Enterprise was conducted at Abingdon and 50,000 tickets were sold at $1.00 each. Fifty thousand gifts were bestowed upon the holders of the tickets sold, among the gifts being a farm of 150 acres of land, house and lot in the town of Abingdon, piano, carriage, buggy, certificates of scholarship in the proposed college, and several thousand steel engravings of the proposed college buildings. By the year 1858 the main building of the college was about completed and the grounds somewhat improved, when, during a very severe storm, the building was so badly injured as to make it necessary to tear it down and rebuild it, and it was apparent that the lodge would not be able to complete the undertaking as at first proposed, although they had expended $30,000 thereon. At this time the Rev. E. E. Wiley, representing the Holston Conference, submitted a proposition to the lodge on behalf of the conference. The lodge accepted the proposition of the conference, and the college, with its debts, real estate and subscription list, was transferred to the Holston Conference, the transfer taking effect on Monday, June 14, 1858. The conference immediately began preparations for the completion of the enterprise undertaken by the lodge, and soon thereafter purchased from Thomas L. Preston the present location of the college for the sum of $21,600. The property thus purchased was the former residence of General Francis Preston, and the home at one time of William C. Preston and John S. Preston, of South Carolina; Mrs. Wade Hampton, South Carolina; Mrs. Robert J. Breckenridge, of Kentucky; Mrs. General Carrington, of Albemarle county; Mrs. John B. Floyd, Mrs. James McDowell, of Rockbridge, and Mrs. John M. Preston, of Abingdon. The General Assembly of Virginia incorporated Martha Washington College on the 22d of February, 1860, naming the following trustees: George V. Litchfield, Milton Y. Heiskell, B. R. Johnston, C. B. Coale, Thomas S. Stewart, Joseph Haskew, Ephraim E. Wiley, T. P. Hoofnagle, William P. Bishop, W. K. Heiskell, Edmond Longley, Thomas G. McConnell, John A. Campbell. This board organized by the election of John A. Campbell as president, and the first session of the school was duly opened on March 15, 1860, and, save for the suspension of a few months in the year 1862, has continued in successful operation to the present, the last few years being the most prosperous in its entire history. This college can boast of more than three hundred and fifty graduates, representing all of the Southern States and many of the Northern and Western States. The description of the buildings and grounds is best given by one of the original trustees of this college: "The buildings and grounds are of the most elaborate and magnificent order, unsurpassed for beauty and convenience in the South or out of it. The grounds comprise eight acres, and are gorgeously ornamented with trees and shrubs and flowers. There are more than a mile of continuous serpentine walks for the young ladies to promenade in, all tastefully bordered with flowering shrubbery. Fruits in great variety, including berries and grapes in great abundance, grow in all parts of the ground, at all times in their season accessible to the inmates, and the young ladies seem, in their beautiful and well-ordered "home school," to be as happy as the first inhabitants of Eden before that Snake came along. The buildings are extensive, convenient and imposing, and capable of accommodating from 125 to 150 boarders. The Faculty is equal to any anywhere; and if we were young again, we believe we might be bewildered at the sight of the bright eyes, sunny curls and fairy-like forms that sport amid the flowers of the campus on calm summer evenings. Some of our young men are half crazy now, but they dare not pass the enclosure, except to see a sister or a cousin, and they all have cousins of course, and even then nearly every tree and bush and flower seems to say—"thus far shalt thou go and no further."* * Charles B. Coale. The buildings, four in number, are constructed of brick, and are heated by steam and are lighted by incandescent electric lights. The principals of this college during its very useful career have been: W. A. Harris, B. Arbogast, R. W. Jones, Warren Dupree, E. E. Hoss, E. E. Wiley, D. S. Hearon, S. N. Barker and W. M. Dyer. STONEWALL JACKSON INSTITUTE. In the year 1868, a number of the prominent citizens of Abingdon, principally affiliating with the Presbyterian Church, feeling it necessary that another school for the education of girls should be established in this section of the State, undertook the founding of such an institution in the town of Abingdon. The location selected was the brick residence erected by General John S. Preston in the year 1833, and lots Nos. 10, 11, 12, 13, 20, 21 and 3-4 of lot No. 9, in West Abingdon. This property was occupied by General Preston until his removal to South Carolina, and then by Governor Floyd until the time of his death. After the death of Governor Floyd, his wife, Sally B. Floyd, and W. B. Byars, trustee, conveyed this property to A. L. Hendricks, who, on the 16th of January, 1868, sold and transferred the same to the trustees of Martha Washington College. Stonewall Jackson Institute, Abingdon, Va. When it was definitely determined to undertake the establishment of this school, the trustees of the Sinking Spring Presbyterian Church, purchased from the Trustees of Martha Washington College the property above mentioned, and the gentlemen interested at once met and organized a Board of Trustees composed of the following gentlemen: W. Y. C. White, A. C. Cummings, T. P. Clapp, F. B. Hurt, Robert A. Preston, T. M. Clapp, James W. Preston, Rev. James McChain, D. G. Thomas, D. C. Dunn, S. A. Preston, D. C. Greenway and J. G. Kreger, and elected the following officers: President, W. Y. C. White. Vice-President, A. C. Cummings. Secretary, John G. Kreger. Treasurer, Samuel A. Preston. The Trustees of the Sinking Spring Presbyterian Church appointed the Rev. A. L. Hogshead as agent to solicit subscriptions to the new enterprise, and the Board of Trustees gave to the new institution the name of Jackson Female Institute, and selected the Rev. Samuel Davies Stuart, of Staunton, Virginia, as principal of the institution for the first year, and the Rev. Thomas Brown as principal professor. The first session of this school began on the 15th of September, 1868, with a large attendance and bright prospects. The name given to the institution was bestowed and intended as a tribute, so far as such an act can constitute a tribute, to a majestic character, a great name that will ever shine with undimmed glory upon the page of history. When General Lee received information of the organization of this institution he addressed the following letter to the principal of the Institute, expressing his feelings in regard thereto: Rev. S. D. Stuart: In reply to yours of the 16th instant in reference to the Stonewall Jackson Institute, I assure you that any scheme designed to perpetuate the recollections of the virtue and patriotism of General Jackson meets with my approval. As he was a friend of learning, I know of no more effective and appropriate method of accomplishing the praiseworthy object in question than the establishment of an institution in which the young women of our country may be trained for the important and responsible duties of life. I hope the institution established by the people of Southwest Virginia, and dedicated to the memory of General T. J. Jackson, may meet with entire success and prove a blessing to the State. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, R. E. LEE. What more fitting monument could be erected to the memory of General Jackson, who was loved chiefly for his patriotism, gentleness, truth, his love for his family and his God, than an institution of learning of this character. Could General Jackson know the manner in which the young lady pupils of this institution are taught and witness them in their uniforms of Confederate gray, he would feel that this is the grandest monument that has yet been erected to his name by a loving people. By the year 1870, it was found necessary to have this institution incorporated, and the General Assembly of Virginia, on the 27th of June, 1870, incorporated the same with the following Trustees: W. Y. C. White, T. P. Clapp, James W. Preston, S. A. Preston, David C. Dunn, Floyd B. Hurt, D. G. Thomas, John G. Kreger, David C. Greenway, H. S. Preston, E. H. Barnett, George R. Barr, James W. Humes, George W. Palmer, A. C. Cummings, Isaac B. Dunn and Joseph R. Anderson. I. B. Dunn and Joseph R. Anderson declined to serve as trustees and R. M. Page and John A. Buchanan were elected to fill the vacancies. Considerable difficulty was experienced by the trustees of this institution in relieving it from its indebtedness, but after a few years the financial condition of the institution was such as to justify the erection of a commodious addition, three stories in height, at the east end of the original building, and about ten years ago a handsome building was erected at the west end of the original building, and the grounds were terraced and placed in excellent condition. The trustees of this institution until recent years were selected, one-half by the trustees of the Institute and the other half by the trustees of Sinking Spring Presbyterian Church, but, in the year 1896, the trustees of the Sinking Spring Presbyterian Church transferred their interest in the institution to Abingdon Presbytery, and the charter of Jackson Female Institute was amended by the General Assembly changing the name to Stonewall Jackson Institute and provides for the appointment of new trustees by the Abingdon Presbytery and the trustees of the Institute. It may be said that this institution bids fair to experience in the near future such an era of prosperity and usefulness as is seldom witnessed, and that not without cause. Could the fathers and mothers of our country know and experience the gentle Christian-like influences that are constantly exerted by the principal of this institution in her dealings with her pupils, they could not hesitate to intrust their daughters to her care. The Institute is situated upon a beautiful eminence on west Main street, the grounds are studded with handsome shade trees, all of them of full growth, many of them of stately stature and patriarchal age; the surface is undulating in graceful terraces and intersected by winding paths. The front and sides of the campus are enclosed with a handsome stone wall, surmounted throughout its entire length by an artistic iron fence. The buildings occupy the crest of a hill of considerable elevation above the street upon which they front and from which they are quite far removed, while the town of Abingdon is 2,057 feet above the level of the sea. In salubrity of climate, which is an important consideration in selecting a school, Southwest Virginia is not excelled by any other section of the country. The principals of the institute since its founding have been: Rev. Samuel D. Stuart, Thomas D. Davidson, A. Q. Holliday, Rev. John O. Sullivan, J. D. Anderson and Miss Kate M. Hunt. Under the present administration the institute has received a larger patronage than in any preceding period of its history. EMORY AND HENRY COLLEGE. From an early day in our history the need of an institution of learning that would afford educational advantages of a high order was keenly felt, and for many years the practicability of establishing such an institution was discussed by the leading citizens of this section of our country, but no practical results were obtained until about the year 1833. Colonel William Byars, Tobias Smith, Alexander Findlay and the Rev. Creed Fulton, about this time, undertook the establishment of such an institution in this county, and had made some progress, when the Holston Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, at its fall session of 1835, held in Knoxville, Tennessee, resolved to establish in Southwestern Virginia a manual labor college, and soon thereafter, on the 9th of April, 1836, Colonel William Byars and Alexander Findlay purchased from George M. Crawford and the other devisees of the Rev. Edward Crawford, 554 1-2 acres of land for the sum of $4,158.75. The lands thus purchased were situated on the waters of Cedar creek, described in the deed as the waters of the Little Holston creek, and were the same lands that were surveyed by John Buchanan, deputy surveyor of Augusta county, for Colonel James Wood, on the 26th of March, 1874 and the 24th of March, 1749. These lands were devised by Colonel Wood to his wife, Mary Wood, and by her conveyed to James Dysart and Matthew Ryburn, executors of John Beattie, deceased, and by Dysart and Ryburn conveyed to the Rev. Edward Crawford, and by the Rev. Edward Crawford devised to his children by his wife, Jane.* * The will of Rev. Edward Crawford was probated on January 21st, 1823. The Holston Conference, at the same time that it decided to establish the manual labor school in Southwest Virginia, commissioned Emory and Henry College, Emory, Va. the Rev. Creed Fulton as an agent to solicit funds for the undertaking, which duty he immediately proceeded to discharge. Upon his return from Knoxville, a meeting of the citizens of the upper end of this county was held at the Old Glade Spring Church, having for its object the obtaining of subscriptions for the enterprise. This meeting was largely attended and $5,000 was subscribed to the enterprise at that time and place,† † Tobias Smith was the first subscriber, his subscription being $500. and soon thereafter another meeting was held in Abingdon at which a subscription equally as large was obtained. In the meantime Colonel William Byars, Alexander Findlay and Tobias Smith were furnishing the money and were giving their time to the erection of buildings upon the location selected for the school, being the lands purchased by Byars and Findlay from George M. Crawford and others. The corner-stone of the main college building was laid with Masonic ceremonies on the 30th day of September, 1836, in the presence of a large concourse of people. The contract for the buildings had been previously let to Lyle &amp; Sheppard and the carpenters' work to George Winniford, and by the spring of 1838 the buildings were sufficiently advanced to justify the opening of the school, and the first session began on the 13th day of April, 1838. The name given to this college was Emory and Henry College, in honor of Bishop Emory and Patrick Henry, and the Rev. Charles Collins was elected the first president of the college. Colonel William Byars was elected president and Alexander Findlay secretary, of the first Board of Trustees of Emory and Henry College. The first Board of Trustees of Emory and Henry College was composed of the following gentlemen: Colonel William Byars, Alexander Findlay, Tobias Smith, Daniel Trigg, M. D., Colonel Thomas L. Preston, Rev. Thomas Catlett, John W. Price, John W. C. Watson, Rev. Creed Fulton, Rev. Nathaniel Sherman, John N. Humes, Nickerson Snead, M. D., Rev. Arnold Patton. This school, in its inception, was called a manual labor college, and was intended as an institution in which the pupils were to be taught to labor with their hands as well as to think. They were to be permitted to work upon the farm and to receive credit upon their tuition and board for labor thus performed, and while this feature of the institution was maintained for many years, it was finally found to be impracticable and was abandoned. One hundred students were enrolled during the first year, and, as far as patronage was concerned, the school was prosperous. This institution was incorporated by an act of the Assembly approved March 5, 1839, and on the 24th of December, 1840, William Byars, Alexander Findlay and Catherine Findlay, his wife, conveyed to the trustees of Emory and Henry College the lands they had purchased from the devisees of the Rev. Edward Crawford in 1836, and in this deed William Byars retained a lien on the lands thus conveyed to secure to himself the sum of $7,400, and to Alexander Findlay and John D. Mitchell $2,000, money advanced by them in the establishment and support of said college. By the year 1843 the trustees of the college found the institution considerably in debt and petitioned the General Assembly of Virginia for a loan of $18,000 from the Literary Fund, and by an Act of the Assembly approved on the 27th of February, 1843, the directors of the Literary Fund were authorized to loan to the trustees of Emory and Henry College the sum of $18,000, provided the trustees of said college would secure the payment of said sum of $18,000 and its interest by a deed of trust upon all their property, and by good personal security, and pursuant to this Act of the Assembly the trustees of the college on the 24th of March, 1843, executed to Beverly R. Johnston a deed of trust upon all their real estate in this county to secure the said sum of $18,000 and its interest, and William Byars, Alexander Findlay, Tobias Smith and other prominent citizens of the county became endorsers on their note. This incumbrance upon the property of the college was discharged on August 20, 1890, by the trustees of Emory and Henry College conveying to the Board of Public Works of Virginia 248 1-2 acres of their real estate situated at Emory. It should be stated to the credit of the management of this institution that, from the year 1843, the college, without an endowment, was free from debt for about thirty years, and that the income from tuition and board was not only sufficient to meet the current expenses of the school, but the trustees were enabled to make considerable improvement during this time, such as the erection of handsome buildings and enlarging the library and apparatus. The patronage of the school reached 280 pupils in the year 1860, and since the close of the war has varied from 80 to 150. Colonel William Byars and Governor Wyndham Robertson, each, in the early history of the college gave to the trustees a sum of money the annual interest of which has for many years furnished the Byars' Medal for the highest proficiency in Natural Sciences, and the Robertson prize medal for encouraging oratory, while Professor James A. Davis donated to the college valuable instruments costing about $700. More than five thousand young men have been educated and more than five hundred have graduated from this institution in its history. It has accomplished great good in its time, and the prospects are that it will accomplish untold benefits to our country in the future. The presidents of this institution have been: 1837-1852, Rev. Charles Collins, M. A., D. D. 1852-1879, Rev. Ephraim E. Wiley, M. A., D. D. 1879-1880, John L. Buchanan, M. A., LL. D. 1880-1884, Rev. David Sullins, M. A., D. D. 1884-1885, Rev. E. Embree Hoss, M. A., D. D. and since that time, Thomas W. Jordan, Rev. James M. Atkins and Rev. R. G. Waterhouse. The location of Emory and Henry College is in a beautiful valley nine miles east of Abingdon, just south of the extreme west end of Walker's mountain, and cannot be excelled for its beauty and fertility anywhere in our country. The college is situated 2,000 feet above the level of the sea, with the White Top mountain in plain view, and directly upon the line of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway. LIBERTY HALL ACADEMY. Liberty Hall Academy was founded in 1866—thirty-seven years ago. It has ranked high as a school ever since. Its founder was Rev. James Keys, who had taught successfully for many years in Johnson county, Tennessee, and was driven out by the war. It is a commodious brick building, built at Mr. Keys' own expense. He, as principal, assisted by his daughter, Mrs. T. W. Hughes, had charge until 1878. His patronage exceeded that of any other school in the county except Emory. In the year above mentioned Mr. Keys retired on account of age and infirmity, and the property was purchased by a board of gentlemen of the Presbyterian Church. This purchase was made in 1878. The object was to continue the school, and to that end they signed and placed an agreement on record that the property should be used for school purposes forever. The first principal after the purchase was Professor T. W. Hughes. He continued in charge seven years, and was succeeded by Rev. Mr. McClure, who resigned at the end of the second year. He was succeeded by a number of gentlemen who remained for brief periods and whose success was not conspicuous. Professor W. J. Edmondson, at present county superintendent, became principal in 1891, and continued in charge six years. The character of the school was fully sustained under him and the patronage very large. His successor was Professor W. G. Edmondson, who resigned at the end of the second year, and was succeeded by Professor Sam Edmondson, the present principal. Liberty Hall has been a school for thirty-seven years. Its average patronage has been large. Its instructors have generally been men of first-class attainments. Its standard has always been high, and no similar institution in Southwest Virginia has fitted as many young men for college or sent into the ranks so many of the teachers of our common schools. While Liberty Hall Academy is nominally Presbyterian, it is not in any sense denominational. An effort is now being made to secure an endowment of $10,000, by which means the salary of the principal will be secured, and rates of tuition correspondingly lowered. BARRACK INSTITUTE. While the writer has but little information in regard to Solomon G. Barrack or the history of the institute established by his donation near Love's Mill in this county, he thinks it worthy of note that Solomon G. Barrack, a citizen of this county, and of very limited means, by his will, which was executed prior to the war between the States, devised the larger portion of his estate to Leonidas Love, to be invested by him upon undoubted security as a school fund, and directed that said fund be kept on interest, and the interest expended yearly in paying the salary of a competent teacher under the direction of Leonidas Love, David Jones, Oscar Love and Charles Meek, and by the same will directed the erection of a schoolhouse upon a piece of land near Love's Mill, Virginia. The gentlemen above named were incorporated under the name and style of Trustees of Barrack Institute in the year 1866. The school-house provided for was erected under their supervision and for now more than thirty-five years the youth of that community have been enjoying the benefits of educational advantages that they would not have enjoyed had the founder of this institution been actuated by selfish motives alone and conferred his property upon his relatives. The memory of Solomon G. Barrack is entitled to a position along-side that of William King, and the memory of both should be honored and respected by the citizens of this county. WHITE TOP MOUNTAIN.† † For illustration see page 282. * * Charles B. Coale. "This is a peak in the Appalachian range, here more familiarly known by the local name of Iron mountain, and near the point where the three States of Virginia, Tennessee and North Carolina all unite at a common corner. It is about twenty miles from Abingdon the way the crow flies, though perhaps thirty by the intricate bridle paths through intervening mountains, by which it is approached. Until within a few years comparatively, owing to its inaccessibility, it was almost in its primitive state, and visited only by hunters and trappers, and here and there a "squatter," who may have fled to its fastnesses to evade those penal exactments which a certain class of men in most communities deem oppressive. It is some 5,000 feet high from base to summit, and upwards of 6,000 feet above the level of the sea. Its summit is a vast field comprising from 300 to 500 acres, without a tree or shrub, and covered with a luxuriant growth of wild grass resembling that of our northwestern prairies, which is highly nutritious and cropped with insatiable avidity by vast herds of stock driven from the neighboring settlements to graze and fatten. During the months of May and June, this field, as well as a large portion of the wooded parts of the mountain, is gorgeously carpeted with wild flowers of every imaginable hue, and so fragrant that their perfume is often wafted a considerable distance on the wings of the wind, which sometimes sweeps across the broad fields like the dying throes of a hurricane, with fitful shrieks of wild and melancholy music. Bordering this natural field are great numbers of native gooseberry and currant bushes, which yield their acrid fruits in neverfailing abundance, and the wild leopard lily, springing from its rocky bed, sways to and fro and scatters its rich perfume as the blast sweeps by. Upon the very summit, various springs of ice-cold water gush from the rocks and leap down the declivities, babbling their wild music as they disappear among the magnificent rhododendrons and the dazzling crimson of the Indian pink. These waters are so pure and light that they never oppress, no matter how freely the thirsty visitor may quaff them. The field above referred to is bordered by a very singular as well as very beautiful growth of timber, known in that region by the name of Lashorn. Some of these trees grow to an immense height, but generally are not more than from thirty to fifty feet high, and, what is very remarkable, where not crowded they are perfectly flat on top, spreading out to a diameter of from fifteen to thirty feet. It is a species of, and very much resembles, Norway spruce, an ornamental tree often found in the yards of our more elegant city residences. The Lashorn of White Top mountain is peculiar to that locality, and of the thousands that have been transplanted, not one has ever been known to grow, though some have lived several years. The limbs at the top where they spread out are so tenacious and inflexible, and so closely interlaced, that the writer has seen as many as twenty persons standing and stepping about upon the top of the same tree at the same time. It is very easy to ascend and descend, as the limbs usually begin at the ground, and being cut off about a foot from the trunk, a very convenient "Indian ladder" is formed, and then a hole being cut through the foliage in the centre of the top, it is not difficult for even a lady to ascend and step out upon the vernal platform. Where the forest of this singular and beautiful growth is dense there is no undergrowth, the trees limbless to the height of forty or fifty feet, the tops intermingling and forming a canopy the sun can scarcely penetrate, and the earth covered with a carpet of lichen moss which feels to the tread as soft and elastic as a sponge. During the summer months these trees are literally alive with snow birds, the little creatures congregating here in millions to build their habitations and rear their young. Notwithstanding the romantic beauty of this grand elevation, and the exhilarating effects of the highly rarified atmosphere upon the system, hundreds and thousands have lived and died within sight of it without ever having paid it a visit. The reason for this has been the difficulty of access, want of accommodations in the vicinity, and the mere cattle paths by which it is approached through deep and intricate gorges, over steep foot-hills, and through almost impenetrable laurel jungles, sometimes infested by bears, wolves, wild-cats and rattlesnakes. There are but few of these "varmints" there now. The view from the summit of the White Top is grand beyond description or even conception. Looking toward the south, you have within the scope of vision, stretching away from east to west, the Blue Ridge Range, which, in the dim distance, looks like an azure band bordering the horizon, with here and there a tall peak hiding its head in the clouds. To the east, mountain piled upon mountain meets the view, their gentler slopes in places dotted with "clearings," and a column of smoke, here ascending and there lying in long folds along the mountain side, denoting the rude habitation of the ruder "squatter." Looking toward the north you have the grand old Cumberland range, the barrier that divides the "Dark and Bloody Ground" from the Old Dominion, as if swelling up from an ocean of green, and struggling to lift itself above the vapor that hangs lazily upon its sides. To the west the view, though less imposing, is not less beautiful. You have before you the broad valley of the Holston, which, although diversified with hill and dale, bold promontories and pine-clad ridges, still, from the altitude from which you look out upon it, has the appearance of a vast sea dotted with picturesque islands. In the distance the spires and tin roofs of the town of Abingdon glisten in the sunlight, large plantations look like blankets spread out in the forest, and at intervals, as it dashes out from behind a bluff, or winds its way through a green pasture, may the White Top Fork of Laurel be seen, like a serpentine thread of silver, its sparkling waters shimmering like diamonds among the foliage and wild flowers upon its bank. The writer of this has enjoyed the luxury of many a magnificent scene in his wanderings, but has never seen that from the summit of the White Top excelled, or even equaled. He was there on one occasion when a storm came riding on the blast more than a thousand feet below where a company of gentlemen were standing. The whole valley was shrouded as with a pall. The deep-toned thunder bellowed below, preceded by brilliant flashes of lightning, illuminating the dark bosom of the cloud. The scene was awfully grand, and so far transcends the powers of mortal description, that he would not dare attempt it." NATURAL BRIDGE AND TUNNEL OF SCOTT COUNTY. One of the curiosities of Southwest Virginia is the Natural Tunnel and Bridge of Scott county. It spans a turbulent and rapid stream bearing the name of Stock creek, and like the Natural Bridge of Rockbridge county has a public road passing over it. It is not so perfect a bridge as that of Rockbridge county, but is much grander in proportion and is laid out upon a much more stupendous scale. It is by actual measurement 420 feet high, about twice as high as the Natural Bridge of Rockbridge county, and the face of the structure is as smooth and perpendicular as if fashioned by the skill of a mason. Its imperfections consist in being much wider than long, and in the small proportion of arch to the immense mass of rock above it. It is really more of a tunnel than a bridge, although a public road crosses the chasm upon it. The tunnel is not straight, but is in the shape of an S, and from two to three hundred yards in length."* * Charles B. Coale. The track of the Virginia and Southwestern Railroad is located through the tunnel, and the arch is far more than sufficient for the passage of the train. In the vicinity of the tunnel there are several large caves in which are found a great variety of stalactites and stalagmites in all stages of formation, and in these caves are found Indian bones and many Indian relics. SALTVILLE VALLEY. The location of the Saltworks in this county was surveyed by John Buchanan, a deputy surveyor of Augusta county, for Charles Campbell, on December 12, 1748, and in the plat that was returned with the survey,† † Surveyor's record, Augusta county, Staunton, Va. the words "Buffalo Lick," are written, and a patent for the same was procured from the Governor of Virginia in 1753. Charles Campbell was the father of General William Campbell, of King's mountain celebrity, and, upon his death, General Campbell became the owner of this tract of land, but the presence of salt water upon this property was not discovered until about the time of the death of General William Campbell, which occurred in 1781. General William Campbell left two children, Sarah Buchanan Campbell and Charles Henry Campbell, the latter dying at the age of five years, and Colonel Arthur Campbell and Colonel William Christian, upon the death of General Campbell, qualified as guardians of his children, and they proceeded to improve this property to a considerabe extent. When the General Assembly of Virginia voted Charles Henry Campbell five thousand acres of land in consideration of the distinguished services of his father, Colonel Arthur Campbell, his guardian, entered this grant in the name of Charles Henry Campbell on lands adjoining the Salt Lick tract, and this land passed, upon the death of Charles Henry Campbell, to his sister, Miss Sarah Buchanan Campbell, afterwards Mrs. General Francis Preston. Some years after the death of General Campbell, his widow married General William Russell, who moved with his family to the Salt Lick in February, 1788, and built what was afterwards known as the "Madam Russell" house. General Russell dug a well on the margin of the flat in front of his house, obtained salt water, and built a furnace and salt houses; the furnace was an open shed, and the kettles were the camp kettles of that day, of a capacity of from eight to ten gallons. A dispute arose between General Arthur Campbell and General William Russell, and, in 1789, the court appointed Colonel Thomas Madison, an uncle of Sarah Buchanan Campbell, her guardian in the place of Colonels Campbell and Christian. In 1790 Colonel Thomas Madison removed to the Salt Lick, built a log cabin upon the location of what was afterwards known as the Preston House, and, digging a well, began the manufacture of salt, and continued to manufacture it at this place until the marriage of his ward to General Francis Preston in 1793. In the meantime General William Russell had died at the home of his son, Robert L. Russell, in Culpeper county, on the 14th of January, 1793. In 1795 General Francis Preston built an addition to the log cabin of Thomas Madison, and, in 1797, upon his retirement from the Congress of the United States, moved with his family to the Salt Lick, and made his home there until the year 1810, when he removed to Abingdon. Soon after General Preston located at the Salt Lick, he had another well dug near that of Colonel Madison, and enlarged the furnaces and the kettles. In 1795 William King bought 150 acres to the west of the Preston tract, and in 1799 erected furnaces and other buildings thereon and began the manufacture of salt. On the 20th of February, 1801, he rented the Preston Salines for the period of ten years, for $12,000 per year, and manufactured salt with great success until the date of his death, which occurred in 1808. From that time until the year 1819, the works were carried on by James King, William Trigg, Mary King, Charles S. Carson, executor of James King, and Lilburn L. L. Henderson, executor of William Trigg. On the 17th of June, 1819, the Saltworks were leased to John Saunders for five years from August 1, 1819, at an annual rental of $30,000, but Saunders, during the following years, assigned his lease to James White, who renewed the lease and continued his operations until September 2, 1833. The Saltworks were then leased to Alexander McCall and William King at an annual rental of $15,972 for the King Saltworks, and $16,000 for the Preston Salines, during the life of Mrs. William Trigg, and they continued in possession of the property until 1845, when Thomas L. Preston took charge of the Preston Saline, and King and McCall and Findlay, Mitchell &amp; Company took joint possession of the King Saltworks. In 1846 Thomas L. Preston rented the King estate from the court at an annual rental of $16,000 for five years, and at the expiration of his lease, Wyndham Robertson became the lessee thereof for the period of five years, and was in turn succeeded by Thomas L. Preston, who, in the year 1858, rented both estates to Spencer, Ackerman &amp; Company. In 1863, Stuart, Palmer and Parker purchased the Preston property, and in 1864 a joint stock company of the two estates was formed under the title of the Holston Salt and Plaster Company, and this company continued business until 1893, when the present proprietors of the Mathieson Alkali Works became the owners of the two estates. The King Salines, in the year 1819, produced from 90,000 to 100,000 bushels of salt per year, and in 1861-1865 the production of the Saltworks was many times greater than in the year 1819. The larger portion of all the salt used in the Southern States during that time was supplied from the Saltworks, it being a common thing to see as many as a thousand salt wagons at one time at the Saltworks during the period mentioned. Since 1893 the present company have manufactured soda and other alkalies upon an extensive scale, and employ hundreds of hands. In the eighteenth century, and soon after the discovery of salt water at the Salt Lick, the bones of a mammoth, the king of the land animals, were dug up by the laborers at the Preston Salines. They were from three to seven feet below the surface of earth, and furnished convincing proof that the mammoth was formerly an inhabitant of this country. NEWSPAPERS. By the year 1806, the enterprising citizens of this county had secured the services of a printer, and a newspaper outfit had arrived at Abingdon, and on the 4th day of January, 1806, the first newspaper published in this portion of Virginia was given to the public. The editor of this paper was John G. Ustick, who afterwards married a Miss Berry, of this county, and the name of the paper was the Holston Intelligencer and Abingdon Advertiser. This paper was published every Tuesday, and the subscription price was $2 per annum, payable half-yearly in advance, if the subscription was paid in cash, but if paid in produce the subscription was required to be paid for the entire year in advance. When the subscriber neglected to pay his subscription in advance, the price was fifteen shillings per annum, half of which was to be collected at any period after the commencement of each six months, subscriptions to the paper to be withdrawn at the end of each six months on the payment of arrearages, but not otherwise. The terms of advertising were 62 1-2 cents per square for the first insertion and three dollars for chancery notices. This paper was ably edited by Mr. Ustick, was uncompromising in its Republicanism, advocating the policies of Madison and supporting his administration upon all occasions. In the year 1812, Mr. Ustick changed the name of this paper from the Holston Intelligencer and Abingdon Advertiser, to the Political Prospect, and continued to publish the Political Prospect until the year 1830. Mr. Ustick was not only an enterprising editor, but he was a patriotic citizen, and in February, 1815, being a member of the Rifle Company formed at Abingdon, he accompanied this company upon their expedition to Norfolk and was absent from his home for nearly five months, as he says, "in the service of a righteous government and a holy cause." The descendants of the editor of the first newspaper published in this portion of Virginia have entirely disappeared from among our people. Mr. Ustick was succeeded by James Alexander, who published a newspaper in Abingdon from 1830-1835, under the title of the Virginia Republican. As to the character of this paper I can say nothing, as I have been unable to obtain a copy of the same. Alexander was succeeded by J. W. Lampkin, who published a newspaper in Abingdon from 1835-1838, called the Virginia Statesman. In the year 1838, Mr. Lampkin formed a partnership with Charles B. Coale, and this partnership published the Southwest Virginian from 1838 to 1840, in the old frame building that stood on the southeast corner of the jail lot in the rear of the courthouse. No copy of the Virginia Statesman or Southwest Virginian is now in existence, and nothing is known of the policy or character of these papers. The editors of these papers were men of character and ability, John W. Lampkin being a young lawyer of fine attainments. He subsequently married and removed to Russell county, where his descendants are to be found at this time, while Charles B. Coale continued to reside in Abingdon, and won a place in the hearts of the people of this country that will be forgotten only when the sons of the fathers who had the pleasure of reading the old Abingdon Virginian have all passed away. In 1840, John N. Humes became the owner and editor of the Southwest Virginian and published the same in the building occupied by the Academy of Visitation east of the creek in East Abingdon. While no copy of this paper has been preserved, there can be no question as to its politics, as John N. Humes was one of the leaders of the Whig party, at the time in question, in Southwest Virginia. In this year, he was the elector for this district upon the presidential ticket headed by William Henry Harrison. In March, 1841, George R. Barr and Charles B. Coale became the owners of the Southwest Virginian and began the publication of the Abingdon Virginian as a Whig paper in the town of Abingdon, and continued the publication of this paper until the year 1873, with but one interruption. When the town of Abingdon was destroyed by fire on the 15th of December, 1864, the Abingdon Virginian was published in the brick building opposite the Colonade Hotel (now occupied by C. A. Pobst), and, of course, was destroyed at the same time that the building was burned. The publication of the Abingdon Virginian was resumed in December, 1865. This paper during the thirty-three years that it was published by Coale &amp; Barr, was, beyond doubt, one of the most readable and deservedly popular country newspapers that have ever been furnished to the public in this section of Virginia. During the war between the States, notwithstanding the great difficulties which confronted the newspaper publisher, the Abingdon Virginian never failed to stand nobly by its people or to issue weekly until the destruction of its plant as before described. In the year 1863, the following advertisement appeared in the Abingdon Virginian: "RAGS! "We call upon everybody who has rags, rich and poor, old and young, learned and unlearned, to send them to us and get four cents per pound, or more if demanded. We are obliged to have them or stop printing. So send them along for humanity's sake, and help us to keep the machine in motion." In the year 1873, the Abingdon Virginian was transferred to George R. Dunn, and soon afterwards became the property of George W. Ward. The Abingdon Virginian, as published by Coale &amp; Barr, advocated in a high-toned and able manner the Whig cause, and the effect upon the politics of the people would have been exceedingly dangerous if not counteracted. In December, 1841, at the instance of the Democratic leaders in Washington county, Robert Latham became the editor and W. R. Fitzsimmons the publisher of a Democratic paper in the town of Abingdon called The Banner. This paper, a copy of which is now in existence, was a very creditable publication. In the copy now in existence is to be found an account of a Democratic mass-meeting held in the town of Abingdon on the second of March, 1843, at which meeting Colonel Samuel E. Goodson was nominated for the Legislature, and in the proceedings of the meeting Colonel Harold Smyth, Colonel William Byars, Robert Latham, Dr. Nick Snead, Tobias Smith, John W. S. Watson, Parker Smith and James Davis took an active part. This paper survived but a few years, and was succeeded by a paper called the Jacksonian, edited by W. R. Fitzsimmon. The Jacksonian was published in a house owned by Jackson Toncray, on the lot now owned by S. N. Honaker, opposite the former residence of James K. Gibson in East Abingdon. The Jacksonian ceased to exist in 1846, and the outfit was sold to Dr. H. F. Peery, who removed the same to Jeffersonville, now Tazewell Courthouse, Virginia, and, in the year 1847, began the publication of the Jeffersonville Democrat. On the 28th of April, 1849, Leonidas Baugh, of Abingdon, began the publication of the Abingdon Democrat, a paper strong in its advocacy of Democratic principles, to which the greater part of its space was devoted. This paper thrived for a number of years, but was transferred by Mr. Baugh some time after his appointment as postmaster at Abingdon, in 1853, to John B. Floyd, and the paper was thereafter, until the year 1857, published by J. M. H. Brunet, of Petersburg, who soon died, and then the paper passed into the hands of Stephen J. Pendleton. In the year 1857, this paper was sold at public auction to pay the debts of Mr. Pendleton, and Henry W. Baker became the editor and owner thereof, and continued to publish said paper until 1861, when the plant was sold to the Southern Advocate, Goodson, Virginia. From this time until the year 1876, the Abingdon Virginian was the only newspaper published in Abingdon. In April, 1882, George W. Gary, of Richmond, began the publication in Abingdon of a monthly paper called The Trade Journal, and continued the publication of the same until the year 1883, when he became the owner and editor of the Abingdon Virginian. Mr. Gary conducted an excellent and successful paper until the year 1890, when the entire outfit was sold and transferred to the Abingdon Publishing Company, which company had become the owner of the Standard, a Democratic newspaper that had been established in Abingdon in the year 1876 and was edited by Hindlay Harris, afterwards by Samuel P. Withers and then by R. E. Hardwick. The Virginian, under the management of Judge Ward, strongly advocated the cause of the Readjuster party in Virginia. After the retirement of Judge Ward from the Abingdon Virginian, he became the owner and editor of the Southwest Examiner, a Read-juster-Democratic paper, but after Judge Ward went upon the bench the Southwest Examiner passed into the hands of R. E. Hardwick and in a short while ceased to exist. The Abingdon Virginian, during the ownership of the Abingdon Publishing Company, was edited by Thomas H. Mason and W. F. Smith. While the paper was well edited, it was a financial failure, and in the year 1896 was sold at public auction and purchased by L. P. Summers. The Virginian from this time till June, 1901, was an advocate of Republican principles and was a success financially. Upon the acquisition of the Abingdon Virginian by Summers in 1896, and during the five years of his ownership, a number of efforts were made by the advocates of the Democratic party to establish a Democratic paper in the town. In the year 1897, the Glade Spring Citizen was removed to Abingdon and began publication as a Democratic paper, "The Citizen," with G. C. Porterfield as editor, but within the year the newspaper outfit became the property of the editor of the Virginian, and Mr. Porterfield became a strong advocate of the Republican party. In the year 1899, J. W. Lyons, of Greenville, Tennessee, became the editor of a newspaper in Abingdon, to which was given the name of the Abingdon Democrat. This effort upon the part of Mr. Lyons proved a failure and in the spring of the year 1900 he returned to Greenville, his former home. In the fall of the year 1900, Thomas S. Hamilton and George H. McCormick began the publication of the Washington Herald, a Democratic newspaper, in the Scott building in West Abingdon. This venture also proved a failure, and the property of the Herald was sold and transferred to the editor of the Virginian, in the same year, since which time no effort has been made to establish a rival newspaper to the Virginian in Abingdon. On the night of the 29th of May, 1898, the Greenway store was destroyed by fire; the offices of the Abingdon Virginian caught therefrom and the entire outfit was destroyed, but by the fall of the same year a one-story brick building had been erected upon the site of the former frame building and the publication of the Virginian was resumed. The Virginian became the property of E. M. Slack by purchase on June 11, 1901, and has since been edited by him. The present editor of the Abingdon Virginian is young, intelligent, independent and enterprising to a degree that is seldom excelled in this country, and in the opinion of the author he is the best-equipped newspaper man that the town has seen in many years. The newspaper of which he is the editor is beyond question the best country newspaper to be found in the Southwest. JUDICIARY. A distinguished historian has said that "the laws of a country are necessarily connected with everything belonging to the people of it, so that a thorough knowledge of them and their progress would inform us of everything that was most useful to be known about them, and one of the greatest imperfections of historians in general is owing to their ignorance of law."* * Priestly. While a thorough knowledge of the law is necessary to a complete understanding of the history of a country, at this point we regret the necessity that compels to a brief notice of the courts that have administered the law in this Commonwealth and county. Prior to the Revolutionary war, the laws of this Commonwealth were administered in the county or monthly courts and in a general court which was held first at Jamestown and afterwards at Williamsburg. The county or monthly courts were composed of a number of persons commissioned by the Governor and Council, and theirs was an extensive jurisdiction, while the general court was composed of the Governor and Council, any five constituting a court, and it had jurisdiction to hear and determine all causes whatsoever relating to or concerning any person or persons, ecclesiastical or civil, or to any person or thing of any nature whatsoever, whether brought before them by original process, appeal from an inferior court or by any other way or means, its jurisdiction being limited only to controversies of the value of ten pounds sterling or 2,000 pounds of tobacco and upwards. It had exclusive criminal jurisdiction of all cases of free persons wherein the judgment on conviction was loss of life or member. After the Revolution, the county courts were continued and a Court of Appeals, High Court of Chancery, a General Court and a Court of Admiralty were established. The judges of said courts were chosen by the General Assembly and commissioned by the Governor. The Court of Appeals was established in May, 1779, and was composed of the judges of the High Court of Chancery, General Court and Court of Admiralty, until 1788, when five judges were chosen by the General Assembly and commissioned by the Governor. This court, from the time of its establishment until 1830, was the supreme civil tribunal of the State, and since that time it has been the supreme civil and criminal tribunal of the State. The first president of this court was Edmund Pendleton. The General Court was composed of ten judges and was the supreme criminal tribunal of the State until 1830, when it was abolished. The Admiralty Court ceased to exist upon the adoption of the Federal Constitution. County Courts. "The institution of the County Court originated as early as 1623-4; and as it is the most ancient, so it has ever been one of the most important, of our institutions, not only in respect of the administration of justice, but for police and economy. They were first called monthly courts. At first only two of them were established, and their jurisdiction was jealously limited to petty controversies, reserving for the party cast the right of appeal to the Governor and Council, who were the judges of what were then called quarter courts. In 1642-3, the style of monthly courts was changed to that of county courts, the colonial assembly having previously begun and continuing thenceforward to enlarge their duties, powers and jurisdictions and to extend the system to every county, as it was laid off. As early as 1645 they had been matured into courts of general jurisdiction, in law and equity, and the most important duties in the matters of police and economy were confided to them. In 1661-2, the Governor and Council were constituted itinerant justices, to sit in the county courts, but that provision was repealed the next year. Hitherto the judges of the county courts had been styled commissioners of the county courts, but in 1661-2 it was enacted that they should take the oath of justices of the peace and be called justices of the peace. These tribunals now assumed a perfectly regular form and their functions were ever after so important that their institution may well be considered as a part of the Constitution, both of the colonial and the present government. No material change was introduced by the revolution in their jurisdiction or general powers or duties of any kind."* * Henning's Statutes at Large. The county court remained unchanged until the year 1850, and it is impossible for any man to estimate the character and utility of this system without actual experience of its operation. The members of this court, prior to 1850, were recommended to the Governor by the county courts of their respective counties, were commissioned by the Governor and held office during good behavior. They served without pay and were selected by reason of their character and ability. The Constitution of 1850 made the members of this court elective by the people, and they were allowed a small fee for their services. From this time until the year 1870, we find a great deterioration in the character of the members of this court, and its efficacy was to a great extent destroyed. This court was abolished by the Constitution of 1868. Can anyone question the character and efficiency of a court presided over by such men as Arthur Campbell, William Campbell, Daniel Smith, William Edmiston, James Dysart, John Kinkead, Robert Craig, James White, John Goodson, Robert Davis, John Gibson, Reuben Bradley, James Cummings, John Preston, Jr., Francis Preston, Charles Tate, William P. Thompson, Thomas McChesney, John M. Preston, John Eakin, M. B. Tate, Tobias Smith, Henry Davenport and many others, presiding justices of this court during its existence? Upon the abolition of the old county court by the Constitution of 1868, a new institution came into existence, to-wit: the county court of the present time. This court exercised a criminal jurisdiction concurrent with the Circuit Court and a limited civil jurisdiction. The first session of this court in this county was held on the 25th day of April, 1870, Judge R. M. Page presiding, Leonidas Baugh clerk, and Beverly R. Johnston Commonwealth's Attorney. This court has been abolished by the Constitution of 1902, and will cease to exist on the first day of February, 1904, and such a thing as a county court will no longer be heard of in this Commonwealth, after an existence of nearly 300 years. The judges presiding in this court since the date of its formation in 1870 are as follows: 1870-1880, R. M. Page. 1880-1881, George W. Ward. 1882-1886, William F. Rhea. 1886-1887, Francis B. Hutton. 1887-1897, George W. Ward. 1897-1904, David C. Cummings, Jr. The attorneys representing the Commonwealth in this county from the organization of the county until the year 1850 were appointed first by the Attorney-General of the State, upon the recommendation of the county court, and were after that time elected by the county court. The first Commonwealth's Attorney of Washington county, being the first lawyer qualifying to practise in the courts of this county, was Ephraim Dunlop, who came from Pennsylvania. He had but one leg, the other having been amputated above the middle of the thigh. He had some capacity, but was a drunkard. He was appointed prosecuting attorney for this county in the year 1777, and was pretty severe upon the Tories, many of whom had taken refuge in the mountains. On one occasion Dr. Brooks, whose right arm was palsied, was passing along the road below town when he found Dunlop, who had fallen from his horse, lying with his foot in the stirrup and his head on the ground, the horse standing perfectly still and quiet. The Doctor having no use of his right arm and Dunlop having but one leg, made the case a difficult one to decide what he should do. He dismounted, however, and succeeded in getting Dunlop into his saddle, intending to take him to the next house. After balancing and straightening Dunlop as well as he could in his saddle, he mounted his own horse and they started, but in a few yards Dunlop made a move in his saddle and down he went again. The horse seemed to be conscious of the state of things and stood still again. The Doctor dismounted again and raised him to his horse's back, then, by riding close to him on his leg side, he kept him from falling until he brought him to a house, half a mile from where he fell. When sober, Dunlop was interesting. At the bar he would rise and place his stump of a thigh on the bar and in that manner steady himself and then proceed with whatever he had to say to the court. He was listened to with attention. After the courts were organized in Sullivan county, he attended them, and some ten or fifteen years afterwards died on the road between Abingdon and Blountville. I believe he had no family.* * David Campbell MSS. Since the year 1852, the attorneys representing the Commonwealth in this county have been elected by the people. The attorneys representing the Commonwealth in this county since the organization of the county have been as follows: 1777, Ephraim Dunlop. ...., Benjamin Estill. 1831, Henry St. John Dixon. 1831-1837, Edward Campbell. 1837-1855, Samuel Logan. 1855-...., George Eakin Naff. 1855-1863, John H. Ernest. 1863-1865, Joseph T. Campbell. 1865-1869, Rees B. Edmondson. 1869-...., Henry C. Auvil. 1869-1870, J. S. Slater. 1870-...., Beverly R. Johnston. 1870-1872, James L. White. 1872-1884, Connally F. Trigg. 1884-1885, George W. Ward. 1885-1887, John L. Rowan. 1887-1891, John C. Summers. 1891-1895, Francis B. Hutton. 1895-1904, Peter J. Davenport. The clerks of the county court from the organization of the government of this county until the year 1852, were elected by the county court, and since the year 1852, they have been elected by the people. The clerks of this court from its first organization until the present time have been as follows: 1777-1779, David Campbell. 1779-1824, John Campbell. 1824-1837, David Campbell. 1837-1858, Jacob Lynch. 1858-1865, John G. Kreger. 1865-1869, James C. Campbell. 1869-1870, Charles McDougal. 1870-1871, Leonidas Baugh. 1871-1887, William G. G. Lowry. 1887-1897, David C. Cummings, Jr. 1897-1904, Robert Preston Cummings. District Courts. The General Assembly at its session in the year 1784, for the purpose of rendering the administration of justice more expeditious and convenient and less burthensome to individuals and to the Commonwealth, passed an Act establishing courts of assize throughout the Commonwealth, for the trial of issues and inquiry of damages, in suits then pending in the General Court, and such as may thereafter be brought, and also for the trial of all treasons, felonies and other crimes and misdemeanors that should be brought before the court. This court was to be held by two judges of the General Court, and it was directed that all verdicts of said court should be certified to the General Court at Richmond. The State was divided into districts. The counties of Montgomery and Washington formed one district, and it was directed that this court of assize should meet at Washington Courthouse and Fort Chiswell, alternately, on the 10th day of May and on the 11th day of October of each year. This Act never went into operation, but after several suspensions it was succeeded by an Act of the Assembly, in the year 1788, establishing district courts. The Act establishing the district courts became a law on the 22d day of December, 1788, and directed that the Commonwealth, except the district of Kentucky, should be divided into districts, and a superior court held in each on the 9th of June and the 9th of November in each year. The counties of Washington, Montgomery and Russell composed one district, and it was directed that a court should be held at Washington and Montgomery courthouses alternately, on the 2d day of May and the 2d day of October in each year. This court was to be held by two judges of the General Court assigned for that purpose. The jurisdiction of the district courts, as fixed by this Act, was as follows: "Over all persons in all causes, matters or things at common law, then cognizable in the General Court, amounting to thirty pounds sterling money or 3,000 pounds of tobacco, whether brought before the court by original process or by appeal from the County Court." This court was given the power to hear and determine all treasons, murders, felonies and other crimes and misdemeanors committed within their district. Claiborne Watkins was the first clerk of this court, and lived at Abingdon and discharged the duties of this office for many years. The Act establishing the district courts was amended in December, 1789, and it was directed that Washington, Wythe and Russell counties should form a district, that the next court for said district should be held at the courthouse of the county of Wythe, late the courthouse of the county of Montgomery (Fort Chiswell), and that, thereafter, every court for said district should be held at Washington courthouse. This court continued to exist until it was succeeded by the Superior Court of Laws, established in the year 1808. The General Assembly in the year 1777, established a High Court of Chancery composed of three judges selected by the General Assembly and commissioned by the Governor, to hold office during good behavior. This court was held at Williamsburg and afterwards at Richmond, in the months of April and September of each year, with a general jurisdiction over all persons and causes in chancery, whether by original process or appeal, where the amount in controversy exceeded ten pounds. The judges of this court were afterwards reduced to one, George Wythe, who was the president of the first court. On the 23d of January, 1802, the General Assembly of Virginia divided the State into three districts and established a superior court of chancery in each. The county of Washington was included in the Western District, and the High Court of Chancery for this district was directed to be held at Staunton on the 12th of March, the 1st of July and the 15th of November of each year. This court exercised the jurisdiction formerly exercised by the High Court of Chancery as originally established, and was to be held by a judge selected by the General Assembly and commissioned by the Governor. The Honorable John Brown, of Staunton, was elected judge of this court and discharged the duties of the same until the year 1827, when he was succeeded by the Honorable Allen Taylor, of Botetourt county, who discharged the duties of this office until the year 1831, when this court was merged into the Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery. The General Assembly in 1818 divided the Commonwealth into nine districts, instead of three districts as formerly, and directed that a Superior Court of Chancery should be held in each of said districts. The counties of Lee, Russell, Scott, Washington, Tazewell, Wythe, Grayson, Giles and Montgomery composed the Eighth District, and a Superior Court of Chancery was held at Wythe courthouse on the Monday first succeeding each term of the Superior Court of Law for the said county in every year, and after this time a Superior Court of Chancery was held at Wythe courthouse, by Judge Brown until 1827, and by Judge Taylor until 1831. A portion of the records of this court are still to be found at Wythe courthouse, and present to the practicing attorney at this day a clear idea of the proceedings of the court of that time. During the existence of this court, every paper connected with a chancery cause was recorded in the minute book of the court, and in one case decided by this court the process, bill, answer, depositions of witnesses and other papers connected with the suit fill one entire book of several hundred pages.* * Pierce vs. Jackson, etc. The General Assembly, on the 1st of February, 1808, amended the Act of 1789 establishing the district courts, divided the Commonwealth into twelve districts, established a superior court of law in each of said districts and directed that a judge of the General Court should be allotted to each of said districts and should hold a superior court of law twice a year at the courthouse of each county in said district. The counties of Grayson, Washington, Lee, Russell, Tazewell, Giles, Montgomery and Wythe composed the Fourth Circuit, and the Hon. William Brockenbrough, a judge of the General Court, was assigned to this district and discharged the duties of the same with marked ability until May, 1811, when he was succeeded by the Hon. Peter Johnson,† † Judges Brockenbrough and Johnston exchanged circuits, Johnston being a native of Prince Edward county. a judge of the General Court, who discharged the duties of the office until June 6th, 1831, when the Superior Court of Law was merged into the Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery. The General Assembly of Virginia, pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution of 1829-1830, rearranged the courts of the Commonwealth and established the Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery, which court superseded the Superior Court of Law and the Superior Court of Chancery. The first session of this court was held at Abingdon on the 6th of June, 1831, Benjamin Estill presiding. This court continued to be the principal court of this section until the year 1870, when some alterations were made in the jurisdiction of the court and the name was changed to the Circuit Court. The judges presiding in this court during its existence have been 1831-1852, Benjamin Estill. 1852-1857, George W. Hopkins. 1857-1862, Samuel V. Fulkerson. 1862-1869, John A. Campbell. 1869-1870, John W. Johnston. 1870-1895, John A. Kelly. 1895-1904, John P. Sheffey. Judge Fulkerson, in the spring of the year 1861, was elected colonel of the Thirty-seventh Virginia Regiment of Volunteer Infantry, in which capacity he served until the fall of 1862, when he was shot and killed in one of the battles near Richmond. During his absence in the army Judges Andrew S. Fulton, David McComas and G. D. Camden presided over the courts held at Abingdon. The Constitution adopted in the year 1902 made some alterations in the courts of the State, and the General Assembly of Virginia on the 12th day of February, 1903, elected Francis B. Hutton, of Abingdon, judge of the Twenty-third Circuit, composed of the counties of Russell, Washington and Smyth. Upon the organization of the district court in the year 1788, Claiborne Watkins was appointed clerk of the court, and, as far as I can ascertain, he and Andrew Russell performed the duties of this office until the year 1830. The clerks of the old District Court, the Superior Court of Law, the Superior Court of Chancery and the Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery were appointed by the court until the year 1852, and from that time they have been elected by the people. The clerks of the Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery and the Circuit Court have been as follows: 1831-1838, Andrew Russell. 1838-1852, Connally F. Trigg, Sr. 1852-1865, Peter J. Branch. 1865-1869, David Campbell Cummings, Sr. 1869-1870, John O'Neal. 1870-1871, Dr. A. R. Preston. 1871-1887, L. Thomson Cosby. 1887-1893, John G. Kreger. 1893-1904, John M. Kreger. When an effort was made to secure the photographs of the deceased judges of this court for use in this history, the propriety of securing and placing their photographs in the courthouse of this county was discussed by several members of the bar, and, as a result, a meeting of the bar was called for the 8th of October, 1901, which meeting, after discussing the matter, appointed Daniel Trigg, James L. White, F. B. Hutton, R. M. Page and L. P. Summers, a committee to secure the portraits of the deceased judges of this court and to make the necessary arrangements for hanging said portraits in the court-room of the court, and to wait upon the Board of Supervisors of this county and request that they place the court-room in a suitable condition for said portraits. This action of the bar was made an order of the Circuit Court. The committee appointed proceeded to the discharge of their duties and secured portraits of Judges Peter Johnston and John W. Johnston from Dr. George Ben Johnston, of Richmond, photographs of Judges Samuel V. Fulkerson and John A. Kelly from Colonel Samuel V. Fulkerson and Joseph L. Kelly, of Bristol, and photographs of Judges Estill, Hopkins and Campbell from friends. The Board of Supervisors in answer to the request of this committee appointed J. D. Williams, J. O. Susong and J. C. Hayter, of the board, and James L. White, W. I. Newton and F. B. Hutton outside thereof, a committee to superintend the repairs to the courthouse, and by the spring of the year 1903 the repairs were completed and the committee reported their proceedings to the judge of the Circuit Court. Their report was received and entered of record,† † Law Order Book, Circuit Court, K, page 133. and thereupon the court appointed L. P. Summers, Preston W. Campbell, John W. Neal, W. H. Robertson and John J. Stuart a committee to arrange a program for the exercises attending the presentation of the portraits of the deceased judges to the county of Washington. This committee arranged a program and reported their action to the court, which report was received and made a matter of record.* * Law Order Book, Circuit Court, K, page 116. The presentation exercises were held on the 11th day of May, 1903, and the following program was rendered on that occasion: Chairman, Judge John P. Sheffey. Secretary, John M. Kreger. Portrait of Judge Peter Johnston. Speech of presentation by Captain J. L. Whit Portrait of Judge Benj. Estill. Speech of presentation by L. P. Summers, Esquire. Portrait of Judge G. W. Hopkins. Speech of presentation by Daniel Trigg, Esquire. Portrait of Judge S. V. Fulkerson. Speech of presentation by Judge R. M. Page. Portrait of Judge John A. Campbell. Speech of presentation by William E. Burns, Esquire. Portrait of Judge John W. Johnston. Speech of presentation by D. F. Bailey, Esquire. Portrait of Judge John A. Kelly. Speech of presentation by Judge John A. Buchanan. Manuscript remarks of Hon. Patrick Hagan read by John J. Stuart, Esquire. Speech of acceptance on behalf of the Supervisors of Washington county, Judge F. B. Hutton. United States Circuit and District Courts. In the year 18—, the Congress of the United States created a district in Western Virginia, to which was given the name of the Western District of Virginia, and soon thereafter the court of said district was organized. For many years this court was held at Wytheville, but it was subsequently removed to Abingdon. This district at the present time is composed of the following counties: Alleghany, Albemarle, Amherst, Appomattox, Augusta, Bath, Bedford, Bland, Botetourt, Buchanan, Buckingham, Campbell, Carroll, Charlotte, Clarke, Craig, Cumberland, Dickenson, Floyd, Fluvanna, Franklin, Frederick, Giles, Grayson, Greene, Halifax, Henry, Highland, Lee, Madison, Montgomery, Nelson, Page, Patrick, Pulaski, Pittsylvania, Rappahannock, Roanoke, Rockbridge, Rockingham, Russell, Scott, Shenandoah, Smyth, Tazewell, Warren, Washington, Wise and Wythe. Courts are held at five points in the district, semi-annually, towit: Abingdon, Roanoke, Harrisonburg, Lynchburg and Danville. The jurisdiction of this court is confined to matters arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States. This court, from the time of its first meeting in Abingdon until the year 1891, held its sessions on the second floor of the county courthouse of this county. Some time previous to the year 1884, through the efforts of Colonel Abram Fulkerson and General William Mahone, the Congress of the United States appropriated money sufficient to erect a handsome courthouse in Abingdon for the accommodation of the United States courts, which courthouse was completed in the year 1891, at an expense to the United States of $85,000, including the furnishing of the same, and was occupied the same year. The judges of this court, so far as I have been able to ascertain, have been: 18—, Judge Caldwell, of Wheeling. 1839-1846, Isaac S. Pennypacker, of Harrisonburg. 1846-1871, John W. Brockenbrough, of Lexington. 1871-1883, Alexander Rives, of Albemarle. 1883-1900, John Paul, of Harrisonburg. 1900—, Henry Clay McDowell, of Big Stone Gap. The clerks of this court have been as follows: 1839—, Thomas L. Moore. 1839-1846, R. W. Moore. 1846-18—, Erasmus Stribling. 1861—, Joseph W. Caldwell. 1871-1874, E. S. Watson. 1874-1884, Benjamin Gildersleeve. 1884—, Isaac Chapman Fowler. The attorneys representing the United States in this court since 1871 are as follows: 1871—, Robert W. Hughes. 1871-1882, Warren S. Lurty. 1882-1885, Daniel Sheffey Lewis. 1885-1889, Henry C. Allen. 1889-1893, William E. Craig. 1893-1897, A. J. Montague. 1897-1901, T. M. Alderson. 1901-1905, Thomas Lee Moore. The marshals of this court since 1855 have been as follows: 1855—, Jefferson T. Martin. 1871-1878, Algernon S. Gray. 1878-1882, John F. Lewis. 1882-1886, John G. Watts. 1886-1887, Samuel L. Graham. 1887-1890, James R. Jordan. 1890-1893, John G. Watts. 1893-1898, George W. Levi. 1898-190-, S. Brown Allen. In addition to the officers above named, several of the citizens of this county and district, to-wit: F. B. Hutton, David F. Bailey, John J. Stuart and John C. Blair, have discharged the duties of assistant district attorney in this court with distinguished ability. PRESBYTERIANISM IN WASHINGTON COUNTY. The first settlers of Washington county were principally Presbyterian in belief and of Scotch-Irish descent, and as early as the year 1772 the Rev. John Craig and the Rev. James Campbell, Presbyterian ministers, had visited and preached to the settlers upon the frontiers (then Southwest Virginia). It may be thought strange that men situated as were the first settlers of this section would have need or would wish to be instructed in religious matters, as their lives were a constant effort to either kill their adversaries, the Indians, or to prevent the Indians from slaughtering themselves and families; but man is a religious being and cannot divest himself of his religious nature. Herodotus, the ancient traveler and the father of history, said that "cities without walls could be found and communities without pretence to arts, laws, or even morals, but no tribe or nation could be found without a religion." The idea of God is intuitive, inherent in the soul of man. And the first settlers of this section were not only susceptible to this idea, but as a rule they had been taught in their youth to honor and love their Creator in all their walks and under all circumstances. Prior to the year 1772, two congregations had been organized in this county, the one at Sinking Spring, the other at Ebbing Spring, and by the summer of 1773 these congregations had grown until their membership was one hundred and twenty-six persons, and these congregations extended a call to the Rev. Charles Cummings, who was then preaching at Brown's Meeting House, in Augusta county. This call was presented by Samuel Edmiston at a session of the Presbytery held at Brown's Meeting House on June 2, 1773. Mr. Cummings accepted the call and removed with his family to the neighborhood of the Sinking Spring church (Abingdon), purchased land and settled upon it. Mr. Cummings served the two congregations until the year 1780, when the Rev. Thomas Brown Craighead took charge of the Ebbing Spring congregation, while Mr. Cummings remained in charge of and served the Sinking Spring congregation faithfully and well until 1812, the date of his death. From the time Mr. Cummings commenced preaching at Sinking Spring up to about the year 1776, the men never went to church without being armed, and taking their families with them. On Sabbath mornings during this period, it was Mr. Cummings' custom, for he was always a very neat man in his dress, to dress himself, then put on his shot-pouch, shoulder his rifle, mount his dun stallion and ride off to church. There he met his gallant and intelligent congregation, each man with his rifle in his hand. When seated in the meeting house they presented altogether a most solemn and singular spectacle. Mr. Cummings' uniform habit, before entering the house, was to take a short walk alone whilst the congregation were seating themselves; he would then return, at the door hold a few words of conversation with some one of the elders of the church, then would walk gravely through the crowd, mount the steps of the pulpit, deposit his rifle in a corner near him, lay off his shot pouch and commence the solemn worship of the day. He would preach two sermons, having a short interval between them, and go home. The congregation was very large, and preaching was always well attended. On sacramental occasions, which were generally about twice a year, the table was spread in a grove near the church. He preached for many years, and until far advanced in life, to one of the largest, most respectable and most intelligent congregations ever assembled in Western Virginia.* * Governor David Campbell's MSS. In the year 1782, the elders of the Sinking Spring congregation were: Samuel Newell, Sr., George Finley, John Blackburn, John Davis, Andrew Willoughby, Sr., William Lowry and James Douglas. Mr. Cummings was a very zealous Whig and did much to fire the patriotism of his congregation and the settlers upon the frontiers. He was the first named on the Committee of Safety for Fincastle county and to his pen has been generally attributed the resolutions adopted by the freeholders of Fincastle county on the 20th of January, 1775. He was a member of Hanover Presbytery and assisted in the preparation of the petition for the abolition of the established church, which was presented to the General Assembly on the 24th of October, 1776, and after the organization of Washington county, in the year 1777, he was chairman of the Committee of Safety for this county during the Revolution, and never failed to serve his country in the cause of liberty when an opportunity afforded. An idea may be had of his influence and the dependence placed upon him by our leaders during the darkest days of the Revolution from a letter addressed to him by Colonel Arthur Campbell in June, 1778, upon his return from Richmond: "Yesterday I returned home, the Assembly having adjourned until the first Monday in October. The acts passed and a list of their titles I here enclose, together with an address of Congress to the people of America, for you to publish agreeably to the resolve. I wish you could make it convenient to preach at the lower meeting house in this county, if it was but a week day, as the contents of the address are of the most interesting nature, both as to the moral and political conduct of the good people of America. Providence is daily working out strange deliverances for us. The treaty with France is much more advantageous than the wisest men of this country expected. The Indians the other day were unexpectedly discomfited on Greenbrier. I think the overthrow was something similar to what happened in this country about two years ago. I must give you the intelligence at full length, as the most hardened mind must see and admire the divine goodness in such an interposition." Mr. Cummings was succeeded by the Rev. Stephen Bovel, and an eye-witness of the place and character of the service at the Sinking Spring church in the year 1833 says: "The Presbyterians worshipped in a very old log building at `the Grave-Yard'—weatherboarded outside and ceiled inside. To this plain, old-fashioned house would, literally, the gathering of the people be. From the hills and valleys the worshippers would pour in until an overflowing house would leave a multitude outside. Ladies and gentlemen, with their children, would walk there twice a day in summer's heat and winter's cold, and listen to one or two discourses before returning to Abingdon! They went there for a purpose, and that purpose was to worship God. The silence of death almost prevailed before preaching. Talking and jesting in the house of God had not then become a fashionable amusement. They were prayerful, solemn, thoughtful, serious, and never failed to enjoy the services of the sanctuary and of the minister. The same writer says: "Dr. Bovel was a minister of the olden stamp. We have heard gray-headed members of the church speak of his teaching them `the Assembly's Catechism,' when they were children. Venerable patriarch of the church! We saw him when far beyond his three score years and ten. With his white head, tremulous voice and faltering steps, he still moved amongst the former people of his charge. In extreme age—the activity and usefulness of his young manhood having passed by, and repose and comfort should have been his—he journeyed far away, and sought a home, and found his grave in a distant State."* * Rev. Lewis F. Cosby. In the year 1830 Mr. Bovel was succeeded by Rev. David R. Preston, and shortly thereafter this congregation erected a new church building (now Temperance Hall), and worshipped in this building until the schism of 1837 divided the church; when one branch of the church erected a new building on the lot now occupied by the Presbyterian church at the corner of Main and Slaughter streets. From the year 1837 until 1865, two congregations of Presbyterians worshipped in the town, one at the Temperance Hall and the other at the new church, and the feelings between the two congregations were such as to greatly endanger the existence of the church. The total membership of both churches in 1865 was one hundred and twelve members only. The two congregations were united in 1865, through the efforts of the Revs. Thomas Brown and James McChain, and since that time the church has greatly prospered, the membership at the present time being three hundred and thirty. This church took its name from the Sinking Spring near the marble yard of James L. Brown, and this church is the parent of the Meadow View, Cold Spring, Green Spring, Walnut Grove, Maple Grove, Spring Creek, Bethel and the first Presbyterian church of Bristol, Tenn. The pastors serving this church during its history have been: 1774-1812, Rev. Charles Cummings. 1812-1830, Rev. Stephen Bovel. 1830-1835, Rev. David R. Preston. 1835—, Rev. William Preston, stated supply. 1835-1842, Rev. Stephen Taylor. 1842-1866, Rev. James McChain. 1870-1883, Rev. E. H. Barnett, and in recent years Revs. P. D. Stephenson, T. A. Wharton and R. V. Lancaster. The ruling elders of this church, so far as I can ascertain, in addition to those previously given, have been: James Vance, James Davis, Michael Shaver, Alexander White, J. W. C. Watson, Elias Ogden, Henry Parrot, Archimedes Davis, T. P. Clapp, John F. Preston, Philip Snapp, Jacob N. Campbell, R. C. Craig, Samuel A. Preston, D. C. Dunn, R. L. Francisco, Robert J. Preston, T. D. Davidson, B. Gildersleeve, John A. Buchanan, R. A. Preston, John A. Hagy, F. B. Hutton, W. B. Ingham, T. M. Clapp and B. R. Smith. Ebbing Spring. This was one of the first churches to be organized in Washington county, and its first pastor was the Rev. Charles Cummings, who served the church until 1780, when he was succeeded by Rev. Thomas Brown Craighead. This church was named from the Ebbing Spring, the church building being on the hill a short distance north of the spring. This spring is now on the farm owned by David Stump, on the Middle Fork of Holston river, in the upper end of this county, and in its normal condition it is a beautiful stream flowing from among limestone rocks. Before the water begins to flow there is a gurgling sound, and then the stream gushes out with a rapid current, filling the channel. The ebb begins gradually, and in less than half an hour the spring is as limpid and quiet as before the disturbance.* * Thomas L. Preston. This was the place of worship of General William Campbell and the families east as far as the head of Holston, and the number of the worshippers at this church was exceeded by that of the Sinking Spring only. In the year 1792, it was decided to remove the church building from the Ebbing Spring to the Old Glade Spring. With the removal of the church from Ebbing Spring the name was changed to Glade Spring. The new church was erected upon property given by Francis Kincannon and deeded, by the direction of Kincannon, by John Robinson on the 15th of February, 1814, to Robert Buchanan, Joseph Snodgrass, David Beattie, John Porterfield, Thomas Edmiston, William Beattie, James Scott, Samuel Edmiston, Leonard Hutton and William Eakin, members of the Presbyterian congregation of Glade Spring. The families constituting this congregation in the early days were among the most patriotic citizens to be found anywhere within the colonies; they were respectable and progressive, and their descendants at this time practice the same ideas that rendered their ancestors distinguished. The pastors serving the Ebbing Spring congregation have been: 1774-1780 —Rev. Charles Cummings. 1780-1790 —Rev. Thomas Brown Craighead. 1790-1816 —Rev. Edward Crawford. 1816-1831 —Rev. Alexander McEwen. 1835 —Rev. Philip Wood. 1843-1844 —Rev. Robert C. Graham. 1844-1848 —Rev. A. G. Taylor. 1848 —Rev. Robert Glenn. 1848-1852 —Rev. Levi R. Morrison. 1852-1856 —Rev. D. F. Palmer. 1856-1859 —Rev. Henry Smith. 1859-1862 —Rev. J. J. McMahon. 1863-1866 —Rev. R. L. McMurrin, and since 1866, the Revs. Henry M. White, J. O. Sullivan, Frank McCutchen, P. H. Guinn, and J. R. Herndon. The ruling elders of this church, so far as I have been able to ascertain, have been: Mitchell Robinson, David Beattie, John Eakin, Peter Clark, John S. Clark, Arthur Hutton, John Robinson, Philip B. Snapp, J. C. Porterfield, Isaac M. Benham, W. B. Dickenson, James A. Buchanan, A. D. Hutton, A. H. Byars, George A. C. Beattie, M. W. Robinson, E. B. Clark, T. M. Porterfield, A. M. Byars, and J. D. Kent. This church has experienced a very rapid growth in recent years, and at the present time five churches and chapels are within the bounds of the Glade Spring church, viz.: Old Glade Spring church, Glade Spring church, Seven Springs, Ebbing Spring Chapel, and the membership of the church is considerable. The location of the church erected in 1792 was near a fine spring and there was a long glade free from timber looking southeast from the location of the church, and it was from this circumstance that the church took the name of Glade Spring in the year 1792. When the building of Emory and Henry College was proposed, a meeting was held for the purpose of soliciting subscriptions at the Old Glade Spring church and the members of this congregation contributed the greater portion of a $5,000 subscription to the enterprise, and Colonel William Byars, Alexander Robinson, Madison Beattie, Absalom Beattie, W. B. Edmondson, W. C. Edmondson and J. M. Byars, active members of this church, have given their influence, money and labor to the upbuilding of Emory and Henry College since the inception of the enterprise. There is not a community in Washington county that excels that of Glade Spring in intelligence, patriotism and worth, and this fact is in great part due to the influence of this church. Rock Spring Church. The Rock Spring church, by far the oldest church organization in that section of the county, was organized just after the Revolution, in the year 1784. The land upon which this church stands was deeded to the congregation, March 15th, 1820; fifty-five poles by Robert Edmondson, twenty poles by Matthew Brown. No sessional records appear to have been kept until 1843, but the membership was large and somewhat scattered. In 1880, sixty-three of its members were organized into a separate church, known as Bethel, near Osceola. The total membership of Rock Spring church from 1843 to 1902 is estimated at something over 500. Its present membership is over seventy. Many of the signers of the original call to Rev. Charles Cummings lived within the bounds of Rock Spring church, and some of their descendants still occupy the old homesteads of their ancestors. The church has occupied three separate buildings; the second was removed in 1884, and the present large and beautiful building erected near the old site. The names of those who ministered to the people of Rock Spring church prior to 1843 are (so far as can be learned) Crawford, Bovel, Glenn and McEwen, of the Presbyterian church, and Harper, McLaws, Scott, Patrick and Thompson, of the Reformed Presbyterian church. About 1825, McEwen, who was then stated supply, and who appears to have been an able and popular minister, was deposed from the ministry on the charge of immorality. The controversy over his trial was bitter and protracted, and checked the growth of the church for several years. In the great controversy of 1837 over church representation, out of which grew the Old and New Schools, Rock Spring sided with the former. Down to 1843 the church had no regular pastor. In that year the Rev. R. C. Graham was called and installed. At that time Samuel Moore, Andrew Edmondson, and Robert E. Lowry were elders. Their first meeting under the new pastor was on December 10, 1843. From that meeting records of the proceedings of the session were kept; the membership at that time was ninety. Mr. Graham's pastorate appears to have ended in 1847. It resulted in a largely increased membership. From 1847 to 1866 the church had no pastor. The stated supplies during that time were Hodge, Stickley, Reece, Wilson and Hogshead. The last, in the year 1866, was installed pastor, and continued as such until the year 1871. He was succeeded by Rev. J. C. Carson, as stated supply, who continued in charge until the autumn of 1875, when Rev. J. O. Sullivan became pastor. His pastorate ceased in the year 1881, when he became president of Stonewall Jackson Institute. The present church building, one of the most commodious in the Presbytery, was erected in the year 1884, at a cost of about $3,000. The next pastor was the Rev. Frank McCutchen. He remained until 1893, when he accepted a call to Rogersville, Tenn. Rev. J. B. Hutton, Rev. S. R. Preston and the Rev. Mr. Visor were stated supplies until October, 1896, when Rev. J. B. Morton became pastor. He resigned in 1901 because of disaffection in the congregation. The present pastor (not yet installed) is Rev. Allen Jones, an able and most energetic man. Maple Grove Church. The first Presbyterian preacher to conduct regular services in this community was the Rev. Stephen Bovel, and, as a result of his efforts, a log-house was built upon the location of the present church in 1831. A partial organization of the church was effected about the same time, but all records pertaining thereto have been lost, and the first regular session of this church of which we have any record was organized in the year 1836, with the following elders present: John Gray, John Davis, John Anderson, Wallace Maxwell, Peter S. Hanby and A. C. Maxwell. The first regularly installed pastor of this church was the Rev. John H. Wallace. In the year 1874, the log church erected in 1831 was torn down, and a handsome country church erected in its place. The church has been served by the following pastors, so far as I can ascertain: Revs. Stephen Bovel, James McChain, John H. Wallace, Henry Rose, J. P. Briscoe, John L. Allison, W. T. Mobray, J. B. Morton, G. W. Henderlite and R. B. Hudson. Spring Creek Church. This church was organized in the year 1852, with John F. Preston and Archimedes Davis as ruling elders, and the following members: Archimedes Davis, John F. Preston, Mrs. Nancy Preston, Mrs. Margaret L. Fulkerson, Mrs. Mary Bradley, Misses Margaret J. Willoughby, Caroline Willoughby, Elizabeth Rush, Mary J. Legard, Andrew Willoughby, Jeremiah Rush, Sr. and James Rush. Soon after the organization of the church, Andrew Willoughby was installed an elder, and within recent years Henry B. Roberts, J. G. R. Davis and others have served in the same capacity. The land upon which this church stands was given by John F. Preston. A very commodious frame building was erected thereon in the year 1852 and remained until 1886, when the old building was torn down and a handsome frame building erected in its stead. The pastors that have served this church have been the same that served the Maple Grove church. Upon this church property stood an old log-house in which the writer attended the public schools, and in the church building he was taught the Shorter Catechism by H. B. Roberts and a faithful corps of noble women. Walnut Grove Church. This church was organized at an early day and has been of great usefulness; but, I am sorry to say that, notwithstanding very persistent efforts, I have been unable to obtain any information in regard to its history. Green Spring Church. This church was established in the year 1794, and the first building was erected upon a tract of land conveyed to the members of the Green Spring congregation and their successors, they calling a regular Presbyterian minister of the gospel, adhering to the Westminster Confession of Faith and the doctrine and discipline therein contained, with the Larger and Shorter Catechism, James Montgomery. This church is situated in the strongest Presbyterian community in Washington county, possibly in Southwest Virginia, and has had a very useful career; but I must express my regret at being unable to obtain any information in regard thereto. All that has been said in regard to the Glade Spring community will apply to this, the peer of the Glade Spring community. The Kings, McConnells, Berrys, McChesneys, Coxes, Kellers, McCauleys, Grays, Thomases, Lowrys, Parks, Avens, Mimmicks and Campbells constitute a large part of this congregation. METHODISM IN WASHINGTON COUNTY. Methodism made its appearance in Washington county, Virginia, by emigration, somewhere between 1770 and 1775. The first circuit, in what is now Holston Conference, appeared in the minutes of 1783 entitled "Holston Circuit," with sixty members, and Jeremiah Lambert was appointed in charge of it. This circuit embraced the scattered Methodists in Southwestern Virginia and upper East Tennessee. In 1784, Lambert reported seventy-six members, a gain of sixteen. Bishop Asbury held the first conference west of the Alleghanies, at Stephen Keywood's, Washington county, Virginia, May, 1788, Keywood lived about midway between Saltville and what is now Glade Spring depot. He lived in a two-story log-house with a massive stone chimney at one end. The conference met in an upper room without fire, and sat three days. Religious exercises were kept up daily, with fine results. John Tunnell, Thomas Ware and others had preaching at Keywood's every day for a week before the session of the conference began, and on Sunday before the conference John Tunnell preached in the morning. Under this sermon Madam Elizabeth Russell, wife of General William Russell, of Revolutionary fame, and sister to Patrick Henry, was convinced that she was the veriest sinner on earth, although up to that period, as a member of the Episcopal church, she had been exemplary in life and thought she was a child of God. She invited the preachers home with her to pray for and instruct her. They complied, and in the afternoon she emerged from darkness into light, praising God with a loud voice. This good—yea, great—woman became a flame of Christian zeal, and to the day of her death, which occurred in 1825, she served God and her generation with a zeal not surpassed in ancient or modern times. Mrs. Russell's first husband was General William Campbell, of King's mountain celebrity. Her daughter, Miss Sarah B. Campbell, married General Francis Preston. Among the children of General Preston may be mentioned the Hons. William C. Preston and John S. Preston, of South Carolina, Thomas L. Preston, and Mrs. John B. Floyd, the last a lifelong Methodist. Up to 1812, Washington county was generally included in Holston Circuit; but in that year Abingdon Circuit appears in the minutes. This circuit embraced Washington county and some adjacent territory in Virginia and Tennessee. Baker Wrather was the first appointee to Abingdon Circuit. This circuit was a part of Tennessee Conference until 1824, when Holston Conference was organized. Abingdon station was established in 1826, with the Rev. George Atkins as its first pastor. At what date the first Methodist church in Abingdon was built I am unable to state. In 1849, the old Abingdon church was torn down and supplanted by a neat brick chapel where the old Methodist graveyard is. This chapel afterwards gave place to the present church on Main street. The Findlays, Litchfields, Mitchells, Floyds, Campbells, Hoofnagles, Honakers, Hamiltons and Barrs have been among the most prominent Methodist families of Abingdon. John Baker, four miles west of Abingdon, was a wealthy Methodist, and was for many years a liberal supporter of the church. John W. Price, near Glade Spring, was a wealthy farmer and an active church worker, often exhorting and holding protracted meetings, resulting in great revivals in his community. Lebanon camp-ground, some six miles east of Abingdon, was established at an early day, and for a number of years was one of the most popular camp-grounds in the connection. Methodists from Abingdon and other parts of the county camped there, and many of the first preachers of the connection preached from its pulpit. In 1835, Holston Conference projected a scheme for an agricultural college. The Rev. Creed Fulton, agent, and also member of the committee to locate the school, raised a subscription and called the committee together. The present site of Emory and Henry College was chosen, and the erection of buildings was begun at once. In 1838, the school was inaugurated under the presidency of Charles Collins, of Maine, a graduate of the Middleton (Conn.) Wesleyan University. He was a well-rounded man, and under his wise administration the college prospered; but the school reached its zenith afterwards under the administration of President E. E. Wiley. Martha Washington College was projected in 1858. The conference accepted from the Odd-Fellows a site and unfinished buildings in the northern suburb of Abingdon, but abandoned the site afterwards, and bought the Preston property, the present site. This college has had a very useful career. Some years afterwards the Methodists of Bristol built and established Sullins College there, with Dr. David Sullins as president. This school has been a successful competitor of Martha Washington College in the cause of female education. Methodism has always been strong in Washington county, of an evangelical type, and a powerful factor in educating and refining the people and creating a good quality of citizenship. Long will the memory of such people as Father Wilkenson, Father Haskew, Dr. George Barr, "Aunt Bettie Haskew," "Aunt Kittie" Findlay, and others like them, linger among our healthful hills as a sweet perfume. I should have mentioned particularly the Methodist Protestant church. This denomination was organized in 1830. It was at first made up of members and preachers who formerly represented the Annual and General Conferences, and, being opposed to an episcopal form of government, seceded from the M. E. Church, and set up a church more democratic in polity. The Rev. Mr. Cosby and Dr. George R. Barr were the principal pioneers of this church in Abingdon. A nice brick church was built, and regular preaching kept up for many years. Dr. Barr was many years its pastor, and a revered and venerable name. The church had some influence at other points in this county, but made little headway against its older and more thoroughly established rival.* * Rev. R. N. Price. The members of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in about the year 1845, disagreed upon the question of slavery, and divided their church property, and since that time there have been two branches of the same church in this county, to-wit: The Methodist Episcopal Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church South. The Methodist Episcopal Church has experienced a very rapid growth in Washington county since 1865, and to-day has thirteen churches and a large number of communicants in this county, while the Methodist Episcopal Church South has churches and communicants in nearly every community in the county. ABINGDON, VIRGINIA—ITS HISTORY. The present location of Abingdon was immediately upon the Indian trail from the south and the Indian trail from the northwest, which, passing through Cumberland Gap, crossed the southern trail at about the present location of Hurt's store, in the town of Abingdon, in the direction of North Carolina. When Dr. Thomas Walker and his company of explorers visited Southwestern Virginia in the years 1749-1750, they followed this Indian trail, and on July 14, 1752, King George II. of England granted to Dr. Thomas Walker a large body of land surrounding and including the site of the town of Abingdon and supposed to contain 6,780 acres. This is the first record that we have of the early exploration of the lands upon which the town of Abingdon has been built. Dr. Walker made no immediate effort to settle the lands secured by his grant, and the next mention that we have of this locality was in the year 1760, in which year Daniel Boone and Nathaniel Gist left the home of Boone, in North Carolina, and, crossing the Holston mountains, encamped in what is now known as Taylor's Valley, from which point they passed down the Holston river to near Glenn's Mill, and thence to the present location of Abingdon, where they encamped on the second night, near where Black's Abingdon, Virginia, 1835. Fort was afterwards built at a spring. Boone and Gist were upon a hunting expedition at the time and were accompanied by their dogs. Soon after nightfall, the hunters were greatly disturbed by the appearance of a large number of wolves. Their dogs were assailed with such fury that Boone and Gist with great difficulty succeeded in repelling the attack of the wolves and preserving their lives, several of their best dogs being killed. From this circumstance the present location of Abingdon received its first name, "Wolf Hills." The wolves had their home in the cave that underlies the town of Abingdon, the entrance to which is upon the lot now occupied as a residence by Captain James L. White. The creek that passes through the eastern and southern portions of the town about this time received the name of Castle's Creek, Abingdon, Virginia, 1902. Looking East from Fruit Hill. Abingdon, Virginia, 1902. Looking South from Fruit Hill. which name, about fifteen years afterwards, was changed to Eighteen Mile Creek, and the creek west of Abingdon was given the name of Wolf Hill Creek, which names are retained until this time. Some time between the years 1765 and 1770, James Douglas, Andrew Colvill, George Blackburn, Joseph Black, Samuel Briggs, James Piper and several other persons settled upon lands surrounding and including the present location of Abingdon, under purchases from Dr. Thomas Walker, which lands were afterwards conveyed to the settlers in the year 1774. By this time, 1774, the immediate vicinity of the present location of Abingdon was settled by large numbers of people, and during this year a church was built near the entrance gate of the present cemetery, west of the town of Abingdon, under the direction of the Rev. Charles Cummings and under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church. The early settlers of this section of Virginia at this early date recognized the importance of this locality, and as the natural instinct of the Indian had made this the passing point of two great Indian trails, so the same instinct of the white man caused him to recognize this as a central location for his operations. Captain Joseph Black, who settled on Eighteen Mile Creek nearly south of the present residence of Colonel Arthur Cummings, with the assistance of his neighbors, erected a small fort near his residence for the protection of the neighborhood from attacks by the Indians, which fort was called "Black's Fort," and this fort was used until the summer of 1776. In the spring of this year, 1776, the Cherokee Indians, after twelve years of comparative peace and friendliness, decided to wage a war against the whites, and to exterminate or drive them from the waters of the Holston and Clinch rivers; and in the month of July news came to the settlement, which extended down as far as Eaton's Fort, seven miles east of Long Island of Holston, that Dragging Canoe, a noted Indian chief, at the head of seven hundred Indian warriors, was marching upon the settlements, which news created great consternation, and every settler, with but few exceptions, gathered his family and traveled with all speed for the older settlements. There was but one public highway passing through this section at that time, which was known as the Great road and passed directly by Black's Fort. By the 20th of July, 1776, fully four hundred men, women and children, had assembled at Black's Fort, and, at the suggestion of their leaders, determined to build a substantial fort and contest the further progress of the Indian invasion. While the building of this fort was in progress, the battle of Long Island Flats was fought and resulted in an overwhelming victory for the settlers. The news of this battle reached Black's Fort on the following day. Upon the receipt of this good news, the Rev. Charles Cummings had all work upon the fort suspended, assembled the multitude, and, kneeling in prayer, thanked God for the deliverance of the people. The work upon the fort was continued until completed and, when completed, it was one of the best forts upon the frontiers. During the week following the battle of Long Island Flats the settlers at Black's Fort were greatly annoyed by small bands of Indians traveling through the settlements, killing the settlers indiscriminately, burning their homes and driving off their property. Three parties of Indians came within the vicinity of Black's Fort. One party scalped Arthur Blackburn and left him for dead, another succeeded in killing and scalping Jacob Mongle, and a third party assailed the Rev. Charles Cummings, his negro servant, Job, William Creswell and James Piper, and succeeded in killing William Creswell and crippling James Piper by shooting off one of his fingers. After the battle at Long Island Flats, the settlers were greatly encouraged, and, at the same time, felt very much outraged at the depredations of their Indian neighbors, and a portion of the settlers at Black's Fort, with the assistance of a few men from Bryan's Fort, succeeded in killing and scalping eleven out of a party of Indians that visited the home of James Montgomery, near the South Fork of Holston river, about eight miles south of Abingdon. The scalps of the eleven Indians were brought to Black's Fort and tied to the end of the longest pole that could be found in the vicinity, and this pole was planted at the gate of the fort as a warning, we suppose, to future invaders that they would meet a like fate. The county of Washington was established by an Act of the Assembly of Virginia in the fall of the year 1776, and by the provisions of that Act Black's Fort was designated as the first place of meeting of the County Court of the new county. The time of the meeting was fixed as January 28, 1777. Tradition says there was a great contest between the citizens of this county as to the location of the county seat, a portion of the citizens advocating the present location of the Presbyterian church at Green Spring as the proper location for the county seat. But several important inducements decided the contest in favor of Black's Fort; to-wit: first, the fact that Black's Fort was directly upon the line of the Great road passing through this section, and, secondly, because Dr. Thomas Walker, Joseph Black and Samuel Briggs agreed to give to the county of Washington one hundred and twenty acres of land for the purpose of locating the town and assisting in discharging the cost of the erection of the necessary public buildings, and, in addition, Dr. Walker agreed to deed to the trustees of the town of Abingdon, for a nominal consideration, four hundred and eighty-four acres of land adjoining the one hundred and twenty above spoken of. It cannot be doubted that the selection was a wise one, especially in view of the mutilation of the territory of Washington county as originally formed, by the formation of new counties by the General Assembly of Virginia, and the encroachments upon Virginia territory by the State of Tennessee. The county seat was as nearly centrally located as possible. The four hundred and eighty-four acre tract of land which Dr. Walker agreed to sell to the trustees of the town of Abingdon for a nominal consideration was conveyed to said trustees by Daniel Smith, attorney in fact for Dr. Walker, on October 7, 1781. The power of attorney from Dr. Walker constituting Daniel Smith his attorney in fact to convey said lands was executed September 9, 1777 and was witnessed by Thomas Jefferson, Reuben Lindsay and George Dives. Shortly after the organization of the County Court of Washington county, Virginia, to-wit: on April 29, 1777, the County Court entered an order appointing Arthur Campbell, Daniel Smith, William Edmiston, William Campbell, Joseph Martin, John Coulter, Robert Craig, trustees to dispose of the lands given to the county by Walker, Black and Briggs. It will be observed that the present location of Abingdon, at the time in question, was without a name, and, as far as I can ascertain, it did not receive the name of Abingdon until the summer of this year. The one hundred and twenty acres of land given to the county by Walker, Black and Briggs were surveyed by Captain Robert Doach, and, immediately after the appointment of the trustees above named, they directed John Coulter to survey and lay out the main street of the town of Abingdon, which was accordingly done. The County Court, on the 27th day of August, 1777, directed James Dysart, the sheriff of Washington county, to employ some person or persons, upon the best terms he could, to remove to some convenient place, where the town was to stand, the logs and other timber which had been placed at Mr. Black's for the purpose of building a magazine, to be used in building a courthouse. The sheriff, pursuant to this order, selected the present location of the yard of Mrs. James W. Preston as a convenient place for the same, and let the contract for the building to Samuel Evans. The County Court, at the same time, directed the sheriff of the county to build a prison fourteen feet square, with square timbers, twelve inches each way, and with a good shingle roof, and in lieu of a stone wall to line the side walls and also the under floor with two-inch plank, and to put in each plank nine iron spikes six inches long; and the sheriff, pursuant to directions, let the contract for the building of the prison to Abraham Goodpasture. At the time of the building of the courthouse, the County Court of Washington county had erected what was known as stocks, just west of the courthouse and on Main street. These consisted of a platform some five or six feet above the ground, with a centrepiece about seven feet above the platform. To this were attached movable boards, one at the foot of the platform and another about four feet above the first. In these boards were holes, through which the head, hands and feet of the culprit were thrust."* * Thomas L. Preston. It is said that one application of this mode of punishment made a lasting impression upon offenders. To George Martin was given the contract for making irons for criminals, and to Hugh Berry that of making nails to be used in the erection of the courthouse and prison. The courthouse and prison were not completed until the year 1779, at which time the County Court directed David Carson and Joseph Black to lay off the prison bounds, and on the 17th day of June, 1779, David Carson and Joseph Black, after laying off the prison bounds, made the following report: Pursuant to an order of court, we the subscribers have laid off the Prison Bounds, as in the annexed Platt. Witness our hands this 17th June, 1779. DAVID CARSON, JOSEPH BLACK. Beginning at the N. W. corner of the gaol at a stump S. 35° E. 40 poles, crossing the road at 3 forked white oak saplings; thence N. 62° E. 35 poles crossing a creek at the old fording at a large white oak tree by the north side of the road; thence N. 32° W. 30 poles crossing said creek N. E. of head of a spring at a white oak stake and an old black stump; and thence to a white oak sapling on a N. E. stony bank on Mr. Willoughby's lot; thence S. 62° W. 36 poles to the north end of the prison house at the beginning. DAVID CARSON. From this report it will be observed that numbers of white oak saplings were standing within the present limits of the town of Abingdon as late as the summer of 1779. It is hardly necessary to be said at this point that the prison bounds thus laid out were used, until the year 1850, as a place of confinement for delinquent debtors, and it would be a matter of great surprise, could the present generation read the names of the prominent citizens of this county who were confined within these prison bounds because of the non-payment of their debts. As soon as the Main street of the town was located and the lots on the north and south sides of said street surveyed, the trustees of the town proceeded to sell and dispose of said lots; but, finding some difficulty in disposing of said lots by reason of some uncertainty in their title to said property, eleven members of the County Court in the fall of the year 1777 addressed the following petition to the General Assembly of Virginia: To the Honorable, the Speaker and Gentlemen of the House of Delegates: The petition of the court of Washington county. Whereas a certain tract or parcel of land is given by the Honorable Thomas Walker, Joseph Black and Samuel Briggs, and also another tract of land is agreed to be sold at a certain rate by the said Walker for the benefit of the aforesaid county to erect their public buildings on, and as this court has already fixed upon a place on said land for their courthouse and prison, and has also laid off a part thereof for a town, and whereas it is apprehended that it would much conduce to the speedy settling of the aforesaid town and advance the value of the lots if an Act of Assembly should pass, enabling the said court or their trustees to receive titles from the above-named gentlemen for the land given and sold, and also to enable them to lay off, sell and make conveyances to the purchasers, and grant such privileges and immunities to the settlers on such lots, as to citizens in like cases have been granted, in the premises we submit to the consideration of your honorable House, and pray you to grant us such redress as you judge just and right, and your petitioners, as in duty bound, shall pray, etc.: George Blackburn, John Kinkhead, William Edmiston, James Montgomery, John Campbell, Andrew Colvill, William Campbell, John Snoddy, Daniel Smith, Thomas Mastin, Arthur Campbell. This petition was referred to the proper committee on November 8, 1777, but was not again heard of until the fall of the year 1778. Washington county's representatives in the Legislature at this time were William Cocke and Anthony Bledsoe, neither of whom had any particular interest in the welfare of the proposed town. But in the spring of the year 1778, Arthur Campbell and Anthony Bledsoe were elected to the Legislature of Virginia from Washington county, and, as a result of the efforts of Arthur Campbell, the town was incorporated in December, 1778. For some reason which I cannot explain, the trustees appointed by the County Court of Washington county, Virginia, on April 29, 1777, with but two exceptions, never acted in the capacity of trustees, William Edmiston and Robert Craig being the exceptions, but on the 6th of June, 1777, William Edmiston, Robert Craig, James Armstrong, Robert Preston and Robert Campbell, terming themselves trustees for the town of Abingdon, met at Christopher Acklin's, in said town, and proceeded to business and surveyed a part of said town, namely the inner lots; after which the board adjourned until the next day, the 7th of June, 1777, on which day the trustees ordered an alley to be laid off, one pole wide, adjoining the lower end of the lots on the south side of Main street; and that a street be laid off, three poles wide, ten poles from said alley, and that the land between the alley and said street be laid off in half acre lots, and that the land on the south side of said street be laid off in acre lots, and that said street be known by the name of Water street; and to the alley between Water and Main streets was given the name of Troopers' alley. Robert Preston was directed to survey said lots and to deliver a draft of the same to Christopher Acklin, who was directed to sell said lots at public outcry at the following June court, which lots were accordingly disposed of by Christopher Acklin at public auction. There seems to be a difference of opinion as to the first settler within the bounds of Abingdon. Charles B. Coale makes the statement that the first house erected in the town was by Dr. Smith, who built his house about the year 1760, on the lot now occupied by Mrs. Henry S. Preston. The statement of Mr. Coale is evidently a mistake, as this portion of Virginia was not settled in the year 1760. There can be no question that Christopher Acklin, as early as June, 1777, had a house built and was living upon the lot now occupied by the county courthouse. As previously stated, in the month of October, 1778, the town of Abingdon was established by Act of the Assembly, and Evan Shelby, William Campbell, Daniel Smith, William Edmiston, Robert Craig and Andrew Willoughby were named as trustees for said town, and the title to the one hundred and twenty acres of land given by Dr. Walker and others was vested in fee simple in said trustees by said Act,* * No deed having passed between Walker, Briggs and Black and said trustees. and said trustees or any three of them were empowered to make conveyances of such lots in said town as had been previously sold and of such as might be sold thereafter. Considerable power was conferred upon said Board of Trustees, as will be seen by an inspection of the Act establishing the town. The name given to the town was evidently suggested by Colonel Arthur Campbell, through whose influence the Act incorporating the town was passed. While the object in view in giving the name, Abingdon, to the town is not known, several statements in regard thereto have been made by different writers upon the subject, one statement being that the town was given the name of Abingdon as a compliment to Martha Washington, the wife of General Washington, it being the name of the parish in which she worshipped in girlhood† † Abingdon was the name of the country seat of Mrs. Martha Custis before her marriage to General Washington, and was but a few miles from Mt. Vernon. ; another statement being that the town was named in honor of Lord Abingdon, a young English nobleman of Scotch descent, with whom William Campbell was well acquainted, Lord Abingdon being very much in sympathy with the ideas of his Scotch kinsfolk living in America, in their contest with England. Daniel Boone, at this time, was known as the greatest explorer and hunter on the frontiers, and the name may have originated with him. Abingdon, Pennsylvania, situated about twelve miles north of Philadelphia, was his first residence in America, and, for many years, was the home of many of his family. The lands deeded to the trustees of the town of Abingdon included four hundred and eighty-four acres in addition to the one hundred and twenty acres given by Dr. Walker and others and vested in said trustees by Act of the Assembly. These four hundred and eighty-four acres lay north and northeast of the town of Abingdon of the present day; and while Main and Water streets were laid off previously to 1778, and lots on either side of said streets surveyed, the lands included within the four hundred and eighty-four acre survey were not surveyed until August, 1781, during which month Daniel Smith surveyed and divided said four hundred and eighty-four acres into nineteen tracts containing from thirteen to fifty-six acres to the lot, which tracts of land were denominated the outer lots of said town. "The lands on which the town is built were given to the county of Washington by Dr. Thomas Walker, of Albemarle county, and by Samuel Briggs, who owned the tract adjoining to the east, and Joseph Black, who owned the one to the west of the town. I first saw the town hill in 1782, and then there were on it a log courthouse about twenty-five feet square, standing opposite Dunn's Hotel across the street—a small log jail on the lower corner of the present public lot; Christopher Acklin's Tavern on the southeast corner of the public square; John Yancey's Tavern, on the lot where Dunn's Hotel stands; and William Dryden's Tavern on the lot where Mr. Mitchell's dwelling stands, that formed the then town of Abingdon. In 1782, Yancey sold his house and lot to John Campbell, and shortly afterwards Dryden sold his to Dr. Alexander Smith, the first husband of Mrs. Conn." Acklin and Smith now entertained all who called on them, Acklin those who were fond of their brandy, Smith the more temperate. Two Irishmen, named Dan and Manasas Friel, at this time appeared with a cargo of merchandise and opened their goods in a room in John Campbell's dwelling house. They soon built a storehouse across the street and, for ten or twelve years from 1783, sold goods and made a handsome property. They then removed to Wythe, and Manasas to a valuable farm near Fort Chiswell. About the time they had located themselves in their new storehouse, William Bagnell and Mrs. Bagnell came to the town and built a large cabin on the lot east of Dunn's Hotel. This couple were from Baltimore and merit special notice. William Bagnell was a dwarf about four feet, nine inches, high, and diminutive in form. Mrs. Bagnell was just the opposite in every respect—a large, athletic woman of good figure, rather handsome than otherwise, and intelligent. They appeared to be about thirty years of age. Bagnell's Tavern soon attracted attention and commanded company. Mrs. Bagnell had been evidently well accustomed to the noise and confusion of a drinking establishment, and acted in her cabin with good authority. She was often visited by an old man and two sons from the foot of Iron mountain, who never left without having a drunken frolic. On one occasion they continued their bacchanalian riot until late in the night and until Mrs. Bagnell was fairly worn down with it and refused to let them have any more whiskey. They begged and pled and threatened, but her ladyship was firm to her purpose and would not yield. They then commenced beating her and running her around the cabin, they pursuing and she retreating and defending herself. At length she was able to escape up a ladder to the loft, and there she shouted murder with all her strength. The town was roused and all came to her relief and to hear what was the matter. The three bacchanalians retreated into the street and bade defiance, and Mrs. Bagnell complained of being much hurt. The sheriff made his appearance and was ordered by a justice to arrest the men. He summoned a posse, and for a short time there was a general engagement; at length the men were taken and committed to jail. In the melee several persons were seriously injured, but the prosecutions failed. Henry Dickenson came to town to live and built on the corner lot on which William King's old brick house stands. Near the same time Captain William Y. Conn arrived from Alexandria with a cargo of merchandise, built a storehouse across the street from Dunn's Hotel and opened goods. Alexander Smith died and Mrs. Smith, then a beautiful young widow, continued the house, which was always crowded with the best company. John Greenway came from Pennsylvania, purchased out Henry Dickenson and built his blacksmith shop on the corner.* * John Greenway afterwards purchased seven hundred acres of land on Eleven Mile creek, near the residence of W. C. Ladlock, gave it the name of "Springfield," and lived there many years. All this time the society of two or three genteel families and the constant intercourse of well-informed strangers made Abingdon a most agreeable place. Although the country was settled with a well-informed population generally, yet there was in it a mixture of all sorts. The leading characters of one class were Edward Callahan and his wife Succy. Where they originally came from I do not know, but they were themselves originals. Edward was a hunter by profession, and when they emigrated to Holston he selected for his residence the banks of the north fork twenty-five miles below Abingdon, at a point where he could see the top of Clinch mountain through a gap in the river knobs. Here he lived many years. Succy was a cake woman, but with the cakes she sold something to drink. She made her appearance on the first day of every court, with a cartload of cakes, pies and drinkables, halted in the middle of the street and made an awning for herself and commenced business. Edward followed on foot at the tail of the cart in the full dress of the hunter, with rifle and shot pouch, and his fine, well-taught hunting dog at his heels, and when he had gotten Succy fairly started at her business he moved off with his peltry to transact his own business. Succy was a shrewd woman and adopted all sorts of evasions to avoid paying license, and sometimes she was hard pressed by the grand jurors and Attorney-General Dunlop. On one occasion she was nearly at her wit's end about retailing whiskey, when John Campbell, the clerk, said something to the court in mitigation, and the justices, being very willing to accept any excuse, let Succy off. She never forgot the kindness, and fifteen years afterwards I, the son of John Campbell, was riding in that part of the country and was benighted at Succy's cabin, when she treated me with a kindness and hospitality which I shall never forget and in a manner, too, that showed she knew how to act her part. I have named two originals of each sex."* * Governor David Campbell's MSS. In the year 1786, Abingdon was a considerable village, boasting of two hotels, one occupying the present location of the Bank of Abingdon and kept by James Armstrong, and the other, kept by Mrs. Mary McDonald, on the south side of Main street nearly opposite the courthouse. There were no buildings west of the present residence of the late S. N. Honaker, and from this point to the western limits of the original town was a wild plum and chinquapin thicket, with a few large white oak trees interspersed. The residence of Daniel Friel occupied the location of the present residence of Mrs. Kate Preston, while the residence of Mrs. Smith occupied the present location of the residence of Mrs. John D. Mitchell, the residence of Dr. Groce occupying the position of what is known as the White House, on the south side of Main street, while to the west of Dr. Groce's residence there lived several families, one by the name of Wise, another by the name of Redpath (James). A house built by William Brice stood on the present location of the Colonnade Hotel. These were about all the houses to be found in the town in the year 1786. A writer upon this subject makes the statement that General John Armstrong, Secretary of War under President Madison, and General Francis Preston Blair, of Missouri, were born on the lot occupied by Dr. Groce; but it is more probable that General Armstrong was born at the home of his father, James Armstrong, and that General Blair was born at the residence of his father, James Blair, both of whom lived in Abingdon. The next effort made to extend the town was at a meeting of the Board of Trustees at the house of William Y. Conn, on the 12th day of January, 1789. At this meeting it was ordered that all that part of said town lying north of the lots on the north side of Main street be laid off into one-fourth-acre lots, that an alley be left at the north end of the lots fronting on Main street, and that a street be laid off ten poles north of said alley, said street to be three poles wide. To the alley was given the name of Chinquapin alley, and to the street thus proposed was given the name of Office or Valley street. Robert Preston was directed to survey said land and to deliver particular plats to Andrew Russell, and Christopher Acklin was directed to sell said lots at public outcry, as directed by the Act incorporating the town. It will be observed that Valley street, as originally proposed, was three poles wide, but at a meeting of the trustees on the 4th of October, 1798, it was ordered that the street known as Valley or Office street be altered and made four poles wide, ten poles north of Chinquapin alley. This alteration in the width of Valley street was induced by the fact that the owners of the lands along said street by their improvements had evidenced that they believed that said street was four poles wide. At the same meeting of the trustees, Andrew Russell was elected secretary and was directed to record a plan of the inner and outer lots of said town. At a meeting of the Board of Trustees on the 22d of November, 1798, Slaughter street was opened two poles wide, running from Valley street in a northwestwardly course to the northern boundary of the town land, but for some reason the name Slaughter street has been given to the cross street running from Valley street to the railroad and crossing the Main street near the Presbyterian church. The original town, as it was in 1798, contained three streets running east and west, known as Water, Main and Valley streets, with two alleys north and south of Main street and known as Troopers' and Chinquapin alleys, the cross streets being Tanners' street, which crosses Main street near to and west of the residence of Captain James L. White; Cross street, now known as Court street, crossing Main street, east of the courthouse; Brewers' street, crossing Main street near to and west of the residence of Mrs. Bessie Watson, and Slaughter street, which began at Main street and ran a northwestwardly course to the boundary of the town land. Most of the lots within the town of Abingdon were sold at public auction, previously to the year 1798. The names of such purchasers as have been preserved are given in another place. In the month of October, 1798, Andrew Willoughby resigned as one of the trustees of the town of Abingdon, and an election to fill the vacancy was held on the 3d day of November, 1798. The election was held at the court-house in said town, and only the freeholders living within the town were permitted to vote. The candidates voted for were Andrew Russell and Frederick Hamilton, and the freeholders voting in said election were: William Brice, John Gold, Frederick Hamilton, C. Watkins, Robert Dukes, James Longley, Joseph Hays, Jacob Baker, Joseph Acklin, Connally Findlay, James White, William Greenway, Solomon Marks, James Armstrong, Samuel Glenn, Patrick Lynch, Michael Deckard, John McCormick, James Redpath, Andrew Russell. It will be seen from an inspection of this poll-list that the freeholders living within the bounds of Abingdon in 1798 were few in number. On the 18th day of April, 1793, the County Court of Washington county, Virginia, directed that twenty-five pounds out of the bonds arising from the sale of lots in the town of Abingdon be appropriated towards building a market-house on the courthouse lot; and James Armstrong, James Bradley, John McCormick and Claiborne Watkins were appointed commissioners to superintend the building of the same; and in September of the same year, the court appropriated twenty pounds to complete a well upon the public lot. The market-house, when completed, was placed in charge of the officers of the town, and Tuesdays and Saturdays were the regular market days, and it was made an offence for any person to sell butchers' meats at other times and places in the said town. This institution was maintained for many years subsequent to 1793, and as late as the year 1810 the law governing the subject was strictly enforced. A Masonic lodge was organized in Abingdon at the residence of James White on the 3d day of October, 1796, and, by the year 1800, this lodge had erected a Masonic hall in the town on Lot No. 50, Water street, the present location of the new jail. A part of this building was used by the Abingdon Academy from the year 1803 until about the year 1820. In 1798 Henry Clay and Captain Henry St. John Dixon came to Abingdon together for the purpose of settling, provided the country suited them. The former, after looking around for a week or two, proceeded on to Kentucky, where his mother had settled after her second marriage, and the latter, having become acquainted with the family of Mr. Dick White, on the farm now owned by William Clark, married one of his daughters and lived for many years where the Stonewall Jackson Institute now stands.* * Charles B. Coale. On the 20th of March, 1799, the County Court appointed William King, James Armstrong, John Eppler and Robert Craig commissioners to report a plan for a new stone prison, which was afterwards built on the public square in the rear of the present courthouse, James White being the contractor, at the price of $1,532.25. By Act of the General Assembly of Virginia of date January 10, 1803, the corporate limits of Abingdon were extended to the west as far as Lot No. 16, which addition to the town has since been known as "Craig's addition" to the town of Abingdon. On the 13th of January, 1803, the General Assembly authorized the trustees of the town of Abingdon to conduct a lottery for the benefit of Abingdon Academy, the proceeds to be used in purchasing a library, philosophical and mathematical apparatus and anything else necessary for the use of the said Academy. By this same Act the Academy was chartered, with many of the prominent citizens of the town as trustees, evidencing the disposition of the citizens of Abingdon, at this early day, to afford their children every necessary facility for securing an education. The General Assembly of Virginia, during the first fifty years of the history of Abingdon, adopted numerous laws extending the time of the property owners for building houses upon the lots purchased of the town, as required by the Act of the Assembly in the year 1778. On the 3d day of August, 1802, an election was held for trustees to succeed Andrew Willoughby, who had died, and Robert Craig and James Armstrong, who had removed from the town. The candidates voted for by the freeholders of the town were Andrew Russell, James White, Frederick Hamilton and John McClelland, the three first named being elected. The freeholders voting in this election were as follows: William King, John McClelland, John McCormack, W. Greenway, A. Russell, Samuel Glenn, Pat Lynch, John Gold, James Longley, G. T. Conn. Between the years 1800 and 1810, a new courthouse was built upon the public square, which courthouse served the county until the year 1848. This courthouse was built of brick and was a very substantial structure. By the year 1806, the town and county had grown in importance to such an extent that a newspaper, a badly-needed institution, was established in the town of Abingdon by John G. Ustick, the name of the paper being "The Holston Intelligencer and Abingdon Advertiser." The first postoffice in Southwestern Virginia was established at Abingdon on the 25th day of April, 1793, with Gerrard T. Conn as postmaster, and this was the only postoffice to be found in the county of Washington, until the year 1833. It is hard to believe that the citizens of this county for forty years had but one post-office and one place at which they could mail their letters and receive their mail. From the year 1793 until about 1835, Abingdon was the centre of the business life of Southwest Virginia, East Tennessee and Kentucky; all mails for the sections named were distributed at the Abingdon postoffice; and a large per cent. of the wholesale trade for the same section was controlled and supplied by Abingdon merchants. Such was the condition of affairs in Abingdon at the beginning of the war of 1812, and, with the first evidences of war, the patriotism of the citizens of the town knew no bounds. A number of brick buildings had been erected in Abingdon, among the number being the brick building erected by William King, which building is still standing on the east side of Court street, opposite the courthouse, and is beyond question the oldest building in the town of Abingdon. Abingdon was visited by its first great fire on Thursday night, September 10, 1812. A description of the fire and the damage done thereby is here copied from a newspaper published in Abingdon on the following Saturday.* * Political Prospect. "At the hour of midnight of Thursday night last we were alarmed by the cry of Fire! which proved to be in the new brick building of Colonel Francis Preston, which was in a few moments so far consumed as to preclude all hopes of its salvation. The flames continued to rage until the following property was consumed: Colonel Francis Preston's frame dwelling house, brick building, ice-house and every stick of timber on his lot; two houses occupied by Mr. John McCormack, with their out-houses; Mr. Estill's office, Mr. William McKee's dwelling house, his new frame store, compting room, kitchen, etc.; Major James White's saddle shop, dwelling house, kitchen, etc., and the building occupied by John McClellan, Esq. "This dreadful destruction of property was the work of some fiend of hell. An attempt was made to fire the new courthouse, but the exertions of a single person, a slave, saved it. Captain F. Smith, who was early on the spot, discovered the fire in the court-house. He entered when the flames had risen to the height of a man's head. He was about to abandon the building, when Mr. William Trigg's yellow man JOE ran in, caught up in his arms the combustibles on fire, threw them into the street and saved the building. This was done at the hazard of his life. If the courthouse had been consumed, we apprehend not a building in the western precinct of the town would have escaped. "The citizens are about to reward JOE by presenting him with a sum of money. A subscription will be handed the citizens of the town for that purpose. Gentlemen of the County who feel an interest in the welfare of Abingdon, and who may happen to be in town can have an opportunity of contributing by calling on Benj. Estill, Esq., Capt. F. Smith, or Andrew Russell, Esq." The Board of Trustees for the town of Abingdon, between the years 1808 and 1812, adopted a number of by-laws and ordinances which conduced very much to the peace and good order of the town. They began by first adopting rules and regulations for the government of the trustees at their regular meetings. Secondly. They adopted an act to enforce the attendance of the trustees. Third. An act describing the duties and regulating the fees of the town sergeant. Fourth. An act to levy a tax on the tithables and property in the town of Abingdon. Fifth. An act to protect property in the town of Abingdon against fire. Sixth. An act concerning out-houses. Seventh. An act laying off the streets and alleys into precincts for the purpose of keeping the same in repair. Eighth. An act to regulate the building of chimneys to houses and blacksmith shops. Ninth. An act to prevent obstructions and remove nuisances from the streets and alleys of the town. Tenth. An act to restrain negroes and mulattoes from being disorderly and for other purposes. Eleventh. An act to preserve good order in the town of Abingdon. Twelfth. An act to establish market days in the town of Abingdon. Thirteenth. An act concerning houses of evil fame. Fourteenth. An act to prohibit the female of the dog kind from running at large in the town of Abingdon. Fifteenth. An act fixing the marks of the hogs owned by the citizens of the town of Abingdon. Sixteenth. An act to restrain negroes from wandering about the streets after night. Seventeenth. An act allowing witnesses for their attendance before a justice of the peace. Eighteenth. An act respecting patrols in the town of Abingdon. This last act was passed on Friday, 11th day of September, 1812, the day after the fire heretofore mentioned. Among the laws adopted by the Board of Trustees at this time was one that provided that "any woman found quarreling or rioting in the streets or alleys or in any other part of said town to the disturbance of the inhabitants, shall be punished by ducking, as is prescribed by the Act of the Assembly of this Commonwealth." This law was adopted on the 29th of April, 1809. The by-laws and ordinances adopted by the trustees were excellent in their character, and could not be improved upon by the lawmakers of this day. At the time in question and until the year 1833, Abingdon was without sidewalks, and her citizens had nothing more than a dirt footway on either side of the street. On the 26th of June, 1811, the Board of Trustees, by an ordinance, declared that "there shall be nine feet laid off in front of the lots on Main street, the main cross and Valley streets for a footway, and the same shall be kept constantly clear and free from obstructions for the convenience of passengers; and that the footways in all other streets of the town shall be seven feet wide." About this time numerous trees were planted along the footways above mentioned, some of which are to be seen at this day, notably the large trees along Main street west of the courthouse and fronting the residence of Mrs. Bessie Watson. If the Board of Trustees of Abingdon held meetings or made a record of their proceedings from the year 1812 until the year 1828 I cannot find it. The General Assembly of Virginia of the 30th of December, 1819, adopted a new charter for the town of Abingdon, extending the corporate limits of the town east to the creek near the tan-yard of Lindsay &amp; Newland; thence to Valley street; thence following the outer limits of Valley street to the old town. It is impossible to give any of the particulars of this extension of the town, as no record of the Board of Trustees for this period has been preserved. On May 9, 1828, the trustees of the town re-enacted, with but few changes, the by-laws and ordinances adopted by the Board of Trustees in the years 1808 and 1812. The additional by-laws adopted were: First. An act to impose a tax on public shows. Second. An act to prevent mischievous dogs from running at large in the streets and alleys of the town. Third. An act concerning coal-houses. Fourth. An act to restrain hogs from running at large in the town of Abingdon. Fifth. An act concerning small-pox, and Sixth. An act to require the sidewalks or footways on the main street of Abingdon to be paved. On the 13th of June, 1833, the following members of the Board of trustees—to-wit: Andrew Russell (President), J. W. Paxton, Thomas Findlay, John M. Preston, Daniel Lynch, Charles C. Gibson, Elias Ogden and Jacob Lynch—met at the courthouse in the town of Abingdon and enacted the following law: "Whereas the inhabitants of the said town are now engaged in the laudable enterprise of MacAdamizing the Main Street between the sidewalks or footways, and it is deemed proper by this Board that the said sidewalks or footways shall be paved with brick, and curbstones shall be placed next the street, in order to place the said Main Street in proper repair, and that this repairing should be made in front of each lot by the owner thereof, "First. Be it enacted by the Trusteees of the town of Abingdon, that every owner of a lot on the Main Street in said town be and he is hereby required, within twelve months from the time said MacAdamizing shall be completed, to pave with brick the footway in front of his lot, and every person failing herein shall, for every month the said foot way in front of his lot shall remain unpaved, pay a fine of five dollars, to be recovered as other fines are recovered by law. "Second. Be it further enacted, that every owner of a lot or part of a lot on said Main Street be and he is hereby required to deliver or cause to be delivered, in front of his lot on or before the 15th day of August next, to John Kellar, the superintendent of the MacAdamizing of said street, a sufficient quantity of curbstones to curb the side of the foot way in front of his lot, which curb-stones shall be at least twenty inches in depth and twelve inches in width and not less than five or more than seven inches thick. Every person failing herein shall pay a fine of eight dollars for every lot he or she shall own, or in that proportion for a greater or lesser piece of ground, which fines, or so much thereof as may be necessary, shall be appropriated to the purchase of the curb-stones hereby required to be delivered." The approach to the courthouse from the east and west previous to 1830 was exceedingly steep, the courthouse standing upon the summit of an oval-shaped hill on the north side of Main street and facing south. The approach from the east was not only steep, but large limestone rocks, to a great extent, rendered the street almost impassable. As early as the year 1830, Colonel John Kellar, who was superintendent of the streets in the eastern precinct of the town, spent a considerable sum of money in blasting the rocks out of the street east of the courthouse, and soon thereafter a number of the enterprising citizens of the town, by private subscription, undertook the macadamizing of the main street of the town. The subscribers to this cause, with the amount contributed by each, as far as I can ascertain, were as follows: Andrew Russell, $ 17 71 John Gibson, 10 00 Chas. S. Bekem, 5 00 John Preston, Jr., 5 00 Samuel Logan, 20 00 Elias Ogden, 25 00 John Hall, 3 00 Daniel Sheffey, 30 00 John S. Preston, 40 00 General Francis Preston, 50 00 John M. Preston, 500 00 If there were other contributors to this fund, no record of names or amounts contributed has been preserved. The work of macadamizing Main street was done by Jacob Clark under the supervision of Colonel John Kellar. The county of Washington and the town of Abingdon assisted in discharging the cost of macadamizing the main street, the private subscriptions not being sufficient for the purpose. Washington county was represented in the General Assembly of Virginia in the year 1834 by Colonel John Kellar in the Senate and Thomas McCulloch in the House of Delegates. Colonel John Kellar was one of the most enterprising citizens that ever lived in the town of Abingdon, and, as a result of his efforts in behalf of the town, he succeeded in having the General Assembly of Virginia, on the 11th day of March, 1834, adopt a new charter for the town of Abingdon, which charter completely changed the form of government and greatly extended the corporate limits of the town. Under this new charter the limits of the town were as follows: Beginning on the northeast corner of the bridge near the currying shop of George V. Litchfield, and in a line with the lands of John N. Humes; thence northwardly on said line to a point in a line parallel to the northern boundary of the inner lots of the said town; thence westwardly on said parallel and along the said line to the line of the land of Alexander Findlay; thence with the said Findlay's line to a point parallel to the southern line of Valley street; thence with the said parallel westwardly to a point parallel to the western line of the lot on which Jacob Loehr formerly lived; thence in a direct line southwardly to the line of said lot and along the same to the alley; thence with said alley to Lot No. 17 in Robert Craig's plan; thence with the eastern line of said Lot No. 17, and continuing in the same direction to a point parallel to the southern boundary of the inner lots first laid off for the said town; thence to the said southern boundary and along it to the southwestern boundary of Samuel Bailie's lots; thence with the line of said lot to the gate at the corner of General Francis Preston's and John N. Hume's land; thence in a straight line to the beginning. This charter provided that all the free white inhabitants of said town should be a body corporate by the name and style of Mayor, Council and Inhabitants of the town of Abingdon, and by that name sue and be sued, etc. This charter directed that on the first Monday in May, 1834, and annually thereafter on the first Monday in May, the inhabitants of said town legally authorized to vote for members of the General Assembly and the freeholders therein who may not be inhabitants and all other housekeepers therein not thus qualified shall assemble at the courthouse of the county, in said town, and shall there and then elect ten persons, being freeholders in said town, who shall be called and denominated a Council, and one other person who shall be denominated a Mayor. The Council thus chosen were directed to hold two regular meetings in each and every year—one the first Monday after they were elected and the other on the first Monday in December, and at such other times as they shall be assembled by the Mayor. The Council were authorized to appoint a clerk and treasurer, and the Mayor was authorized to appoint the town sergeant, surveyors and superintendents of the streets, and such other powers were conferred upon the Mayor and Council of the town as were necessary for the government and improvement of the same. This charter has been followed in all subsequent amendments of the laws of the town, and it is from this source that we derive our present form of town government. The first Mayor and Council elected under this charter were as follows: Mayor—John M. Preston. Council—Daniel Lynch, Augustus Oury, John S. Preston, Jeremiah Bronough, R. R. Preston, Benjamin Estill, John Kellar, Peter J. Branch, Daniel Trigg, Chas. S. Bekem. Clerk and Treasurer—Jacob Lynch. Sergeant—Jacob Clark. The Mayor and Council thus elected adopted the necessary laws for the government of the town, and in doing so they followed, to a great extent, the laws adopted in the years 1808 and 1812 by the Board of Trustees of the town. The one act adopted by the town of Abingdon that is worthy of notice at this point was an act to regulate the sale of ardent spirits in the town, adopted June 12th, 1837. This act provided that, "If any person within the corporation of Abingdon shall sell by retail (other than an ordinary keeper), to be drunk in or at the place where sold, or in or upon the premises of which such person has control, or within the said corporation, any wine, rum, brandy or other ardent spirits, or a mixture thereof, he or she so offending shall pay a fine to the said corporation of $5.25 for each offence." A description of Abingdon as it was in the year 1835 has been preserved, which description is as follows: "It is situated on the great valley road, about 8 miles north of the Tennessee boundary, at the southeast side of a mountain ridge, about seven miles distant from either of the two main forks of the Holston River. A part of the town stands on a considerable eminence, beneath which there is a cavern containing a lake. "Abingdon contains, besides the ordinary county buildings, between 150 and 200 dwelling-houses, many of them handsome brick buildings. A portion of the inhabitants are followers of Baron Swedenborg, in other words belong to the New Jerusalem Church, but they possess no house of worship and their preacher occasionally occupies one or the other of the Methodist houses. "There is an academy for females and one for males, (both brick edifices) 2 hotels kept in good style, 3 taverns principally used for the accommodation of wagoners, 1 manufacturing flour mill, 9 mercantile houses, some of which are wholesale establishments and sell goods to the amount of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars annually, 3 groceries, 1 woolen and 2 cotton manufactories and one well-established nursery. "There are 4 tanyards with saddle and harness manufactories attached to them, 10 blacksmith's shops, 1 hat manufactory and store, 6 wheelwrights and wagon makers, 2 cabinet warehouses, 3 bricklayers, 2 stone masons, 3 house-carpenters, 3 watch-makers and jewelers, 2 boot and shoe factories, 3 house and sign painters, 2 coppersmiths and tin-plate workers and 3 tailors. "Abingdon is rapidly increasing in population and trade. Old houses are giving place to handsome brick buildings, which the opulent and enterprising citizens are daily erecting. The main street has lately been MacAdamized at considerable expense, but greatly to the improvement of its utility, beauty and comfort. "As a specimen of the flourishing condition of this town, we must mention that a quarter acre lot, situated near the courthouse, recently sold for upwards of $4,000. There is a distributing postoffice here. Population, 1,000 persons, of whom thirteen are resident attorneys, and 3 regular physicians. "County Courts are held on the 4th Monday in every month; quarterly, in March, June, August and November. "Judge Estill holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 2nd Monday after the 4th of April and September." It may excite some surprise when told that in this large and well-populated county there were in 1831 but two postoffices, the one in Abingdon and the other at Seven-Mile Ford; but since the severance of Smyth the one at Seven-Mile Ford is now in that county, in consequence of which there is not, to our knowledge, any other postoffice in this county except the one at Abingdon, the county seat. The merchants doing business in the town of Abingdon at this time were: William McKee &amp; Co., Edward M. &amp; John C. Greenway, John M. Preston, Col. James White and Findlay &amp; Mitchell, and with such merchants Abingdon was the centre of trade for all the surrounding country. All goods were brought to Abingdon from Baltimore by wagon. The practicing physicians in Abingdon at the time were Drs. Earl B. Clapp, James W. Paxton and Alexander R. Preston. There was but one church in the town, and that was a frame structure occupied by the Methodist Episcopal church, and one in the vicinity, and that was the Presbyterian church situated west of the entrance gate to the Sinking Spring Cemetery. That church was a very old log-building, weatherboarded on the outside and ceiled inside, and to this old-fashioned house nearly all the people gathered from the town and surrounding country for the worship of God. Upon the arrival of Rev. Lewis F. Cosby in Abingdon in March, 1831, efforts were immediately set on foot to build a Methodist Protestant church, which church was erected that year upon the present location of that church. The Presbyterians, being stimulated thereby, at once undertook the erection of a new church, and in the same year their new church, now Temperance Hall, was completed and occupied. The County Court of Washington county, on the 24th of July, 1838, upon the application of John W. Stevens, captain of a company of artillery, granted permission to erect a gun-house upon the public lot, and John M. Preston, Elias Ogden and Jacob Lynch were directed to superintend the erection of it. This company was organized as a result of the agitation preceding the Texas Revolution, and Captain Stevens organized this company of artillery from the patriotic youth of Abingdon. On the 23d day of October, 1838, a new county jail was completed on the public lot at the corner of Court and Valley streets, and the prison bounds were so extended as to include the new jail. On the 16th day of November, 1841, Andrew Russell, after more than forty years of active participation in the government of the town of Abingdon, departed this life, and appropriate resolutions were adopted by the County Court of Washington county, Virginia, in token of respect to his name. On the 27th of May, 1844, the County Court of Washington county appointed John M. Preston a commissioner to have a well dug upon the jail lot, which was done, and this served large numbers of the people of the town until the year 1901. In the year 1846, the citizens of Washington county were very greatly interested in the war between the United States and Mexico, Captain A. C. Cummings and General Peter C. Johnson taking an active part in the efforts made to organize the citizens of this county and enlist them in the service of their country, and on the 25th of March, 1846, the County Court entered the following order: "On motion of Arthur C. Cummings, Captain of the Artillery attached to the 164th Regiment of Virginia Militia, and it appearing to the court that the cannon which was sent out for the use of the said company is being injured for want of a shed to place the said cannon under to protect it from the weather, it is therefore ordered that leave be granted the said Cummings to have a suitable shed erected for the purpose aforesaid on the lower end of the public lot on which the courthouse stands, provided he can procure the same to be done at an expense not exceeding the sum of twenty dollars, and that the same be levied in the next County levy." A number of the citizens of this county served in that war under Captain Cummings, while General William E. Jones and Lieutenant John Preston Johnston did valiant service for their country, Johnston losing his life in the service. In the spring of the year 1847 the County Court of Washington county, Virginia, authorized the building of a new courthouse for the county in the town of Abingdon, which courthouse was completed by the year 1850, the court occupying a house of the late James White as a court-room from the year 1847 to 1850. Herbert M. Ledbetter was the undertaker of said building, and William Fields assisted in the completion of the building. Upon the completion of the courthouse Connally F. Trigg and Jacob Lynch were appointed commissioners to secure tables and chairs for the new courthouse and to have the courthouse bell removed and hung therein. It was also directed that the portico to the new courthouse should be enclosed with an iron railing; that the public lot should be enclosed and suitable pavements provided. The floors of the courthouse were ordered to be carpeted. At a meeting of the stockholders of the Exchange Bank of Virginia, held at Norfolk, Va., in the month of May, 1849, a branch bank was ordered to be established at Abingdon, with a capital of $100,000, and during the same month this branch bank was organized at Abingdon by the election of the following officers: President, Dr. Daniel Trigg; cashier, Robert R. Preston; directors, John C. Greenway, David Campbell, Beverly R. Johnston, Jacob Lynch, Isaac B. Dunn and Thomas L. Preston. This was Abingdon's first bank, and the town has not been without a bank since that time, with the exception of a short period in the fall of the year 1893. Upon the 30th of May, 1850, a peculiar order was entered by the County Court, which was as follows: "It appearing to the Court that there is now no overseer of the streets and alleys in the western end of the town of Abingdon, and that there is at present no Mayor in said town who could appoint an overseer, and it further appearing to the Court that the street in said town called Slaughter or Butcher Street south of the Main Street is in such bad repair as to render it unsafe to pass over it with a vehicle of any kind or for man on horseback; it is therefore ordered that Norman Crawford be and he is hereby authorized and directed to proceed and cause the said street to be put in such repair as to render the passage along the same safe and convenient for wheel carriages and horsemen, and that the expense thereof be levied out of the next county levy." On the 27th of April preceding, James H. Dunn, with ten other prominent citizens of the town, were elected Mayor and councilmen, and why this order was entered cannot be ascertained from the records preserved. In the year 1856, the Mayor and Council of Abingdon appointed E. M. Campbell, W. J. Deady and John C. Campbell a committee to have Slaughter street graded and macadamized, which was accordingly done. At the April term, 1853, of the County Court of this county, the court appointed John M. Preston, Peter J. Branch and Beverly R. Johnston a committee to plant trees in the public square north of the courthouse, which duty was performed and the trees thus planted remained in the square until the year 1902, when they were cut down and removed from the premises. On the 31st day of March, 1856, a fire of considerable proportions consumed a portion of the western end of the town. A description of the fire and the damage done, as given by the "Virginian" at the time, is here copied. "On Saturday morning last, about 2 o'clock, our town was visited by the most destructive fire that has occurred here since 1812. The hour at which it commenced, when the whole population was buried in slumber, and the place, in the midst of the largest collection of combustible material in the town, rendered it but the more resistless and disastrous. It broke out in the extensive coach factory of Mr. Henry Sinon, and in the course of an hour five large buildings, four of them wood, were consumed, besides numerous out-buildings that were either burned or torn down. Mr Sinon lost his dwelling, his shops and every building upon his premises, besides everything they contained, except a portion of his furniture. Some forty-odd new carriages and buggies were destroyed, as well as all his lumber, tools, materials, books and papers, involving a total loss of everything he possessed, except his family and part of his furniture and apparel. "The house recently purchased for the Gift Enterprise was also reduced to ashes, and the buildings of Mr. William Rodefer, adjoining, were demolished to arrest the progress of the flames. On the opposite side of the street Mr. Michael Shaver lost two tenements, one his old family residence on the corner, and the other a new two-story brick, recently erected. "The wind, coming from the west, for a time threatened the destruction of the whole town, as the flames broke out at various times and places upon the roofs of many of the neighboring buildings. Under all the circumstances, the dryness of the weather, the stiff northwest breeze, the combustible material of the buildings, the inflammable contents of the large, well-filled coach shop, the hour of the night and consequent relaxation of the muscles and energies of the people, and the scarcity of water, the wonder is that the destruction of property was not greater, but when the people did get there and had their blood warmed up, they put forth all their energies and fought the devouring element manfully. The whole population was out, men, women, children and servants, and all performed their duty. "The loss is a heavy one, probably between $30,000 and $40,000, and the whole is supposed to have been the work of an incendiary. A negro girl of Mr. Sinon's, who had previously forboded or threatened evil to the family, is now in jail under suspicion. "Messrs. Crawford, Ellis, Joseph A. Brownlow and H. B. Tunnell are the other persons whose families were left without shelter, all of whom, so rapid was the progress of the flames, lost a portion of their household property. A broad expanse of blackened earth with a number of tall, ghost-like chimneys, is all that is left of the best improved portion of the west end of Abingdon. "In addition to Mr. Sinon's loss of carriages, Mr. Greenway lost four, Mr. Robertson two, and Messrs. T. L. Preston, B. K. and M. H. Buchanan, Thos. G. McConnell, J. M. Rose and others one each. "On Saturday evening a meeting of the citizens was held for the purpose of relieving, as far as possible, the destitution of the sufferers, at which John M. Preston, Esq., was called to the chair and John G. Kreger appointed Secretary. The Chairman explained the object of the meeting and appointed Revs. McChain, Baldwin, Dickey, and Barr and Wm. Y. C. White, Esq., a committee to wait upon the people for such aid as they might be disposed to contribute. The last we heard of the effort, upwards of $1200 had been raised, which, for the citizens of town and vicinity, is exceedingly liberal." By this time the Virginia and Tennessee railroad was approaching Abingdon, and on the 1st day of April, 1854, the Council of Abingdon passed an ordinance allowing the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad Company to enter the town and to use the streets and cross streets of the town, provided they place their depot in the town or at the eastern end thereof, and the citizens of the town presented a petition to the authorities of the new road asking that the same be located at the Knob Road, or the eastern end of the town. In addition to what the Council of the town did to secure the depot of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad Company, the citizens of the town petitioned the railroad authorities to place their depot at the eastern end of the town, but Thomas L. Preston agreed to give the railroad three acres of land at the present location of the Norfolk and Western depot, and the depot of the railroad was established at that point, the railroad being completed as far as Abingdon by the year 1856. John D. Mitchell, the Mayor of Abingdon, departed this life on Tuesday morning, March 15th, 1859, and on the following morning the Council of the town convened at the courthouse and appointed Dr. E. M. Campbell, S. W. Carnahan and James C. Greenway a committee to draft and report suitable resolutions, which committee reported on the evening of the same day. The resolutions were as follows: "Whereas, It has pleased Almighty God to call suddenly from our midst John D. Mitchell, Esq., our worthy officer and esteemed citizen, therefore: "Resolved, That it is with deep regret we have heard of the sudden death of our Mayor and friend, John D. Mitchell, Esq., and that in his death the community has lost a long tried and faithful public servant and an esteemed and worthy citizen, and this body an efficient and honored presiding officer. "Resolved, That we deeply sympathize with the family of the deceased. "Resolved, That the members of the Council and its officers wear a badge of mourning for thirty days. "Resolved, That this preamble and these resolutions be entered upon the record of the Council. "Resolved, That a copy of these proceedings be transmitted to the family of the deceased. "Resolved, That the editors of the `Virginian' and `Democrat' be requested to publish the foregoing preamble and resolutions in their respective papers." This is the only death of a Mayor of the town while in office in the history of the town. Nothing further of importance occurred previously to the spring of 1861, the opening of the war between the States. In the spring of this year the following officers of the town were elected: Mayor, Samuel W. Carnahan; Councilmen, James K. Gibson, Thomas S. Stuart, Milton Y. Heiskell, Jacob Lynch, John G. Kreger, Isaac Benham, Newton K. White, William Keller, John W. Johnston and William Rodefer; Sergeant, B. C. Clark. The charter of the town was amended by Act of the Assembly on the 18th of March, 1852, and by this charter the town was authorized to construct water works for the town, but the question had to be submitted to the voters of the town for their approval or disapproval. By an order of the Council an election was ordered for the second day of July, 1853, which election was held, but the result cannot be given, as no record of the same has been preserved. It is probable that the vote was adverse, as the question is not mentioned again in the records. At the first meeting of the new Council, on the 9th of July, 1861, the following orders were entered: "Ordered that the Mayor appoint a patrol of the citizens, regardless of age, to patrol the town of nights, who are able to render such service." "On motion the Mayor is directed to appoint a committee to wait upon those who sell liquor in the town and request them not to sell liquor to the soldiers in and about Abingdon." "On motion it was made the duty further of said committee to request of officers permitting their men to come to Abingdon to require of them to leave their side-arms in their camp quarters." The record of the town government from this time until the summer of 1863 has not been preserved. At a meeting of the Town Council on the 18th of August, 1863, the Mayor was appointed a committee to ascertain at what price a negro man, suitable for work on the streets, could be purchased by the corporation. The committee reported on September 1st, 1863, that a negro man suitable for the purpose could be purchased of Mr. Seabright for $1,800. Thereupon, it was moved and seconded that the negro man be purchased, upon which motion a vote was taken and resulted in a unanimous vote against the purchase of the negro, otherwise we might now have to record the corporation of Abingdon as a slave-owner. At the same meeting of the Council, C. S. Bekem and E. M. Campbell were appointed a committee to select a suitable piece of ground outside of the present enclosure of the Sinking Spring Cemetery as a burial ground for Confederate soldiers, to ascertain the cost of the same, and report to the next meeting of the Council, but this committee was discharged on the 18th of April, 1864, without reporting, and a resolution was adopted requesting Captain M. B. Tate, post-quartermaster, to make some arrangements as to a proper location for the burial of Confederate soldiers and enclosing the same. Quite a number of Confederate dead are buried in the Sinking Spring Cemetery, and their graves to-day are unmarked, and not the slightest effort has recently been made to keep green the graves, or fresh in memory the brave souls who died in defence of their country, and, as they were taught to believe, in a righteous cause. Could these brave men again appear in the flesh and see their surroundings, how justly could they reproach their fellow-soldiers, descendants and kinsmen, for their failure to discharge such an obligation to the worthy dead.* * Since the above was written a neat wire fence has been placed around the square containing the bodies of the Confederate dead. By the latter part of August, 1863, numbers of wounded soldiers and officers were in Abingdon, and the enemy not thirty miles distant, and on September 1st, 1863, the owners of carriages in and around Abingdon lent every assistance in transporting the sick and wounded to Washington Springs. On the 25th of September, 1863, this community was threatened by an invasion of the Federals from the west. An account of the situation, as it was in Abingdon at that time, is here given: "On Saturday last, great excitement prevailed all over this county, in consequence of the apprehended approach of the Yankees from Kingsport, Tenn., in this direction. The particulars, as accurately as we can obtain them from the mass of contradictory rumors and accounts, are these: Two companies of Col. Carter's 1st Tenn. Cavalry had been resting and recruiting their horses for a few days on Netherland's Island, near Kingsport, after their successive skirmishes with the enemy near Cumberland Gap, when they were suddenly attacked by a Yankee Brigade under General Ross. Carter threw his few men on this side of the river and made a stand at Vance's Ford of Reedy Creek, opposite the upper end of Kingsport. After holding the enemy in check awhile, a very large force was seen crossing the river above the island, for the purpose of flanking him. Carter's men then fell back, taking the Holston Springs road one mile this side of Kingsport, and being separated from the rest of the command, they proceeded to Bristol on Saturday. The Yankees kept the Reedy Creek road to Morell's Mill, and thence to Bristol. A large portion of Colonel Carter's men, from frequent skirmishing and falling back, became much scattered, but the small number, about one hundred and fifty, who were led by the Colonel in person, fought gallantly and made a stand whenever and wherever there was a chance to hold the enemy in check. "The enemy reached Bristol about the middle of the day Saturday, and committed some depredations, among which were the burning of the commissary house with, some say a hundred, and others three hundred, barrels of flour, a small amount of bacon and some dozen boxes of ammunition, rifled Gugginheimer's store and despoiled the houses of a few citizens. This latter was done by a few stragglers who had been left behind and who were intoxicated. "The enemy then started in this direction, and Carter again gave them fight at Millard's Mill, one mile this side of Bristol, farther than which they did not come in force. Foraging parties scattered out as far up perhaps as Col. John Preston's, but no particular damage was done that we have heard of. They all then retired beyond Bristol, and, on Sunday morning, proceeded towards Zollicoffer, where they were met by General Jones and got more than they bargained for. The fight lasted several hours, with, it is said, a loss to the enemy of nine killed and about thirty wounded, and to us of two killed and seven or eight wounded. General Williams pursued the enemy to within two and one-half miles of Blountville and only returned when called back by a dispatch from Gen. Jones. "All day Saturday most intense excitement prevailed in Abingdon. The company recently organized in town was under arms all day, together with various squads from the country, in support of Davidson's Battery, then stationed in this vicinity, with the Provost Guard, and also a portion of Colonel Carter's cavalry, and Col. Chenneworth and his command. From the position of our forces, a fair view of the road towards Bristol was had for a mile or two, in which direction all eyes were constantly turned. Ever and anon, when a cloud of dust produced by flying refugees, men, women, negroes and stock, rose in the distance, Captain Davidson could be seen to look sternly, and the fingers of the undrilled infantry pressed upon the triggers of the charged muskets. Had the Yankees approached, many saddles would have been emptied, for determined resistance was depicted in every countenance. "Had it not been humiliating it would have been amusing to see citizens and strangers stampeding through town with as much haste and excitement as if the Yankees had been at their heels, when the latter were quietly regaling themselves at Bristol, without a thought of proceeding another foot in this direction. As night approached, scouts brought the information that the enemy had gone in the opposite direction, when `quiet once more reigned in Warsaw.' "* * Abingdon, Virginia. From this time until the summer of 1864, the officers and citizens of Abingdon were kept busy guarding the town, nursing the sick and wounded and burying the dead. To add to the troubles of the people, in the month of June, 1864, small-pox was discovered in the town, which caused a great deal of uneasiness and annoyance. Such was the condition of the people of the town in the month of December, 1864, when General Stoneman, in command of about 10,000 Federal troops, arrived at Abingdon on the evening of the 14th. By order of General Stoneman, the depot of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad Company, the Government Commissary (Hurt's store), in charge of Captain Williams, the issuing department of the Quartermaster's Department (Sinon &amp; Co.'s brick carriage factory), in charge of Major Crutchfield, Quartermaster's storing department (Musser &amp; Co.'s carriage factory), in charge of J. E. C. Trigg, the county jail and the barracks opposite the jail, on the corner of Court and Valley streets, were destroyed by fire, the Federal officers strictly enjoining the destruction of any other than government property. After the destruction of this property, the Federal troops resumed their march to the east, but had not left the town more than two hours before a renegade by the name of James (Tites) Wyatt, who had formerly been an apprentice to Gabriel Stickley, being in the town on horseback, proceeded to fire all the property on both sides of Main street from Court street to Brewers' street. He succeeded in firing the courthouse and other buildings on the north side of Main street and had fired all the buildings on the south side of Main as far west as the present storehouse occupied by Honaker &amp; Sons, when he discovered the presence of a number of Confederate soldiers and undertook to make his escape, passing down Main street to the west with all possible speed, hotly pursued by the Confederate soldiers, being hard pressed all the time. When he reached Hayes Street he turned to the south at the eastern gate of Stonewall Jackson Institute. At this point he fell from his horse and was left for dead, but was afterwards carried into the former residence of Governor Floyd, where he soon died. The fire that he thus started destroyed the courthouse of the county and all the buildings west as far as the present residence of S. N. Honaker. All the buildings on that side of the street were of brick and almost all were three stories high. On the south of Main street every building, without an exception, was destroyed, from Court street on the east to Brewers' street on the west. The fire might have been stopped sooner, but, at the time, in Abingdon was hardly an able-bodied man, and about the only witnesses of the destruction of the town were old men, women and children. Thus the people of Abingdon were to a great extent rendered homeless, with starvation and sickness on every side and their country in the hands of the enemy. Such was the condition of the town when peace came, in 1865. The fall of 1865 and spring of 1866 were used by the people in collecting and preserving such property as had been left after four years of desperate fighting. The first meeting of the Town Council of Abingdon, after the surrender, was held at the office of Dr. W. F. Barr on March 3d, 1866, with the following officers present: Mayor, G. R. R. Dunn; Councilmen, Norman Crawford, Charles J. Cummings, John G. Clark, David G. Thomas, William Rodefer, Milton Y. Heiskell and W. F. Barr. The first order entered by this meeting was one repealing the bylaws in so far as the same referred to the punishment of slaves and free men of color, and the Mayor was directed to refer all violations of the laws of the town by freed men or freed women to Lieutenant Woodward, superintendent of the Freedmen's Bureau of this district. At the same meeting a committee of five was appointed to petition the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad Company to locate the new depot on or near the Knob Road leading from Abingdon, or at the eastern end of the town, and on March 16th, 1866, a committee of three was appointed to ascertain what ground could be procured for a depot and what subscription could be raised to aid in building the depot, and on June 21st, 1866, a resolution was adopted, requesting the directors of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad Company to send a committee to Abingdon to discuss with the Council the question of the location of a depot; but, notwithstanding the efforts of the officers and the people of the town of Abingdon, the depot was built upon the location of the old depot. The Council and people of Abingdon from this time henceforward lent their every energy toward the upbuilding of the town, and in a few years the damages suffered by the town as a result of the war were completely obliterated. Pursuant to the proclamation of the Governor, the courts of the county and circuit were held in the Temperance Hall until the county could build a new courthouse. The County Court of Washington county, in November, 1866, awarded the contract of building a new courthouse to the following persons: To Messrs. James and David Fields, the brick-work and plastering; to Mr. Hockman, of Harrisonburg, the carpentry-work; to Messrs. Keller &amp; Grim, the tin-work; to Messrs. Morrison and Vaughan, the painting. The courthouse was completed by the beginning of the year 1869, and at the time was said to be the handsomest courthouse in the State. On May 10th, 1873, Valley street, from the residence of Martin Keller to the west gate of the residence of G. V. Litchfield, was ordered to be macadamized, G. V. Litchfield paying a large part of the costs of said macadamizing. We here give a description of the town as it was in 1875, written by the late Charles B. Coale. "Abingdon was endowed with its name anterior to 1776. The streets, of which there are seven, intersect each other at right angles, three east and west, and four north and south, with an equal number of alleys running in the same direction. The streets are sixty feet wide and the alleys sixteen. The main street is MacAdamized, as are several others partially, with brick pavements on either side, from one end of the town to the other. There is no place of its size in the State more noted for fashion, taste and morality, with its usual proportion of loafers and gentlemen of leisure; and, like all other places where there is or has been considerable wealth, there is a right smart sprinkling of what some people would term aristocracy, but which, in reality, is nothing more than a decent observance of the conventionalities of life. Many of the private residences, as well as the public buildings, are of brick, large and tasteful, and a number of them three stories high. They are generally neat, some of them approaching elegance, and but few dilapidated, though one here and there may look as if it had been rocked by an earthquake, or had danced to the piping of a hurricane, at some period in its history. We claim to have one of the most capacious and convenient courthouses in the Commonwealth, and by some it is considered a model in architecture, with its massive pillars and towering steeple, though the writer must confess that he cannot exactly see it in that light. "We are great church-going people and have a variety of denominations. For instance, we have two Methodist churches, Episcopal and Protestant, a Baptist, a Presbyterian, a Protestant Episcopal, and a Roman Catholic, and for good measure we have thrown in a Swedenborgian Temple, and a few Lutherans, Universalists and Christian Baptists lying around loose. In all these churches are regular services, except the Baptist, which is rather too far from water to be very vigorous, and the Swedenborgian. We have three large and well kept hotels, nine variety stores, two drug stores, two fancy stores, two or three drinking saloons, half a dozen confectionaries, an agricultural warehouse, a bakery, a billiard saloon, an iron-foundry, three or four black-smith and as many wheelwright shops, two tanneries, two or three saddle and harness establishments, any number of carpenters, painters, shoemakers, tailors, brick and stone-masons, a large brick town-hall, a library association and reading room, in which may be found all the leading literature of the day, and last, though not least, two of the best weekly papers within a circuit of a dozen miles, and a job office. The town was incorporated by legislative enactment many years ago, and, city-like, has a mayor and common council, who maintain the peace and dignity of the corporation and periodically enforce the hog-law. "We have, as is the case in all places where the people get sick and die, or fall out with and wrong each other, a redundancy of doctors and lawyers, five or six of the former and a baker's dozen of the latter, none of them probably making fortunes very rapidly by their professions. "There seems to be no possible chance of a diminution of lawyers shortly, but there is a bare probability that some of the doctors may take a dose of his own medicine one of these days, and if so, the jig is certainly up with him. One of our citizens, Judge Johnston, is a United States Senator, and we have a score or less who would love to be in the house of representatives. And right here it might be said, that we have three banks, all as stubborn as mules since the Legislature has limited interest to six per cent., two or three insurance companies, a machine shop operated by steam, two tin and copper-smith's establishments, a photograph gallery, two barber shops and the biggest sort of a colored school." Nothing more of sufficient importance to be worthy of note occurred from this time until the year 1884. In the month of April of that year the Council of the town appropriated $100 to pay the expenses of a committee to the city of Washington to prevent the United States Courthouse from being located at Wytheville. And in this year the main street, from J. M. Rose's to Wall street, and Wall street, from Main street to the depot, was macadamized, thirty feet in width, and from six to twelve inches in depth. Sidewalks made of brick and curb-stones were placed on both sides of Main street and of Wall street, at an expense of several thousand dollars. A large portion of the territory in the western part of the town was thus opened and prepared for rapid development, and at this time the community thus dealt with constitutes the best business section of the town. The Mayor and Council were authorized and directed to issue $20,000 in bonds, pursuant to the Act of the General Assembly of date March 4th, 1884, and, in keeping with this spirit of improvement, the Council, by an ordinance passed on the 12th day of April, 1886, ordered all porches and steps to be removed from the streets of the town, and a committee was appointed on April 5th of the same year to investigate the opening of Valley street, through the property of Miss Ella V. Findlay and that of Dr. William White. By an ordinance, adopted on the 11th day of October, 1886, the sergeant of the town was ordered to kill all the English sparrows found within the corporate limits. The author of the last ordinance is unknown, the record giving no information of the member of the Council upon whose motion this order was made. About this time a peculiar order was entered by the Council of the town. The contest as to the readjustment of the State debt was the sole theme of public discussion, and, upon motion of James H. Hines, William H. Mitchell was permitted to erect a pole at the corner of Court and Main streets and near the Bank of Abingdon building and to place thereon a Readjuster flag. This is the only instance in the history of the town, so far as I can ascertain, in which a request of this kind was made and granted. On the 14th day of October, 1887, S. F. Hurt, a member of the Town Council, at the request of Captain James L. White, moved that an election be ordered to take the sense of the citizens of the town of Abingdon upon the voting of $20,000 of the bonds of the town to the Abingdon Coal &amp; Iron Railroad Company. The Council directed this election to be held on the 24th of November, 1887, and John C. Campbell, David J. Webb and W. M. G. Sandoe were appointed judges to conduct the election, in which election all persons authorized to vote in any election held in the town for town officers were permitted to vote. The result of the election was one hundred and fifty-three votes for the subscription and thirty votes against the subscription, being one hundred and eighty votes out of a total registration of two hundred and seventy-four. In this election seventy-five freeholders voted; sixty-one for the subscription and fourteen against it. The Council thereupon subscribed $20,000 to said railroad company, John A. Buchanan, George E. Penn and W. J. Brown having been appointed by the Council for that purpose on December 22d, 1887. The question arose as to when the bonds thus subscribed to said railroad should be issued, and upon this question George E. Penn and W. J. Brown, two of the committee, recommended that said bonds should be issued and delivered as fast as the road was graded, at the rate of $133.33? per mile, while Judge Buchanan filed a minority recommendation that said bonds be issued for the sum mentioned as each mile of the railroad was completed, but the majority report was adopted, and the bonds were issued and delivered as the road was graded. At a meeting of the Council on the 18th of August, 1888, on motion of Dr. George E. Wiley, seconded by H. H. Scott, an election was ordered to be held on the 29th of September, 1888, to take the sense of the voters of the town upon the question of a subscription of a sum not exceeding $20,000, for the purpose of furnishing water and lights for the town. In this election sixty-three votes were poled for the proposition and fifty-seven against it, but the Council refused to subscribe any amount to this enterprise. It was a short time only until the town obtained the benefits of a very efficient water and light company. At a meeting of the Council on the 6th of July, 1892, upon motion of Samuel A. Carson, seconded by Colonel A. F. Cook, a committee was appointed to buy a lot in the town of Abingdon, upon which to build a Mayor's office and city prison. This committee purchased a part of a lot situated near the centre of the town upon the south side of the street, adjoining the I. O. O. F. Hall, for the sum of $450, and immediately erected thereon a very commodious building, which has since been occupied by the officials of the town, and in the year 1897, a house was erected upon the same lot, in which all prisoners failing to pay their fines in money are required to break rock to satisfy the same, the rock thus prepared being used to macadamize the streets of the town. In the year 1900 Col. A. C. Cummings and D. S. Grim, surviving trustees of the Sons of Temperance, transferred to the town of Abingdon the title to Temperance Hall, and their action was confirmed shortly thereafter by the General Assembly of Virginia, whereupon John W. Barr, H. H. Scott, J. W. Bell, D. A. Preston and R. M. Page were named as trustees to hold said property for the town. It is the purpose of the town to improve this property, and, if this be done, it will be quite an addition to the town and probably a source of revenue. Such is a brief outline of the history of Abingdon as it has been preserved. In the words of another and a more gifted writer: "If there is any more picturesque country than that which surrounds Abingdon, the writer has never been so fortunate as to see it; that is, according to his idea of the grand and beautiful in nature. For a mile or two around, the landscape is undulating, interspersed with bolder hills generally wooded, standing out like islands in a storm-tossed sea. During Spring and Summer the whole face of the earth, except cultivated fields, seems to be covered with a carpet of green irregularly figured with wild flowers, a rural picture with a frame-work of mountains.* * Charles B. Coale. "To the south of and adjoining the corporate limits of the town, is `King's Mountain,' now thickly populated. It was so named because of a fancied resemblance to the famous mountain in South Carolina, on which was fought the battle of October 7th, 1780. The victory won there by the western mountaineers, quorum magna pars were Washington county men, Mr. Jefferson said, turned the tide of war in favor of the United States and led Cornwallis to march to Yorktown, to his surrender there, and to the end of the war." "There were many of the veterans of that campaign alive in 1825, and to rehearse the incidents of the contest and impress upon the minds of that generation the gallant and daring deeds of their ancestors, a sham battle was fought at King's Mountain. The position of the Revolutionary commanders was occupied by some officers who were instructed (perhaps drilled,) how to play their part, and the English people in red coats, with cannon and bayonetted muskets, occupied the crest of the hill. There was great firing of blank cartridges, charging up the hill and retreat from the fixed bayonets of the British regulars, until Colonel Ferguson was killed and a white flag raised. In all of this melee no fatal accidents occurred and few casualties."* * Thomas L. Preston. To the north and northwest of the corporate limits of the town is Fruit Hill, commonly called "Taylor's Hill," which is thickly settled, and it is reasonable to say that at least one-third of the inhabitants of the town proper are without the corporate limits. The main street of Abingdon of the present day is fully one mile in length. The streets are excellently macadamized, with brick pavements on both sides. Valley street is more than one-half mile in length, a part of the street being macadamized, and brick pavements are on the eastern end thereof. This street is rapidly developing and is destined to become the main thoroughfare of the town. It would be a considerable undertaking to enumerate the many and varied enterprises of the town. The chief pride of Abingdon are her educational facilities, there being three institutions in and near the town that cannot be excelled anywhere in this country, to-wit: Martha Washington College, Stonewall Jackson Institute and the Abingdon Male Academy, to each of which a separate chapter has been devoted.

An Act for Establishing a Town at the Courthouse in the County of Washington. Passed October, 1778. "Whereas it hath been represented to this present general assembly that Thomas Walker, Esq., Joseph Black and Samuel Briggs have engaged to give one hundred and twenty acres of land in the county of Washington, where the court house of the said county now stands, agreeable to a survey thereof made by Robert Doach, for the purpose of establishing a town thereon, and for raising a sum of money towards defraying the expenses of building a court house and prison, agreeable to which part of the said land has been laid off, and several lots sold, and buildings erected thereon; and whereas it would tend to the more speedy improvement and settling the same, if the freeholders and inhabitants thereof could be entitled to the same privileges enjoyed by freeholders and inhabitants of other towns of this state, Be. it Enacted By this Present General Assembly, That the said one hundred and twenty acres of land, agreeable to a survey made thereof, relation thereto being had may more fully appear, be and the same is hereby vested in fee simple in Evan Shelby, William Campbell, Daniel Smith, William Edmondson, Robert Craig and Andrew Willoughby, gentlemen, trustees and shall be established a town by the name of Abingdon. "And be it further enacted, That the said trustees, or any three of them, shall, and they are hereby empowered to make conveyances to the purchasers of any lots already sold, or to be sold, agree able to the conditions of the contracts, and may also proceed to lay off such other part of said land as is not yet laid off and sold, into lots, and streets and such lots shall be sold by the said trustees at publick auction for the best price that can be had, the time and place of sale being previously advertised at least three months before, on some court day at the court house of that and the adjacent county, the purchasers respectively to hold the said lots subject to the condition of building on such lots a dwelling house at least twenty feet long and sixteen feet wide, with a brick or stone chimney, to be finished within four years from the date of sale, and the said trustees, or any three of them, shall, and they are hereby empowered to convey the said lots to the purchasers thereof in fee simple, subject to the condition aforesaid, and receive the monies arising from such sale, and pay the same to the order of the Court of Washington County, towards defraying the expenses of their publick buildings, and the over-plus, if any, to be applied in repairing the streets of the aforesaid town. "And be it further enacted, That the said trustees, or the major part of them, shall have power from time to time to settle and determine all disputes concerning the bounds of said lots, and to settle such rules and orders for the regular and orderly buildings of houses thereon as to them shall seem best and most convenient. And in case of the death, removal out of the country, or other legal disability of any of the said trustees, it shall and may be lawful for the freeholders of the said town to elect and chose so many other persons in the room of those dead, removed or disabled, as shall make up the number, which trustees so chosen shall be to all intents and purposes individually vested with the same power and authority as any one in this act particularly mentioned. "And be it further enacted, That the purchasers of the lots in the said town, so soon as they shall have built upon and saved the same according to the conditions of their respective deeds and conveyances, shall be entitled to and have and enjoy all the rights, privileges and immunities which the freeholders and inhabitants of other towns in this state, not corporated by charter, have, hold and enjoy. "And be it further enacted, That if the purchasers of any lots sold by the said trustees shall fail to build thereon within the time before limited, the said trustees, or the major part of them, may thereupon enter into such lot, and may either sell the same again, and apply the money towards repairing the streets, or in any other way for the benefit of the said town, or they may appropriate the said lot, or any part of it, to any publick use for the benefit of the inhabitants of said town. "And be it further enacted, by the authority aforesaid, that the trustees of the said town, and their successors, for the time being, shall, and they are hereby authorized and empowered by that name to sue and implead either in the court of the said county, or the general Court, any person or persons who shall commit a trespass on the streets of said town, or lands which may have been appropriated for the use of the inhabitants thereof. All sums of money recovered by virtue hereof shall be applied by the said trustees towards repairing the streets of the said town. "Provided, always, That nothing herein contained shall be construed to affect the legal rights of any person holding lands adjoining the said town."* * 9 Hen. S., p. 55. BRISTOL, VIRGINIA. It is with delicacy that we undertake to write of a locality that at the present time is attracting the attention of a considerable part of the business world and that is destined to become a great city. There has been something in the location of Bristol that attracted the attention of the early explorers of our country, and afterwards many of our best and noblest citizens. Some time after Colonel James Patton had obtained from the Governor and Council of Virginia a grant for one hundred and twenty thousand acres of land to be located in this section of Virginia, John Buchanan, a deputy surveyor of Augusta county, with a comany of explorers, visited this section of Virginia and from the Bristol, 1856. Bristol, 1903. year 1746 to the year 1750 surveyed made tracts of the choicest land to be found on all the waters of the Indian river.* * Now Holston. Among the lands surveyed by John Buchanan were three tracts in the immediate vicinity of Bristol. The three tracts in question were surveyed for John Taylor, of Caroline county, Virginia, and are described as follows: 1,946 acres, Shallow Creek,† † Beaver Creek. waters of Indian river. 1,000 acres, Shallow Creek, waters of Indian river. 720 acres, Shallow Creek, waters of Indian river. The first tract was surveyed on the 22d of February, 1749, and to it was given the name of "Sapling Grove"; the second tract was surveyed on the 23d of February, 1749, and to it was given the name of "Timber Grove," while the third tract was surveyed on the 19th of March, 1749, and was given the name of the "Forks." From this time until about the year 1765, the close of the French-Indian war, no efforts were made to settle the lands in question, so far as can be ascertained. In the year 1765, or shortly thereafter, Evan Shelby and Isaac Baker left their homes in Maryland‡ ‡ Now Washington county, Md. and came to the Holston country, and soon thereafter purchased the "Sapling Grove" tract of 1,946 acres from John Buchanan, who, by assignment from John Taylor, had become the owner thereof. This tract of land was divided between Shelby and Baker by Robert Preston, Shelby owning 973 acres, the western end thereof, and Baker 973 acres, the eastern end thereof. Soon after the purchase Evan Shelby erected his residence upon the lots now occupied by Dr. John Ensor and John H. Caldwell, in South Bristol, while Isaac Baker erected his residence on Beaver Creek, about 300 yards north of the present residence of A. A. Hobson and north of the creek. The location of his residence is pointed out at the present time in an old field in which stand a few apple trees. John Buchanan died before a patent issued for said land and before he had executed a deed for same to Shelby and Baker, and William Preston and William Campbell, the executors of John Buchanan, for some reason, did not convey said land during their lifetime. Colonel William Preston, by his will, appointed John Preston, Francis Preston, John Breckenridge and John Brown his executors, and on the 2d of May, 1796, John Preston, one of the executors of William Preston, executor of John Buchanan, deceased, executed a deed to Isaac Baker, Jr., for the 973 acres of land contracted to his father, Isaac Baker, deceased, and on the 22d of November, 1798, Francis Preston, one of the executors of William Preston, executor of John Buchanan, deceased, conveyed to Isaac Shelby, as executor of Evan Shelby, deceased, the 973 acres of land contracted to Evan Shelby by John Buchanan. The consideration paid by Isaac Baker was 304 pounds, and by Evan Shelby 304 pounds. This 1,946-acre tract of land was patented to William Preston and William Campbell, executors of John Buchanan, deceased, on the 2d of November, 1779. Evan Shelby and Isaac Baker were intimate friends before their emigration to the Holston, as evidenced by the fact that Shelby had named one of his sons Isaac for Isaac Baker, while Baker had named one of his sons Evan for Evan Shelby. Isaac Shelby won distinction at King's mountain and was several times Governor of Kentucky, while Evan Baker took an active part in the cause of the Colonies and served during the Revolutionary war as deputy commissary on the waters of the Holston. Isaac Baker by his will devised his moiety in the "Sapling Grove" tract of land to his sons, Isaac Baker, Jr., and William Baker. Evan Shelby and Isaac Baker, in their lifetime, conveyed small portions of their respective properties to Henry Harkleroad, William Bolton and John O'Brian. It is worthy of mention at this point that Evan Shelby and Isaac Baker, in their old age, were bereft of their wives, and subsequently remarried—the former, Isabella Elliott; the latter, Mary Head, a young widow—and each was required by his prospective wife to make a settlement upon her before marriage, Evan Shelby conferring upon his second wife a considerable interest in his personal property, which was large, and of which a considerable number of slaves formed a part, and in his real estate at "Sapling Grove," while Isaac Baker made a similar provision for his second wife, and in addition thereto conveyed to the two sons of Mary Head by her former marriage one hundred acres of land each. Stirring scenes were often witnessed in the "Sapling Grove" community from the date of the settlement made by Shelby and Baker until the year 1800. The armies of the State and large delegations of Indians were many times visitors to this community. Colonel Evan Shelby was one of the great men produced by the conditions existing upon the frontiers in those days. He was well educated, patriotic and a very wise counsellor, and many times did he command expeditions against the Indian tribes living south of the Tennessee. The Virginia Government greatly appreciated his worth, and prior to 1781 conferred upon him numerous (very valuable) tracts of land within her territory, and subsequent to 1781 the Government of North Carolina showered upon him every honor that could be thought of. Colonel Shelby departed this life in the year 1794, leaving Isaac Shelby, Moses Shelby, Evan Shelby and James Shelby, sons, and several daughters. His remains were interred in a grove of very fine trees and within view of his former residence, and remained there until the growth of Bristol required their removal to the present cemetery. The location of his grave previous to this removal is now pointed out as being on Fifth street immediately in front of the First Presbyterian church, Bristol, Tennessee. Isaac Baker was buried in this same graveyard. Isaac Baker, Sr., at the time of his death, left six sons, to-wit: William Baker, Isaac Baker, Joshua Baker, Evan Baker, John Baker and Thomas Baker and several daughters, to-wit: Hatchy Baker, Susannah, who married Thomas Worley, Mary, who married Thomas Van Swearingen and Catharine, who married Ephraim Smith. William Baker, who obtained an interest in the "Sapling Grove" by the will of his father, removed to Knox county, Tennessee, and on the 10th of September, 1799, conveyed his interest in said land, being three hundred and forty-eight acres, to John Goodson, for the sum of $3,000, and this tract of land afterwards became the property of Colonel Samuel E. Goodson, and the location of a large part of East Bristol. Isaac Baker, Jr., conveyed part of the lands devised to him by his father to William Bolton, Solomon Sell, Henry Harkleroad, David Worley, John Cornett, Ephraim Johnson, John Cuff, Simeon Ely and Jacob Susong, while Colonel Isaac Shelby, as executor of Evan Shelby, conveyed the lands owned by Evan Shelby at "Sapling Grove" to James King, Jr., on the 26th of November, 1814, for the sum of $10,000. James King, immediately after his purchase, built a residence on Solar Hill, near Sullins College and near the present location of the late residence of H. E. McCoy, while the former residence of Isaac Baker was occupied by John Goodson. Some years previously to this an iron furnace was built on Beaver Creek about three and a half miles below the present location of Bristol at the Sulphur Springs. James King and John Goodson for many years exercised great diligence in farming their respective properties, and persons now living often speak of King's Meadows as a beautiful farm. In the year 1842, James King conveyed six acres of the "Sapling Grove" tract to Campbell Galliher, and on the 18th of June he conveyed to the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad Company, in addition to an eighty-foot right of way, ten acres of land for the use of the company, and on the 12th of April, 1854, he conveyed to his son-in-law, Joseph Anderson, four acres of land. By the year 1850 the building of the Virginia and Tennessee railroad had become an assured fact, and in view of the fact that the terminus of that road under the Virginia charter was the State line, the building of a town at this point was begun. Colonel Samuel E. Goodson had a part of his lands surveyed, and offered the same for sale. He gave to the proposed town the name of "Goodsonville," which name it retained until the incorporation of Goodson in the year 1856. He also gave to the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad Company a right of way through his lands, and transferred to the said company for a consideration, in the years 1851-1852, eleven acres of land for the use of the said company. Among the first conveyances executed by Colonel Goodson was to John G. King, Jacob H. Susong and J. P. Hammer, as trustees for the Independent Order of Odd-Fellows, and to John Fleming, John Moore, Fleming Crumbly, D. W. Crumbly, W. W. James, William F. Bolton, Wm. H. Snodgrass, Jesse Aydlott and Hardy Pool, as trustees for the Methodist Episcopal church. The lot last conveyed was Lot No. 103 in the plan of Goodsonville, as surveyed by Edmund Winston, and this lot is now occupied by the Colored Methodist Episcopal church on Lee street. Some time previous to the 1st of April, 1855, A. K. Moore, from Pennsylvania, arrived in Bristol and decided to make it his home, and ever thereafter until his death, in the year 1863, he was a most enthusiastic believer in the future of Bristol. He was a real estate agent by profession and an accomplished gentleman, and his views in regard to the future of Bristol were so convincing that the early settlers of the town were confident that it was a question of only a few years when Bristol would monopolize the trade and business of all the surrounding country. And having this object in view, the projectors of the town so named the streets thereof that by the year 1860 we find the principal streets having the following names: Virginia street, in honor of the Commonwealth; Washington street, in honor of Washington county; Russell street, in honor of Russell county; Lee street, in honor of Lee county; Scott street, in honor of Scott county; Cumberland street, in honor of the mountain of that name; while Moore street, King street, Shelby street and Spencer street were named for James King, A. K. Moore, Evan Shelby and Geo. M. Spencer, and Edmund street in honor of Edmund Winston, who first surveyed the lots and streets of the town. In the year 1855 the Magnolia House was built upon the location of the present Hamilton House, and a number of small houses were erected on both sides of Main street. James King about this time moved from his residence on Solar Hill to his home in South Bristol, where he subsequently died in 1867, and his former home on Solar Hill was occupied and used as a boarding house and as an office by Dr. J. P. Hammer and Walter Willoughby. A storehouse and hotel were built at the corner of Washington and Main streets on the corner now owned by John R. Dickey, and was occupied by Wilson &amp; Loyd, merchants, and the hotel was conducted by J. H. Everett. Jos. R. Anderson occupied the brick building on the southwest corner of Main and Fourth streets, and conducted a store therein. In the fall of the year 1855 it was found necessary to have local government in the town, and all the citizens of Bristol, Tennessee, and Goodson, Virginia, were called to meet upon the present location of the St. Lawrence Hotel, and at this meeting the Rev. James King presided. The meeting decided that it was necessary that the town should have local government, and after petitioning the General Assembly of Virginia to incorporate the town of Goodson, they proceeded to select one of their number to act as Mayor until a charter could be obtained. William L. Rice, a citizen of Goodson and at that time a member of the County Court of Washington county, and having the power in that capacity to administer oaths, to issue warrants for, and try, offenders against the law, was selected by the meeting to act as Mayor, tax collector and sergeant of the town. Pursuant to this authority, Mr. Rice proceeded to discharge his duties, and wishes the fact to be recorded that V. Keebler was the first man in the town to voluntarily pay one dollar to be used in discharging the costs of the government thus organized. Pursuant to the petition of the citizens of the two towns, the General Assembly of Virginia, on the 5th of March, 1856, incorporated the town of Goodson, and directed that the officers of the said town should consist of seven trustees and a sergeant, and their term of office was fixed at one year and until their successors were appointed, and it was directed that an election should be held for the selection of the trustees and sergeant therein provided for on the first Saturday in April, 1856, and James Fields, John N. Bosang and A. T. Wilson, or any two of them, were directed to conduct said election. It will be observed that this Act contemplated the government of the town by a Board of Trustees, and nothing was said as to a Mayor, but the citizens of the town thereafter selected a Mayor until the charter of the town was amended, among the number thus selected being A. K. Moore, A. M. Appling, William L. Rice, Philip Rohr and others, whose names I have been unable to obtain. The persons thus selected to act in the capacity of Mayor also acted as sergeant of the town. It is a matter of regret that no record has been preserved of the early trustees of the town of Goodson. The boundaries of the town of Goodson, as set out in the Act of incorporation, were as follows: Beginning at a sycamore tree on the west side of the said town; running thence north 22 east one hundred and ten poles; thence due east one hundred and fifty poles; thence due south 22 east one hundred and forty poles; thence south 56 west one hundred poles; thence north 37 west one hundred and fifty poles to the beginning. The sycamore tree mentioned in this Act stood about two feet south of the middle of Main street, and in front of the storehouse formerly occupied by T. F. Wood. The Virginia and Tennessee railroad reached Bristol in the fall of the year 1856, and at the time the following merchants were doing business in the town, to-wit: Seneker &amp; James, on Main street between Fourth and Water streets at the place now occupied by Bunn's store; Jos. R. Anderson, at the corner of Fourth and Main streets, as before described; Rosenheim Bros., on southwest corner of Main and Fifth streets, the present location of the drug store; Martin Bros., on the location of the National Bank of Bristol, and Wilbar Bros., on the southwest corner of Main and Sixth streets; Smith &amp; Wilson, at the corner of Main and Washington streets, and L. F. Johnson, in a brick building south of the Norfolk and Western railway and near the west bank of the creek. J. N. Bosang kept a bar-room on the lot now occupied by the Dominion National Bank and Williams Walters a bar-room at the present location of the Stanley House, and in addition thereto whiskey was retailed at several of the stores above enumerated. Three hotels were found in the town at that time, the Caywood House, kept by Ezekiel Caywood, at the present location of the Thomas House; the Magnolia House, kept by Peck &amp; Langhorne, at the present location of the Hamilton House, and the Virginia House, kept by John H. Everett, at the corner of Main and Washington streets on the Dickey lot. In addition to the places named several small houses were found along the Virginia side of Main street from Fourth to Moore, and one brick residence on Main street between Fourth and Water streets, east of Bosang's bar-room, and known as the Zimmerman House. A portion of this house is now occupied by Col. J. B. Peters, President of the Board of Health, as an office. In the year 1855, upon the application of William L. Rice, the county court of this county appointed John F. Preston, Wallace Maxwell, Moses H. Latham, William B. Campbell, E. R. Rhea and Jonathan T. Hanby commissioners to view a location for a road from the town of Goodson to the Jonesboro road at or near the lands of John L. Bradley, three miles west of Abingdon. The commissioners thus named made their report, and the main Bristol road was opened in the following year. In December of this year the county court of this county appointed the following citizens living in the vicinity of Goodson to patrol in the neighborhood of Goodson: Roland T. Legard, captain, James T. Preston, Henry A. Wilds, William A. Preston, E. L. Brooks, John P. Buchanan, Joseph Rhea, Alexander, James, and Jacob Carmack. In the following year Nunley &amp; Fuqua and Booker &amp; Trammel were licensed to conduct business in the town of Goodson. Early in the year 1857 a number of the citizens of Goodson and Bristol, recognizing the importance of a newspaper, formed a joint stock company and purchased a printing press in Philadelphia, and in the month of May, 1857, began the publication of the Bristol News. The head lines of this paper presented a very suggestive scene. To the left of the page was placed an engine and car and to the right was placed a man on horseback, the train and horseman facing to the centre of the page. This paper was edited for a short while by A. K. Moore, who was succeeded by J. Austin Speery. Speery continued to edit this paper until the year 1862, in which year he became the editor of the Knoxville Register, and the News was discontinued until 1865. In 1858 Lafayette F. Johnson and Andrew Manonie were licensed to transact business in Goodson by the county court of Washington county. On the 10th of May, 1858, at about 1 o'clock A. M., in the night time of that day, the Magnolia Hotel was destroyed by fire and Minor Boler and George Ligon, free men of color, were arrested and tried, charged with having fired said building, but were acquitted. Soon thereafter the county court of this county appointed the following citizens to patrol in the town of Goodson: Robert B. Moore, captain, Lucian Johnson, J. F. H. Ledbetter, Edward Johnson, John C. Carner, Samuel G. Booker, Hardy Pool, John Hammit, James Williams and Joseph Barnes. About this time two lawyers came to Bristol and decided to make it their future home, John S. Mosby* * The since celebrated Colonel John S. Mosby. and Gideon Burkett. Burkett located on the Tennessee side of the town and had his office in the frame building that stood upon the lot occupied by Rosenheim Bros., while Mosby settled on the Virginia side and had his office in a building, owned by James King, that stood upon the lot now occupied by the Tip-Top Restaurant, at the corner of Cumberland and Fourth streets. Bristol, Virginia, should be proud of the fact that her first lawyer afterwards distinguished himself in the defence of his State. In the year 1859 Raine &amp; Megginson, Jos. W. Jones, Lafayette F. Johnson and Raine &amp; Jamison were licensed to transact business in the town of Goodson, and John S. Mosby qualified as a notary public. By the year 1860 Col. Goodson had sold and transferred lots in the town of Goodson to the following citizens: Reuben H. Crabtree, J. N. Bosang, Thos. E. Bibb, Morgan &amp; Thomas, James H. Johnson, J. C. Hayter, Samuel Sells, John B. Wagoner, M. T. &amp; James W. Morgan, Jane G. Wilds, Thos. Lanahan, Stephen Connelly, A. T. Wilson, Ella Shelor, Sarah A. Howard, Henry Rosenheim, David Rust, John OBrian, Elijah Coman, John Rhea, George M. Spencer, Mary A. Hammit, David P. Jamison, Alex. Morgan, James Johnston, H. D. Shell, I. N. McQuown, Thos. J. Morrison, Wm. Rencher (colored barber), John Dulaney, Cordle Harmeling, L. F. Johnston, W. E. Eakin, Wm. Trammel, I. B. Dunn, S. H. Milliard, James A. Apling, D. J. Ensor, and many others. The Rev. James King had sold to David F. Scranton and Joseph Johnston, of Savannah, Georgia, sixty-five and a half acres of land, and they had conveyed parts thereof to W. L. Martin, James A. Apling, W. F. Moon, M. W. Jones, Alexander Lazenbay, Jesse Aydlott, V. Keebler, Samuel E. Philips, Bridget Powers, Sparrel Askew, John H. Newman, Thos. E. Lancaster, Jos. W. Jones, and several others. Such was Goodson, as best it can be described, at the opening of the war between the States. In the spring of the year 1861 Philip Rohr was elected Mayor, V. Keebler Recorder and Treasurer, Campbell Galliher, Sergeant, and J. N. Bosang, J. E. Pepper, John Johnston and W. H. Trammel aldermen of said town, and the officers thus elected served with but few changes until the year 1870. Immediately upon the declaration of war a company was organized at Goodson, to which was given the name of the Goodson Rifles, of which company John F. Terry was elected captain. This company was assigned to the Thirty-seventh Virginia Regiment, commanded by Col. Samuel V. Fulkerson, and many brave deeds are recorded as having been performed by the members of this company. On the 23d of July, 1861, Campbell Galliher, Sergeant of the town of Goodson, appeared before the county court of Washington county and represented to the court the need of firearms in said town, whereupon the county court directed the sheriff of this county to lend to the said Galliher, for use in the town of Goodson, ten guns, the property of the Commonwealth. In the month of February, 1862, Martin L. Comann and Rev. W. W. Neal purchased from Henry W. Baker the outfit of the Abingdon Democrat, and on the 27th of March, 1862, the first issue of the Southern Advocate was published in the town of Goodson, the Bristol News having passed out of existence at this time. The headline of this paper was such as to be worth recording. Between the words Southern and Advocate, which were printed in large letters, were placed the seal of the State of Virginia and the seal of the State of Tennessee, and above the seals was printed in small type "Virginia &amp; Tennessee." From this paper I ascertain that Jos. B. Palmer was at that time practising law in the town of Goodson, that L. A. Womack and W. W. Nickels were the proprietors of the Exchange Hotel, afterwards the Nickels House, and that the Bank of Philippi was temporarily transacting business in Goodson, with L. D. Morall as president and J. W. Payne as cashier. The Provost Marshal stationed at Bristol in the year 1862 was Joshua H. Pitts, but he was shortly thereafter succeeded by William D. Gammon. In the month of April the authorities of the Presbyterian and Methodist churches of Bristol tendered the use of their churches to the authorities of the Confederate States for the care of the sick and wounded soldiers. In 1862 a young ladies' boarding school was conducted in Bristol by Mrs. M. M. Bailey and was continued for several years thereafter. At the same time two schools for boys were conducted in the town the Bristol-Goodson Academy, of which Thos. D. Walthall was principal, and the Bristol High School, of which Prof. H. C. Neal was principal. From the files of the Southern Advocate we ascertain that W. M. Pettyjohn was conducting a general land agency, L. M. Hall practising dentistry, and A. P. Johnston, J. F. Parrot, M. D. Richmond &amp; Co., Johnston &amp; Pile and Wilbar Bros., merchants, were doing business in the town. In February, 1863, small-pox appeared in the town, causing a great deal of uneasiness, and Philip Rohr, the Mayor of Goodson, applied to the County Court of Washington county and was allowed the sum of five hundred dollars to fight the small-pox in the town. In the spring of this year the Southern Advocate ceased to exist, and the first issue of the State Line Gazette was published on the 6th of March, 1863. Martin L. Comann and Wm. L. Rice owned and edited this paper, and afterwards W. W. Langhorne, a young lawyer who had settled in the town, was associate editor. This paper lived about five years, and ceased to exist. By this time Goodson contained a considerable population, and on the 25th of May, 1863, Wm. F. Moon* * Father of John A. Moon, M. C., from the Third Tennessee District. petitioned the County Court of Washington county for the establishment of a voting precinct in the town, which precinct was established at the storehouse of A. M. Apling, and Wm. L. Rice was appointed conductor and Wm. F. Moon, Malon S. Susong, Valentine Keebler, Elijah Seneker and Hugh M. Milliard commissioners to hold all elections in said town. In the fall of the year 1863 the Federal forces reached Bristol and destroyed the freight depot, the brick storehouse occupied by L. F. Johnston, and the Masonic Lodge. And while the town was visited several times thereafter by the Federal forces during the war, no other property was destroyed by fire. In this year A. K. Moore was killed by Captain Lucas, of Kentucky, at the Thomas House, in Bristol, Tenn. Upon the close of the war, and in 1865, the Bristol News was resurrected by John Slack, and the first issue of this paper appeared on the 9th of August, 1865. From the files of this paper we find that Chas. R. Vance, J. R. Deadrick and J. B. Palmer, practising attorneys, then lived in Bristol-Goodson. Previous to the incorporation of Goodson by the General Assembly in the year 1856, and probably as late as the year 1860, the postoffice was "Sapling Grove," and was at first kept in the residence of James King on now Solar Hill, and afterwards in a small frame house on the lot now occupied by the St. Lawrence Hotel. The postoffice was removed to the Tennessee side of the town in 1865, by order of President Johnson. Early in the year 1866, the Rev. James King donated property situated in South Bristol, and valued at $16,000, for the purpose of establishing a school for young men, and to be under the management of the Holston Presbytery. The Presbytery which met at Leesburg, Tenn., shortly thereafter, accepted the proposition of Mr. King and appointed a board of curators, consisting of fifteen gentlemen, and this board was directed by the Presbytery to assemble in Bristol on the 4th of July, 1866, for the purpose of organizing the school and electing officers for the same. This school was organized, and has for many years been known as King College, one of the best-equipped schools to be found in all this section of the Holston country. The Virginia and Kentucky railroad was undertaken, and considerable work was accomplished on said road previously to 1861, but the outbreak of the war caused a cessation of all work for the time; but interest in the building of this road was again manifested in the year 1866, and the attention of the citizens of Goodson-Bristol to this matter was urged by Robert W. Hughes, president of the company, and a mass-meeting of the citizens was held in the Methodist church in Goodson in this year. Governor Francis H. Pierpoint and the Board of Public Works attended this meeting, and a great deal of interest was manifested. The meeting was called to order by the Rev. Philip Rohr, then Mayor of Goodson, Robert W. Hughes was elected chairman and Chas. R. Vance secretary, and strong resolutions, prepared by a committee composed of James King, John Slack and Wm. L. Rice, were adopted, and Jos. R. Anderson, Philip Rohr and L. F. Johnston were appointed a committee to solicit subscriptions to the enterprise. The building of this railroad was begun, and, in addition to the subscriptions of private individuals, the town of Goodson, on the 12th of May, 1877, subscribed five thousand dollars to the Bristol Coal and Iron Narrow-Guage Railroad Company, the successor of the Virginia and Kentucky railroad, and to-day this road, now called the Virginia and Southwestern, is one of the most profitable enterprises that Bristol can boast of. In March, 1866, the following lawyers were practising in the town of Goodson: W. W. Langhorne, J. B. Maclin, N. M. Taylor and York &amp; Fulkerson. In the fall of this year the Bristol News was leased by John Slack to David F. Bailey, and the first issue of the News published by Bailey was on the 9th of August, 1867. From an inspection of this paper we find that M. L. Blackley and W. N. Clarkson were practising law in the town, and that the Bristol High School, under the management of J. D. Tadlock, and a male and female school, under the management of B. G. Maynard, were doing a thriving business. The Bristol News was edited by D. F. Bailey, and then by Bailey and Ramey, and on August 7th, 1868, was sold and transferred to I. C. and Elbert Fowler. In the year 1870 John Slack began the publication of the Bristol Courier, and the two papers, the News and the Courier, are still published in Bristol. At the time of the total eclipse of the sun in the month of August, 1869, Goodson being in the centre of the path of totality, the United States Coast Survey directed Colonel R. D. Cutts, of the United States Navy, to proceed to Bristol and to prepare for making observation during the eclipse. Colonel Cutts visited Goodson and erected an observatory on Lancaster Hill, now called Solar Hill. The observations were taken, and the latitude of Goodson ascertained to be 36° 35′ 50.2″, the longitude to be 5° 08′ Washington time, 20-32 fast. Afterwards, in the year 1870, the street now known as Solar street was opened, and the observatory used by Colonel Cutts was found to be in the centre of the proposed street, and from that circumstance, and at the suggestion of the Mayor, the street was called Solar street, and the hill has since been called Solar Hill. By the year 1870 Goodson had grown rapidly and the future of the town was exceedingly bright, and in this year the General Assembly of Virginia amended the charter of the town and extended the corporate limits, the provisions of said charter as to the limits of said town being as follows: Beginning at the intersection of the Virginia and Tennessee States' line and the western boundary line of the town cemetery, and running west with said State line twenty-two hundred yards; thence north nine hundred and fifty yards; thence east twenty-two hundred yards on a line parallel with the States' line; thence south nine hundred and fifty yards to the point of beginning. This Act provided for a mayor, five councilmen, a recorder and sergeant, all to be elected by the vote of the people, and directed that the election should be held for that purpose on the 2d of July, 1870, at King Block, on Front street, and John N. Bosang, John Keys and Jesse H. Pepper were directed to superintend said election. The first election held under this Act resulted in the election of the following officers: Mayor—I. C. Fowler. Recorder—J. T. Millard. Sergeant—J. L. Ligon. Councilmen—John H. Winston, President; S. L. Saul, Chas. T. Pepper, Geo. H. DeVault and Jos. W. Owens. At a meeting of the Mayor and Council on the 27th of July, 1870, rules and regulations were adopted by the Council for the government of the body in their proceedings, and the foundations were laid for an era of prosperity and growth that has met the expectations of the most ardent friends of the town. By the amended charter the Council of the town was authorized to provide a building for the safekeeping of all persons sentenced to imprisonment under the ordinances of the town, and, pursuant to this authority, the Council appointed a committee to select a place and to ascertain the cost of such a building. This committee selected a place on Washington street, now Wagoner's planing mill, and employed Archer &amp; Carmack to erect the necessary buildings thereon. At a meeting of the Mayor and Council of the town on the 23d of January, 1871, the Council requested the General Assembly of Virginia to amend the charter of the town so as to increase the Council from five to seven members, and to authorize the Council of the town to open and extend the streets of the town, and to subscribe a sum of money, not exceeding twenty-five thousand dollars, to be used in purchasing suitable grounds within the limits of the town for a public square, for building a town hall, and also for the purpose of purchasing a tract of land then within the corporate limits of the said town, the property of Joseph Johnston, and giving to the Council the authority to lay off said land, when purchased, into lots, and dispose of the same to the best interest of the corporation, and pursuant to this petition the General Assembly of Virginia, on the 14th of March, 1871, amended the charter of Goodson as petitioned for, except that it was provided that no subscription should be made until the expediency thereof should be submitted to the qualified voters in the corporation and should receive three-fifths of the votes actually polled at said election; and it was further provided that said property, when purchased, should be sold by the Council, and for the purpose of improvement only. The Council of Bristol ordered this election to be held, and the proposition to purchase the Johnston lands received more than three-fifths of all the votes polled, and these lands, containing about sixty acres, were purchased by the Mayor and Council of Goodson for the sum of eighteen thousand dollars. On the 8th of May, 1871, I. C. Fowler, John H. Winston and Jos. W. Owens were appointed a committee to superintend the laying off of said lands into streets and lots, and Thos. D. Walthall was designated to survey said land. The lands when laid off into lots were ordered to be sold, and Dr. David Sullins was the auctioneer. After the sale of these lots, and in the fall of the same year, the lots owned by the town and the money and notes received from the purchasers of lots previously sold amounted to $41,218, or $16,000 profit on the investment. On the 13th of June, 1870, the General Assembly of Virginia incorporated the Bank of Goodson, with Z. L. Burson, W. W. James, I. C. Fowler, U. L. York and I. B. Dunn as directors. This bank was organized and transacted business in Goodson for several years, and was known as James' Bank. In August of the year 1871, while great improvements were being projected and the Council of Goodson was transacting the most extensive real estate business that the town has known in its history, the Council of the city were presented with a melon by the "Marble Players" of the town, and the present was so much appreciated that the Council at its meeting on the 29th of August adopted the following resolution: "Resolved, That the thanks of the Council be tendered the `Marble Players' of this corporation for the present of a magnificent melon." In the same year a chain-gang was organized, and in the year 1873 goats, swine and cows were prohibited from running at large in the town. In 1874 it was provided that wooden buildings should not be erected in the town except upon the petition of two-thirds of the land-owners in the square where the building was proposed to be erected, and from the year 1871 to 1880 most of the streets of the town were macadamized, and in many cases extended so as to meet the requirements of a rapidly increasing population. In the year 1881 it was thought necessary by the Council of Goodson to have a public building erected for the use of the officers of the town, and the question was submitted to the vote of the people, and having received the necessary vote, the Council appointed John H. Winston, Z. L. Burson and W. W. James a committee to report a plan and the cost of a public building. This committee reported, and a very commodious hall, built of brick, was erected some time thereafter on the corner of Cumberland and Lee streets, at a cost of about $7,000 to the corporation. By the year 1890 the town of Goodson had grown to be a city, and the inconvenience attending the transaction of the legal business of the town at Abingdon created a public demand for the establishment of a corporation court for the city, and in answer to this demand the General Assembly of Virginia, on the 12th of February, 1890, changed the name of the town of Goodson to that of the city of Bristol, and adopted a new charter for said city. The officers provided for by the new charter were a mayor, treasurer, nine councilmen, a clerk of the corporation court, an attorney for the Commonwealth, a sergeant, one justice of the peace for each ward in said city, and one constable. Pursuant to this Act of the Assembly, the first Corporation Court of the city of Bristol assembled in the City Hall on the 3d of March, 1890, Judge Wm. F. Rhea presiding. The following officers were appointed by the court for said city: Clerk, J. H. Winston, Jr.; Commonwealth's Attorney, W. S. Hamilton; Treasurer, C. C. Minor; Sergeant, Chas. Worley; Commissioner of the Revenue, J. W. Mort. The court thus organized has continued until the present time and is at this time presided over by Judge Wm. S. Stuart. The city of Bristol has grown rapidly and to-day it is a very thrifty city, with beautiful streets and many large and handsome business houses. In the city of Bristol are to be found two female colleges—towit: Sullins College and the Southwest Virginia Institute—that cannot be excelled anywhere in the South. In the year 1902 the Norfolk and Western Railway Company tore down the old depot, erected in 1865, and on the same site erected as handsome a depot as is to be found in Southwest Virginia.

VILLAGES OF WASHINGTON COUNTY. Glade Spring. Glade Spring is situated in the best section of Washington county, and previous to the spring of the year 1856 but five houses were to be found in that vicinity, viz., the residence of David Beattie, which occupied the location of the present residence of Mrs. W. B. Cobb; the house of Beattie Allison, now occupied by Mrs. Brewer; a log house occupied by David (Proctor) Edmondson, on the lot where Dr. W. L. Dunn's residence stands; the residence of W. Mc. Ryburn and the residence of James O. Ryburn, now occupied by his widow. The Virginia and Tennessee railroad was completed to this place in the spring of the year 1856. A depot was built, and for a short time was called Passawatamie, but it was changed within a short time to Glade Spring by the request of all the citizens of that community. The name Glade Spring was derived from Glade Spring Presbyterian church, located some distance south of the town. In the year 1856, about the time the depot was erected, W. B. Dickenson and J. S. Buchanan employed Francis Smith, of Abingdon, to erect the frame building, now painted red, standing a short distance southwest of the depot and on the main road, and Dickenson &amp; Buchanan occupied the same as a storehouse for five years thereafter. This was the first business house established in Glade Spring. By the year 1861, a considerable village had grown up around the depot at Glade Spring and considerable business was transacted there. This is one town in Southwestern Virginia that escaped the ravages of the Federal forces in 1864-1865, the depot being saved at the request of David (Proctor) Edmondson. Since the close of the war Glade Spring has been incorporated by the General Assembly of Virginia and now has a full quota of town officials, namely: Mayor—J. T. Morris. Councilmen—W. K. Brooks, M. V. Edmondson, J. D. Kent, Samuel Keys and E. M. Atkins. Three attorneys at law, to-wit: Selden Longley, S. D. Jones and A. M. Dickenson, have had their homes in the town at different times since 1870, and for a number of years a newspaper and a bank have thrived in the town. The citizens living in and around Glade Spring cannot be excelled for virtue, wealth, intelligence and enterprise anywhere in our country. Postmasters—Glade Spring. Office established December 30, 1833. 1833-1839 —David R. Smyth. 1839-1845 —Nickerson Snead. 1845 —John K. Cunningham. 1845-1847 —Benjamin F. Aker. 1847-1852 —D. M.

Hendricks. Meadow View. This is a thriving village about seven miles east of Abingdon, on the Norfolk and Western railway, and is experiencing a rapid growth at the present time, having several large and thriving stores, several beautiful churches and a number of very thrifty people for citizens. The name of this village was suggested by the location (formerly "Edmondsons Meadows"). Wyndale. For many years this village was known as Montgomery's Switch, the depot having been located on the lands of S. W. Montgomery, but several years ago the name of the railroad station, but not the postoffice, was changed to Wyndale by the authorities of the Norfolk and Western railway. This village has experienced some growth within recent years. Wallace's Switch. When the railroad reached this point in the year 1856, Major Goforth was the owner of the mill at that point, and at his instance the citizens of the community petitioned the railroad for a station, and the station was established and called Goforth's, but the name was shortly changed to Wallace's Switch in honor of the Rev. W. P. Wallace, a Presbyterian minister who lived in that community. The growth and prosperity of this town has been greatly retarded in recent years by the rapid growth and development of Bristol, which is in close proximity thereto. This town has several good business houses and churches and an excellent flouring mill, owned by Dr. W. M. Phillips. Mendota. Mendota is situated on the North Fork of Holston river opposite the noted Kinderhook farm and immediately on the Virginia and Southwestern railroad. The excellent river-bottom lands opposite Mendota were patented by the Commonwealth to Thomas Kendrick, William Todd Livingston and others, and the home of Peter Livingston was but a short distance below Mendota at the time the noted half-breed Benge made his raid thereon in the year 1794. The river-bottom land opposite Mendota, some time previous to 1860, became the property of Adam Hickmen, a native of Kinderhook, N. Y. Upon his acquisition of this property, he gave it the name of Kinderhook, and from this farm Kinderhook magisterial district derived its name. The postoffice at this point was for many years Kinderhook, but some years ago the name was changed to Mendota by Henry C. Holly, who for many years merchandised at that place. A number of thriving business houses and pretty residences are to be found at this place, and several physicians and one lawyer reside in the town. Hamilton Institute was established at Mendota in the year 1874, and has continued from that time to be the resort of the ambitious youth, both male and female, of that section of this county. At present its prosperity is fairly good. Several efforts have been made in recent years to organize a new county out of parts of the counties of Scott, Washington and Russell, and Mendota has been the only place suggested as the county seat of the proposed new county. Damascus. When the Abingdon Coal and Iron Railroad Company was first suggested, and for some years thereafter, the location of this town and the postoffice at this place were known as Mock's Mills and remained so until about the year 1892; when the postoffice was changed to Damascus at the instance of General J. D. Imboden, who at that time was very much interested in the welfare of the community. It has been suggested that the name of Damascus was given to this locality because of a fancied resemblance to Damascus in Palestine, near the scene of the conversion of St. Paul. The location of this town was laid off into streets by the year 1892, and the plans of a magnificent hotel and numerous business enterprises were projected; but the crisis came soon thereafter, and all growth and progress ceased until about the year 1897. In the meantime business had revived, and the property of the Abingdon Coal and Iron Railroad Company became the property of the Virginia and Carolina Railway Company, of which W. E. Mingea, of Roanoke, was president, and the railroad had been completed to Damascus. The first train carrying passengers reached Damascus on the 7th day of February, 1900, and at that time the building of the Beaver Dam railroad from Damascus to Crandull, Tennessee, was being rapidly pushed to completion, and every preparation was being made for a rapid development of the magnificient water-power, mineral deposits and immense forests of splendid timber found in the immediate vicinity of Damascus. Since that time the Beaver Dam railroad has been completed, and the Virginia and Carolina Railway Company has been extended some distance up Laurel Fork of Holston river in the direction of North Carolina. A large tannery, extract plant, an extensive sash, door and blind factory and numerous saw mills carried on by hundreds of hands are at work in and around Damascus at the present time. The town itself has experienced a very rapid growth, and to-day boasts of several churches, a splendid public school building, a number of prosperous mercantile establishments, one physician, Dr. Fortune, one real estate agent, R. F. Fortune, a bank and many thrifty citizens. Greendale. Greendale is situated six miles northwest of Abingdon on the Russell turnpike, in the Rich Valley. The name of this town was suggested by the location, and the town boasts of an excellent high school, several stores, two mills, several churches and many good citizens. Boundaries of Washington County. The boundaries of Washington county, with the exception of the southern boundary, between this county and the State of Tennessee, formerly the State of North Carolina, have been fully given at other places in this history, and as to them there has been no serious controversy. The southern boundary of Virginia, extending from Steep Rock creek, now the Laurel Fork of Holston river, to Cumberland Gap, has been the subject of controversy since the coming of the first settlers to this portion of Virginia, and, therefore, it is deemed proper that a history of this controversy should be preserved. The first charter of Virginia was granted by King James in the year 1606 to Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Somers, Richard Hackluit, Edward Maria Wingfield, Thomas Hanham, Robert Gilbert, William Parker and George Popham, and embraced all the lands lying and being all along the sea coast between 34° of north latitude from the equinoctial line, and 45° degrees of the same latitude, and in the main land between the same 34 and 45 degrees of latitude and the islands thereunto adjacent or within one hundred miles of the coast thereof. The second charter of Virginia was granted by King James in the year 1609 to the treasurer and company of adventurers and planters of the city of London for the first Colony of Virginia. The territory thus granted was described as follows: "All those lands, countries and territories situate, lying and being in that part of America called Virginia, from the point of land called Cape or Point Comfort all along the sea coast to the northward two hundred miles, and from the said point of Cape of Comfort all along the sea coast to the southward two hundred miles, and all that space and circuit of land lying from the sea coast of the precinct aforesaid up into the lands throughout from sea to sea west and north west, and also all the islands lying within one hundred miles along the coast of both seas of the precinct aforesaid. "In the year 1663, Charles II., King of England, granted a charter to Edward, Earl Clarendon, George, Duke of Albemarle, William, Lord Craven, John, Lord Berkley, Anthony, Lord Ashley, Sir George Carteret, Sir William Berkley and Sir John Colleton, of all that territory or tract of ground situated, lying and being within our dominions of America, extending from the north end of Lucke Island, which lyeth in the southern Virginia seas and within six and thirty degrees of the northern latitude, and to the west as far as the South seas, and so southerly as far as the river St. Mathias, which bordereth upon the coast of Florida and within one and thirty degrees of northern latitude, and so west in a direct line as far as the South seas aforesaid." A second charter was granted by King Charles II. in the year 1665 to the same persons, and by this charter the northern boundary of Caroline was fixed at 36° and 30 minutes north latitude and so west in a direct line to the South seas. Considerable difficulty was experienced by the two colonies in agreeing upon the true location of this line previously to the year 1776, but, notwithstanding these difficulties, the line was extended as far west as Steep Rock creek, now Beaver Dam creek, in this county, by Joshua Fry and Peter Jefferson, commissioners upon the part of Virginia, and Daniel Weldon and William Churton, commissioners on the part of North Carolina. It will be observed that the lands included in the Carolina charter had been previously granted by King James to the treasurer and company of adventurers and planters of the city of London for the first Colony in Virginia, and a similar condition existed as to the colonies of Maryland and Pennsylvania. When the delegates and representatives from the several counties in Virginia met in Williamsburg and adopted a Constitution for the Commonwealth on the 5th day of May, 1776, section 21 of that Constitution contained the following provision: "The territories contained within the Charters, erecting the Colonies of Maryland, Pennsylvania, North and South Carolina, are hereby ceded, released and forever confirmed to the people of these colonies respectively, with all the rights of property, jurisdiction and government, and all other rights whatsoever, which might, at time heretofore, have been claimed by Virginia, except the free navigation and use of the rivers Patomoque and Pokemoke, with the property of the Virginia shores and strands, bordering on either of the said rivers, and all improvements which have been or shall be made thereon. The Western and Northern extent of Virginia shall in all respects stand as fixed by the Charter of King James I., in the year one thousand six hundred and nine, and by the public treaty of peace between the courts of Britain and France, in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty-three; unless, by Act of this Legislature; one or more governments be established westward of the Alleghany mountains. And no purchases of lands shall be made of the Indian natives, but on behalf of the Public by authority of the General Assembly." Thus Virginia disposed of all her rights in and to the large territory included within the State of North Carolina. By this time the lands west of the mountains and extending far into the present State of Tennessee were being rapidly settled, and disputes were frequent and oftentimes resulted in violence. The first controversy as to the true location of this line in this section of Virginia arose out of the election held for members of the House of Delegates from Washington county, in the spring of the year 1777. The right of Anthony Bledsoe and William Cocke, the delegates receiving the majority of votes in that election, was contested by Arthur Campbell and William Edmiston, the principal ground of their contest being that Bledsoe and Cocke were elected by citizens living in North Carolina. The contention of Campbell and Edmiston was not sustained, and the citizens living as far down as the Long Island of Holston were accepted as legal voters in said election. In the following year Arthur Campbell and Anthony Bledsoe were elected to represent this county in the House of Delegates of Virginia and, upon the assembling of the General Assembly, Anthony Bledsoe presented a bill for extending the boundary line between Virginia and North Carolina, which bill became a law at the same session of the General Assembly. The bill as thus passed was as follows: Whereas, the inhabitants of this commonwealth and those of the State of North Carolina have settled themselves farther westward than the boundary between the said two states hath hitherto been extended, and it becomes expedient in order to prevent disputes among such settlers, that the same should be now farther extended and marked. Be it therefore enacted by the General Assembly, that two commissioners shall be appointed by joint ballot of both houses of assembly, who shall have authority to meet with others to be appointed on the part of said State of North Carolina, and proceed to extend and mark the line between this Commonwealth and the State of North Carolina, beginning where Joshua Fry and Peter Jefferson, commissioners from Virginia, together with others from North Carolina, formerly appointed to run the said line, ended their work, and, if that be found to be truly in the latitude of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north, then to run from thence due west to Tenasee river, or, if it be found not truly in the said latitude, then to run from the said place due north or south into said latitude, and thence due west to the said Tenasee river, correcting the said course at due intervals by astronomical observations. If either of the commissioners so to be appointed shall decline or be unable to go through the duties of his appointment, the governor and council shall appoint some other to act in his stead; The said commissioners shall nominate such skillful surveyor to execute their directions and such other attendants as shall be necessary, and shall endeavor to procure the most accurate instruments, which, if injured in said service, shall be made good at the public expense, or wholly paid for, at the election of the proprietor, if borrowed from an individual, or of any such other person or persons, as shall have authority to make such election, if borrowed from any seminary of learning. Each commissioner shall be allowed for his trouble herein fifty shillings per day for every day he shall attend. Each surveyor with the chain carriers and other attendants, shall be allowed such sums as the commissioners shall certify they respectively ought to receive and be paid by the treasurer of this commonwealth out of any publick money in his hands, together with the allowance to the commissioners as aforesaid; and the said commissioners are hereby directed to make a report of their proceedings to the general assembly. And whereas, from the hostile disposition of the Indian nations, it may be unsafe for the commissioners and attendants to proceed on the business hereby directed, without a sufficient guard to protect them, Be it further enacted, That the governor, with the advice of the council, shall, on application of the commissioners so appointed direct and order a sufficient number of officers and men to be raised for that purpose, by voluntary enlistment, or if that cannot be done, then to be furnished from the militia of such counties as shall be convenient, to attend the said commissioners as a guard, and, for their safe conduct in the prosecution of the business by this act directed shall order them a sufficient number of tents and camp utensils, and shall appoint a commissary to furnish necessary provisions during the time they shall be employed for the purpose aforesaid; which commissary shall, previously to his entering on the execution of his office, give bond with sufficient security for the faithful performance of his duty, and shall receive for his services such allowance as is given to other commissaries of this commonwealth. In the year 1779, the Legislature of North Carolina concurred in the action of the Legislature of Virginia and passed the following Act: "Whereas, the inhabitants of this State and those of the commonwealth of Virginia, have settled themselves farther westwardly than the boundary between the said two States hath hitherto been extended; and it becomes expedient in order to prevent disputes among such settlers, that the same shall be further extended and marked. 2 Be it therefore enacted, &amp;c., that Oroondates Davis, John Williams (Caswell), James Kerr, William Bailey Smith and Richard Henderson, or any three of them, be and they are hereby appointed commissioners with full power and authority to meet with other commissioners from the commonwealth of Virginia, and to proceed to extend and mark the line between that commonwealth and this State, beginning where Joshua Frye and Peter Jefferson, commissioners on the part of Virginia, together with Daniel Weldon and William Churton, from North Carolina, formerly appointed to run the said line, ended their work; and if that be found to be truly in the latitude of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north then to run from thence due west to Tennessee or the Ohio river; or if it be found not truly in said latitude, then to run from the said place due north or due south, in the said latitude, and thence due west to the said Tennessee or Ohio river; correcting the said course at due intervals by astronomical observations. If either of the commissioners by this act appointed shall decline, or be unable to go through the duties of his appointment, the Governor and Council shall appoint some other to act in his stead. And the said commissioners are hereby directed to make report of their proceedings to the General Assembly"* * Revised Statutes of N. C., Vol. II., page 82. The Governor of Virginia, pursuant to the authority vested in him, directed Thomas Sharp and a company of militia to act as guard to the commissioners while running the boundary line as directed, and designated Anthony Bledsoe to act as commissary to the commissioners and the guard while running said line. The Governor of Virginia, pursuant to the authority vested in him, appointed Dr. Thomas Walker and Daniel Smith commissioners upon the part of Virginia, and the Virginia commissioners, in the summer of 1779, met the North Carolina commissioners at Steep Rock creek, and proceeded to discharge the duties directed by the General Assemblies of the two States. As to what occurred at this time and upon this undertaking, the report of Dr. Walker and Daniel Smith is the best evidence, and is here given: To the Honorable, the Speaker and Gentlemen of the House of Delegates: "In obedience to an act of the assembly entitled "An act for extending the boundary line between Virginia and North Carolina." We, the subscribers, proceeded to run the said Line. — The gentlemen from North Carolina did not meet us so soon as had been agreed; and after they came many accidents happened which protracted the business. The place where Messrs. Fry and Jefferson ended their line, on Steep Rock creek, could not be found, owing, we suppose, to so much of the timber thereabout being since dead! We proceeded to observation in order to fix upon the spot on Steep Rock creek, where we should begin. On Monday, 6th September, 1779, having agreed with the Carolina gentlemen in Observation, the following Memorandums were entered on their Journal as well as ours, as proper preliminaries agreed upon, necessary for fixing this line, Viz. "That the Sun's Meridian Altitude was this day fifty-nine degrees fifty-two minutes—that this place of observation was one minute and twenty-five seconds north of the proper latitude, or one mile, two hundred and one poles and a half—That at Steep Rock we were in superficial measure 329 miles West of Currituck Inlet: That there should be an abatement of twelve miles for mountainous and uneven ground, or that we were 317 miles or five degrees and forty-two minutes west of Currituck Inlet; That a degree of longitude in this latitude is 48.23 geographic miles, or of statute miles 55 and 1,083 yards. That Currituck Inlet was in 75 degrees 30 minutes west Longitude, this being the average of three different accounts, and of course that the Longitude we were then in was 81 degrees 12 minutes west of London. We measured off the one mile and 201½ poles a due south course, and the beginning of the line was thus fixed to the satisfaction of all. We should not have troubled you with these particulars, but for some subsequent events which make us think it our duty. After running the line as far as Carter's valley 45 miles west of Steep Rock creek, the Carolina gentlemen then conceived the line was farther South than it ought to be, and on trial it was found that the variation of the needle had altered a little, which must have happened very lately, and was owing, we believe, to our being just then near some Iron Ore: because on observing the Sun's Meridian Altitude the line was not too far South. As the Carolina gentlemen, by their Observations, made out otherways, they proposed that the surveyors on each side should observe and fix the latitude. This was agreed to by one of us, influenced by a knowledge of a small change of the variation, and was not dissented to by the other, as most of the observations on the part of Virginia had been made by him. But, quite contrary to our expectations, they agreed that we were more than two miles too far South of the proper latitude, which distance was measured off directly north and the line run eastward from that place superintended by two of the Carolina gentlemen, and one of us; while from the same place it was continued westwardly, superintended by the others for the sake of expediting the business. The instruments proper for ascertaining the latitude, were mostly taken back on the eastern part of the line, in order that those who superintended it might be farther satisfied; but after going back more than twenty miles, and observing every day on this line, his judgment was unalterably fixed that this line was wrong, although the Carolina gentlemen could not seem to be of this opinion, and he returned and overtook his colleague on the Western part of the line on Blackwater creek or thereabouts, to whom he imparted his sentiments, proposing that he should also observe for some days— which he did—The result was that we concluded our first line right, and we brought it up accordingly from Carter's valley where it had been left and continued on with it to the westward. It was once after this proposed by us, and agreed to by the Carolina Gentlemen, that as we differed so much in Observation we would each run his own line, encamp as near together as we could and let future observers hereafter to be appointed, determine which was right, which might be done at a small expense. But this they afterwards declined, although they carried their line as far as Cumberland mountain, protesting against our line. This protest was received in a letter after we had crossed Cumberland mountain. We continued however as far as Clear fork, being 123¾ miles from Steep Rock creek, marking a Poplar and two Hackberry trees with initials of our names and with November 22, 1779, and had serious thoughts of going no further. But when we considered that, perhaps, three-fourths of the whole expense was already incurred, that a number of People were settling to the Westward, who imagined they were in North Carolina, while we thought they were on the lands reserved for our officers and soldiers:—These and some more of the like considerations, made us think it more conducive to the good of the State in general that we should keep on, than that we should return. But as the season was far advanced and the Country before us, as far as it was known, was very mountainous and barren, not yielding a sufficient quantity of Cane for our pack horses, which for some time had been their principal support: these, among other reasons, made us judge it best to leave off running the line here, and go farther to the westward, into a better Country, where, by reason of many people being about to settle, it might be of importance to run the line speedily. The map will show our route to a place on Cumberland River, where we built canoes to carry our luggage and rest the pack horses, which were too much reduced to do service that way. And here, to add to the number of our difficulties and misfortunes, we were frozen up more than forty days in a river never known to be frozen before. We went by water from this place until we got into the proper latitude (as we judge one hundred and nine miles west of Clear Fork) and began the line on two Beech trees marked with our names and Feb'y 25, 1780, on the West bank of Cumberland River, a creek coming in about a mile above us on the West side, and another one somewhat smaller about half a mile below us on the East side. From this place we extended the line across the heads of Green River and Red river, through a country called the Barrens, from there being little or no timber in it, in many places, crossed the Cumberland again at 131 miles, where there is a cliff on the Northeast side, and a bottom about three quarters of a mile broad on the other side, and at the end of one hundred and forty miles, one quarter and eight poles from the two Beech trees, on the 23rd day of March found ourselves on the Bank of the Tennessee River, and of course had run the line as far westward as we were authorized to do, notwithstanding the hardships and difficulties we had to contend with—One of us kept through the woods with the surveyor while the other went down by water, by which means a tolerable map of the Cumberland River is taken, a fine river, being navigable at least 700 miles from the mouth upwards. When we had returned homewards about 160 miles we met with orders from his Excellency the Governor to do another piece of service, which we suppose he has made you acquainted with. "We have also since seen Col. Henderson, one of the North Carolina commissioners who with another of his Colleagues has been examining our line, and he has repeatedly given us more reason to believe their state will establish the line as we ran it. "Thomas Walker. "Daniel Smith." This report of the Virginia commissioners accompanied the Governor's communication to the Virginia House of Delegates in the year 1780, and was received by the Legislature and ratified, and, at the same time, Anthony Bledsoe, who had acted as commissary to the commissioners, and Thomas Sharp and his company of militia, who had acted as guard to the commissioners, were allowed compensation for their expenses, etc. If Richard Henderson and his associates made a report to the General Assembly of North Carolina, I have not been able to obtain it. The disorder that prevailed upon the failure of the commissioners to agree was alarming. The criminals of the country found a place of security between the lines as run by Walker and Henderson, and the people living between said lines refused to pay taxes or perform military services in either State. The Virginia Legislature, on the 6th of June, 1781, adopted the following resolutions: "Resolved, that it is the opinion of this committee that another and more pointed representation may be made to the General Assembly of North Carolina, in support of the title of the citizens of Virginia as well as the title of others, circumstanced as they are, to lands which, previous to the late extension of the boundary line between this State and that of North Carolina were supposed to be in this commonwealth, but since have been proved to lie in the said State of North Carolina. "Resolved, that it is the opinion of this committee, that such other parts of the said memorial as pray that a public agent may be appointed to present the same to the General Assembly of said State of North Carolina, and receive their final answer thereupon, are reasonable and that the Governor, with the advice of the Council, be authorized and required to appoint such an agent." And on the 15th of December, 1783, when the situation was precarious indeed, the General Assembly of Virginia adopted the following resolutions: "Resolved, That the Governor, with the advice of his Council, be authorized and required to propose to the State of North Carolina, either to confirm the boundary line extended by the Virginia commissioners between the States of Virginia and North Carolina, or to choose able commissioners from some other of the United States, who shall begin where Joshua Fry and Peter Jefferson, commissioners from Virginia, together with others from North Carolina, formerly appointed to run the same line, ended their work: And if the termination of the old line be found truly in the latitude of thirty-six degrees 30′ north, to extend the same to the river Mississippi, and should the termination of the old line not be truly in the latitude aforesaid, then to run from thence due north or south to the same, and from thence due west to the river Mississippi; and that all necessary expenses incurred in carrying this resolution into execution be paid out of any money in the hands of the treasurer, not otherwise appropriated."* * Journal House of Delegates, 1781. But the General Assembly of North Carolina, for some reason, delayed action as to the confirmation of the Walker line until the year 1789. In the meantime the authorities of Washington county were exercising all their energies in keeping the peace and preserving order in the disputed territory. Colonel Arthur Campbell, the county lieutenant of Washington county, in answer to an inquiry, addressed the following letter to the Governor of Virginia in the year 1787: "Sir,—If I recollect right, about the year 1749, the boundary line betwixt Virginia and N. Carolina was extended by Col. Fry and Jefferson as far west as a place called Steep Rock creek, since known by the name of Laurel Fork of the Holston River. This line being extended on the true latitude by commissioners on both sides, and mutually agreed to was returned and recorded in Public Offices in both States. "In 1779, the Commissioners, Thomas Walker and Daniel Smith, on the part of Virginia, and Richard Henderson and James Smith on the part of North Carolina, met at the place where Fry and Jefferson left off, and, after spending many days in making observations, agreed to continue Fry and Jefferson's line as the true, or at least nearest the true latitude. Both parties proceeded amicably about 40 miles, until they crossed the north fork of Holston, near the Great Island. By this time the Pilots and Hunters gave it as their opinion that both Cumberland Gap and the settlement on Cumberland River, at the French Lick, would both fall into Virginia. A halt was made and several days passed in making observations, debating, and even abusing one another. Henderson said the line must be run crooked, and insisted on delay until a parallel at two miles distant, north of the line then run, should be extended eastward back, which would prove whether the surveyors had lost the latitude and run the line crooked. To this Dr. Walker assented, that if the line was found crooked he would rectify it. The surveyors ran back accordingly, accompanied by two commissioners, and the line was found equi-distant in all parts that was tryed. It was then acknowledged that the error did not proceed from the surveyors. Notwithstanding which, Henderson proceeded westwardly on the north line and Walker on that of the South, it being a due west direction from Steep Rock. The Commissioners, when they reached Cumberland mountain again, had a meeting and spent many days in taking observations. At length Walker proceeded on over the mountain with his line, without being accompanied by Henderson, spent the winter in the woods and, the next spring, continued the line to the Mississippi. The Carolina Commissioners left off at Cumberland Mountain, and when they found that the boundary run by Dr. Walker left the French Lick upwards of twenty miles to the South, they seemed well satisfied, and it was generally thought that Dr. Walker's report would be agreed to and signed by both parties. But, from what motive I know not, yet Henderson returned his works as run only to the Cumberland Mountain to the Executive of North Carolina. And I have been told that the papers have since lain dormant, no opinion having been given one way or the other. "The People settled between those lines have ever since adhered to either State, as Interest, caprice and sometimes very unworthy motives dictated. Although the public authority seems, in the first instance, to be blamable, yet the evil amongst the people is increasing, and prudence points out delay as improper." In the meantime Daniel Smith had appeared before the General Assembly of North Carolina and represented to that body the true situation of affairs in the disputed territory, and, as a result, the committee to whom the communication from the Virginia authorities had been referred, reported to the General Assembly of North Carolina at their session in the fall of the year 1789, which report is as follows: REPORT Of the Committee of the Legislature of North Carolina, on Walker's Line, at their session at Fayetteville, which began on the 2nd. of November and ended on the 22nd. of December, 1789. Mr. Person, from the committee to whom was referred the letter from his Excellency, the Governor of Virginia, on the subject of establishing the boundaries between this State and Virginia, reported that it is proposed on the part of Virginia that the line commonly called Walker's line be established as the boundary between us. Should this proposal not be acceptable to this State, they then will appoint commissioners to meet any persons who may be appointed on the part of North Carolina, empowered to confer on the propriety of establishing Walker's or Henderson's line, and to report to the Legislature of their respective State their proceedings. On examining the manner in which those lines were run by the commissioners in the year 1780, they find that the commissioners began and extended the line together about forty miles, when some difference took place and the commissioners on the part of this State ran a parallel line two miles north of the other line, for about half the distance, and extended the line no farther. Mr. Walker and the other commissioners from Virginia extended the line to the Tennessee river and marked its termination on the Mississippi by observations, leaving the line from the Tennessee to that place unsurveyed. As the difference between said lines would be only two miles, running most of the distance through a mountainous, barren country, and as they have great reason to believe, from the information of General Smith, that the commonly called Walker's line is the true line, your committee are of the opinion that the object is not worth the expense of sending commissioners to confer on the propriety of establishing Henderson's line in preference to that of any other and do recommend that a law be passed confirming and establishing the line usually called Walker's line as the boundary between this State and the State of Virginia, with a reservation in favor of the oldest grants from either State in deciding the rights of individual claimants in the tract of country between the two lines commonly called Henderson's and Walker's lines. This report was not definitely acted upon until the 11th of December, 1790, upon which day an Act was passed establishing Walker's line as the boundary line between the States, which action of the General Assembly of North Carolina was immediately communicated to the Governor of Virginia at the fall session, 1791, of the General Assembly of Virginia, and on the 7th day of December the following action was taken by the General Assembly of Virginia: § 1. Whereas, official information hath been received by the General Assembly that the Legislature of the State of North Carolina have resolved to establish the line as the boundary line between North Carolina and this Commonwealth, and it is judged expedient to confirm and establish the said line on the part of this State, be it therefore enacted by the General Assembly, that the line commonly called and known by the name of Walker's line shall be, and the same is hereby declared, to be the boundary line of this State. § 2. And be it further enacted, That in all courts of law and equity within this Commonwealth, the claims for lands lying between the line commonly called Walker's line and the line commonly called Henderson's line shall be decided in favor of the oldest title, whether derived from this Commonwealth or from the State of North Carolina. In the meantime the State of North Carolina, through her senators in the Congress of the United States, had conveyed and ceded to the United States of America all of her western possessions, including the territory affected by the disputed line and which cession was accepted by the Congress of the United States on the 7th day of April, 1790. As a result, the authorities of the southwest territory, now included in the State of Tennessee, denied the right of North Carolina to act in the premises, and held the action taken to be invalid, and asserted their right to the territory lying between the Walker and Henderson lines. In the spring of the year 1792, the Governor of Virginia, by proclamation, asserted the authority of this Commonwealth to the lands in dispute, and directed Colonel Arthur Campbell, the county lieutenant of this county, to transmit a copy of the law and proclamation to William Blount, the Governor of the southwest territory, and to Gilbert Christian, the county lieutenant of Sullivan county. Pursuant to the direction of the Governor, Colonel Campbell, on the 7th of June, 1792, addressed the following letter to Governor Blount: "Sir,— I enclose you a copy of a law, with a proclamation of the Governor of Virginia, by the same conveyance. I am instructed to exercise the authority of the State to the boundary, usually called Walker's line. In this business, it is the wish of the Executive that the subordinate officers conduct themselves in an amicable manner to the inhabitants over which North Carolina formerly exercised Jurisdiction, and with due respect to the authority of the Government south of the River Ohio; these orders are perfectly consonant to my own feelings and sentiments. Therefore, Sir, if you have any objections to make to the change taking place, or anything to ask in favor of the people, it will be respectfully attended to by me and immediately reported to the Governor of Virginia. "I am Sir, Your most Ob't Serv't, "A. Campbell." At the same time Colonel Campbell addressed a letter to Gilbert Christian asking information as to the orders given by Governor Blount as to the disputed territory, and in reply received the following letter from Gilbert Christian: "Dear Sir,—Some days past I received a letter from you, requesting me to inform you whether Governor Blount had given special orders to me to draft between Walker's and Henderson's lines. Sir, my orders are to draft the men required from the County of Sullivan, which I conceived extends from Henderson's line from everything I have known or seen, respecting that matter for when the Assembly of North Carolina passed the cession Act, that part was claimed by North Carolina, but after they passed the s'd cession Act, and at the same Assembly they passed a resolve, giving up that part to Virginia with a condition Congress would consent to it, which has never been done as I know of. I have seen a proclamation from the Governor of Virginia, informing the people in those bounds that the Assembly of North Carolina made such a Resolve, and at the next year's Assembly they appointed a committee to confirm the s'd Resolve, which they did, But Congress had received the cession Act, before that several months, and appointed and commissioned Governor Blount to exercise his authority over the ceded territory. I cannot see what right North Carolina had to say anything about our territory, without our consent or the consent of Congress, for the Constitution says the people are not to be bound by law, but by their own consent, either by themselves or by their Representatives in General Assembly. So, Sir, I apprehend the State of Pennsylvania had as great a right to have confirmed the aforesaid Resolve as the State of North Carolina. If the Executive of your State had mentioned in the Proclamation a confirmation of the Resolve aforesaid by Congress, it might have been considered authentick, but as it is I cannot conceive it so." Upon the receipt of this letter, Colonel Campbell enclosed the same to the Governor of Virginia, and addressed the following letter to the Governor: "Sir,— The enclosed letter from the commanding officer of the militia of Sullivan county, seems to be an avowal of an opposition to an act of our Legislature, for establishing Walker's line as the boundary line to this State. "That I conceive it my duty to forward it to your Excellency. About half of the inhabitants between the lines seem desirous to be governed by the laws of Virginia, but they complain of it as an oppression to be harassed by the authority of the Southwest Territory, and to pay obedience to the laws of this State at the same time." The authorities of the Southwest Territory used every means possible to induce the people in the disputed territory to give their allegiance to the Southwest Territory. Governor Blount published in the Knoxville Gazette, on the 10th of March, 1792, a communication which purported to give the reasons why the people living in the disputed territory should be subject to the authority of the territory. The arguments used were exemption from the payment of taxes, local convenience and the accessibility of the seat of government of the Southwest Territory. The State of Tennessee was admitted into the Union on the 1st day of June, 1796, and the Constitution of the State adopted in the same year defines the boundaries of the State as follows: "Beginning on the extreme height of the Stone mountain at the place where the line of Virginia intersects it in latitude thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes north, running thence along the extreme height of the said mountain to the place where Watauga River breaks through it; thence a direct course to the top of the Yellow mountain, where Bright's road crosses the same; thence along the ridge of said mountain, between the waters of Doe River and the waters of Rock Creek, to the place where the road crosses the Iron Mountain; from thence along the extreme height of said mountain to the place where Nolichucky River runs through the same; thence to the top of Bald Mountain; thence along the extreme height of said mountain to the Painted Rock, on French Broad River; thence along the highest ridge of said mountain to the place where it is called the Great Iron or Smoky Mountain; thence along the extreme height of said mountain to the place where it is called the Unicoi or Unaka Mountain, between the Indian towns of Cowee and Old Chota; thence along the main ridge of the said mountain to the southern boundary of this State, as described in the Act of session of North Carolina to the United States of America that all the territory, lands and waters lying west of said line, contained in the chartered limits of the State of North Carolina, are within the boundaries and limits of this State." The boundaries of the State of Tennessee as fixed by the Constitution of 1796 were incorporated in the Constitutions of that State, adopted in the years 1834 and 1870. It will thus be seen that the Constitution of the State of Tennessee designates their northern line to be in thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes north latitude, when, in fact, the line now insisted upon by that State is in latitude 36° 36′ 00.94″, or 6′ 00.94″ north of the true line. Such was the condition of affairs at the beginning of the year 1800. On the 10th of January, 1800, the General Assembly of Virginia adopted the following resolution: "Resolved, That the Executive be authorized and requested to appoint three commissioners, whose duty it shall be to meet commissioners to be appointed by the State of Tennessee, to settle and adjust all differences concerning the said boundary line, and to establish the one or the other of the said lines, as the case may be, or to run any other line which may be agreed on for settling the same; and that the Executive also be requested to transmit a copy of this resolution to the Executive authority of the State of Tennessee." The General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, on November 13, 1801, adopted the following act: 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, That the Governor, for the time being, is hereby authorized and required, as soon as may be convenient after the passing of this act, to appoint three commissioners on the part of the State, one of whom shall be a mathematician capable of taking the latitude, who, when so appointed, are hereby authorized and empowered, or a majority of them, to act in conjunction with such commissioners as are or may be appointed by the State of Virginia, to settle and designate a true line between the aforesaid States. 2. Be it enacted, That there shall be appointed by the authority aforesaid one surveyor, who, together with the aforesaid commissioners, shall each receive five dollars per day as full compensation for their services and expenses whilst they are performing the duties enjoined in this act, and there shall also be chosen by the commissioners one suitable person as marker of the line aforesaid, who shall receive two dollars per day in full discharge for his services and expenses. And whereas, it may be difficult for this Legislature to ascertain with precision what powers ought of right to be delegated to the said commissioners; therefore, 3. Be it enacted, That the governor is hereby authorized and required, from time to time, to issue such instructions to the commissioners as he may deem proper for the purpose of carrying into effect the object intended by this act consistent with the true interest of the State. 4. Be it enacted, That said commissioners, as soon as may be, shall report in writing to the governor for the time being a true statement of all their proceedings relative to the running and establishing of the said line, whose duty it shall be to lay the same before the succeeding Legislature. Pursuant to the authority thus conferred Peter Johnston, Joseph Martin and Creed Taylor were appointed commissioners upon the part of Virginia, and Moses Fisk, John Sevier and George Rutledge commissioners upon the part of Tennessee to ascertain and adjust the boundary line between the two States, while Brice Martin and Nathan B. Markland were appointed surveyors to run and mark the said line. The commissioners thus appointed proceeded to the discharge of their duties and completed their labors at the house of William Robertson, near Cumberland Gap, on the 8th of December, 1802. The commissioners and surveyors thereupon reported their action to the General Assembly of the States of Virginia and Tennessee. Their report was confirmed and the boundary line between the States established as reported by an act of the General Assembly of Virginia passed on the 22d of January, 1803, which act is as follows: 1. Whereas the commissioners appointed to ascertain and adjust the boundary line between this State and the State of Tennessee in conformity to the resolution passed by the Legislature of this State for that purpose have proceeded to the execution of the said business, and made a report thereof in the words following, to-wit: "The commissioners for ascertaining and adjusting the boundary line between the States of Virginia and Tennessee, appointed pursuant to public authority on the part of each, namely, General Joseph Martin, Creed Taylor and Peter Johnston, for the former, and Moses Fisk, General John Sevier and General George Rutledge, for the latter, having met at the place previously appointed for that purpose and not uniting in the general results of their astronomical observations to establish either of the former lines, called Walker's and Henderson's, unanimously agreed, in order to end all controversy respecting the subject, to run a due west line equally distant from both, beginning on the summit of the mountain generally known by the name of White Top mountain, where the northeastern corner of Tennessee terminates, to the top of the Cumberland mountain, where the southwestern corner of Virginia terminates, which is hereby declared to be the true boundary line between the said States, and has been accordingly run by Brice Martin and Nathan B. Markland, the surveyors duly appointed for that purpose, and marked under the direction of the said commissioners, as will more at large appear by the report of the said surveyors, hereto annexed, and bearing equal date herewith. "2. The Commissioners do further unanimously agree, to recommend to their respective States, that individuals having claims or titles to lands on either side of said line, as now fixed and agreed upon, and between the lines aforesaid, shall not in consequence thereof, in any wise be prejudiced or affected thereby; and that the Legislatures of their respective States, should pass mutual laws to render all such claims or titles secure to the owners thereof. "3. And the said Commissioners do further unanimously agree to recommend to their States respectively, that reciprocal laws should be passed, confirming the acts of all public officers, whether Magistrates, Sheriffs, coroners, surveyors or constables, between the said lines, which would have been legal in either of said States had no difference of opinion existed about the true boundary line. "4. This agreement shall be of no effect until ratified by the Legislatures of the States aforesaid, respectively, and until they shall pass mutual laws for the purpose aforesaid. Given under our hands and seals at William Robertson's, near Cumberland Gap, December the eighth, eighteen hundred and two. "Joseph Martin (L. S.) "John Sevier (L. S.) "Creed Taylor (L. S.) "Moses Fisk (L. S.) "Peter Johnston (L. S.) "George Rutledge (L. S.) 5. And whereas Brice Martin and Nathan B. Markland, the surveyors duly appointed to run and mark the said line, have granted their certificate of the execution of their duties, which certificate is in the words following, to-wit: "The undersigned surveyors, having been duly appointed to run the boundary line between the States of Virginia and Tennessee, as directed by the commissioners for that purpose, have, agreeably to their orders, run the same, beginning on the summit of White Top Mountain, at the termination of the northeastern corner of the State of Tennessee, a due west course to the top of Cumberland mountain, where the southwestern corner of the State of Virginia terminates keeping at an equal distance from the line called Walker's and Henderson's, and have had the new line run as aforesaid marked with five chops in the form of a diamond, as directed by the said commissioners. Given under our hands and seals, this eighth day of December, eighteen hundred and two. "B Martin, (L. S.). Nat. B. Markland, (L. S.)." And it is deemed proper and expedient that the said boundary line so fixed and ascertained as aforesaid should be established and confirmed on the part of this Commonwealth. "Be it therefore enacted by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia, That the said boundary line between this State and the State of Tennessee, as laid down, fixed and ascertained by the said commissioners above named, in their said report above recited, shall be, and is hereby fully and absolutely, to all intents and purposes whatsoever ratified, established and confirmed on the part of this Commonwealth, as the true, certain and real boundary line between the said States. "7. All claims or titles to lands derived from the government of North Carolina or Tennessee, which said lands by the adjustment and establishment of the line aforesaid, have fallen into this State, shall remain as secure to the owners thereof as if derived from the government of Virginia, and shall not be in any wise prejudiced or affected in consequence of the establishment of the said line. "8. The acts of all public officers, whether magistrates, sheriffs, coroners, surveyors or constables, heretofore done or performed in that portion of territory between the lines called Walker's and Henderson's lines, which has fallen into this State by the adjustment of the present line and which would have been legal if done or performed in the States of North Carolina or Tennessee, are hereby recognized and confirmed. "9. This act shall commence and be in force, from after the passing of a like law on the part of the State of Tennessee." The General Assembly of the State of Tennessee on November 3, 1803, adopted an act confirming the report of the commissioners establishing the boundary line between the two States and confirming the title of all lands lying in the State of Tennessee granted by the Commonwealth of Virginia as fully as if said land had been granted by the State of Tennessee. The act in question is identical with the act of the Virginia Assembly before given. It was supposed that the boundary line thus established would forever settle this question, but by the year 1856 it seems that the old controversy was renewed, and in that year the General Assembly of Virginia passed an act appointing two commissioners to meet commissioners appointed by the State of Tennessee to again run and mark the boundary line between the States. The General Assembly of Tennessee did not take action in this matter until the first of March, 1858, on which day an act was passed authorizing the Governor of the State of Tennessee to appoint two commissioners to meet the commissioners appointed by the Commonwealth of Virginia to re-run and mark the line of 1802, and said commissioners were directed to cause monuments of stone to be permanently planted on said line where there is now growing timber by which the line may be plainly marked, said stones to be planted at least one in every five miles. The commissioners thus appointed were given full power and authority to re-run and mark the line of 1802, and it was made their duty to employ a field party to consist of one engineer, one surveyor, one back-sighter, one axe-man and such others as were necessary, the said engineer and surveyor to be well qualified to make said survey upon scientific principles, said commissioners to superintend the work. The Governor of Virginia appointed James C. Black and Leonidas Baugh commissioners upon the part of Virginia, and the Governor of Tennessee appointed Samuel Milligan and George B. McClelland commissioners upon the part of Tennessee, to run and re-mark said line. The commissioners thus appointed began work on the 29th of September, 1858, and on the 3d of December, 1859, submitted their report to the executives of the State of Tennessee and the State of Virginia. Their report was in the following words and figures, to-wit: "To His Excellency the Governor of Virginia: "In obedience to commissions respectively conferred upon us under an act of the legislature of the State of Virginia passed the 18th day of March, 1856, and an act of the legislature of the State of Tennessee, passed the 1st day of March, 1858, authorizing the executives of each of said States respectively to appoint commissioners `to again run and mark' the boundary line between the States of Virginia and Tennessee, we the undersigned commissioners, proceeded to discharge the duties assigned us, and beg leave to submit the following as our joint action: Our first object was to determine the duty with which we were charged under the acts of both states, which we found to be substantially the same and both exceedingly vague and indefinite. "But the manifest intention of the legislature of Virginia and Tennessee was, in our opinion, to ascertain and re-mark the compromise line of 1802, but the laws evidently drafted without a knowledge of the facts as we found them to exist, imposed upon us obligations which it was practically impossible to comply with. "We were required to begin the line `on the summit of the mountain commonly known by the name of the White Top, where the northeastern corner of Tennessee terminates' and thence to run due west `to the top of the Cumberland Mountain where the southwestern corner of Virginia ends.' This line, by the laws of Virginia and Tennessee, was declared to be on the parallel of 36 30′ north latitude, and midway between Walker's and Henderson's lines run in 1779. "With these legal restraints upon us, after engaging the services of Professor Revel Keith, an experienced astronomer, and Charles S. Williams, a practical engineer, with an efficient field party, we, on the 29th day of September, 1858, repaired to the field, but observation and experiment soon demonstrated the utter impracticability of a literal compliance with the requirements of the law. "We began the experimental work at the town of Bristol, a small village situated on the compromise line of 1802, at a point where there was no controversy as to the locality of the line, and our first observation at that point showed the latitude to be 36° 36′ nearly, which upon calculation we found to be a little over six statute miles north of the latitude contemplated by law. Further observations and experiments all along the line furnished nearly similar results. In the region of the White Top mountain we met with still more insuperable difficulties to a strict compliance with the requirements of the law. The summit of this mountain, which is well defined and elevated above the surrounding mountains, we found to be about three miles, a northeast course from the termination of the marked timber on the line; and at right angles with the parallel 36 30′ north latitude, a little over eight miles north of said parallel. The northeastern corner of Tennessee was designated by no monument, nor was there any evidence on the ground by which we could determine the corner or the beginning of the compromise line of 1802. "The marks on the timber which were found throughout the whole line ceased on a spur of a dividing range of mountains that connects the Stone, Pond and White Top mountains called the `Divide' from the fact that the waters flow from it both east and west, and about one mile from the summit of this dividing range. "At the point where the marks on the line of 1802 terminate there is no marked corner or any change in appearance of the marks on the timber indicating a purpose to establish a corner or beginning point of the line, nor is there any marked timber between that point and the summit of the `Divide,' although thickly wooded, except on the summit, where it appears to have been cleared twenty or twenty-five years ago and is now under cultivation. "Under this perplexing state of facts we were neither able to comply strictly with the requirements of the law or definitely to settle the `northeastern corner of Tennessee,' or to establish the beginning point of the line we were required to trace. "The Virginia commissioners insisted that the line should be extended east from the end of the marked line on the little mountain south of the Denton Valley to the top of the `Divide,' because it would be but a continuation of the line from Cumberland Gap, which is to that point about midway between Walker's and Henderson's lines, and because the existence of a cross line running south 22° west was not even known, or the line from the top of the little mountain westward to the river heretofore recognized as the boundary, or any part of it. "And the Tennessee commissioners, that the northern line as connected by the cross line with the southern should be extended to the `summit of the Divide,' and the northeastern corner of Tennessee there established, because it is the only unbroken and continuously marked line ascertained, and the summit of the `Divide' presents the only natural monument that reasonably conforms to the commissioners' purpose to establish one at the end of the marks on the line. No conclusive agreement could be made, and we were compelled to leave the point of beginning an open question. "After making these and various other experiments calculated to determine the character of the line and its offsets, and taking the latitude at different points between Bristol and White Top mountain, and also at Cumberland Gap in the fall of 1858, we found from the inclemency of the weather and the advanced season, that it would be manifestly to the interest of both States to suspend operations until the following summer, when the season would be more propitious for the progress of the work. "On the 7th day of June, 1859, we again, with our `Surveyor and field party,' assembled at Bristol, and after determining to retrace and remark the compromise line of 1802, we resumed the work and accurately ran, re-marked and measured the old line of 1802 with all of its offsets and irregularities, as shown in the surveyor's report herein incorporated and on the accompanying map herewith submitted. SURVEYOR'S REPORT. To Leonidas Baugh and James C. Black, of Virginia, and Samuel Milligan and George B. McClelland, of Tennessee, commissioners for running and re-marking the boundary line between their respective States: Gentlemen,— Herewith I submit a map of the boundary line between the States of Virginia and Tennessee, as traced and remarked by the field party in my charge under your direction. After a thorough search through the country in the vicinity of the mountain "commonly known as White Top," the line marked by the commissioners of 1802 was found marked upon a northern spur of the ridge known as the "Divide." This ridge divides the waters flowing into New River on the east from those flowing into Holston River on the west. The point where the line was found is about a mile northwestwardly from the residence of Mr. Wells Blevins, upon the "Divide" and about three miles southwesterly from the summit of White Top. Although diligent search was made, no trace of a line was found east of this point, neither, on the other hand, was there the least indication of a corner, the line being marked as elsewhere. Traced westerly to Denton's Valley the line varies, generally one and one-half (1½) degrees north from a truly west course as found by astronomical observation. In Denton's valley an offset was found, the line bearing south 22 west (by the needle), for a distance of 8,700 feet, to a point upon a high spur of the little mountain immediately west of Mill Creek. From the southern terminus of this offset the line runs upon a course very closely approximating due west to a point in the eastern boundary line of the town of Bristol, where a small variation was found. The line was so adjusted, however, as to coincide with the central line of the main street of Bristol, the magnetic course being south 89° 40′ west, and so continued to the west branch of Beaver Creek. From Bristol west to Cumberland Gap, the line generally preserves a due west course, as determined by astronomical observations, with the following exceptions: 1. On the farm of John Hickman, west of Bristol, the line varies to North 82½ west (magnetic course), for a distance of 310 feet. 2. At the crossing of Wallen's ridge, where an offset of 1,457 feet occurs, which was connected by an oblique line, as shown on the map. 3. Near Cumberland Gap, where the direction of the line varies to north 88 west (magnetic course) for a distance of 6,922 feet. The line was found plainly marked where the timber remained standing, was readily found through most of its course and is subject to minor deviations incidental to long compass lines, generally, however, preserving a due west course. The standing timber along the line was marked in five chops in the form of: The total length of line as run and remeasured with a level chain is 113 miles. Respectfully submitted. Charles S. Williams, Surveyor Boundary Commissioner. The territory in the form of a triangle, lying between the top of Little mountain and the red lines on the map in what is known as "Denton's Valley," has heretofore been recognized by the citizens residing therein as included in the State of Virginia, and the top of Little mountain is recognized as the boundary line. To this supposed boundary both States have heretofore exercised jurisdiction, and north of the summit of the mountain the citizens residing in the triangle have derived their land titles from the State of Virginia; they have there voted, been taxed, and exercised all the rights of citizens of that State. The line, though plainly marked from the top of Little mountain westward nearly to the river, and the cross line at Denton's Valley running south twenty-two west and connecting the north and south lines, seem not to have been recognized as the boundary line, the very existence even of the cross line being unknown until we discovered it; but it is also well defined and so distinctly marked as to leave no doubt that it was run and marked in 1802. With this single exception, the line as traced by us has been, as far as we are able to ascertain, recognized throughout its entire length for fifty-seven years as the true boundary line between the States of Virginia and Tennessee. The latitude, as marked on the map east of Bristol and at Cumberland Gap, was carefully determined by Professor Keith with a "zenith transit" or transit instrument, the most modern and improved astronomical instrument now in use, and may be relied upon as perfectly accurate, except at Bristol, and that was ascertained under disadvantageous circumstances, but it is believed to be nearly correct. West of Bristol, except at Cumberland Gap, the latitude was determined by Lieutenant Francis T. Byan, of the corps of United States topographical engineers, with a "sextant," and may also be relied upon as correctly determined. The line was traced with a "theodolite," and great care observed throughout correctly to ascertain its true bearing, offsets and irregularities. We found the old line marked with "five chops in the form of a diamond," and we varied ours by using only four chops, and placed them on the tree somewhat in the form of the letters w y e: as shown in the surveyor's report. The fore and aft marks were placed truly on the line, and the side marks were placed respectively on that portion of the timber next the true line. Where we found no growing timber we caused monuments of stone to be erected, "firmly planted" one foot and a half in the ground and extending two and a half feet above the ground, well dressed and marked on the north side with the letter V, and the south side with the letter T, so that the line may be readily identified throughout its entire length. At Cumberland Gap the line terminated on a chestnut oak on the summit of a mountain, at which there is also marked a monument of stone. At the eastern end of the line where the marked timber ceases we placed a monument of stone, but we put no inscription upon it, indicating that point to be the "northeastern corner of Tennessee" for the reason hereinbefore assigned. We deem it proper further to state that we have indicated on the map at different points the reputed locality of the Walker line, but we found no marked timber indicating its position, except at the western end of the line, which we have truly represented on the map. We saw no trace of the Henderson line at any point, and consequently were unable accurately to represent its position on the map. Its reputed position is represented on the map at a point near Bristol. We further beg leave to state that the general course of the line lies over a rough and mountainous country, almost inaccessible, especially the eastern portion of it, and its survey was attended with an amount of labor and privation which we are sure no one can justly appreciate but those who have actually undergone them. But we felt justified in stating that we spared no pains or labor accurately to trace and mark the line, as well as to show the true state of facts that surround it, that the legislatures, both of Tennessee and Virginia, can act understandingly in ratifying or rejecting it, as in their wisdom they may think right and proper. All of which is most respectfully submitted. Sam Milligan, George R. McClellan, Tennessee Commissioners. Leonidas Baugh, James C. Black, Virginia Commissioners. December 30, 1859. This report was disapproved and rejected by the General Assembly of Virginia on the 9th of March, 1860, and the Governor of the Commonwealth was authorized and directed to settle with Baugh and Black for services rendered, and to appoint one or more commissioners to run again and re-mark the line between Virginia and Tennessee in strict conformity with the compact of 1802. The result of this effort to run and re-mark the line of 1802 having failed, the entire question was again open for discussion and controversy. In the year 1869, the superintendent of the United States Coast Survey directed Richard B. Cutts to proceed to Bristol, with instructions to observe the solar eclipse on August 7th, and to connect the station at Bristol with one or more of the monuments which mark the boundary line in that vicinity. Pursuant to instructions, Mr. Cutts proceeded to Bristol, and, after having discharged his duties, made the following report to his superior. Washington, D. C., "December 30th, 1869. "Prof'r. Benj'n Pierce, Sup't. U. S. Coast Survey: "Sir,— In your letter of instructions to observe the Solar Eclipse of August 7th, at or near Bristol, Tenn., you also directed me to comply, if practicable, with the request made by the President of Washington College, Virginia, to connect the station at Bristol, the position of which would be astronomically determined, with one or more of the monuments which mark the boundary line of the State of Virginia in that vicinity, so that the longitude and latitude thereof may be accurately known. "Ascertaining soon after my arrival at Bristol that the connection could be readily made, the work was undertaken and completed without interfering with the regular duties assigned to the party. Signals, which were visible from the astronomical station, were erected on the boundary, or main street separating Goodson in Virginia from Bristol in Tennessee, and the connection effected by means of a measured base and triangulation. In view of the fact, however, that the signals, or monuments, were placed on a line which, though recognized as the boundary between Virginia and Tennessee, has not been, in the opinion of many, definitely settled as such, and as the results of the observations and triangulation, made under my direction, may be used as authority in the discussion of the question should it again arise, I beg leave to show the character of the operation by which the direction of the line, and the latitude and longitude of the monument were obtained, and to describe, by a short historic sketch hereto appended, the special line referred to, there having been three or more lines run by the interested parties at different periods. "The instruments employed to determine the exact geographical position of the observatory on Lancaster Hill, Goodson, in connection with the Eclipse of August 7th, were a Transit and Zenith Telescope, each mounted on a solid pier composed of brick and cement. The latitude was determined by 12 pairs of stars, and the longitude by the transmission of time signals to the Naval Observatory at Washington, on three nights, the telegraph wires having been connected and placed at our disposal for that purpose. The observations to secure those results were made by Assistant A. T. Mosman during nine nights, between the 28th of July and the 7th of August. "To connect the Zenith Telescope with the boundary, a base was measured and a triangulation executed, including two stations on the line recognized by the inhabitants as the boundary of 1802, and as specially pointed out by Thomas D. Walthall, Esq., of Bristol, an engineer and surveyor well informed on the subject. "The azimuth of the line was derived from measurements made between Ursa Minor at its upper culmination and three of the principal triangle sides. "Before leaving Bristol, it was understood that permanent monuments would be erected by the municipal authorities of Bristol and Goodson, at two points determined on the boundary. The piers on Lancaster Hill were placed, by letter, under the protection of the Mayor of Goodson. "Upon examination of the charters, agreements and legislative enactments referring to the dividing line between Virginia on the one side and North Carolina and Tennessee on the other, as fully quoted and explained in the accompanying appendix, it will be ascertained that from the date of the second charter of King Charles II., in 1665, to the latest legislation in regard to its demarcation in 1860, the southern boundary of Virginia has been supposed to be situated, as it was in part directed to be traced, on the parallel of 36° 30′. "The joint commission which was organized in 1779 was directed to start upon the parallel of 36 30′, and to continue on that parallel to the Tennessee river. As the respective commissioners differed in the results of their observations, two lines were run, known as the Walker and Henderson lines, neither of which was correct. Finally as a kind of compromise and under the supposition that the true line must certainly be between the two then in dispute, other commissioners were appointed in 1800, with full powers from Virginia and rather limited powers from Tennessee, and under the direction of this Joint Commission a supposed middle line was then marked, which line was ratified, established and confirmed by Virginia on the 22d of January, 1803, and by Tennessee in the month of November following. This line is neither on the parallel of 36 30′ nor midway between the Walker and Henderson Lines, and yet it must be recognized, as the law directs, `as the true, certain and real boundary between the two States.' "Owing, however, to the lapse of time, this line has become `indistinct, uncertain and to some extent unknown,' and in consequence thereof Virginia, in 1856, appointed Commissioners to `again run and mark said line.' In 1858, the State of Tennessee responded to the Virginia legislation by authorizing the appointment of Commissioners for a similar purpose, and also the organization of a Field Party, to consist of an Engineer and Surveyor, well qualified to make said survey upon scientific principles. This last direction would appear to confer an indirect but very necessary authority to run a new line, in case the old one could not be identified. The Commissioners duly reported their proceedings and acts to their respective States. In 1860, Virginia disapproved of and rejected the line thus re-run and marked, and, by the same resolution of the General Assembly, the Governor was empowered to appoint one or more commissioners to again run the boundary as defined in the Statute of January 22nd, 1803. This is the last act of legislation referring to the boundary line between Virginia and Tennessee, and from this it has been inferred that the location of the line has not been definitely settled. "The following table and memoranda show the results of the operations at Bristol. The latitudes of the Henderson and Walker lines at points situated respectively North and South of Bristol, were computed from data supplied by Thomas D. Walthall, Esq.: When Run. Supposed Latitude. True Latitude. True Longitude. Henderson, or North Carolina line 1779 36° 36′ 00″ 36° 36′ 48. ″ Walker or Virginia line 1779 36° 36′ 00″ 36° 34′ 25.5″ The Middle line, East Mont 1802 36° 36′ 00″ 36° 35′ 38.9″ 82° 10′ 40.00″ The Middle line, West Mont 1802 36° 36′ 00″ 36° 40′ 40.0″ 82° 11′ 25.12″ "The azimuth, or direction of the line, from East to West monument is 91°, 51′, 51″, or North 88°, 09′, 00″ West true. "It will be perceived that the direction of the Middle line, the present acknowledged boundary, is nearly two degrees north of a due west course, and if this direction should have been continued to the Cumberland Mountains, a very large wedge of Virginia territory must have been cut off. In fact, we find from the numerous and reliable observations made for latitude, in 1859, at Newlee's sulphur spring, at or close to the Cumberland Gap, as published in the `Report of the Commissioners appointed to mark the boundary line between the States of Kentucky and Tennessee' that the Southwest corner of Virginia is situated in latitude 36°, 36′, 00.94″, or 6′, 91″, North of the true line. "According to the observations made in connection with the survey of the coast of the United States, the correct latitude of the line where it crosses Knott's Island, situated about three miles west of the site of old Currituck Inlet, is 36°, 33′, 15″, and not 36°, 31′, as determined in 1728; and the correct latitude of the line, west of the Alleghany mountains, where it separates Goodson from Bristol, is 36°, 35′, 39″, .5 and not 36°, 31′, upon which parallel it was intended by all the parties interested that the line should be run.—These discrepancies are not a matter of surprise in view of the defective method adopted for tracing the parallel, of the inferior class of astronomical and surveying instruments employed by the old surveyors, and of the more than probable errors committed in running the line, due, in part, to a want of care in determining the magnetic variation. From the data already presented, it may be fairly inferred that if the different surveys had been conducted as they would be to-day, the State of Virginia would now include within its limits at least 800 square miles of additional territory. "A sketch of the triangulation, and the computations of the triangle sides, latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths, are attached to this report. "I am, Respectfully yours, "Richard D. Cutts." In the year 1871, the General Assembly of Virginia passed an act providing for the appointment of commissioners to ascertain and locate the true boundary line between this State and the State of Tennessee, and in the year 1886 a similar act was adopted, but the State of Tennessee persistently refusing to take any action looking to a settlement of the question, the General Assembly of Virginia, on the 31st day of January, 1890, passed an act repealing the act of the General Assembly of Virginia passed on the 22d of January, 1803, confirming and establishing the boundary line between this State and the State of Tennessee as ascertained by the report of the commissioners appointed in that year, and declared the true line of this State to be in latitude 36°, 30′ north; and that the line agreed upon between the States on the 22d of January, 1803, was erroneous by reason of mistakes in fact caused by defective instruments and incompetent observers, and that the same is not obligatory on the State. In the meantime, on the 7th day of January, 1890, a suit had been instituted in the Supreme Court of the United States by the Commonwealth of Virginia through her attorneys, R. A. Ayers and William F. Rhea vs. the Commonwealth of Tennessee, the object of the suit being to have the Supreme Court of the United States declare the true line between the States to be 36°, 30′ north latitude, as provided for in the original charter of the colonies of Virginia and North Carolina. Numerous depositions were taken in this case, and the Supreme Court of the United States, on the 3d day of April, 1893, rendered their opinion, and decided that Virginia was estopped by her action in the year 1803, and declaring the true line between the States to be the compromise line of 1803.* * 148 U. S. Reports, page 503. Controversies between the citizens of Virginia and the citizens of Tennessee at this time and for some time previous thereto were of frequent occurrence, and oftentimes seriously threatened the breach of the peace. In the year 1889, N. T. Wills, Joseph Southerland and R. R. Butler undertook to take possession of a tract of land situated near Green Cove in this county, the property of Marion Miller and the heirs of George W. Hopkins, deceased, and continued their efforts until the year 1892, in which year Marion Miller obtained an injunction from the judge of the Circuit Court of this county restraining the said Wills, Southerland and Butler from interfering with said property, and in the month of October, 1893, the defendants answered in said suit. Numerous depositions were taken, and on the 24th of May, 1895, the judge of the Circuit Court of this county rendered an opinion, holding that the summit of White Top, as the beginning of the compromise line of 1802, did not mean, nor never was intended to mean, the top of the highest peak of that mountain, but that it meant the top of the mountain at the point where the compromise line run by the commissioners of 1802 began. But the court, in view of the fact that the corner where the line of 1802 actually began was uncertain, ordered and decreed that the following issues out of chancery should be tried at the bar of the court, namely: First. Does the compromise line of 1802, between the States of Virginia and Tennessee, as located and established by General Joseph Martin, Creed Taylor and Peter Johnston, commissioners on the part of Virginia, and Moses Fisk, General John Sevier and General George Rutledge, commissioners on the part of Tennessee, lie south or north of the lands in controversy? Second. At what point did it actually begin, and in what direction was it actually run and located until it passed west of the lands now claimed by complainant and in controversy in this cause? This issue was tried by a jury, composed of R. P. Carson, W. O. Booker, H. B. Roberts, D. A. Jones, Jerry Whitaker, Thomas H. Akers, J. C. Hayter, George Keller, James Hagy, W. F. Arnett, Robert Miller, and James Fields. This jury, after hearing all the evidence produced by the parties, returned the following verdict: "1st. We, the jury, find and decide that the compromise line of 1802-'03 runs south of the land in controversy. "2nd. The jury further find that the point where that line began is on the summit of Pond Mountain, and runs due west beyond the lands in controversy." The defendants moved the court to set aside this verdict of the jury and grant them a new trial, and the court, in the month of January, 1896, delivered an opinion disagreeing with the jury in their conclusions and adjudging that the top of Pond mountain was not the summit of White Top, where the said line began, and fixed said line north, instead of south, of the land in controversy, and declared the land in controversy to be in the State of Tennessee and without the jurisdiction of the court. From this opinion of the court the plaintiff, Marion Miller, appealed to the Court of Appeals of Virginia, and that court, on the 18th of November, 1897, delivered an opinion reversing the judgment of the Circuit Court of Washington county and fixing the boundary line between the States of Virginia and Tennessee as a straight line, beginning on the top of White Top mountain where the northeastern corner of Tennessee terminates and following a due west course midway between Walker's and Henderson's lines to the top of the Cumberland mountain where the southwestern corner of Virginia terminates.* * 92 Virginia Reports, page 337. By this decision the contention of the citizens of the State of Virginia was sustained, and the position of the claimants of lands under titles derived from the State of Virginia was greatly strengthened. Thus matters stood when, on the 30th day of April, 1900, a consent decree was entered by the Supreme Court of the United States in the suit of Tennessee, complainant, vs. the State of Virginia, defendant, directing commissioners to ascertain, retrace, remark and re-establish the boundary line between the State of Tennessee and the State of Virginia as fixed in the year 1803. W. C. Hodgkins, J. B. Baylor and Andrew H. Buchanan were appointed commissioners to execute said decree. These commissioners proceeded to execute this decree, and on the 5th day of January, 1903, filed their report in the clerk's office of the Supreme Court of the United States, which report is in the words and figures following, to-wit: To the Honorable the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States: Your commissioners, appointed by decree of this honorable court, dated April 30, 1900, to ascertain, retrace, re-mark and re-establish the boundary line established between the States of Virginia and Tennessee, by the compact of 1803, which was actually run and located under proceedings had by the two States, in 1801-1803, and was then marked with five chops in the shape of a diamond, and which ran from White Top mountain to Cumberland Gap, respectfully represent that they have completed the duties assigned to them by the said decree of April 30, 1900, that they have remarked and retraced the said boundary line as originally run and marked with five chops in the shape of a diamond in the year 1802, and that for the better securing of the same they have placed upon the said line, besides other durable marks, monuments of cut limestone, four and a half feet long and seven inches square on top, with V's cut on their north faces and T's on their south faces, set three and a half feet in the ground, conveniently located as hereinafter more fully described, so that the citizens of each State and others, by reasonable diligence, may readily find the true location of said boundary; all of which is more particularly set forth in the detailed report of their operations which your commissioners herewith beg to submit, together with two maps explanatory of the same, a list of the several permanent monuments and other durable marks, and a complete bill of costs and charges. And your commissioners further pray that this honorable court accept and confirm this report; that the line as marked on the ground by said commissioners in the years 1901 and 1902 be declared to be the real, certain and true boundary between the States of Tennessee and Virginia; that your commissioners be allowed their expenses and reasonable charges for their own services in these premises, as shown on the bill of costs which forms a part of this report; and finally that your commissioners be discharged from further proceedings in these premises. [SEAL.] William C. Hodgkins, Commissioner. [SEAL.] James B. Baylor, Commissioner. [SEAL.] Andrew H. Buchanan, Commissioner. Detailed report of the operations of the commission appointed by the Supreme Court of the United States (April 30, 1900,) to retrace and re-mark the boundary line between the States of Tennessee and Virginia. At the date of the above decree and for several months thereafter the State of Virginia had no funds available for the proceedings ordered by the court, and none could be had until there could be a session of the State Legislature to make the needed appropriation. It was, therefore, necessary for your commissioners to seek an extension of the time within which they might make their report, and, upon the motion of the attorney-general of Virginia, an extension was granted until the next term of court. At a session of the General Assembly of Virginia held in the winter of 1900-1901, the sum of five thousand dollars was appropriated for the purpose of paying Virginia's share of the expenses of this boundary survey. The Tennessee Legislature had previously made a like appropriation. Your commissioners, therefore, made preparations for beginning the execution of their duties under your decree of April 30, 1900, as early in the season of 1901 as the weather conditions should permit. The commission held its first meeting at Washington, D. C., on May 16, 1901, and organized by choosing William C. Hodgkins, of the State of Massachusetts, as chairman, James B. Baylor, of the State of Virginia, as secretary, and Andrew H. Buchanan, of the State of Tennessee, as treasurer. At this meeting there was a full discussion of the problem presented and of the method of work which might be most suitable under all the conditions. Arrangements were also made for procuring the necessary camp outfit and supplies. Through the courtesy of the superintendent of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey your commissioners were able to procure from that bureau, without charge, not only the outfit of tents and camp furniture required for the shelter and comfort of the party, but also valuable instruments needed for the survey. This relieved the States of Tennessee and Virginia of a considerable expense which would otherwise have been unavoidable. The two States were spared another heavy item of expense by the fact that each of your commissioners is a civil engineer and entirely familiar with work of this nature. It was, therefore, unnecessary to follow the usual course of employing engineers or surveyors to carry out the field work under the direction of the commissioners. Instead of that, your commissioners themselves conducted all the field work, hiring only such rodmen, axemen, etc., as were necessary from time to time. By such methods and by exercising rigid economy in all their expenditures, your commissioners have been able to complete the entire work, including the setting of cut-stone monuments and also including the amount charged for their own remuneration for the sum of $9,475.99, which is but little more than the amount charged to the State of Virginia alone by the joint commission of 1858-1859. It having been decided at the first meeting of the commission that the most convenient place for beginning field operations would be the city of Bristol, which is located directly upon the boundary line, the commission adjourned to that place. Field-work was begun on May 22, 1901, with the examination of a portion of the line east of Bristol, where a number of trees were found which bore the marks of the surveys of 1802 and 1858-'59. As there have been considerable controversy and conflicting testimony in regard to the nature of these old marks, it may be well to show by diagrams and photographs the actual arrangements and appearance of those of both years, as well as of the somewhat different mark which was used for the present re-marking by your commissioners: 1802. 1859. 1902. While the marks made in 1858-'59 are still numerous in forested areas and are generally easily distinguishable, those made in 1802 are becoming scarce, and sometimes are barely discernible when found. This is shown in the accompanying photograph of a large white oak tree, upon which the marks of 1858-'59 can readily be traced, while only three of those made in 1802 can be distinguished, and those with difficulty. The marks of 1802 were apparently made with a small and light hatchet, and on many trees which have a thick and rough bark the hatchet does not seem to have reached the wood, and in such cases the gradual exfoliation of the bark has often nearly or entirely obliterated the mark. Where the wood was wounded a small burr has formed, which can nearly always be recognized; but cuts which did not completely penetrate the bark have sometimes disappeared. The marks left by the survey of 1858-'59 were found of very great value as guides to the older "diamond" marks of 1802. Both marks were often found on the same tree, and it was a rare occurrence to find the diamond mark without the mark of 1859 either above or below it. In fact, it was very soon noticed that the mere fact of finding the mark of 1858-'59 either above or below the normal position on a tree was an almost certain indication that a diamond mark had been found there at the date of the latter marking, even though, through the action of time and the elements, all vestiges of it may now have disappeared. Since the date of the last survey, very many marked trees have been destroyed through various agencies, especially since the more rapid development of this section in the recent years has caused a greater demand for lumber, and in some places the trees bearing the old marks are so far apart and the marks themselves are so faint that great trouble and delay would often have been experienced in the search for these old marks had it not been for the aid afforded by the marks of 1858-'59, which always proved reliable guides by which to find the older marks. In this connection it may not be inappropriate for your commissioners to state that they everywhere found that the joint commission of 1859 did its work in a careful and conscientious manner, and that they believe its line, as marked on the growing timber, is identical with that marked by the joint commission of 1802, and that full credence should be given to statements of fact in the report of that survey. From a point about a mile and a quarter east of Bristol the line was traced without difficulty, other than that due to the broken nature of the country traversed, as far as the beginning of what is commonly known as the Denton Valley offset. At this point occurs the greatest and most remarkable irregularity in the whole course of this line, there being a deflection from the direct course of 66°, 10′ for a distance of 8715.6 feet. The portion of the boundary east of the offset is further north than that west of the offset, so that the deflection is to the south in going westward from the eastern end of the line, the direction in which it was originally run out, or to the north in working eastward from Bristol, as was done in the present survey for reasons of convenience. In either case the deflection is to the left hand; but it is not the same in each case, as the two portions of the line east and west of the offsets are not exactly parallel to each other. This difference of direction amounts to 1°, 30′, as shown on the map of the line accompanying this report. Owing to the long controversy over this offset and the persistent assertions of certain parties that marked timber would be found on the eastern prolongation of the portion of the line extending from Bristol to Denton's valley, if the same were run out, your commissioners felt obliged, in order to settle the question for all time, to run out this line and make a careful search for marked timber along its course. This was accordingly done and a careful examination of the timber on each side of the transit line was made as the work progressed, but with only negative results. Although several weeks were spent in running this line across the series of very rough and heavily-timbered mountains lying between Denton's valley and Pond Mountain, near the corner of North Carolina, and although every story brought to the commissioners by people interested in the result was carefully examined, your commissioners were utterly unable to find or have pointed out to them one authentic mark of the line 1802, either on this line or anywhere in its vicinity. On the other hand, the "offset line" and the portion of the line running eastward from the offset to the vicinity of the White Top mountain were found well marked; both the 1802 and the 1858-'59 marks were found at frequent intervals. In order to be assured that these marks were authentic, blocks were cut from several of these trees at different points on said offset line, and the ages of the marks were determined by counting the rings of the annual growth. These tests showed that the marks were of the supposed age. The ages of the most important marks were verified by the United States Bureau of Forestry. As was found in 1858-'59, the marking of the timber ceased (or began) on a comparatively low eminence, known as Burnt Hill, which from the neighboring heights of White Top or Pond mountain seems to be in the bottom of a hollow. The apparent discrepancy between this situation and the language of the report of the joint commissioners of 1802, which reads: "Beginning on the summit of the mountain generally known as the White Top mountain," etc., has led some to suppose that the line should be extended further east, to the summit of the so-called "divide" or watershed between the tributaries of the Holston and New rivers. There seems, however, nothing to support this theory except the somewhat hazy idea that the eastern end or point of beginning of this line ought to be on a summit. As a matter of fact, the actual end of the line of Burnt Hill is on quite as much of a summit as if it had been on the "divide," which in this place is so low and flat as to be scarcely perceptible as an elevation of any importance. It certainly could never be supposed to be the summit of White Top mountain, which towers far above it, its huge, dome-like bulk filling the northeastern horizon. No marked trees of 1802 or 1858-'59 could be found east of Burnt Hill, though the line was produced through heavy timber of original growth to the "divide," and careful search was made for them. The same condition was found in 1859, as reported by the commission of that year. A point which that commission seems to have overlooked is the important fact that the eastern end of the marked line at Burnt Hill is almost exactly in line between the corner of North Carolina, on Pond Mountain, and the summit of White Top mountain. What more likely than that the commissioners of 1802, who had agreed to lay out a line equally distant from the older lines, known as Walker's and Henderson's and beginning on the summit of the mountain generally known as the White Top mountain, should begin at the point where the Walker line reached the northwestern corner of North Carolina, and where accordingly the jurisdiction of Tennessee should begin, and run thence in the direction of the most important peak to the northward and eastward until they reached the desired middle point between the lines of Walker and Henderson, and from that point started on their westerly course. It is hard to understand why they should have omitted to mark this part of the line; but this small bit of boundary extending from the northeast corner of Tennessee to the northwest corner of North Carolina seems to have been somewhat overlooked in more recent proceedings. Your commissioners respectfully recommend that the straight line between these two points be declared to be the boundary, believing as they do, in the absence of any marks to the contrary, that this was the original and true line. All of this section is composed of very rugged and densely-wooded mountains with but a scanty population. The progress of the work in this mountainous anl almost inaccessible region was delayed not only by the nature of the country and by the fact that in this very worst part of the whole line it was necessary to run out these two independent lines, doubling the labor to be expended, but also by the unfortunately rainy weather which was experienced. The frequent and heavy rains often stopped field work, washed the few roads so badly that they became almost impassable, and raised the streams so high that sometimes for days at a time it was impossible to ford them. It was not until September 21st that your commissioners were able to close work in the White Top region and return to Bristol to start westward from that place towards Cumberland Gap. For the remainder of the season, however, both the weather and the nature of the country were much more favorable for field operations, and excellent progress was made, though it was impossible to complete the work before the approach of winter. So far as the portion of the boundary passing through the central portion of the city of Bristol is concerned, the labors of your commissioners were forestalled by a special act of the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, approved January 28, 1901, ceding to the State of Virginia the northern half of the main street of the two cities. The General Assembly of Virginia accepted the cession by an act approved February 9, 1901, and the action of the two legislatures was subsequently ratified by the Congress and approved by the President of the United States March 3, 1901. This cession covers, however, but a small part of the boundary, extending only from the northwest corner of the old town of Bristol on the west to the western boundary of the Bristol cemetery on the east. As it is important to guard against the possible renewal of this long-standing controversy, and as the town is already extending beyond the above limits, it was deemed proper to mark the old diamond line by monuments, just as if there had been no legal change in the boundary for this short distance. But your commissioners regret to report that they have been unable to reach a unanimous conclusion in regard to the true location of the said diamond line within and near the above limits. Commissioners Hodgkins and Buchanan, after careful study of all the evidence of record and after diligent examination of the ground, are of the opinion that the said diamond line of 1802-1803 runs from monument No. 25, near the first marked trees east of Bristol, in a straight line, to monument No. 26, on the western boundary of the Bristol cemetery and on the north line of Main or State street; thence along the northern line of said Main or State street to "a planted stone in the edge of a field formerly owned by Z. L. Burson, being the northwest corner of the corporate territory of the old town of Bristol" referred to in the act of cession, supra; and thence in a straight line to monument No. 28 in the fork of the main road and near the first marked trees west of Bristol. Commissioner Baylor, on the other hand, after equally careful consideration of all the evidence of record and diligent examination of the ground, is of the opinion that the said diamond line of 1802-1803 runs from monument No. 25, near the first marked tree east of Bristol, in a straight line to monument No. 27, situated just outside of the wall of the Bristol cemetery, and on the middle line of Main or State street as it runs west from this point; and thence in a straight line along the middle of Main or State street to monument No. 28, near the centre of the fork of the main road and near the first marked trees of 1858-'59 west of Bristol. The said line running through the centre of Main or State street is just thirty feet south of monument No. 26 on the north property line of Main or State street outside the western wall of Bristol cemetery. Westward from Bristol, the boundary was retraced without difficulty by the marked trees, just as in the previous work to the eastward. Only one marked deviation from the general course of the line was encountered during the remainder of the season. This was on the property formerly known as the Hickman place, in the vicinity of the village of Bloomingdale, Tennessee. Here the line was found to have a deflection of 8°, 30′ to the right or north for the distance of 3161.8 feet. From the western end of this offset the line resumed its general westerly course, and so continued until the end of the work of that year. As the season advanced it became evident that even under the most favorable conditions it would be impossible to complete the survey without working far into the winter, which on many accounts was undesirable. The attorney-generals of the two States therefore joined in a request for a further extension of time within which your commissioners might file their report, and this honorable court thereupon extended that time until the opening of the October term, 1902. The field operations for the season of 1901 were closed at the end of October, at which time the survey had been extended to the Clinch river, forty-three miles east of Cumberland Gap, the total length of boundary retraced being seventy miles, besides sixteen miles of trial line run on the extension of the "straight line" from Denton's valley to Pond mountain. Before the opening of the field work for the season 1902 a complaint reached your commissioners from a citizen of Johnson county, Tennessee, supposed to be reliable, to the effect that interested parties were interfering with the marks placed on the line the previous year, and that, in some cases at least, the monuments had not been properly placed by the persons employed for that purpose. Although these statements seem scarcely credible in view of the general interest taken in the work by the inhabitants, your commissioners thought it best to investigate the matter and to satisfy themselves by personal inspection that the monuments had remained undisturbed in their proper places. This was accordingly done at the outset of the season's work, and it was ascertained that the stories of falsification of the marking were without any foundation of fact; that all the monuments between the northeast corner of Tennessee and Bristol had been properly set, and that none of them had been disturbed. These preliminary operations occupied the time from June 23 to July 4, on which day your commissioners returned to Bristol. After placing some additional monuments on the old line in and near Bristol they proceeded to Gate City, Virginia, where the camp outfit had been stored at the close of the work in the preceding autumn, and at once went into camp at Robinett, Tennessee, west of the north fork of the Clinch river. The survey of the boundary line was resumed at the point where it had been suspended the year before, at the crossing of Clinch river near Church's ford. From this point to Cumberland Gap the line crosses a succession of mountains and valleys with comparatively little level or cleared land. Little difficulty was experienced in tracing the line in this part of its course, the marked trees being generally found at frequent intervals. The line preserved its general course as before, except that two deflections to the northward were found, which were similar to that found the year before near Bloomingdale. The first of these occurred on the mountain called Wallen's Ridge, where the line made a deflection of 19° to the north before reaching the summit, and kept that course for a distance of 4643.7 feet before resuming its usual direction. There were numerous trees with both the 1802 and 1859 marks on this deflected line. The final deflection of 4° 10′ to the north for a distance of 6503.3 feet began at the "old furnace road" near Station creek, less than three miles from the west end of the line on Cumberland mountain. From the western end of this offset the line runs straight to the terminus. There has been considerable controversy and litigation over these last three miles of the boundary, and a number of witnesses have testified in the case of Virginia ag't Tennessee, Supreme Court United States, October term 1891, that there were none of the marks of the previous surveys remaining between Station creek and the summit of Cumberland mountain, owing to the destruction of the timber in that area during the military operations of the Civil war. Your commissioners were able to find, however, three trees well marked with the mark of 1859 survey, and at least one of these bore evidence in the position of this mark that an old diamond mark was formerly visible above it. These marked trees were found on the east and west part of the line west of the offset, and are in excellent alignment, and settled beyond the possibility of doubt the location of this part of the boundary, and hence the short remaining distance to the summit of Cumberland mountain. This line passes near and a little south of the old mill several times referred to in the case above cited, and thence across the Union railroad station, leaving most of the town of Cumberland Gap in Tennessee. The summit of Cumberland mountain was reached on Saturday, August 23, 1902, and on the following Monday the field work of the survey was completed and the camp outfit was packed and shipped to Washington. Your commissioners then separated; Professor Buchanan returned to his home at Lebanon, Tennessee, to work up his field notes, and Mr. Hodgkins to Washington, to attend to business of the commission and to draft a report of its operations, while Mr. Baylor remained on the ground until September 13, superintending the placing of monuments along the part of the line surveyed in 1902. In conclusion, your commissioners state that they have found the duties imposed upon them by your instructions often arduous and exacting, and that the survey just completed proved far more laborious, and was attended by greater hardships, than any of them had anticipated; but that they have nevertheless given the same careful attention to every part of it, and that they believe it to be correct throughout.

[SEAL.] William C. Hodgkins, Commissioner. [SEAL.] James B. Baylor, Commissioner. [SEAL.] Andrew H. Buchanan, Commissioner. The Supreme Court of the United States on the 1st day of June, 1903, confirmed this report and entered the following order: This cause came on to be heard on May 18, 1903, on the proceedings heretofore had herein and upon the report of William C. Hodgkins, James B. Baylor and Andrew H. Buchanan, commissioners appointed by the decretal order herein of April 30, 1900, to ascertain, retrace, re-mark and re-establish the real, certain and true boundary line between the States of Tennessee and Virginia as actually run and located from White Top mountain to Cumberland Gap under proceedings had between the two States in 18011803, and as adjudged and decreed by this court in its decree of April 3, 1893, in a certain original case in equity wherein the State of Virginia was complainant and the State of Tennessee was defendant, which report is annexed hereto and made part hereof. And it appearing to the court that said report was filed in this court on the 5th day of January, 1903, and that the same is unexcepted to by either party in any respect, therefore, upon the motion of the State of Tennessee by her attorney-general and of the State of Virginia by her attorney-general, it is ordered that said report be, and the same is hereby, in all things confirmed. It is thereupon ordered, adjudged and decreed that the real, certain and true boundary line between the States of Tennessee and Virginia as actually run and located under the compact and proceedings had between the two States in 1801-1803, and as adjudged by this court on the 3d day of April, 1893, in said original cause in equity wherein the State of Virginia was complainant and the State of Tennessee was defendant as aforesaid, was at the institution of this suit, and now is, except as hereinafter shown, as described and delineated in said report filed herein on January 5, 1903, as aforesaid. And it further appearing to the court, and it being so admitted by both parties, that since the institution of this suit and the decretal order of April 30, 1900, as aforesaid, a compact was entered into by the States of Tennessee and Virginia expressed in the concurrent laws of said States, namely, the act of the General Assembly of Tennessee, approved January 28, 1901, entitled "An act to cede to the State of Virginia a certain narrow strip of territory belonging to the State of Tennessee lying between the northern boundary line of the city of Bristol, in the county of Sullivan, and the southern boundary line of the city of Bristol, in the county of Washington, State of Virginia, being the northern half of Main street of the said two cities," and the reciprocal act of the General Assembly of Virginia, approved February 9, 1901, entitled "An act to accept the cession by the State of Tennessee to the State of Virginia of a certain narrow strip of territory claimed as belonging to the State of Tennessee and described as lying between the northern boundary line of the city of Bristol, in the county of Sullivan, State of Tennessee, and the southern boundary line of the city of Bristol, in the county of Washington, State of Virginia, being the northern half of the Main street of the said two cities." And it further appearing that said compact received the consent of the Congress of the United States by joint resolution approved March 3, 1901, as follows: "Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That a recent compact or agreement having been made by and between the States of Tennessee and Virginia whereby the State of Tennessee by an act of its legislature approved January twenty-eighth, nineteen hundred and one, ceded to the State of Virginia certain territory specifically described in said act, and being the northern half of the Main street between the cities of Bristol, Tennessee and Virginia, and the State of Virginia, by act of its general assembly, approved February ninth, nineteen hundred and one, having accepted said cession of the State of Tennessee, the consent of Congress is hereby given to said compact or agreement between said States fixing the boundary line between said States as shown by said acts referred to, and the same is hereby ratified." And the said commissioners in their said report having ascertained and recommended the straight line from the end of the "diamond marked" or compact line of 1801-1803 to the corner of the States of North Carolina and Tennessee as the true boundary line between the States of Virginia and Tennessee between those two points, the court, approving said recommendation and finding of said commissioners, doth adopt the same. And the court being of opinion that it is proper to recognize the line so established by said last mentioned compact of 1901 as the real, certain, and true interstate boundary line within and between said two cities, and to definitely determine and fix in this cause what is the real and true and certain boundary line between said States throughout the entire length thereof from the corner of the States of North Carolina and Tennessee, on Pond mountain, to the corner of Virginia and Kentucky, at Cumberlnd Gap, doth therefore adjudge, order, and decree that the entire, real, certain and true boundary line between the States of Tennessee and Virginia is the line described and delineated in said report filed herein on January 5, 1903, modified as to so much of said line as lies between the two cities of Bristol by the aforesaid compact of 1901 between the two States, and as so described, delineated and modified said boundary line, from the said North Carolina corner to the eastern end of the compact line of 1801-1803, known as the "diamond marked" line, and thence to Cumberland Gap, is hereby determined, fixed and established. It is to be hoped that this action of the Supreme Court of the United States will put an end to this controversy, which has lasted for more than 130 years.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">To the Honorable, the Speaker and Gentlemen of the House of Delegates: "In obedience to an act of the assembly entitled "An act for extending the boundary line between Virginia and North Carolina." We, the subscribers, proceeded to run the said Line. — The gentlemen from North Carolina did not meet us so soon as had been agreed; and after they came many accidents happened which protracted the business. The place where Messrs. Fry and Jefferson ended their line, on Steep Rock creek, could not be found, owing, we suppose, to so much of the timber thereabout being since dead! We proceeded to observation in order to fix upon the spot on Steep Rock creek, where we should begin. On Monday, 6th September, 1779, having agreed with the Carolina gentlemen in Observation, the following Memorandums were entered on their Journal as well as ours, as proper preliminaries agreed upon, necessary for fixing this line, Viz. "That the Sun's Meridian Altitude was this day fifty-nine degrees fifty-two minutes—that this place of observation was one minute and twenty-five seconds north of the proper latitude, or one mile, two hundred and one poles and a half—That at Steep Rock we were in superficial measure 329 miles West of Currituck Inlet: That there should be an abatement of twelve miles for mountainous and uneven ground, or that we were 317 miles or five degrees and forty-two minutes west of Currituck Inlet; That a degree of longitude in this latitude is 48.23 geographic miles, or of statute miles 55 and 1,083 yards. That Currituck Inlet was in 75 degrees 30 minutes west Longitude, this being the average of three different accounts, and of course that the Longitude we were then in was 81 degrees 12 minutes west of London. We measured off the one mile and 201½ poles a due south course, and the beginning of the line was thus fixed to the satisfaction of all. We should not have troubled you with these particulars, but for some subsequent events which make us think it our duty. After running the line as far as Carter's valley 45 miles west of Steep Rock creek, the Carolina gentlemen then conceived the line was farther South than it ought to be, and on trial it was found that the variation of the needle had altered a little, which must have happened very lately, and was owing, we believe, to our being just then near some Iron Ore: because on observing the Sun's Meridian Altitude the line was not too far South. As the Carolina gentlemen, by their Observations, made out otherways, they proposed that the surveyors on each side should observe and fix the latitude. This was agreed to by one of us, influenced by a knowledge of a small change of the variation, and was not dissented to by the other, as most of the observations on the part of Virginia had been made by him. But, quite contrary to our expectations, they agreed that we were more than two miles too far South of the proper latitude, which distance was measured off directly north and the line run eastward from that place superintended by two of the Carolina gentlemen, and one of us; while from the same place it was continued westwardly, superintended by the others for the sake of expediting the business. The instruments proper for ascertaining the latitude, were mostly taken back on the eastern part of the line, in order that those who superintended it might be farther satisfied; but after going back more than twenty miles, and observing every day on this line, his judgment was unalterably fixed that this line was wrong, although the Carolina gentlemen could not seem to be of this opinion, and he returned and overtook his colleague on the Western part of the line on Blackwater creek or thereabouts, to whom he imparted his sentiments, proposing that he should also observe for some days— which he did—The result was that we concluded our first line right, and we brought it up accordingly from Carter's valley where it had been left and continued on with it to the westward. It was once after this proposed by us, and agreed to by the Carolina Gentlemen, that as we differed so much in Observation we would each run his own line, encamp as near together as we could and let future observers hereafter to be appointed, determine which was right, which might be done at a small expense. But this they afterwards declined, although they carried their line as far as Cumberland mountain, protesting against our line. This protest was received in a letter after we had crossed Cumberland mountain. We continued however as far as Clear fork, being 123¾ miles from Steep Rock creek, marking a Poplar and two Hackberry trees with initials of our names and with November 22, 1779, and had serious thoughts of going no further. But when we considered that, perhaps, three-fourths of the whole expense was already incurred, that a number of People were settling to the Westward, who imagined they were in North Carolina, while we thought they were on the lands reserved for our officers and soldiers:—These and some more of the like considerations, made us think it more conducive to the good of the State in general that we should keep on, than that we should return. But as the season was far advanced and the Country before us, as far as it was known, was very mountainous and barren, not yielding a sufficient quantity of Cane for our pack horses, which for some time had been their principal support: these, among other reasons, made us judge it best to leave off running the line here, and go farther to the westward, into a better Country, where, by reason of many people being about to settle, it might be of importance to run the line speedily. The map will show our route to a place on Cumberland River, where we built canoes to carry our luggage and rest the pack horses, which were too much reduced to do service that way. And here, to add to the number of our difficulties and misfortunes, we were frozen up more than forty days in a river never known to be frozen before. We went by water from this place until we got into the proper latitude (as we judge one hundred and nine miles west of Clear Fork) and began the line on two Beech trees marked with our names and Feb'y 25, 1780, on the West bank of Cumberland River, a creek coming in about a mile above us on the West side, and another one somewhat smaller about half a mile below us on the East side. From this place we extended the line across the heads of Green River and Red river, through a country called the Barrens, from there being little or no timber in it, in many places, crossed the Cumberland again at 131 miles, where there is a cliff on the Northeast side, and a bottom about three quarters of a mile broad on the other side, and at the end of one hundred and forty miles, one quarter and eight poles from the two Beech trees, on the 23rd day of March found ourselves on the Bank of the Tennessee River, and of course had run the line as far westward as we were authorized to do, notwithstanding the hardships and difficulties we had to contend with—One of us kept through the woods with the surveyor while the other went down by water, by which means a tolerable map of the Cumberland River is taken, a fine river, being navigable at least 700 miles from the mouth upwards. When we had returned homewards about 160 miles we met with orders from his Excellency the Governor to do another piece of service, which we suppose he has made you acquainted with. "We have also since seen Col. Henderson, one of the North Carolina commissioners who with another of his Colleagues has been examining our line, and he has repeatedly given us more reason to believe their state will establish the line as we ran it. "Thomas Walker. "Daniel Smith."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sir,— I enclose you a copy of a law, with a proclamation of the Governor of Virginia, by the same conveyance. I am instructed to exercise the authority of the State to the boundary, usually called Walker's line. In this business, it is the wish of the Executive that the subordinate officers conduct themselves in an amicable manner to the inhabitants over which North Carolina formerly exercised Jurisdiction, and with due respect to the authority of the Government south of the River Ohio; these orders are perfectly consonant to my own feelings and sentiments. Therefore, Sir, if you have any objections to make to the change taking place, or anything to ask in favor of the people, it will be respectfully attended to by me and immediately reported to the Governor of Virginia. "I am Sir, Your most Ob't Serv't, "A. Campbell."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Sir,— The enclosed letter from the commanding officer of the militia of Sullivan county, seems to be an avowal of an opposition to an act of our Legislature, for establishing Walker's line as the boundary line to this State. "That I conceive it my duty to forward it to your Excellency. About half of the inhabitants between the lines seem desirous to be governed by the laws of Virginia, but they complain of it as an oppression to be harassed by the authority of the Southwest Territory, and to pay obedience to the laws of this State at the same time." The authorities of the Southwest Territory used every means possible to induce the people in the disputed territory to give their allegiance to the Southwest Territory. Governor Blount published in the Knoxville Gazette, on the 10th of March, 1792, a communication which purported to give the reasons why the people living in the disputed territory should be subject to the authority of the territory. The arguments used were exemption from the payment of taxes, local convenience and the accessibility of the seat of government of the Southwest Territory. The State of Tennessee was admitted into the Union on the 1st day of June, 1796, and the Constitution of the State adopted in the same year defines the boundaries of the State as follows: "Beginning on the extreme height of the Stone mountain at the place where the line of Virginia intersects it in latitude thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes north, running thence along the extreme height of the said mountain to the place where Watauga River breaks through it; thence a direct course to the top of the Yellow mountain, where Bright's road crosses the same; thence along the ridge of said mountain, between the waters of Doe River and the waters of Rock Creek, to the place where the road crosses the Iron Mountain; from thence along the extreme height of said mountain to the place where Nolichucky River runs through the same; thence to the top of Bald Mountain; thence along the extreme height of said mountain to the Painted Rock, on French Broad River; thence along the highest ridge of said mountain to the place where it is called the Great Iron or Smoky Mountain; thence along the extreme height of said mountain to the place where it is called the Unicoi or Unaka Mountain, between the Indian towns of Cowee and Old Chota; thence along the main ridge of the said mountain to the southern boundary of this State, as described in the Act of session of North Carolina to the United States of America that all the territory, lands and waters lying west of said line, contained in the chartered limits of the State of North Carolina, are within the boundaries and limits of this State." The boundaries of the State of Tennessee as fixed by the Constitution of 1796 were incorporated in the Constitutions of that State, adopted in the years 1834 and 1870. It will thus be seen that the Constitution of the State of Tennessee designates their northern line to be in thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes north latitude, when, in fact, the line now insisted upon by that State is in latitude 36° 36′ 00.94″, or 6′ 00.94″ north of the true line. Such was the condition of affairs at the beginning of the year 1800. On the 10th of January, 1800, the General Assembly of Virginia adopted the following resolution: "Resolved, That the Executive be authorized and requested to appoint three commissioners, whose duty it shall be to meet commissioners to be appointed by the State of Tennessee, to settle and adjust all differences concerning the said boundary line, and to establish the one or the other of the said lines, as the case may be, or to run any other line which may be agreed on for settling the same; and that the Executive also be requested to transmit a copy of this resolution to the Executive authority of the State of Tennessee." The General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, on November 13, 1801, adopted the following act: 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, That the Governor, for the time being, is hereby authorized and required, as soon as may be convenient after the passing of this act, to appoint three commissioners on the part of the State, one of whom shall be a mathematician capable of taking the latitude, who, when so appointed, are hereby authorized and empowered, or a majority of them, to act in conjunction with such commissioners as are or may be appointed by the State of Virginia, to settle and designate a true line between the aforesaid States. 2. Be it enacted, That there shall be appointed by the authority aforesaid one surveyor, who, together with the aforesaid commissioners, shall each receive five dollars per day as full compensation for their services and expenses whilst they are performing the duties enjoined in this act, and there shall also be chosen by the commissioners one suitable person as marker of the line aforesaid, who shall receive two dollars per day in full discharge for his services and expenses. And whereas, it may be difficult for this Legislature to ascertain with precision what powers ought of right to be delegated to the said commissioners; therefore, 3. Be it enacted, That the governor is hereby authorized and required, from time to time, to issue such instructions to the commissioners as he may deem proper for the purpose of carrying into effect the object intended by this act consistent with the true interest of the State. 4. Be it enacted, That said commissioners, as soon as may be, shall report in writing to the governor for the time being a true statement of all their proceedings relative to the running and establishing of the said line, whose duty it shall be to lay the same before the succeeding Legislature. Pursuant to the authority thus conferred Peter Johnston, Joseph Martin and Creed Taylor were appointed commissioners upon the part of Virginia, and Moses Fisk, John Sevier and George Rutledge commissioners upon the part of Tennessee to ascertain and adjust the boundary line between the two States, while Brice Martin and Nathan B. Markland were appointed surveyors to run and mark the said line. The commissioners thus appointed proceeded to the discharge of their duties and completed their labors at the house of William Robertson, near Cumberland Gap, on the 8th of December, 1802. The commissioners and surveyors thereupon reported their action to the General Assembly of the States of Virginia and Tennessee. Their report was confirmed and the boundary line between the States established as reported by an act of the General Assembly of Virginia passed on the 22d of January, 1803, which act is as follows: 1. Whereas the commissioners appointed to ascertain and adjust the boundary line between this State and the State of Tennessee in conformity to the resolution passed by the Legislature of this State for that purpose have proceeded to the execution of the said business, and made a report thereof in the words following, to-wit: "The commissioners for ascertaining and adjusting the boundary line between the States of Virginia and Tennessee, appointed pursuant to public authority on the part of each, namely, General Joseph Martin, Creed Taylor and Peter Johnston, for the former, and Moses Fisk, General John Sevier and General George Rutledge, for the latter, having met at the place previously appointed for that purpose and not uniting in the general results of their astronomical observations to establish either of the former lines, called Walker's and Henderson's, unanimously agreed, in order to end all controversy respecting the subject, to run a due west line equally distant from both, beginning on the summit of the mountain generally known by the name of White Top mountain, where the northeastern corner of Tennessee terminates, to the top of the Cumberland mountain, where the southwestern corner of Virginia terminates, which is hereby declared to be the true boundary line between the said States, and has been accordingly run by Brice Martin and Nathan B. Markland, the surveyors duly appointed for that purpose, and marked under the direction of the said commissioners, as will more at large appear by the report of the said surveyors, hereto annexed, and bearing equal date herewith. "2. The Commissioners do further unanimously agree, to recommend to their respective States, that individuals having claims or titles to lands on either side of said line, as now fixed and agreed upon, and between the lines aforesaid, shall not in consequence thereof, in any wise be prejudiced or affected thereby; and that the Legislatures of their respective States, should pass mutual laws to render all such claims or titles secure to the owners thereof. "3.

      <field name="fulltext">"To His Excellency the Governor of Virginia: "In obedience to commissions respectively conferred upon us under an act of the legislature of the State of Virginia passed the 18th day of March, 1856, and an act of the legislature of the State of Tennessee, passed the 1st day of March, 1858, authorizing the executives of each of said States respectively to appoint commissioners `to again run and mark' the boundary line between the States of Virginia and Tennessee, we the undersigned commissioners, proceeded to discharge the duties assigned us, and beg leave to submit the following as our joint action: Our first object was to determine the duty with which we were charged under the acts of both states, which we found to be substantially the same and both exceedingly vague and indefinite. "But the manifest intention of the legislature of Virginia and Tennessee was, in our opinion, to ascertain and re-mark the compromise line of 1802, but the laws evidently drafted without a knowledge of the facts as we found them to exist, imposed upon us obligations which it was practically impossible to comply with. "We were required to begin the line `on the summit of the mountain commonly known by the name of the White Top, where the northeastern corner of Tennessee terminates' and thence to run due west `to the top of the Cumberland Mountain where the southwestern corner of Virginia ends.' This line, by the laws of Virginia and Tennessee, was declared to be on the parallel of 36 30′ north latitude, and midway between Walker's and Henderson's lines run in 1779. "With these legal restraints upon us, after engaging the services of Professor Revel Keith, an experienced astronomer, and Charles S. Williams, a practical engineer, with an efficient field party, we, on the 29th day of September, 1858, repaired to the field, but observation and experiment soon demonstrated the utter impracticability of a literal compliance with the requirements of the law. "We began the experimental work at the town of Bristol, a small village situated on the compromise line of 1802, at a point where there was no controversy as to the locality of the line, and our first observation at that point showed the latitude to be 36° 36′ nearly, which upon calculation we found to be a little over six statute miles north of the latitude contemplated by law. Further observations and experiments all along the line furnished nearly similar results. In the region of the White Top mountain we met with still more insuperable difficulties to a strict compliance with the requirements of the law. The summit of this mountain, which is well defined and elevated above the surrounding mountains, we found to be about three miles, a northeast course from the termination of the marked timber on the line; and at right angles with the parallel 36 30′ north latitude, a little over eight miles north of said parallel. The northeastern corner of Tennessee was designated by no monument, nor was there any evidence on the ground by which we could determine the corner or the beginning of the compromise line of 1802. "The marks on the timber which were found throughout the whole line ceased on a spur of a dividing range of mountains that connects the Stone, Pond and White Top mountains called the `Divide' from the fact that the waters flow from it both east and west, and about one mile from the summit of this dividing range. "At the point where the marks on the line of 1802 terminate there is no marked corner or any change in appearance of the marks on the timber indicating a purpose to establish a corner or beginning point of the line, nor is there any marked timber between that point and the summit of the `Divide,' although thickly wooded, except on the summit, where it appears to have been cleared twenty or twenty-five years ago and is now under cultivation. "Under this perplexing state of facts we were neither able to comply strictly with the requirements of the law or definitely to settle the `northeastern corner of Tennessee,' or to establish the beginning point of the line we were required to trace. "The Virginia commissioners insisted that the line should be extended east from the end of the marked line on the little mountain south of the Denton Valley to the top of the `Divide,' because it would be but a continuation of the line from Cumberland Gap, which is to that point about midway between Walker's and Henderson's lines, and because the existence of a cross line running south 22° west was not even known, or the line from the top of the little mountain westward to the river heretofore recognized as the boundary, or any part of it. "And the Tennessee commissioners, that the northern line as connected by the cross line with the southern should be extended to the `summit of the Divide,' and the northeastern corner of Tennessee there established, because it is the only unbroken and continuously marked line ascertained, and the summit of the `Divide' presents the only natural monument that reasonably conforms to the commissioners' purpose to establish one at the end of the marks on the line. No conclusive agreement could be made, and we were compelled to leave the point of beginning an open question. "After making these and various other experiments calculated to determine the character of the line and its offsets, and taking the latitude at different points between Bristol and White Top mountain, and also at Cumberland Gap in the fall of 1858, we found from the inclemency of the weather and the advanced season, that it would be manifestly to the interest of both States to suspend operations until the following summer, when the season would be more propitious for the progress of the work. "On the 7th day of June, 1859, we again, with our `Surveyor and field party,' assembled at Bristol, and after determining to retrace and remark the compromise line of 1802, we resumed the work and accurately ran, re-marked and measured the old line of 1802 with all of its offsets and irregularities, as shown in the surveyor's report herein incorporated and on the accompanying map herewith submitted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Leonidas Baugh and James C. Black, of Virginia, and Samuel Milligan and George B. McClelland, of Tennessee, commissioners for running and re-marking the boundary line between their respective States: Gentlemen,— Herewith I submit a map of the boundary line between the States of Virginia and Tennessee, as traced and remarked by the field party in my charge under your direction. After a thorough search through the country in the vicinity of the mountain "commonly known as White Top," the line marked by the commissioners of 1802 was found marked upon a northern spur of the ridge known as the "Divide." This ridge divides the waters flowing into New River on the east from those flowing into Holston River on the west. The point where the line was found is about a mile northwestwardly from the residence of Mr. Wells Blevins, upon the "Divide" and about three miles southwesterly from the summit of White Top. Although diligent search was made, no trace of a line was found east of this point, neither, on the other hand, was there the least indication of a corner, the line being marked as elsewhere. Traced westerly to Denton's Valley the line varies, generally one and one-half (1½) degrees north from a truly west course as found by astronomical observation. In Denton's valley an offset was found, the line bearing south 22 west (by the needle), for a distance of 8,700 feet, to a point upon a high spur of the little mountain immediately west of Mill Creek. From the southern terminus of this offset the line runs upon a course very closely approximating due west to a point in the eastern boundary line of the town of Bristol, where a small variation was found. The line was so adjusted, however, as to coincide with the central line of the main street of Bristol, the magnetic course being south 89° 40′ west, and so continued to the west branch of Beaver Creek. From Bristol west to Cumberland Gap, the line generally preserves a due west course, as determined by astronomical observations, with the following exceptions: 1. On the farm of John Hickman, west of Bristol, the line varies to North 82½ west (magnetic course), for a distance of 310 feet. 2. At the crossing of Wallen's ridge, where an offset of 1,457 feet occurs, which was connected by an oblique line, as shown on the map. 3. Near Cumberland Gap, where the direction of the line varies to north 88 west (magnetic course) for a distance of 6,922 feet. The line was found plainly marked where the timber remained standing, was readily found through most of its course and is subject to minor deviations incidental to long compass lines, generally, however, preserving a due west course. The standing timber along the line was marked in five chops in the form of: The total length of line as run and remeasured with a level chain is 113 miles. Respectfully submitted. Charles S. Williams, Surveyor Boundary Commissioner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The territory in the form of a triangle, lying between the top of Little mountain and the red lines on the map in what is known as "Denton's Valley," has heretofore been recognized by the citizens residing therein as included in the State of Virginia, and the top of Little mountain is recognized as the boundary line. To this supposed boundary both States have heretofore exercised jurisdiction, and north of the summit of the mountain the citizens residing in the triangle have derived their land titles from the State of Virginia; they have there voted, been taxed, and exercised all the rights of citizens of that State. The line, though plainly marked from the top of Little mountain westward nearly to the river, and the cross line at Denton's Valley running south twenty-two west and connecting the north and south lines, seem not to have been recognized as the boundary line, the very existence even of the cross line being unknown until we discovered it; but it is also well defined and so distinctly marked as to leave no doubt that it was run and marked in 1802. With this single exception, the line as traced by us has been, as far as we are able to ascertain, recognized throughout its entire length for fifty-seven years as the true boundary line between the States of Virginia and Tennessee. The latitude, as marked on the map east of Bristol and at Cumberland Gap, was carefully determined by Professor Keith with a "zenith transit" or transit instrument, the most modern and improved astronomical instrument now in use, and may be relied upon as perfectly accurate, except at Bristol, and that was ascertained under disadvantageous circumstances, but it is believed to be nearly correct. West of Bristol, except at Cumberland Gap, the latitude was determined by Lieutenant Francis T. Byan, of the corps of United States topographical engineers, with a "sextant," and may also be relied upon as correctly determined. The line was traced with a "theodolite," and great care observed throughout correctly to ascertain its true bearing, offsets and irregularities. We found the old line marked with "five chops in the form of a diamond," and we varied ours by using only four chops, and placed them on the tree somewhat in the form of the letters w y e: as shown in the surveyor's report. The fore and aft marks were placed truly on the line, and the side marks were placed respectively on that portion of the timber next the true line. Where we found no growing timber we caused monuments of stone to be erected, "firmly planted" one foot and a half in the ground and extending two and a half feet above the ground, well dressed and marked on the north side with the letter V, and the south side with the letter T, so that the line may be readily identified throughout its entire length. At Cumberland Gap the line terminated on a chestnut oak on the summit of a mountain, at which there is also marked a monument of stone. At the eastern end of the line where the marked timber ceases we placed a monument of stone, but we put no inscription upon it, indicating that point to be the "northeastern corner of Tennessee" for the reason hereinbefore assigned. We deem it proper further to state that we have indicated on the map at different points the reputed locality of the Walker line, but we found no marked timber indicating its position, except at the western end of the line, which we have truly represented on the map. We saw no trace of the Henderson line at any point, and consequently were unable accurately to represent its position on the map. Its reputed position is represented on the map at a point near Bristol. We further beg leave to state that the general course of the line lies over a rough and mountainous country, almost inaccessible, especially the eastern portion of it, and its survey was attended with an amount of labor and privation which we are sure no one can justly appreciate but those who have actually undergone them. But we felt justified in stating that we spared no pains or labor accurately to trace and mark the line, as well as to show the true state of facts that surround it, that the legislatures, both of Tennessee and Virginia, can act understandingly in ratifying or rejecting it, as in their wisdom they may think right and proper. All of which is most respectfully submitted. Sam Milligan, George R. McClellan, Tennessee Commissioners. Leonidas Baugh, James C. Black, Virginia Commissioners. December 30, 1859.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Washington, D. C., "December 30th, 1869. "Prof'r. Benj'n Pierce, Sup't. U. S. Coast Survey: "Sir,— In your letter of instructions to observe the Solar Eclipse of August 7th, at or near Bristol, Tenn., you also directed me to comply, if practicable, with the request made by the President of Washington College, Virginia, to connect the station at Bristol, the position of which would be astronomically determined, with one or more of the monuments which mark the boundary line of the State of Virginia in that vicinity, so that the longitude and latitude thereof may be accurately known. "Ascertaining soon after my arrival at Bristol that the connection could be readily made, the work was undertaken and completed without interfering with the regular duties assigned to the party. Signals, which were visible from the astronomical station, were erected on the boundary, or main street separating Goodson in Virginia from Bristol in Tennessee, and the connection effected by means of a measured base and triangulation. In view of the fact, however, that the signals, or monuments, were placed on a line which, though recognized as the boundary between Virginia and Tennessee, has not been, in the opinion of many, definitely settled as such, and as the results of the observations and triangulation, made under my direction, may be used as authority in the discussion of the question should it again arise, I beg leave to show the character of the operation by which the direction of the line, and the latitude and longitude of the monument were obtained, and to describe, by a short historic sketch hereto appended, the special line referred to, there having been three or more lines run by the interested parties at different periods. "The instruments employed to determine the exact geographical position of the observatory on Lancaster Hill, Goodson, in connection with the Eclipse of August 7th, were a Transit and Zenith Telescope, each mounted on a solid pier composed of brick and cement. The latitude was determined by 12 pairs of stars, and the longitude by the transmission of time signals to the Naval Observatory at Washington, on three nights, the telegraph wires having been connected and placed at our disposal for that purpose. The observations to secure those results were made by Assistant A. T. Mosman during nine nights, between the 28th of July and the 7th of August. "To connect the Zenith Telescope with the boundary, a base was measured and a triangulation executed, including two stations on the line recognized by the inhabitants as the boundary of 1802, and as specially pointed out by Thomas D. Walthall, Esq., of Bristol, an engineer and surveyor well informed on the subject. "The azimuth of the line was derived from measurements made between Ursa Minor at its upper culmination and three of the principal triangle sides. "Before leaving Bristol, it was understood that permanent monuments would be erected by the municipal authorities of Bristol and Goodson, at two points determined on the boundary. The piers on Lancaster Hill were placed, by letter, under the protection of the Mayor of Goodson. "Upon examination of the charters, agreements and legislative enactments referring to the dividing line between Virginia on the one side and North Carolina and Tennessee on the other, as fully quoted and explained in the accompanying appendix, it will be ascertained that from the date of the second charter of King Charles II., in 1665, to the latest legislation in regard to its demarcation in 1860, the southern boundary of Virginia has been supposed to be situated, as it was in part directed to be traced, on the parallel of 36° 30′. "The joint commission which was organized in 1779 was directed to start upon the parallel of 36 30′, and to continue on that parallel to the Tennessee river. As the respective commissioners differed in the results of their observations, two lines were run, known as the Walker and Henderson lines, neither of which was correct. Finally as a kind of compromise and under the supposition that the true line must certainly be between the two then in dispute, other commissioners were appointed in 1800, with full powers from Virginia and rather limited powers from Tennessee, and under the direction of this Joint Commission a supposed middle line was then marked, which line was ratified, established and confirmed by Virginia on the 22d of January, 1803, and by Tennessee in the month of November following. This line is neither on the parallel of 36 30′ nor midway between the Walker and Henderson Lines, and yet it must be recognized, as the law directs, `as the true, certain and real boundary between the two States.' "Owing, however, to the lapse of time, this line has become `indistinct, uncertain and to some extent unknown,' and in consequence thereof Virginia, in 1856, appointed Commissioners to `again run and mark said line.' In 1858, the State of Tennessee responded to the Virginia legislation by authorizing the appointment of Commissioners for a similar purpose, and also the organization of a Field Party, to consist of an Engineer and Surveyor, well qualified to make said survey upon scientific principles. This last direction would appear to confer an indirect but very necessary authority to run a new line, in case the old one could not be identified. The Commissioners duly reported their proceedings and acts to their respective States. In 1860, Virginia disapproved of and rejected the line thus re-run and marked, and, by the same resolution of the General Assembly, the Governor was empowered to appoint one or more commissioners to again run the boundary as defined in the Statute of January 22nd, 1803. This is the last act of legislation referring to the boundary line between Virginia and Tennessee, and from this it has been inferred that the location of the line has not been definitely settled. "The following table and memoranda show the results of the operations at Bristol. The latitudes of the Henderson and Walker lines at points situated respectively North and South of Bristol, were computed from data supplied by Thomas D. Walthall, Esq.: When Run. Supposed Latitude. True Latitude. True Longitude. Henderson, or North Carolina line 1779 36° 36′ 00″ 36° 36′ 48. ″ Walker or Virginia line 1779 36° 36′ 00″ 36° 34′ 25.5″ The Middle line, East Mont 1802 36° 36′ 00″ 36° 35′ 38.9″ 82° 10′ 40.00″ The Middle line, West Mont 1802 36° 36′ 00″ 36° 40′ 40.0″ 82° 11′ 25.12″ "The azimuth, or direction of the line, from East to West monument is 91°, 51′, 51″, or North 88°, 09′, 00″ West true. "It will be perceived that the direction of the Middle line, the present acknowledged boundary, is nearly two degrees north of a due west course, and if this direction should have been continued to the Cumberland Mountains, a very large wedge of Virginia territory must have been cut off. In fact, we find from the numerous and reliable observations made for latitude, in 1859, at Newlee's sulphur spring, at or close to the Cumberland Gap, as published in the `Report of the Commissioners appointed to mark the boundary line between the States of Kentucky and Tennessee' that the Southwest corner of Virginia is situated in latitude 36°, 36′, 00.94″, or 6′, 91″, North of the true line. "According to the observations made in connection with the survey of the coast of the United States, the correct latitude of the line where it crosses Knott's Island, situated about three miles west of the site of old Currituck Inlet, is 36°, 33′, 15″, and not 36°, 31′, as determined in 1728; and the correct latitude of the line, west of the Alleghany mountains, where it separates Goodson from Bristol, is 36°, 35′, 39″, .5 and not 36°, 31′, upon which parallel it was intended by all the parties interested that the line should be run.—These discrepancies are not a matter of surprise in view of the defective method adopted for tracing the parallel, of the inferior class of astronomical and surveying instruments employed by the old surveyors, and of the more than probable errors committed in running the line, due, in part, to a want of care in determining the magnetic variation. From the data already presented, it may be fairly inferred that if the different surveys had been conducted as they would be to-day, the State of Virginia would now include within its limits at least 800 square miles of additional territory. "A sketch of the triangulation, and the computations of the triangle sides, latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths, are attached to this report. "I am, Respectfully yours, "Richard D. Cutts."</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Biographical Sketches. REV. CHAS. CUMMINGS. Mr. Cummings was an Irishman by birth, and came to America in early manhood. Soon after arriving in this country he entered Carlisle College, Pennsylvania. After receiving a thorough education he settled in Lancaster county, Virginia, and on the 13th of February, 1766, he married Miss Mildred Carter. He was licensed to preach by Hanover Presbytery on the 18th of April, 1767, and received a call to the North Mountain church, in Augusta county, which church he served until 1772, when he received a call to the Sinking Spring and Ebbing Spring congregations, on the Holston. This call he accepted, and removed with his family to a tract of land in the neighborhood of Abingdon. He served the Sinking Spring church until the year 1812, the date of his death, which occurred in March of that year. He accompanied Colonel Christian upon his expedition against the Cherokees in the year 1776, and preached in the territory, now in the State of Tennessee, being the first preacher in that territory. He joined a company organized at Abingdon under the command of Colonel Evan Shelby, and hurried to the relief of the inhabitants at Watauga when besieged by the Indians, in 1776. He was the first named on the Committee of Safety for Fincastle county, and is accredited with the honor of having drafted the Fincastle resolutions which were adopted on the 20th of January, 1775. He assisted in drafting a petition from Hanover Presbytery to the General Assembly of Virginia, asking the separation of the Church and the State, in October, 1776. When Washington county was formed, in the year 1777, he was elected chairman of the Committee of Safety, and by his example and admonition did much to fire the spirit of patriotism which blazed forth so brilliantly among the people of the Holston in the War of the Revolution. He was of middle stature, about five feet ten inches high, well set and well formed, possessing great personal firmness and dignity of character. His voice was strong and had great compass; his articulation slow, clear and distinct; without apparent effort he could speak to be heard by ten thousand people. His mind was good, but not brilliant. He understood his own system well; spoke always with gravity, and required it from all who sat under the sound of his voice. He would not tolerate any movement among the congregation after the services commenced. He uniformly spoke like one having authority, and laid down the law and the gospel, as he understood them, with great distinctness. COLONEL ARTHUR CAMPBELL. He was born in Augusta county in the year 1743. Entered the service of his country when a youth; was captured at Dickenson's Fort and carried into captivity by the Indians and kept for three years; returned to his home and moved to Holston settlements in 1765. Major in Fincastle militia and member of the County Court of Fincastle county; member of the House of Burgesses from Fincastle county; one of the original trustees of Washington College. County lieutenant and presiding justice of Washington county for more than a quarter of a century. Represented Fincastle county in the Convention of 1776 and Washington county many times thereafter in the General Assembly of the State. Made an effort to organize a new State west of the mountains in 1782-1785. He was a statesman and a patriot. Died at the present location of Middleborough, Ky., on August 8th, 1811. COLONEL WILLIAM RUSSELL. Born in Culpeper county in the year 1748. Settled near the Clinch river, south of Castle's Woods, about 1770, and built Russell's Fort. Commanded a company of frontiersmen at the battle of Point Pleasant in the fall of 1774. Member of the House of Burgesses from Fincastle county in 1776. Commissioned captain in the Continental army, and accompanied Colonel Christian upon his expedition against the Cherokee Indians in 1776. Member of the General Assembly of Virginia in 1786, and introduced bill for formation of Russell county, Virginia. Brigadier-general of Virginia militia. Married Mrs. Wm. Campbell, and for many years resided at Saltville, Virginia. Died in the year 1794 at the home of his son, Robert S. Russell, in Shenandoah county, Virginia. COLONEL WILLIAM COCKE. Colonel Wm. Cocke was a son of Abraham Cocke, of Amelia county. Was born in 1747, and died August 22d, 1828. He was an early pioneer of Kentucky; active in the formation of the "State of Franklin," and afterwards of Tennessee; served in two wars—the Revolution, in which he was a captain, and the war of 1812, in which he volunteered, though an old man, and was a member of the Legislature in four States—Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Mississippi. He was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates from Washington county in 1777, and was United States Senator from Tennessee, 1796-'7, 1799-1805. He was afterwards a judge of the Circuit Court of Tennessee, and later removed to Mississippi, where he died. MAJOR ANTHONY BLEDSOE. Born in Augusta county. Member of the County Court of Botetourt, Fincastle and Washington counties. Officer in the militia of Fincastle and Washington counties. Built Bledsoe's Fort. Represented Washington county in the General Assembly 1777-1778. Commanded Christian's army at Long Island from December, 1776, to April, 1777. Removed to Bledsoe's Lick, near Nashville, Tennessee, where he was killed by the Indians. CAPTAIN WM. EDMISTON. Born in Augusta county. Served in the French-Indian war of 1754-1763. Member of the county courts of Fincastle and Washington counties. Officer in the militia of Washington and Fincastle counties. Received a grant of 3,000 acres of land under the King's proclamation of 1763 for services rendered in the French-Indian war, and laid the grant in the community of Edmiston's Fort, in this county. Captain of a company on the expedition into South Carolina in October, 1780. Was killed at the head of his company in the battle of King's Mountain. COLONEL JOSEPH MARTIN. Son of English parents, who emigrated from Bristol, England, and settled in Albemarle county, Virginia. Colonel Martin was born in Albemarle county in the year 1740. Married Susanna Childs. Settled in Pittsylvania county, Virginia. In 1765 attempted the establishment of Martin's Station, in Powell's Valley, but was driven off by the Indians. Afterwards appointed entry-taker by Colonel Richard Henderson for that portion of the Henderson purchase situated in Powell's Valley. Commanded a company of men upon Christian's expedition against the Cherokees in 1776. Appointed Indian agent and stationed at Long Island of Holston river, which position he occupied until the year 1789. Was a member of the Convention of North Carolina called for the adoption or rejection of the Federal Constitution, and several times a member of the General Assembly of North Carolina. About the year 1790 he returned to his old home in Henry county, Virginia. Was soon thereafter elected to the General Assembly of Virginia from Henry county, and continued to serve in that capacity until he himself thought he was by age unfit for further usefulness. Died in 1808, in the sixty-eighth year of his age. GENERAL WM. CAMPBELL. Was a native of Augusta county, of the true Caledonian race by the maternal line as well as by that of the father. Being an only son, he received a liberal education under the best teachers of the times. He had an ardent mind, very susceptible of literary improvements, and acquired early in life a correct knowledge of the English language, of ancient and modern history, and of several branches of mathematics. Nature had formed him for a commander in military capacity. His personal appearance was grave and masculine, being something about six feet high and well proportioned; in conversation rather reserved and thoughtful; in his written communications expressive and elegant. His patriotism was not of a timid cast. He never balanced between his military duty and prudential maxims. When his ire was excited he showed in his countenance the fury of an Achilles. The trusty Andreferrara, the sword he wore on the day of battle, was once the property of his grandfather from Scotland, and he had an arm and a spirit that could wield it with effect. In the year 1775 he was of the first regular troops raised in Virginia, being honored with a captain's commission in the first regiment. Here he acquired a practical knowledge of tactics and the discipline of an army. In the latter part of the year 1776 he resigned his position on account of the Indian war breaking out, by which his family and friends were exposed to immediate danger. Soon after he was promoted to be lieutenant-colonel of the militia of Washington county, and the next year, on the resignation of Evan Shelby, Sr., to that of colonel of the regiment. In this rank he remained until after the battle of King's Mountain and of Guilford, when he was appointed by a vote of the Legislature of Virginia to rank as a brigadier-general, and was ordered to join the Marquis LaFayette, to oppose the invasion of the enemy in 1781. After the defeat of Ferguson, the British general, Cornwallis, imbibed a personal resentment, and had the temerity to theaten that if General Campbell fell into his hands he would have him instantly put to death for his rigor against the Tories. This, instead of intimidating, had the contrary effect, and in turn the American general resolved, if the fortune of war should place Cornwallis in his power, he should meet the fate of Ferguson. This at the battle of Guilford had nearly been the case, for had all the militia behaved with the same firmness and courage as on the wing where General Campbell commanded, the British army must have met with a total defeat. On forming the army in Virginia, under Marquis LaFayette, in 1781, General Campbell became a favorite of that gallant nobleman, who gave him command of the brigade of light infantry and riflemen. A few weeks before the siege of Yorktown he took sick of a complaint in his breast, which obliged him to retire from the army to a friend's house in the country, and there, after a short sickness, to end his days, in the thirty-sixth year of his age, much lamented by the friends of liberty who knew him. Of his military character we have given a short sketch. His moral sentiments and social demeanor in civil life were exemplary. Although an only son and heir to a considerable property, he never gave way to the fashionable follies of young men of fortune. He well knew that vice at any time of life, or in any shape, darkens the understanding, perverts the will, and thus injures social order in every grade of society. He kept a strict guard on his own passions, and was by some deemed too severe in punishing the deviations of others. His military career was short, but brilliant. Warren and Montgomery acted at a conspicuous stage, and deserved the eulogisms so often repeated. Campbell undertook a no less arduous task, with an inferior number of undisciplined militia. He marched in a few days nearly two hundred miles, over vast mountains, in search of the enemy, who were commanded by an experienced officer, of known bravery and military skill, and who had chosen his field for battle. It was at (King's Mountain) rather a fortification than an open space for combatants to meet upon. The assault of the Americans was impetuous and irresistible, and the event was a victory to a wish. This victory resulted in the retreat of the main British army a considerable distance and their relinquishment of the scheme of invading Virginia that year. It also reanimated all the friends of liberty in the Southern States, and was the prelude of adverse events to the enemy, which, in the course of the next campaign, terminated in their final overthrow.* * Colonel Arthur Campbell. COLONEL WILLIAM PRESTON. Son of John Preston, of Augusta county. Born in Ireland 1730, and died at Smithfield, now Blacksburg, 1783. One of the first trustees of Staunton. Member the House of Burgesses from Augusta county 1766-1768, and from Botetourt county 1769. Commanded a company of Rangers in the French-Indian war 1754-1763. On the formation of Botetourt county, 1769, he was appointed colonel of the militia, coroner, escheator and county surveyor. Upon the formation of Fincastle county he was appointed sheriff and surveyor. He was engaged with Colonels Campbell and Christian in their expeditions against the Cherokees in the year 1776. Was at the battles of Whitsill's Mills and Guilford Courthouse, 1781, and was actively engaged throughout the Revolution. He was a member of the Committee of Safety of Fincastle county, and assisted in the preparation of the Fincastle Resolutions. He left eleven children, all of whom, both male and female, became distinguished in the history of our country. His five sons were John, Francis, James, William and Thomas, and his six daughters were Mrs. Thomas Madison, Mrs. Thomas McDowell, Mrs. Hart, Mrs. Thomas Lewis and Mrs. John Floyd. One son and one of his sons-in-law became governors of Virginia. COLONEL JAMES KING. The subject of this sketch was born at Londonderry, Ireland, in 1752. He was well educated, and emigrated to Virginia about the year 1769, and by purchase, entry and condemnation acquired about 50,000 acres of land in and around Bristol, Tennessee and Virginia, of the present day. Colonel King married Sarah, one of the seven daughters of Colonel Thomas Goodson, in Montgomery county, Virginia, and settled a few miles southwest of Bristol near the Sulphur Springs. Colonel King won his title through the Revolutionary war. Was captured and escaped and rejoined his regiment, and after some time resigned his commission and returned to his home, near Bristol, rather than deliver to the quartermaster a magnificent mare from which he had knocked a British officer, but subsequently rejoined his regiment, and was at Yorktown when Cornwallis surrendered. Colonel King some time previous to the year 1800 erected an iron furnace (Barbary Furnace) near the Sulphur Springs, and made the first iron in what is now the State of Tennessee. Colonel King's partner in this enterprise was Governor Blount, of the Southwest Territory. The iron made at this furnace was hauled in wagons to Kingsport, a distance of twenty-five miles, the junction of the North and South forks of Holston river, and transported from that point by water. Kingsport took its name from Colonel King. Some time previous to the year 1810 Colonel King purchased from Isaac Shelby, executor of General Evan Shelby, 976 acres of land, one-half the Sapling Grove tract, for $10,000, and it is said that the backs of two horses were ruined in carrying this silver to Frankfort, Kentucky, the home of General Isaac Shelby. Colonel King afterwards had this property conveyed to his son, the Rev. James King. Colonel King was a very active and useful man. He was one of the three commissioners who negotiated the treaty of Holston, and afterwards laid off the site of Knoxville, Tennessee. He was a man of considerable wealth, and furnished Andrew Jackson (afterwards President of the United States) the money with which Jackson and John Overton purchased the Chickasaw Bluff (now the site of the city of Memphis, Tennessee). The draft for this money is as follows: Col. James King, Sir: Please pay to Mr. Andrew Jackson or order two thousand five hundred one dollars sixty-seven cents which place to account of Sir Your Ob. Servant, David Allison May 13th, 1795. Dolls. 2501 67-100 Colonel King died of gout August 17th, 1825, aged seventy-three years, leaving three children, to-wit: Rev. James King, who married Mourning Micajah Watkins, daughter of the Hon. Micajah Watkins, of Halifax county; William King and Sarah King. Colonel King was buried five miles west of Bristol, under an old coffin-shaped tomb of rock and an iron slab, on which the following inscription in cast: Col. James King Dec'd Aug. 17th 1825 Aged 73 years A Patriot of 1776. The Rev. James King above mentioned was a distinguished Presbyterian divine, a man of considerable wealth, the founder of Bristol, Tennessee, and of King College. He left a large family of children. None but the wealthy in the early days of our country could afford a four-wheel carriage. The Rev. James King, Jr., was the owner of such a carriage, and below is given a receipt for the taxes assessed by the Federal Government upon this luxury: This is to certify that James King, Jr., in the county of Sullivan, in the first collection district of Tennessee, has paid the duty of Thirty dollars, for the year to end on the 31st day of December next, for and upon a four-wheel carriage, called a "Coachee," owned by him, and the harness used therefor. This certificate to be of no avail any longer than the aforesaid carriage shall be owned by the said James King, Jr., unless said certificate shall be produced to a collector, and an entry be made thereon, specifying the name of the then owner of said carriage, and the time when he became possessed thereof. Given in conformity with the laws of the United States this 2nd day of February, 1818. NATHAN GREGG, Deputy Collector of the Revenue, &amp;c. GENERAL WM. E. JONES. The subject of this sketch was born on the Middle Fork of Holston river, in the upper end of Washington county, on the 3d day of May, 1824. He was the son of Robert Jones and wife (formerly a Miss Edmondson). He was educated at Emory and Henry College and at the Military Academy, Gen. Wm. E. Jones West Point, New York, from which institution he graduated in 1848, and was commissioned second lieutenant in the Mounted Rifles, and for three years served in that capacity in what was afterwards the State of Oregon. On January 13th, 1852, while on a furlough, he was united in marriage to Miss Eliza M. Dunn, a daughter of Dr. Samuel Dunn, of this county. Mrs. Jones was accidentally drowned at Pass Cubolla, Texas, on the 26th of March, 1852, while on her way with her husband to join his command in the West. In 1857 he resigned his command in the United States army, and after visiting many places of interest in the Old World he returned to his father's estate, near Glade Spring, and with the assistance of several French and German emigrants he planted an extensive vineyard, and was so engaged when the war between the States began. He organized a cavalry company in the spring of 1861, numbering 102 officers and men, to which was given the name of the Washington Mounted Rifles, afterwards Company D of the First Virginia Cavalry. In September, 1861, he was commissioned colonel of the First Virginia Cavalry, which position he held until April, 1862, when he was assigned to the command of the Seventh Virginia Cavalry, General Turner Ashby's old regiment, and was succeeded in the command of the First Virginia Cavalry by Fitzhugh Lee. In September, 1862, he was commissioned brigadier-general, and was assigned to a command in the Valley of Virginia, a serious disagreement arising between Generals Stuart and Jones. General Jones was assigned to the command of the Department of Southwest Virginia and East Tennessee, and arrived upon the scene during the battle at Blountville. Shortly thereafter he surprised the enemy near Rogersville, Tenn., and captured from eight to nine hundred prisoners. He was at the siege of Knoxville with General Longstreet, and during the same fall and winter he surprised and routed the Federal force of about six hundred officers and men stationed in Lee county. In the spring of 1864 his command took part in the battle of Cloyd's Mountain, in Pulaski county. From Cloyd's Mountain he was ordered to the Valley of Virginia to oppose the advance of the Federal forces under command of General Hunt. General Jones, with the infantry force he had at his command, advanced rapidly to Staunton, and from Staunton to Mt. Hope. At this point his forces were attacked by General Hunter, and every indication pointed to the success of the Confederate arms, when General Jones indiscreetly rushed into the hottest of the fight to rally and encourage some of his men, when he was shot and fell from his horse dead. In a moment all was confusion, and the Confederates were routed. And thus ended the battle of Piedmont. General Jones was directly descended from one of the Edmiston families, whose ancestor participated in the battle of King's Mountain, and was one of the bravest and most striking figures that Washington county has ever produced. His remains were interred in the cemetery of the Old Glade Spring Presbyterian church, and his grave is marked by a plain marble shaft, which bears the following inscription: Gen. Wm. E. Jones, killed June 5th, 1864, In the battle at Piedmont, Virginia, aged 40 years and 27 days. JAMES L. WHITE. The subject of this sketch is the son of Wm. Y. C. White and his wife, Margaret Greenway.

In the year 1818 he decided to settle in Alabama, and President James Monroe, when informed of that fact, addressed the following communication to Governor Bibb, of Huntsville, Alabama, in regard to Colonel Campbell: Louisville, June 24th, 1819. Dear Sir: Had I seen you when at Huntsville I should have spoken to you and recommended to your kind attention Major John Campbell, lately of the Council of State in Virginia, now a resident of Alabama.

He received a legacy of 100 pounds from his grandmother, Elizabeth Davis, and with this capital he started as a pedler to make his fortune. His success was rapid, and he established stores along his line of travel and stocked them with such merchandise as best suited the people of Jos. W. Davis. the country. In 1799 he married Mary Trigg, and built the first brick house in Abingdon. (This house is still standing on Court street opposite the courthouse.) He died in 1808.

      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX. JOURNAL OF DOCTOR THOMAS WALKER— 1749-'50. Having on the 12th of December last been employed for a certain consideration to go to the westward in order to discover a proper place for a settlement, I left my home on the 6th day of March, at 10 o'clock, 1749-'50, in company with Ambrose Powell, William Tomlinson, Colby Chew, Henry Lawless &amp; John Hughes. Each man had a horse and we had two to carry the baggage. I lodged this night at Col. Joshua Fry's, in the Albemarle, which county includes the Chief of the head Branches of James River on the east side of the Blue Ridge. March 7th. We set off about 8, but the day proving wet, we only went to Thomas Joplin's on Rockfish. This is a pretty River, which might at a small expense be made fit for transporting Tobacco; but it has lately been stopped by a Mill Dam near the Mouth to the Prejudice of the upper inhabitants who would at their own expense clear and make it navigable, were they permitted. March 8th. We left Joplin's early. It began to rain about Noon. I left my people at Thomas Jones's and went to the Reverend Mr. Robert Rose's on Tye River. This is about the size of Rockfish, as yet open, but how long the Avarice of Millers will permit it to be so, I know not. At present the Inhabitants enjoy plenty of Fine fish, as Shad in their Season, Carp, Rocks, Fat-Backs which I suppose to be Tench, Perch, Mullets, etc. March 9th. As the weather continues unlikely, I moved only to Baylor Walker's quarters. March 10th. The weather is still cloudy, and leaving my people at the Quarter, I rode to Mr. John Harvies', where I dined and returned to the quarter in the evening. 11th. The Sabbath. March 12th. We crossed the Fluvanna and lodged at Thomas Hunt's. 13th. We went early to William Calloway's and supplied ourselves with Rum, Thread, and other necessaries &amp; from thence took the main wagon Road leading to Wood's or the New River. It is not well cleared or beaten yet, but will be a very good one with proper management. This night we lodged in Adam Beard's low grounds. Beard is an ignorant, impudent, brutish fellow, and would have taken us up, had it not been for a reason easily to be suggested. We went from Beard's to Nicholas Welche's, where we bought corn for our horses, and had some Victual dressed for Breakfast, afterwards we crossed the Blue Ridge. The ascent and descent is so easy that a Stranger would not know when he crossed the Ridge. It began to rain about Noon and continued until night. We lodged at William Armstrong's. Corn is very scarce in these parts. March 15th. We went to the Great Lick* * Now Roanoke. on a Branch of the Staunton &amp; bought corn of Michael Campbell for our Horses. This Lick has been one of the best places for Game in these parts and would have been of much greater advantage to the Inhabitants than it has been if the Hunters had not killed the Buffaloes for diversion, and the Elks and Deer for their skins. This afternoon we got to the Staunton where the Houses of the Inhabitants had been carried off with their grain and Fences by the Fresh last summer, and Lodged at James Robinson's, the only place I could hear of where they had Corn to spare, notwithstanding the land is such that an industrious man might make 100 barrels a share in a seasonable year. March 16th. We kept up the Staunton to William Englishe's. He lives on a small branch, and was not much hurt by the Fresh. He has a Mill, which is the furthest back except one lately built by the Sect of people, who call themselves of the Brotherhood of the Euphrates, (17th) and are commonly called the Duncards, who are the upper inhabitants of the New River, which is about 400 yards wide at this place. They live on the west side and we were obliged to swim our Horses over. The Duncards are an old set of people who make it a matter of religion not to shave their Beards, ly on beds, or eat Flesh, though at present, in the last they transgress, being constrained to it, as they say, by want of a sufficiency of Grain and Roots, they having not long been seated here. I doubt the plenty and deliciousness of the Venison &amp; Turkeys has contributed not a little to this. The unmarried have no private property, but live on a Common Stock. They don't baptize either Young or Old, they keep their Sabbath on Saturday, &amp; hold that all men shall be happy hereafter, but must first pass through punishment according to their Sins. They are very hospitable. March 18. The Sabbath. 19th. We could not find our Horses and spent the day in looking for them. In the evening we found their track. 20th. We went very early to the track of our Horses &amp; after following them six or seven miles, we found them all together. We returned to the Duncards about ten o'clock, and having purchased half a bushel of meal and as much small Hominy we set off and Lodged on a small Run between Peak Creek and Reedy Creek. March 21st. We got to Reedy Creek and Camped near James McCall's.† † Now Max Meadows. I went to his House and Lodged and bought what Bacon I wanted. 22nd. I returned to my People early. We got to a large Spring about five miles below Davis's Bottom on Holston's River and Camped. 23rd. We kept down Holston's River about four miles and Camped; and then Mr. Powell and I went to look for Samuel Stalnaker, who I had been informed was just moved out to settle. We found his Camp, and returned to our own in the Evening. 24th. We went to Stalnaker's, helped him to raise his house and Camped about a quarter of a mile below him. In April 1748, I met the above mentioned Stalnaker between the Reedy Creek Settlement and Holston River, on his way to the Cherokee Indians, and expected him to pilot me as far as he knew but his affairs would not permit him to go with me. March 25th. The Sabbath. Grass is plenty in the low grounds. 26th. We left the Inhabitants, and kept nigh West to a large Spring on a Branch of the North fork of Holston. Thunder, Lightening, and Rain before Day. 27th. It began to Snow on the morning and continued till Noon. The Land is very hilly from West to North. Some Snow lies on the tops of the mountains N. W. from us. 28th. We traveled to the lower end of Giant's Ditch on Reedy Creek. 29th. Our Dogs were very uneasie most of the Night. 30th. We kept down Reedy Creek, and discover'd the tracks of about 20 Indians, that had gone up the Creek between the time we Camped last Night, and set off this Morning. We suppose they made our Dogs so restless last Night. We Camped on Reedy Creek. March 30th. We caught two young Buffaloes one of which we killed, and having cut and marked the other we turn'd him out. 31st. We kept down Reedy Creek to Holston where we measured an Elm 25 feet round 3 feet from the Ground. We saw young Sheldrakes, we went down the River to the North Fork and up the North Fork about a quarter of a mile to a Ford and then crossed it. In the Fork between Holston's and the North River, are five Indian Houses built with loggs and covered with Bark, and there were abundance of Bones, some whole Pots and Pans, some broken and many pieces of mats and Cloth. On the West Side of the North River, is four Indian Houses such as before mentioned, we went four miles Below the North River and Camped on the Bank of Holston's, opposite to a large Indian Fort. April ye 1st. The Sabbath. We saw Perch, Mullets, and Carp in plenty, and caught one of the large Sort of Cat Fish. I marked my Name, the day of the Month, and date of the year on several Beech Trees. 2nd. We left Holston &amp; travelled through small Hills till about Noon, when one of our Horses being choaked by eating Reeds too greedily, we stopped, having travelled seven miles. 3d. Our horse being recover'd, we travelled to the Rocky Ridge. I went up to the top to look for a Pass, but found it so Rocky that I concluded not to attempt it there. This Ridge may be known by Sight at a distance. To the Eastward are many small Mountains, and a Buffalo Road between them and the Ridge. The growth is Pine on the Top and the Rocks look white at a distance. We went Seven miles this day. 4th. We kept under the Rocky Ridge crossing several small Branches to the Head of Holly Creek. We saw many small Licks and plenty of Deer. April 5th. We went down Holly Creek. There is much Holly in the Low Grounds &amp; some Laurel and Ivy. About 3 in the afternoon, the Ridge appeared less stony and we passed it and Camped on a small Branch about a mile from the top. My riding Horse choaked himself this Evening and I drenched him with water to wash down the Reeds, and it answered the End. 6th. It proving wet we did not move. 7th. We rode 8 miles over broken Land. It snowed most of the day. In the Evening our dogs caught a large He Bear, which before we could come up to shoot him had wounded a dog of mine, so that he could not Travel, and we carried him on Horseback, till he recovered. 8th. The Sabbath. Still snow. 9th. We travelled to a river, which I suppose to be that which the hunters Call Clinche's River, from one Clinch a Hunter, who first found it. We marked several Beeches on the East side. We could not find a ford Shallow eneugh to carry our Baggage over on our horses. Ambrose Powell Forded over on one horse, and we drove the others after him. We then made a Raft and carried over one Load of Baggage, but when the Raft was brought back it was so heavy that it would not carry anything more dry. April 10th. We waded and carried the remainder of our Baggage on our shoulders at two turns over the River, which is about one hundred and thirty yards wide. We went on about five miles and Camped on a small Branch. April 11th. Having travelled 5 miles to and over a High Mountain, we came to Turkey Creek, which we kept down 4 miles. It lies between two Ridges of Mountains, that to the Eastward being the highest. 12th. We kept down the Creek 2 miles further, where it meets with a large Branch coming from the South West, and thence runs through the East Ridge making a very good Pass; and a large Buffalo Road goes from that Fork to the Creek over the West Ridge, which we took and found the ascent and descent tolerably easie. From this Mountain we rode four miles to Beargrass River. Small Cedar Trees are very plenty on the flat ground nigh the River, and some Barberry trees on the East side of the River. On the Banks is some Beargrass. We kept up the River two miles. I found some Small pieces of Coal and a great plenty of very good yellow Flint. The water is the most transparent I ever saw. It is about 70 yds. wide. April 13th. We went four miles to a large Creek, which we called Cedar Creek, being a Branch of Bear Grass, and from thence Six miles to Cave Gap, the land being level. On the North side of the Gap is a large Spring, which falls very fast, and just above the Spring is a small Entrance to a large Cave, which the Spring runs through, and there is a constant Stream of Cool air issuing out. The Spring is sufficient to turn a Mill. Just at the foot of the Hill is a Laurel Thicket, and the Spring Water runs through it. On the South side is a plain Indian Road. On the top of the Ridge are Laurel Trees marked with Crosses, others blazed and several Figures on them. As I went down on the other Side, I soon came to some Laurel in the head of a Branch. A Beech stands on the left hand on which I cut my name. This Gap may be seen at a considerable distance, and there is no other that I know of, except one about two miles to the North of it, which does not appear to be so low as the other. The Mountain on the North Side of the Gap is very Steep and Rocky, but on the South Side it is not so. We called it Steep Ridge. At the foot of the hill on the North West Side we came to a Branch, that made a great deal of flat Land. We kept down it 2 miles, Several other Branches coming in to make it a large Creek, and we called it Flat Creek. We camped on the Bank where we found very good Coal. I did not See any Lime Stone beyond this Ridge. We rode 13 miles this day. April 14th. We kept down the Creek 5 miles Chiefly along the Indian Road. 15th. Easter Sunday. Being in bad grounds for our Horses we moved 7 miles along the Indian Road, to Clover Creek. Clover and Hop Vines are plenty here. April 16th. Rai(n). I made a pair of Indian Shoes, those I brought out being bad. 17th. Still rain. I went down the Creek a hunting and found that it went into a River about a mile below our Camp. This, which is Flat Creek and some others joined, I called Cumberland River. 18th. Still Cloudy. We kept down the Creek to the River along the Indian Road to where it crosses. Indians lived about this Ford Some years ago. We kept on down the South Side. After riding 5 miles from our Camp, we left the River, it being very crooked. In riding 3 miles we came on it again. It is about 60 or 70 yards wide. We rode 8 (?) miles this day. 19th. We left the River but in four miles we came on it again at the Mouth of Licking Creek, which we went up and down another. In the Fork of Licking Creek is a Lick much used by Buffaloes and many large Roads lead to it. This afternoon Ambrose Powell was bit by a Bear in his Knee. We rode 7 miles this day. 20th. We kept down the Creek 2 miles to the River again. It appears not any wider here than at the mouth of Clover Creek, but much deeper. I thought it proper to cross the River and began a bark Canoe. April 21st. We finished the Canoe and tryed her. About noon it began to thunder, lighten, hail and rain prodigiously and continued about 2 hours. 22nd. The Sabbath. One of the horses was found unable to walk this morning. I then propos'd that with 2 of the Company I would proceed, and the other three should Continue here till our return, which was agreed to and Lots were drawn to determine who should go, they all being desirous of it. Ambrose Powell and Colby Chew were the fortunate Persons. 23rd. Having carried our Baggage over in the bark Canoe and Swum our horses, we all crossed the River. Then Ambrose Powell, Colby Chew and I departed. Leaving the others to provide and salt some Bear, build an house, and plant some Peach Stones and Corn. We travelled about 12 miles and encamped on Crooked Creek. The mountains are very small hereabouts and here is a great deal of flat Land. We got through the Coal to-day. April 24th. We kept on Westerly 18 miles, got Clear of the mountains and found the Land poor and the woods very Thick beyond them, and Laurel &amp; Ivy in and near the Branches. Our Horses suffered very much here for want of food. This day we Came on the fresh Track of 7 or 8 Indians, but could not overtake them. 25th. We kept on West 5 miles, the Land continuing much the Same, the Laurel rather growing worse, and the food scarcer. I got up a tree on a Ridge and saw the Growth of the Land much the same as Far as my Sight could reach. I then concluded to return to the rest of my Company. I kept on my track 1 mile then turn'd Southerly &amp; went to Cumberland River at the mouth of a water Course, that I named Rocky Creek. 26th. The River is 150 yards wide and appears to be navigable from this place almost to the mouth of Clover Creek. Rocky Creek runs within 40 yards of the River Bank then turns off, and runs up the River, surrounding about 25 acres of Land before it falls into the River. The Banks of the River and Creek are a sufficient Fence almost all the way. On the Lower Side of the mouth of the Creek is an Ash marked T. W., a Red Oak A. P., a white Hickory C. C., besides several Trees blazed Several ways with 3 Chops over each blaze. We went up the North Side of the River 8 miles, and Camped on a Small Branch. A Bear Broke one of my Dogs forelegs. April 27th. We crossed Indian Creek and went down Meadow Creek to the River. There Comes in another from the Southward as big as this we are on. Below the mouth of this Creek and above the mouth are the remains of Several Indian Cabins and amongst them a round Hill made by Art about 20 feet high and 60 over the Top. We went up the River, and Camped on the Bank. 28th. We kept up the River to our Company whom we found all well, but the lame Horse was as bad as we left him, and another had been bit in the Nose by a Snake. I rub'd the wounds with Bear's oil, and gave him a drench of the same and another of the decoction of Rattle Snake root some time after. The People I left had built a House 12 by 8, cleared and broke up some ground &amp; planted Corn and Peach Stones. They also had killed several Bears and cured the meat. This day Colby Chew and his Horse fell down the Bank. I bled and gave him Volatile drops, &amp; he soon recovered. April 29th. The Sabbath. The bitten Horse is better. 3 quarters of a mile below the House is a Pond in the Low Ground of the River, a Quarter of a mile in Length and 200 yds. wide much frequented by Fowl. 30th. I blazed a way from our House to the River. On the other side of the River is a large Elm cut down and barked about 20 feet and another standing just by it with the bark cut around at the root and about 15 feet above. About 200 yards below this is a white Hickory Barked about 15 feet. The depth of water here, when the lowest that I have seen it, is about 7 or 8 feet, the Bottom of the River Sandy, ye Banks very high, &amp; the Current very slow. The bitten Horse being much mended, we set off and left the lame one. He is white, branded on the near Buttock with a swivil Stirrup Iron, and is old. We left the River and having Crossed Several Hills and Branches, Camped in a Valley North from the House. May 1st. Another Horse being bit, I applyed Bear's Oil as before mentioned. We got to Powell's River in the afternoon and went down it along an Indian Road, much frequented, to the mouth of a Creek on the West side of the River, where we camped. The Indian Road goes up the Creek, and I think it is that Which goes through Cave Gap. 2nd. We kept down the River. At the mouth of a Creek that comes in on the East side is a Lick, and I believe there was a hundred Buffaloes at it. About 2 o'clock we had a Shower of rain. We camped on the River, which is very crooked. May 3rd. We crossed a narrow Neck of Land, came on the River again and kept down it to an Indian Camp, that had been built this Spring, and in it we took up our Quarters. It began to rain about Noon and continued until Night. 4th. We crossed a narrow Neck of Land and came on the River again, which we kept down till it turn'd to the Westward, we then left it, and went up a Creek, which we Called Colby's Creek. The River is about 50 yards over where we left it. 5th. We got to Tomlison's River, which is about the size of Powell's River, and I cut my name on a Beech, that stands on the North Side of the River. Here is plenty of Coal in the South Bank opposite to our Camp. 6th. The Sabbath. I saw Goslings, which shows that Wild Geese stay here all the year. Ambrose Powell had the misfortune to sprain his well knee. 7th. We went down Tomlison's River the Land being very broken and our way embarrassed by trees, that had been blown down about 2 years ago. May 8th. We went up a Creek on the North Side of the River. 9th. We got to Lawlesse's River which is much like the others. The Mountains here are very Steep and on Some of them there is Laurel and Ivy. The tops of the Mountains are very Rocky and some part of the Rocks seem to be composed of Shells, Nuts and many other Substances petrified and cemented together with a kind of Flint. We left the River and after travelling some Miles we got among Trees that had been blown down about 2 years, and were obliged to go down a Creek to the River again, the Small Branches and Mountains being impassable. 10th. We Staid on the River, and dressed an Elk skin to make Indian Shoes—most of ours being quite worn out. 11th. We left the River, found the Mountains very bad, and got to a Rock by the side of a Creek sufficient to shelter 200 men from Rain. Finding it so convenient, we concluded to stay and put our Elk skin in order for shoes and make them. 12th. Under the Rock is a Soft Kind of Stone almost like Alum in taste; below it a Layer of Coal about 12 inches thick and white Clay under that. I called the Run Alum Creek. I have observed several mornings past, that the Trees begin to drip just before day &amp; continue dripping till about Sun rise, as if it rain'd slowly. We had some rain this day. 13th. The Sabbath. 14th. When our Elk Skin was prepared we had lost every Awl that we had brought out, and I made one with the Shank of an old Fishing hook, the other People made two of Horse Shoe Nailes, and with these we made our Shoes or Moccosons. We wrote several of our Names with Coal under the Rock, &amp; I wrote our names, the time of our comeing and leaving this place on paper and stuck it in to the Rock with Mortar, and then set off. We Crossed Hughes's River and Lay on a large Branch of it. There is no dew this morning but a shower of Rain about 6 oclock. The River is about 50 yards wide. May 15th. Laurel and Ivy increase upon us as we go up the Branch. About noon it began to rain &amp; we took up our Quarters in a Valley between very Steep Hills. 16th. We crossed Several Ridges and Branches. About two in the afternoon, I was taken with a Violent Pain in my Hip. 17th. Laurel and Ivy are very plentiful and the Hills still very steep. The Woods have been burnt some years past, and are now very thick, the Timber being almost all kill'd. We Camped on a Branch of Naked Creek. The pain in my Hip is something asswaged. 18th. We went up Naked Creek to the head and had a plain Buffalo Road most of the way. From thence we proceeded down Wolf Creek and on it we Camped. 19th. We kept down ye Creek to Hunting Creek, which we crossed and left. It rained most of the afternoon. May 20th. The Sabbath. It began to Rain about Noon and continued till next day. 21st. Left off raining about 8. We crossed several Ridges and Small Branches &amp; Camped on a Branch of Hunting Creek. In the Evening it rained very hard. 22nd. We went down the Branch to Hunting Creek &amp; kept it to Milley's River. 23rd. We attempted to go down the River but could not. We then Crossed Hunting Creek and attempted to go up the River but could not. It being very deep we began a Bark Canoe. The River is about 90 or 100 yards wide. I blazed several Trees in the Fork and marked T. W. on a Sycamore Tree 40 feet around. It has a large Hole on the N: W: side about 20 feet from the Ground and is divided into 3 Branches just by the hole, and it stands about 80 yards above the mouth of Hunting Creek. May 24th. We finished the Canoe and crossed the River about noon, and I marked a Sycamore 30 feet round and several Beeches on the North side of the River opposite to the mouth of the Creek. Game is very scarce hereabouts. 25th. It began to rain before day and continued till about noon. We travelled about 4 miles on a Ridge and Camped on a small Branch. 26th. We kept down the Branch almost to the River, and up a Creek, and then along a Ridge till our Dogs roused a large Buck Elk, Which we followed down to a Creek. He killed Ambrose Powell's Dog in the Chase, and we named the Run Tumbler's Creek, the Dog being of that Name. 27th. The Sabbath. 28th. Cloudy. We could not get our Horses till almost Night, when we went down the Branch. We lay on to the main Creek, and turn'd up it. May 29th. We proceeded up the Creek 7 miles, and then took a North Branch &amp; went up it five miles and then encamped on it. 30th. We went to the head of the Branch we lay on 12 miles. A shower of Rain fell this day. The Woods are burnt fresh about here and are the only fresh burnt Woods we have seen these Six Weeks. 31st. We crossed 2 Mountains and Camped just by a Wolf's Den. They were very impudent and after they had been twice shot at, they kept howling about the Camp. It rained till Noon this day. June ye 1st. We found the Wolf's Den and caught 4 of the young ones. It rained this morning. We went up a Creek, crossed a mountain and went through a Gap, and then, camped on the head of A Branch. 2nd. We went down the Branch to a River 70 yards wide, which I called Frederick's River. We kept up it a half a mile to a Ford, where we crossed and proceeded upon the North Side 3 miles. It rained most of the afternoon. Elks are very plenty on this River. June 3rd. Whit-Sunday. It rained most of the day. 4th. I blazed several trees four ways on the outside of the low Grounds by a Buffalo Road, and marked my Name on several Beech Trees. Also I marked some by the River side just below a "mossing" place with an Island in it. We left the River about 10 o'clock &amp; got to Falling Creek, and went up it till 5 in the afternoon, when a very black Cloud appearing, we turn'd out our Horses, got tent Poles up, and were just stretching a Tent, when it began to rain and hail, and was succeeded by a violent Wind which Blew down our Tent &amp; a great many Trees about it, several large ones within 30 yds. of the Tent. We all left the place in confusion and ran different ways for shelter. After the Storm was over, we met at the Tent, and found all safe. 5th. There was a violent Shower of Rain before day. This morning we went up the Creek about 3 miles, and then were obliged to leave it, the Timber being so blown down that we could not get through. After we left the Creek we kept on a Ridge 4 miles, then turned down to the head of a Branch, and it began to rain and continued raining very hard till Night. June 6th. We went down the Branch till it became a large Creek. It runs very Swift, falling more than any of the Branches we have been on of late. I called it Rapid Creek. After we had gone 8 miles we could not ford, and we Camped in the low Ground. There is great sign of Indians on this Creek. 7th. The Creek being fordable, we Crossed it &amp; kept down 12 miles to a River about 100 yards over, which we called Louisa River. The Creek is about 30 yards wide, &amp; part of ye River breaks into ye Creek—making an Island on which we Camped. 8th. The River is so deep we cannot ford it and as it is falling we concluded to stay and hunt. In the afternoon, Mr. Powell and my Self was a hunting about a mile &amp; a half from the Camp, and heard a gun just below us on the other side of the River, and as none of our People could cross, I was in hopes of getting some direction from the Person, but could not find him. June 9th. We crossed the River &amp; went down it to the mouth of a Creek &amp; up the Creek to the head and over a Ridge into a Steep Valley and Camped. 10th. Trinity Sunday. Being in very bad ground for our Horses, we concluded to move. We were very much hindered by the Trees, that were blown down on Monday last. We Camped on a Small Branch. 11th. It rained violently in the Latter part of the Night &amp; till 9 o'Clock. The Branch is impassable at present. We lost a Tomahawk and a Cann by the Flood. 12th. The Water being low we went down the Branch to a large Creek, &amp; up the Creek. Many of the trees in the Branches are Wash'd up by the Roots and others barked by the old trees, that went down ye Stream. The Roots in the Bottom of the Runs are Barked by the Stones. June 13th. We are very much hindered by the Gust &amp; a shower of Rain about Noon. Game is very scarce here, and the mountains very bad, the tops of the Ridges being so covered with Ivy and the sides so steep and stony that we were obliged to cut our way through with our Tomahawks. 14th. The Woods are still bad and Game scarce. It rained to-day about Noon &amp; we Camped on the top of A Ridge. 15th-16th. We got on a large Creek where Turkey are plenty and some Elks. We went a hunting &amp; killed 3 Turkeys. Hunted &amp; killed 3 Bears &amp; some Turkeys. 17th. The Sabbath. We killed a large Buck Elk. 18th. Having prepared a good stock of Meat, we left the Creek crossing several Branches and Ridges. The Woods still continuing bad the weather hot &amp; our Horses so far spent, that we are all obliged to walk. June 19th. We got to Laurel Creek early this morning, and met so impudent a Bull Buffalo that we were obliged to shoot him, or he would have been amongst us. We then went up the Creek six miles, thence up a North Branch of it to the Head, and attempted to cross a mountain, but it proved so high and difficult, that we were obliged to Camp on the side of it. This Ridge is nigh the eastern edge of the Coal Land. 20th. We got to the top of the Mountain and Could discover a flat to the South &amp; South East. We went down from the Ridge to a Branch and down the Branch to Laurel Creek not far from where we left it yesterday &amp; Camped. My riding Horse was bit by a Snake this day, and having no Bear's Oil I rub'd the place with a piece of fat meat, which had the desired effect. 21st. We found the Level Nigh the Creek so Full of laurel that we were obliged to go up a Small Branch, and from the head of that to the Creek again, and found it good travelling a Small distance from the Creek. We Camped on the Creek. Deer are very scarce on the Coal Land. I have seen but 4 since the 30th of April. June 22nd. We kept up to the head of the Creek, and the Land being Leveller than we have lately seen, and here are some large Savanna's. Many of the Branches are full of Laurel and Ivy. Deer and Bears are plenty. 23rd. Land continues level with Laurel and Ivy &amp; we got to a large Creek with very high &amp; steep Banks full of Rocks which I called Clifty Creek, the Rocks are 100 feet perpendicular in some Places. 24th. The Sabbath. 25th. We Crossed Clifty Creek. Here is a little Coal and the Land still flat. 26th. We crossed a Creek that we called Dismal Creek, the Banks being the worst and the Laurel the thickest I have seen. The Land is Mountainous on the East Side of the Dismal Creek, and the Laurels end in a few miles. We Camped on a Small Branch. June 27th. The Land is very high &amp; we crossed several Ridges and camped on a small Branch. It rained about Noon and continued till the next day. 28th. It continued raining till Noon, and we set off as soon as it ceased and went down the Branch we lay on to the New River just below the mouth of Green Bryer. Powell, Tomlison and myself stripped, and went into the New River to try if we could wade over at any place. After some time having found a place we returned to the others and took such things as would take damage by water on our Shoulders, and waded over Leading our Horses. The bottom is very uneven, the Rocks very slippery and the Current very Strong most of the way. We Camped in the Low Ground opposite to the mouth of Green Bryer. 29th. We kept up Green Bryer. It being a wet day we went only 2 miles, and Camped on the North Side. June 30th. We went 7 miles up the River, which is very crooked. July ye 1st. The Sabbath. Our Salt being almost spent We travelled 10 miles, sometimes on the River and at other times some distance from it. 2nd. We kept up the River the chief part of the day and we travelled about 10 miles. 3rd. We went up the River 10 miles to-day. 4th. We went up the River 10 miles through very bad Woods. 5th. The way growing worse we travelled 9 miles only. 6th. We left the River. The low grounds on it are of very little Value, but on the Branches are very good, and there is a great deal of it, and the high land is very good in many places. We got on a large Creek called Anthony's Creek, which affords a great deal of Very good Land, and it is chiefly bought. We kept up the creek 4 miles and Camped. This Creek took its Name from an Indian, called John Anthony, that frequently hunts in these Woods. There are some inhabitants on the Branches of Green Bryer, but we missed their Plantations. July 7th. We kept up the Creek, and about Noon 5 men overtook us and inform'd us we were only 8 miles from the inhabitants on a Branch of James River called Jackson's River. We exchanged some Tallow for Meal and parted. We Camped on a Creek nigh the top of Alleghany Ridge, which we named Ragged Creek. 8th. Having Shaved, Shifted, &amp; made new Shoes, we left our useless Raggs at ye Camp &amp; got to Walker Johnston's about Noon. We moved over to Robert Armstrong's in the Afternoon &amp; staid there all Night. The People here are very hospitable and would be better able to support Travellers was it not for the great number of Indian Warriors, that frequently take what they want from them, much to their prejudice. July 9th. We went to the hot Springs and found Six Invalids there. The Spring Water is very Clear &amp; warmer than new Milk, and there is a spring of cold Water within 20 feet of the Warm one. I left one of my Company this day. 10th. Having a Path we rode 20 miles &amp; lodged at Captain Jemyson's below the Panther Gap. Two of my Company went to a Smith to get their Horses Shod. 11th. Our Way Mending, We travelled 30 miles to Augusta Court House, where I found Mr. Andrew Johnston, the first of my acquaintance I had seen since the 26th day of March. 12th. Mr. Johnston lent me a fresh Horse and sent my Horses to Mr. David Steward's, who was so kind as to give them Pasturage. About 8 o'clock I set off leaving all my Company. It began to rain about 2 in the Afternoon &amp; I lodged at Capt. David Lewis's, about 34 miles from Augusta Court House. 13th. I got home about Noon. We killed on the Journey 13 Buffaloes, 8 Elks, 53 Bears, 20 Deer, 4 Wild Geese, about 150 Turkeys, besides small Game. We might have killed three times as much meat if we had wanted it.</field>
