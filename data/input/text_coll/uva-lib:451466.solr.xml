      <field name="fulltext">ORIGIN AND DIFFUSION OF MONASTIC LIFE IN LATE ANTIQUITY AND THE EARLY MIDDLE AGES, 4TH-9TH CENTURIES Western monachism is rooted in an esoteric religious counter culture that emerged at the outer fringes of Roman society in the sere fastness of the Nitrian desert and the Thebaid of Egypt. It was the creation of religious fanatics who, by severing their ties with the secular world, immersing themselves in meditation, prolonged fasting, severe deprivation, and self-mortification, sought mystical union with God. Out of a society engaged in a last heroic struggle to regroup strength by adopting a new religion, monachism spread by word of mouth, then through writings of the Fathers, finally to gain the momentum of wildfire and sweep the whole length of the Roman empire in two bold arcs: one swung north through Palestine, Syria, and Anatolia beyond the outermost boundaries of the Roman world into Babylon, Arabia, Armenia, Persia; the other, following a path of even more astonishing expansion across the Mediterranean into Italy and Gaul, then raced to the empire's farthest northwestern borders, the Celtic territories of Ireland and Scotland. In these lands, never entered by Roman legions, monachism dramatically reversed its course and redescended upon the Continent to play a decisive role in the internal reconstraction and territorial expansion of the Christian church in lands now held by the Barbarian conquerors of Rome. All this occurred in only 250 years—as if on the apron of a vast, dark stage where the lineaments of a new world order were dimly beginning to appear. The map shows, within this emerging world, the growth and diffusion of a new, Romanized monachism enunciated in the Regula Benedicti and propagated by the Papal See in close alliance with the house of the Carolingian rulers. Differences between the two polar forms of pre-Carolingian monachism—those of Saints Anthony and Benedict—are described on pp. 327ff. Historically they are separated by a series of intermediary forms, in the development of which Egyptians, Anatolians, Romans from Italy, the provinces of Gaul, Pannonia, Scythia, and even Celts, played decisive roles. prologue to part IV THE MONASTIC POLITY ORIGIN AND DIFFUSION OF CHRISTIAN MONACHISM IN EGYPT, THE NEAR EAST AND EUROPE IN LATE ANTIQUITY AND THE EARLY MIDDLE AGES, 4TH-9TH CENTURIES St. Anthony considered the anchorite's solitary asceticism the highest form of monastic devotion. He spent most of his life in total seclusion, emerging from desert retreats only briefly, to comfort imprisoned Christians or organize the life of the many monks who followed his example. Anthony's followers, Ammun and Macarius, allowed groups of hermits to live close to one another for instruction and common prayer, which led to establishment of clusters of cells scattered around a common center containing a church, and in its later, more developed form, even a refectory and bakery. St. Pachomius considered organized monastic life preferable to that of the anchorite because only in communities could the weaker find support from stronger members, and the community as a whole attain a solid economic basis. St. Basil went a step further, declaring the communal life superior on both theoretical and practical grounds: seclusion, he argued, mitigated against the apostolic law of charity and further, faults of selfishness and pride could not be corrected unless observed by others. In 339 St. Athanasius introduced anchoritic monachism to Italy, making it known worldwide through his Life of St. Anthony. Jerome did the same for coenobitic monachism through his Latin translation of the Rule of Pachomius (386/7). In 364 St. Martin founded in Ligugé, Aquitaine, the first monastery of Roman Gaul, followed by many others, primarily coenobitic, all south and southwest of the Loire—the majority filiations of Marmoutier. Lerins, founded by Honoratus in 410, adopted the ideal of group hermitism. St. John Cassian, founder of the abbey of St. Victor of Marseilles, in 415, saw eremetic life as a heroic ideal but in practice provided guidance for establishment of coenobitic communities. All these forms spread north along the Rhone Valley from Lerins and Marseilles. Monastic life there profited from the fact that Provence had become a haven for Gallo-Roman aristocrats who, anticipating the Germanic invasions, had retreated from estates in the threatened northern parts of Gaul, after the seat of the government had been withdrawn from Trier to Milan in 395, and who, as the secular world collapsed, quickly recognized that they could retain social status by becoming leaders in the episcopal church. St. Patrick, trained in Lerins-oriented Auxerre, took Egyptian style eremetism to Ireland in 432. By 563 St. Columba had founded Iona in the Hebrides as a center of conversion for Scotland; in 653 St. Aidan established the famous monastery of Lindisfarne off the Northumbrian coast. In those 200-odd years, some Irish inland monasteries became great centers of learning with scriptoria that produced some of the finest works of medieval book illumination. But in most places along the Irish coast and windswept offshore islands, monks either lived in isolation, or in groups of twelve under an abbot, each residing in his own beehive hut, sallying forth by land or sea, "tramping the heather all day, to preach by the burnside at evening." St. Columban carried his mission into Gaul with a step of epochal importance: he addressed himself immediately to the court of Sigibert, thus binding his missionary activities to the Frankish power structure. Equally important, he created a new monachism combining his native Irish with Benedictine custom. The abbey of Luxeuil, ceded to Columban by Childebert, became a primary point of radiation for this mixed rule in the Frankish kingdom and along its eastern borders, also spreading through intimate alliance with Frankish aristocracy. At the time of Columban's death in 615, in Bobbio, every known variety of monachism was practiced in Europe, including the slowly advancing Benedictine form. Its ascent and diffusion, accompanying a concerted effort to reform and unify the secular Church, was the accomplishment of no more than a half-dozen men working in close co-operation with the Papal See and fully supported by secular rulers in England and on the Continent. Dispatched by Gregory the Great to "convert the Angles into Angels," St. Augustine landed in 597 on Thanet Island, Kent, and established at Canterbury the first Benedictine monastery outside Italy. His successors carried the mission into northern England. Foremost among these was Benedict Biscop who, between 665-672, founded Monkwearmouth and Jarrow, the bases of conversion for Scotland. The advance to the north was strengthened when the Synod of Whitby in 644 declared for the Benedictine mission. From northernmost England—in a reversal of course as radical as that which Irish monachism had experienced under Columban—the movement struck back upon the Continent, south and southeast, bypassing and encircling the Frankish crown lands (yet supported by their rulers) and pressing west against them from strong positions in the semi-heathen borderlands of Frisia, Hesse, Thuringia, and Bavaria. The main protagonists in this mission were the two Anglo-Saxons, Willibroad († 739) and Winfrid, called Bonifatius, both issuing from York—the latter, between 770-790, unquestionably the most powerful churchman east of the Rhine. West of the Rhine the reform advanced mainly by synodal action, in the framing of which, besides Bonifatius, the bishop Chrodegang of Metz and Fulrad of St. Denis played decisive roles. By the century's end, the Benedictine conquest was so complete that all other rules had virtually sunk into oblivion. Benedict's Rule prevailed because only it could spin the thread that would weave the spiritual and administrative fabric of Church and State into a whole cloth, engendering a dialectical interaction that was to rubricate the entire course of Western history. The inner dynamics of this process and its cultural implications are discussed in the next chapter, "The Monastic Polity."

      <field name="fulltext">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS For more than 40 years the art and architecture of the Middle Ages has fascinated me. In all that time, no other architectural testament has so thoroughly compelled my attention as that Carolingian plan for a monastic settlement, the parchment known as the Plan of St. Gall, to the study of which these books are devoted. Ernest Born and I have worked on this project intermittently since the Council of Europe exhibition Karl der Grosse, held in Aachen in 1965. But despite long familiarity, when I enter my study in the morning, my eye falling upon a facsimile Plan hanging there, it arouses the same intellectual stirrings and aesthetic engulfment I experienced when as a student, I viewed the Plan for the first time in the presence of my teacher, Erwin Panofsky. The Plan of St. Gall gathers as in a lens an image of the whole of Carolingian life. Product of the first synthetic encounter between Antiquity and the new civilization of the Barbarian north, it testifies the first pervasive alliance between Church and State in this nascent world, and the first successful integration into the fabric of the State, as a force at once spiritual, educational, and economic, of the ideal of monasticism which in Antiquity had taken its start as a counter culture. The men who conceived the Plan were of the intellectual elite of their time; they would have held striking presence among sagacious men of any age. They were expert in every facet of that microcosm of life compacted by history within the walls of a monastic enclosure: its spiritual and devotional aspirations, its educational endeavors, its medical and sanitary services, its industrial and technological facilities. Administrative and economic managers, they were accomplished in agriculture, viticulture, animal husbandry. Associated with them were the greatest scholars, illuminators, and metal workers of the time. The makers of the Plan possessed consummate skill in architectural planning. They designed in a plot only 480 by 640 feet a self-sustaining community for some 270 souls. Each structure is scaled to a specific use, all are sited in relation to one another and to the whole so as to insure proximity among related and distance between disparate functions—a settlement of urban complexity, clustered around the imposing bulk of a basilica that, had it ever been built as conceived, would have been the most outstanding church of the Age of Charlemagne. It is to these men, anonymous as they are and separated from us by a span exceeding a millennium, that we express our deepest gratitude. They have enriched our lives by offering across the centuries the exhilarating historical experience of participating in retrospect in one of the keenest acts of Western architectural planning. With their work they have held us spellbound and in the course of time have become a part of us. The co-author of this book is a modern descendant of such fiber of man. Ernest Born's share in this project appears on every page of it. Without him the books could have been written neither in a technical nor a substantive sense. It is easy to acknowledge his contribution where the boundaries of our tasks are clearly marked, but nearly impossible to separate the roots of authorship in countless instances when intellectual interaction led to changes in our common thinking. He has embodied the abstractions of our research in drawings at the scale of the original Plan, then given them new life in a distinguished book design. He has illustrated the Plan's guest and service buildings in ground plans and drawings of great strength and elegance that are precise enough to be translated into accurately scaled models. Ernest Born has applied to the making of these books all the skills of his rich professional career—architect, designer, draftsman. Those privileged to work next to him are indebted to his penetration, strength, and total inability to compromise quality in treating even the smallest of innumerable details. The remarkable abilities of Carl Bertil Lund, long an associate of Ernest Born, became an invaluable resource in illustrating these books. His skill in preparing layouts for perspectives of great pictorial quality, an almost mysterious gift, Lund inherited from his teacher Otto Eggers—in his era an architectural draftsman without peer, an architect, and chief of design to architect John Russell Pope. The full measure of Lund's work will be seen in the new models of the buildings of the Plan, which he has been commissioned to construct for an exhibition sponsored by the University Art Museum, Berkeley, and the Pro Helvetia Foundation, Zurich. Contributions of two other collaborators, Charles W. Jones and A. Hunter Dupree—Jones with a translation of that landmark in the history of Western economics, Adalhard's "Customs of Corbie;" Dupree with an essay on the Plan's relevance to the history of Western measurement—speak for themselves and are more fully described in their introductions, in Volume III. Not so visible are benefits accruing to the project through Charles W. Jones's vast knowledge of patristic and early medieval literature. Impelled by friendship and our common deep and binding devotion to the past, he corrected and enriched the text, proofread all the galleys, and in particular made a garland of virtue from the thorns of the Glossary, which appears in Volume III. We are most particularly indebted to Msgr. Dr. Johannes Duft, head of the Stiftsbibliothek, St. Gall, and thus official guardian of the original Plan, and to the late Hans Bessler. Both were prime movers in efforts culminating in publication, in 1952, of the eight-color facsimile print of the Plan of St. Gall, which made it available for mensuration studies with precision instruments, the use of which could not be risked on the original parchment. Dr. Duft then permitted us, in a ten-day study of the original, to check whatever theories could be developed from prior use of the facsimile. The Löpfe-Benz facsimile has been of crucial importance in developing color illustrations of parts of the Plan. Other fine photographs and negatives of the Plan exist, but none adaptable for use here. At last after many trials and much suspense, master printer Charles Wood, using all the technology modern photolithography could muster, proved that through the facsimile we could achieve illustrations adequate to justify publishing these books. Wolfgang Braunfels gave the motivating impetus to this work when he asked us to furnish drawings for a three-dimensional model of the buildings of the Plan for display at the exhibition Karl der Grosse, and to offer, in connection with that project, a summary of current knowledge about the Plan of St. Gall. We could comply with the first, but not the second request because of the complexity of historical problems raised by the Plan, its broad cultural ramifications, and the highly controversial nature of many questions involved. But that invitation represented the challenge from which issued the concept and eventual completion of this work. The planning and execution of a study of this scope was not the work of a night's reflection. If the narrative of the books' making at times took on sagalike dimensions, their auspicious completion owes to the efforts of many over the years. We were fortunate in having the advice and guidance of Irene Gordon to help establish editorial style for the text at an early state. Lorna Price has carried the principal burden and prime responsibilities for editing these books. To applaud her handling of endless, taxing editorial minutiæ throughout 1200-odd manuscript pages would be an easy task. But few words are strong enough to express thanks for clarifications she brought to the project through her sharpness of mind, ability to ferret out shortcomings in both style and logic, and her freshness, speed, and spontaneity in treating them. In the best Benedictine tradition she performed her task as corrector "gently" (leniter; cf. p. 275, below). In a discipline continuously enriched by successive generations of scholars, it is appropriate to thank men whose work had a profound impact on my own intellectual formation: my teachers, Erwin Panofsky and Charles de Tolnay. Their influence has pervaded my entire life. And there are others, colleagues to whom I am indebted in this broader sense of shared learning: Kenneth John Conant, George Forsyth, François Ganshoff, Richard Krautheimer, and my friends Jean Bony, Wolfgang Lotz, Carl Nordenfalk, and Lynn White. Leo Hugot lent his own drawings for use in our analysis of the grounds of the Palace Chapel, Aachen; Friedrich Prinz freely offered his expertise in developing the map on p. vi; H. R. Sennhauser has provided information from his work on the Carolingian foundations of the present church of St. Gall. I have benefitted greatly through the friendship of F. W. B. Charles, with whom I have cooperated in other studies of vernacular architecture; likewise from the vast knowledge J. T. Smith has brought to that subject during many years of devoted service in the Royal Commission of Historical Monuments of England. For their unflagging labors in these vineyards we thank the Trustees of the British Museum, and the Bodleian Library, and their staffs, as well as the Bibliothèque Nationale, the Gabinetto Fotographico Nationale, the Musées Royaux d'Art et d'Histoire, Brussels, and the Musée d'Histoire et d'Art, Luxembourg. Other archives and individuals, too many to list here, are acknowledged at illustrations throughout the books. Substantial contributions toward the production of these books have come from several sources. As long ago as 1960, two Guggenheim grants made it possible for us to study and survey surviving medieval buildings related to the Plan's guest and service buildings in the context of another study interrupted by our work on this one. The Samuel H. Kress Foundation has provided extraordinarily generous support that directly aided in making these volumes exemplars of fine bookmaking. We thank Mary Davis, Executive Vice President of the Kress Foundation, for the many times we called on her for support of less material nature, when she responded with vigor, warmth, and faith. The Pro Helvetia Foundation of Switzerland has offered, for the expressed purpose of making this work available to a broader range of scholars and institutions, a subsidy intended to reduce the cost of this publication, as well as a substantial grant and a pledge to sponsor the travelling exhibition of the new model of the buildings of the Plan of St. Gall. We are grateful in particular to Luc Boissonnas, Director, Pro Helvetia Foundation, and to our friends Florenz Deuchler and Christoph Eggenberger for their encouragement and support. Other generous donors are acknowledged on page ii. We thank Glen H. Grant, Assistant to the Chancellor, and Albert Bowker, Chancellor, University of California, Berkeley, for their assistance in working out details associated with funding the three volumes; and William J. McClung, University of California Press, for his sagacity and imagination. Much remains to be said of the men and women backstage who, with their specialized knowledge and skills, entered the intricate process by which a typewritten manuscript is transformed into the book the reader holds. Acknowledgement of their share in making these books will be given in a colophon by Ernest Born, at the end of Volume III. We hope that each one who has been drawn to participate has left the work feeling in some measure enriched by it, as we do ourselves. The insight the Plan of St. Gall affords into every segment of the culture and history of its age is inexhaustible, and will preclude, I hope, that any reviewer refer to this book as a final, definitive treatment of the subject. I would then consider my efforts to have failed —failed to generate ideas worthy of controversy, failed to transmit a sense of the timeless complexities and vast cultural ramifications of this extraordinary document.

      <field name="fulltext">FOREWORD BY WOLFGANG BRAUNFELS THIS BOOK, the fruit of research that placed a heavy burden of work upon its author for over two decades, is ultimately the result of a lucky encounter at the right hour. During preliminary planning discussions held in the home of the editor of the Aachener Kunstblätter, and concerned with the structure and content of the Council of Europe exhibition "Karl der Grosse," the desire arose for a new model based on the Plan of St. Gall, which would transpose into three-dimensional reality the numerous discoveries and findings made by scholars from various countries since the first model was constructed in 1877. The realization of this project was made possible by the co-operation of three men whose personalities, experience, and skills complemented one another in the most fortuitous manner: Walter Horn, to whom this assignment brought the challenging opportunity to sharpen the detail and broaden the scope of his work on the Plan of St. Gall; Ernest Born, the architect and designer, who rendered these findings in drawings of admirable accuracy and beauty; and Siegfried Karschunke,* * Karschunke died, as the authors learned with sorrow, in the fall of 1972, still a young man. At the time of his death he was under contract to build and was engaged in making a model similar to the one made for the Council of Europe Exhibition at Aachen in 1965, this time for the University of California at Berkeley. the great craftsman whose acquaintance I made by a stroke of luck, and who, with the loving care of an artist inspired by his task, undertook to rebuild the manifold shapes in wood, half-timber, and lead. Never, from the very outset, had it been our intent to confine the plans for 1965 to the exhibition alone. We were convinced that the lifework and impact upon history of so multifaceted and powerful a personality as Charlemagne's could not be done justice solely by an exhibition. From this awareness emerged the plan to augment the exhibition with a scholarly work of four volumes to be published simultaneously, which would offer to some eighty specialists an opportunity to illuminate Charlemagne's accomplishments from every conceivable perspective. It was in this context that I turned to Walter Horn with a request to contribute to our plans with a summary of his studies on the Plan of St. Gall. In the ensuing negotiations it became clear that the range of his thoughts and findings would far exceed the framework of our publications. An alternative plan, namely that of publishing his findings on the Plan of St. Gall in a separate volume simultaneously with the exhibit had to be abandoned for reasons of timing, because of the complexities involved in this work. At that time Walter Horn was still engrossed in highly specialized studies in the field of medieval timber architecture, as an essential prerequisite to the completion of his work on the Plan of St. Gall. The delay turned out to be a blessing, for in its present form, The Plan of St. Gall stands as a comprehensive monograph. Not only does the author exhibit a sovereign command of all the architectural problems but he has interpreted the Plan in the context of the manorial, economic, intellectual, and spiritual life of the period. His book is an exposition both of an architectural master plan and of a segment of fundamental cultural history, seen in the context of medieval life as a whole. The Plan of St. Gall is indebted in more than one way to the cultural program of the Court of Aachen and the monastic policy of Charlemagne and Louis the Pious. Reflected in it is one of the essential traits in Charlemagne's personality: his desire for order, unity, perfection. A number of monasteries sponsored by Charlemagne flourished in the empire, and many others were founded during his long reign. On his death, these monasteries numbered more than 650 in the kingdom of the Franks alone, not including those in Italy. Many of these monasteries—and foremost among them were those meant to strengthen Frankish control in the recently annexed provinces south of the Loire River, east of the Rhine, and in Italy—he favored with large donations. Others passed from the ownership of their founders to that of the monarch. In the second volume of the work which we published in connection with the Karl der Grosse Exhibition, Joseph Semmler has portrayed Charlemagne's efforts to strengthen monastic life; with rich documentation he has gathered together what is here only summarily reviewed. In monasteries throughout his realm the emperor was eager to introduce the regula sancti Benedicti and replace with it many other monastic traditions and widely varying customs. Even though it cannot be established with certainty that he succeeded in the so-called Aachener Normalexemplar in securing for himself a copy of the original manuscript by the great father of western monachism, it was a self-evident precept to him that all nuns and monks in his empire should be bound to shape their lives in accordance with this and no other Rule. In this endeavor Charlemagne found a great ally, from 782 onward, in Benedict of Aniane. This descendant of a line of powerful counts of southern France threw himself with the full force of his impassioned asceticism in support of literal adherence to the Rule of Saint Benedict. Charlemagne's Admonitio generalis of 789 to the clergy of his empire, and the Synod of Aachen of 802, are two milestones in his efforts to have the Rule adopted in all the monastic communities of the empire. In 802 Charlemagne's royal messengers (missi dominici) were dispatched throughout the counties to make sure that all monasteries had adopted the Rule. There was no want of countermovements. Angilbert, a son-in-law of Charlemagne, furnished his monks at St. Riquier a different custom, which stipulated a laus perenneis, that is, a continuous and uninterrupted prayer offered by groups of monks in alternating sequence. Adalhard of Corbie, a blood-cousin of the emperor, made a passionate defense of the regula mixta at the synod of 802. The emperor may have recognized on that occasion that full conformity could not be obtained. From the records of synods which he called together in five principal conters of the empire, in 813, as his life was already drawing to a close, we learn that there were provinces where monasteries flourished and others where they had fallen into decay. This book will make it clear that even in 816 and 817, under the very eyes of Benedict of Aniane, whom Louis the Pious had ordered to come to Aachen, opposition to the uniform interpretation of the Rule for all monasteries had not, as yet, died out. Nonetheless, even the scheme of the Plan of St. Gall reflects that propensity for norm and for unity that characterizes all ordinances issued by Charlemagne in his quest for an unalterable law and a perfection that reached toward the utopian. The great leaders of medieval monachism were powerful and self-willed personalities. The Rule of Saint Benedict was primarily conceived as an abbot's rule, an ordered body of prescriptions for a good abbot, who was to be a strong yet compassionate father. The material welfare of the entire abbey, as well as the spiritual well-being of each individual monk, was placed in his hands. He was both ruler and educator, for just as a kingdom in the Middle Ages belonged to the king, so the abbey belonged to the abbot, not only the order or the congregation. A powerful father figure of this type was Haito, the bishop and abbot who, at request of Abbot Gozbert of St. Gall, arranged for the Plan to be copied from the scheme worked out in 816 and 817 during the two synods of Aachen. As one of Charlemagne's counsellors, Haito was entrusted with a mission to Constantinople in 811. He is known to have produced a report on his experiences which, unfortunately, has not survived. The diocesan directives which he issued for the clergy of Basel (Capitulare Hettonis) and the so-called Statutes of Murbach testify his passionate concern with a life governed by firm custom. He sent the monks Grimald and Tatto to Benedict of Aniane with the commission to procure an accurate copy of the Rule, word for word, syllable for syllable, as these monks themselves attest. For even though Haito differed from Benedict of Aniane in the interpretation of certain passages of the Rule, he was in full accord with him, as well as with Charlemagne, in postulating that the Rule should be the sole guideline for the monks' life. As a sexagenarian, in 823, this remarkable man, Haito, relinquished all his offices to devote the remaining thirteen years of his life to a singular task. In a comprehensive book he gathered the names of all his friends and acquaintances, entire monasteries, entire clans of noblemen, even the house of the king himself, to unite them in this manner in a brotherhood of supplicants who could pray in concert for their eternal salvation. At the end, his collection embraced more than 20,000 names representing the century's prominent men in their entirety, whom Haito thus proposed to summon in a final Imperial Assembly in Heaven. At the same time he took it upon himself to record in prose the metaphysical visions of his pupil, Wetti, the Visio Wettini, in which, inter alia, the punishment of Charlemagne in Purgatory was listed. It was on this account that Walafrid Strabo, who succeeded Haito at Reichenau in 838, based his famous poem which stands at the beginning of a long lineage terminating in Dante's Divine Comedy. The same will to perfection and order that inspired Haito's instructions to the priests of his diocese and the monks of his monasteries and that drove him to compile the list of names for the confraternity of Reichenau animated the directives issued by all those great codifiers who worked under Charlemagne and Louis the Pious in the overriding task of unifying Church and State in the endeavor to establish the Kingdom of God on Earth. It was this same spirit which also inspired the design of the perfect city for monks transmitted by Haito to the abbot of St. Gall. One may wonder whether it could ever have been built in exactly that form. Like many of the laws of Charlemagne, it had a basically utopian character. However, in stressing this quality inherent in the Plan, we must not lose sight of the fact that it was made to serve as a guide to actual construction. Whether or not the Plan should be interpreted as a schematic drawing or a building plan has puzzled scholars for over a century. Walter Horn's research has brought three surprising discoveries to light. First, contrary to former opinion, he has established without any shadow of a doubt that the Plan was drawn to a consistent scale. Second, this scale was used with an acute awareness of the spatial and functional realities involved. And third, once the building types had been identified, the entire Plan could be converted into working drawings, on the basis of which a monastery could in fact be built in its actual dimensions. Of course, the variability from monastery to monastery of topographical and prevailing economic conditions, as well as changing monastic customs, may have prevented the literal instrumentation of a plan of such paradigmatic perfection. Yet, a preliminary inquiry into the effects which the Plan of St. Gall had on other monastic planning suggests that in all its basic dispositions it in fact conditioned the course of all future developments. Whatever alterations were undertaken were caused by changes in monastic custom. It was therefore a real temptation of the mind to attempt to embody this instrument in a model. When I called upon Walter Horn in 1963 to develop such a model and he confessed to me that its construction would fulfill a dream he had entertained for many years, it was clear to both of us that we were in search of architectural solutions which could not be obtained on the sole basis of the data contained in the Plan itself. Walter Horn found the key for these solutions in his comprehensive and many-branched studies of the monastic architecture of Western Europe, and of the contributions made to it by early Germanic timber architecture. His aim was not—and could not have been— to demonstrate what form the scheme assumed when Abbot Gozbert used it for the reconstruction of his own monastery for the topographic features of the site upon which Gozbert had to build would in itself have precluded the Plan's being put into effect in precisely the form in which it was drawn. Rather, Mr. Horn had to confine himself to demonstrating the ways in which various buildings and installations of the Plan of St. Gall could have been built with the means of the period, adhering as closely as was possible to precepts disclosed in this first ideal plan. The Plan itself is a work of art of the highest order. It draws on old customs and serves old ideals. In styling it "a near-utopian concept," we want to stress the fact that it is an architectural entity whose outer order most nearly reflects its inner order, and whose laws govern the aesthetic organization of even the smallest buildings, and the gardens. It was to result in an organism within which the Rule of Saint Benedict could be lived in the most rational manner, with the shortest connections for traffic, secure segregation of monks from laymen, healthy from sick, novices from those who had already taken their final vows. There was to be a minimum of dependence on necessary supplies that could not be produced or stored within the walls of the monastery, to avoid disturbance from the outside world. It was a self-contained and completely rationalized monastic entity. Charlemagne and Louis the Pious dispatched junior and senior Frankish monks to all parts of the empire, including Italy and the deep forests of Saxony, the Spanish marks as well as the only recently acquired steppes of the Avarii. With amazement we gaze upon an aristocracy that embraced only two ideals of life: the life on horseback, in continuous movement year in and year out, and the life behind the walls of monasteries—boundless liberty or hermetic isolation. Men of those times must have given a great deal of thought to the perfect life in a monastery in which nothing disturbed the inner calm of men turned toward God. In full compliance with the precepts of the Rule, they took everything into this Noah's Ark—the staples for a considerable length of time, a full range of domesticated animals and plants, craftsmen and scribes, physicians and teachers. They saw to it that the inner circle of life was tightly enclosed by an outer economic circle. Both circles were centered upon the space of the church, where the sole product was offered that could be entered upon the credit balance of the monastery: the praise of God. Graduated in an ascending scale of mass and form, the buildings of this monastery rank from the more modest economic and agricultural houses to the more spacious and comfortably furnished buildings for receiving guests, to the solid volumes of the claustral structures and the imposing hall of the church with its altars. The conceptual realization of this rich and perspicacious architectural composition is controlled from within, but the order of building has entered into an aesthetic consonance with the order of life established in the Rule of Saint Benedict.

      <field name="fulltext">ABBREVIATIONS FROM THE time this task was conceived as a three-volume work, it was planned to reduce to a minimum extensive citation and abbreviation in the footnotes, and to do so by integrating note citations with the annotated Bibliography at the end of Volume III. Text footnote citation is made in a modified scientific style. Most single-author references are given by author surname, year of publication, volume number if applicable, and page citations. With a few exceptions, full bibliographical information can be found only in the Bibliography. Citations to primary sources, chiefly the patristic writings and the great encyclopedias, are given by abbreviated general title (see list below); volumes in these works are given in the notes with abbreviated titles but in sufficient detail to make their identities virtually self-evident. Simple references to authors of standard works, even without the Bibliography, will pose little problem to many readers. We realize that the method has the drawback of not being fully useful at once. The need to balance text, notes, captioning, and illustrations on these pages favored conciseness wherever possible. Internal cross references are by volume and page number of this work, with volume number omitted for the book in hand.

THE PLAN OF ST. GALL Red outline drawing of the Plan with margin of the parchment shown in dotted black line. The illustration shows the Plan at 1/10 the original size, 1:1920 which is equivalent to one inch equals 160 feet. For larger scale plan see p. xxviii. * The small reproductions of the Plan at 1/10 and 1/8 original size, appearing in various parts of the work, required preparation of a special drawing in which the lines of the basic red rendering have been considerably thickened for ease of legibility and of printing when reduced to small size. The small plan is never used where gross exaggeration of line width in the reproduction would provide an iconographic distortion affecting interpretive values in reading the Plan. It is used exclusively as a convenience for the reader, to facilitate ease of reading where the typical full-page illustration would be disproportionate to the purpose. R. B.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE THE PLAN AND ITS BUILDINGS: A PRELIMINARY ORIENTATION THE PLAN OF ST. GALL is one of the principal treasures of the library of the former monastery of St. Gall in Switzerland (Stiftsbibliothek, Ms. 1092) where it has been since the ninth century. A large sheet of vellum (30½ × 44 inches; 77 × 112 cm.) sewn together from five separate pieces, it exhibits on the smooth side the outlines, drawn in red ink, of all the buildings required for the life and work of an exemplary Carolingian monastery. The drawings are annotated by a wealth of explanatory titles written in brown ink which define the purpose of each structure, the function of its individual rooms, and the nature of its furnishings. The style of the script discloses that the Plan was made in the scriptorium of the monastery of Reichenau. In addition to its descriptive legends the Plan is provided with a dedicatory note or letter of transmittal explaining the circumstances that led to the creation of the Plan. From this letter we can infer that the Plan was drawn up at the request of Abbot Gozbert, who presided over the monastery of St. Gall from 816 to 836. We are well informed by other historical sources that Gozbert rebuilt the church of the monastery of St. Gall during the last six years of his abbacy (830-836) and appears to have intended to reconstruct the monastery in its entirety. The Plan obviously was made to serve as guide in this project. The author of the Plan, to judge by the tenor of his letter of transmittal, was a churchman of higher rank than Abbot Gozbert. His name is not revealed in the letter, but the fact that the Plan was drawn in the monastery of Reichenau suggests that it was Haito, bishop of Basel, from 803-823, and for most of that period (806-823) simultaneously abbot of the monastery of Reichenau. The wording of the dedicatory note, plus a variety of technical details, make it clear that the Plan was not an original but a copy made by tracing. Nothing is known about the conditions that gave rise to the prototype plan: however, the paradigmatic nature of the scheme suggests that it was a product of the monastic reform that flourished under the reign of Louis the Pious, and reached its climax in two synods held in his palace at Aachen in 816 and 817 by the leading bishops and abbots of the empire. The primary purpose of this reform was to establish universally binding rules for the spiritual and temporal conduct of monastic life. The scheme shown on the Plan aimed in the same manner at the establishment of a guiding rule that could be followed in the architectural layout of a monastic settlement. The Plan of St. Gall reveals that at the time of Louis the Pious the layout of the buildings required for such a settlement had already reached its classical medieval form— a form that it retained with only minor variation to the very close of the Middle Ages. Not every monastery subsequently built comprised all the buildings shown on the Plan, but the Plan contained every building that one could expect in a prototypic medieval monastery. The nucleus of this aggregate of dwellings and workshops is the great monastery Church whose imposing bulk rises dramatically above that of any other building in the settlement. It is an aisled basilica with transept, eastern and western apses, and two detached circular towers. In front of the Church there is a semicircular atrium with a covered gallery and porches for the screening of visitors (No. 1, f, g, h) and behind it, at the eastern end, there is another open atrium for the use of the novices and the sick. A double-storied lean-to (No. 1, a) built against the Church in the corner between the northern transept arm and the fore choir contains the monks' Scriptorium on the ground level and the Library above. In the corresponding space on the southern side of the Church there is a similar annex (No. 1, b) with the Sacristy on the ground floor, and, above it, the room for the liturgical vestments. From the Sacristy a crank-shaped passage leads to an annex for the preparation of the holy oil and holy bread (No. 2). Attached to the southern flank of the Church are the buildings of the monks (Nos. 3-9). These are ranged along the perimeter of a large cloister yard and are connected with each other by arcaded galleries. Together they form a complete enclosure separating the living quarters of the monks from the areas in which the serfs and the guests are housed. The east side of the cloister yard is taken up by a double-storied building (No. 3) that contains on the ground floor the Monks' Warming Room, and above it, their Dormitory. A passage on the south end of the Dormitory leads to the Monks' Privy (No. 4). On ground level a second passage connects the Warming Room with the Monks' Laundry and Bathhouse (No. 5). The southern side of the Cloister is occupied by another double-storied building (No. 6) that contains on the ground floor the Monks' Refectory, and above it, their Vestiary. From the west end of the Refectory a crank-shaped passage leads into the Monks' Kitchen (No. 8). The south end of the Kitchen is, in turn, connected by a long passage with the Monks' Bake and Brew House (No. 9), which lies outside the claustral compound. On the west side of the Cloister yard there is a third two-storied building (No. 7), with the Monks' Cellar on the ground floor and the monastery's Larder above. Between this building and the Church is the Monks' Parlor (No. 1, j). It is here that the brothers are permitted to meet with visiting relatives and friends, and where the ritual of the washing of the feet is held. Likewise reserved for monastic use exclusively are the houses for the novices and the sick. They form two separate conventual settlements (No. 17), each complete in itself, one attached to the south, the other to the north side of a double chapel that lies in the eastern prolongation of the principal church. Each has a cloister surrounded by a full complement of living facilities, the layout of which repeats on a smaller scale the layout of the claustrum of the regular monks. Two small detached buildings (Nos. 18 and 19) contain their baths and kitchens. The House of the Physicians (No. 16) stands north of the Infirmary. It contains, in addition to the doctor's own quarters, a ward for those who suffer from acute illness and a small pharmaceutical storeroom. East of the physician's house there is a small medicinal herb garden (No. Z) and west of it the House for Bloodletting and Purging (No. 15). On the other side of the group of buildings that contain the Novitiate and the Infirmary there is the Monks' Cemetery (No. Y), which also serves as an orchard. To the north of the Church, in a tract of land that is clearly outside the claustral precinct and forms a transitional zone between the monastic and the secular world, there are the Abbot's House (No. 13) and the Outer School (No. 12). The Abbot's House consists of a principal building, which is his residence (No. 13), and an annex (No. 14) with the Abbot's kitchen, cellar, and bath. The Outer School (No. 12) is the place where secular youths and the future clerics are housed and trained. To either side of the western end of the Church, in suitable proximity to the road that gives access to the settlement, are the monastery's two principal facilities for the reception of visitors, viz., to the north the elaborately furnished House for Distinguished Guests (No. 11), primarily used for the accommodation of the Emperor and his court, and to the south the more modest Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers (No. 31). Each of these establishments is provided with its own annex, supplying space for cooking, baking and brewing (Nos. 10 and 32). The vassals and knights who travel in the Emperor's following find accommodations in a building of unusually large dimensions, located in a large plot of land in the northwestern corner of the monastery site (No. 34). This building unfortunately was erased, together with its explanatory titles, in the twelfth century by a monk who superimposed upon this area of the Plan the last three paragraphs of the Life of St. Martin, the bulk of which he had written on the back of the Plan. Next to this building, on the southern side of the entrance road is a house for Visiting Servants from the monastery's outlying estates and for the Servants Travelling with the Emperor's Court (No. 38). A third facility for visitors, the Lodging for Visiting Monks, is installed in a lean-to built against the northern aisle of the Church, contiguous with the transept (No. 1, c). A continuation of that lean-to toward the west contains the Lodging of the Master of the Outer School (No. 1, d) and the Porter's Lodging (No. 1, e). A similar lean-to built against the southern aisle of the Church, west of the Monks' Parlor (No. 1, j), contains the Lodging of the Master of the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers (No. 1, i). The remaining tracts of land to the east, south, and west of the Church and Claustrum are occupied by the houses for the serfs and servants who are in charge of the monastery's economic, industrial, and agricultural operations. South of the Cemetery in the eastern sector of the monastery is the House of the Gardener (No. 20) and the Monks' Vegetable Garden (No. X). Still farther south, in the southernmost portion of this tract, is the House of the Fowlkeepers (No. 22) and two circular enclosures, one for chickens (No. 23) and the other for geese (No. 21). Next to them, moving from east to west, in the large rectangular tract that lies to the south of the claustral block, there follow in sequence first, the large monastic Granary (No. 24) with its cross-shaped threshing floor; next, a building of even larger dimensions, the Great Collective Workshop with living quarters for the shoemakers, saddlers, cutlers, shieldmakers, turners, and curriers (No. 25) and an annex, in which the goldsmiths, blacksmiths, and fullers are installed (No. 26). Still farther west there is the Monks' Bake and Brew House (No. 9) and to the south of this, three smaller square buildings house the Mill (No. 27), the Mortar (No. 28), and the Drying Kiln (No. 29). Between the latter and the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers is a large rectangular building containing workshops and living quarters for the coopers and wheelwrights, as well as a small granary for the storing and threshing of the grain used by the brewers (No. 30). West of this there is an even larger rectangular structure for the horses and oxen and their keepers (No. 33). What is left of the large rectangular tract to the west of the Church is entirely reserved for the care of the monastery's livestock. It includes a House for Sheep and Shepherds (No. 35), a House for Goats and Goatherds (No. 36), a House for Cows and Cowherds (No. 37), a House for Swine and Swineherds (No. 39), and a House for Brood Mares and Foals and Their Keepers (No. 40). All of these houses are carefully fenced off from each other and from the adjoining sectors of the monastery. One of the great limitations of the Plan of St. Gall is that with only a few exceptions it confines itself to rendering the buildings in linear ground projection. It tells nothing about the elevation of the buildings and their method of construction. To settle the problem of their three-dimensional appearance in visual and constructional terms is one of the primary goals of this study. W.H.

      <field name="fulltext">1.X THE PLAN OF ST. GALL DRAWN ON PARCHMENT IN RED AND BLACK. LIFE OF ST. MARTIN, LOWER LEFT STIFTSBIBLIOTHEK, ST. GALL</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I PREVIOUS LITERATURE, ORIGIN, PURPOSE, AND SPECIAL PROBLEMS I. 1 PREVIOUS LITERATURE INTRODUCTION ONE of the most remarkable facts about the Plan of St. Gall is that it still exists and that it is still at St. Gall. Aside from the length of time that has elapsed since the days it was first made, there were several specific dangers that threatened its existence even after it was incorporated into the Library of St. Gall, such as the sack of the Magyars in 926, in expectation of which all the books were evacuated to the monastery of Reichenau,1 1 When the books were brought back from Reichenau, according to Ekkehart "the number was the same, but not the books" (nam cum reportarentur, ut ajunt, numerus conveniebat, non ipsi). Ekkeharti (IV.) Casus sancti Galli, chap. 51; ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 193-98; ed. Helbling, 1958, 104-5. For further accounts of events that might have threatened the survival of the Plan, see Duft, 1952, 36-38; and Duft, in Studien, 1962, 33-36, as well as the literature quoted there. and the stormy days of secularization at the close of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth which spelled disaster to so many other monastic libraries. In addition to these external dangers there were those created by the Plan's unusual shape. Being a sheet of parchment of unwieldy proportions it was subject to the same hazards of housekeeping that tend to beset all holdings that do not fit neatly into a normal shelving system. That the Plan survived at all under these circumstances must be credited—as Johannes Duft has correctly pointed out2 2 Duft, ibid. —to an unknown monk of St. Gall who, at the close of the twelfth century, availed himself of the unused back portions of the skin to inscribe upon it the text of a Life of St. Martin. Conscious perhaps of the important role this document had played in the renovation of his monastery and the construction of the buildings in which he lived, he refrained from cutting the Plan apart, but folded it lengthwise and crosswise into a sequence that furnished him with fourteen pages for his text, plus two empty pages that served as covers (fig. 1).3 3 This Vita sancti Martini (not known to the editors of the Bibliotheca Hagiographica Latina) was first examined by P. Lehmann, in 1947, after the Plan had been freed from its seventeenth or eighteenth century backing of linen. Lehmann found it to be not without hagiographical merit. He describes it as a judicious compilation and alignment of a number of widely distributed narratives of the life and miracles of St. Martin, written in St. Gall, in a careful gothic minuscule used toward the close of the twelfth century in southwest Germany and northeast Switzerland. For details see Lehmann, 1951, 745-51; with regard to the chapter sequence and its relation to the folding system of the Plan, see Schwarz, 1952, 35. Thus the physically unmanageable Plan was transferred into a book-sized volume that could easily be incorporated into a conventional shelving system. The author of the Life of St. Martin did not proceed with equal wisdom when he discovered toward the end of his task that the back of the Plan was not large enough to accommodate all of his text. With his mind set on finishing his work, he turned the Plan over and entered the last twenty-two lines of his text on the lower left corner of the front side of the Plan. In order to use this portion of the parchment for his text, he erased the lines and explanatory legends of a large building that occupied the northwest corner of the monastery site (fig. 1.X). I.1.1 FROM THE MIDDLE AGES TO THE MIDDLE OF THE 19th CENTURY The Plan was thus made subservient to a hagiographical text of lesser importance, and in this new association— as the subsequent history shows—its original meaning fell into oblivion. In a fragmentary catalogue of the holdings of the Library of St. Gall, which was written in 1461 under Abbot Kaspar of Breitenlandenberg, the document is listed as a "large animal skin with the life of St. Martin written upon it and a delineation of the houses of his monastery" (pellis magna continens vitam S. Martini scriptam structuramque domorum eius depictam). The author of this catalogue, as is obvious from this entry, considered the text on the back of the skin to be the principal part of this document and interpreted the drawings on the front of the skin as an outline of the monastery of St. Martin at Tours.4 4 Duft, 1952, 36; and Duft, in Studien, 1962, 34. The true character of the Plan was rediscovered by Henricus Canisius who in 1604 published the verses of the Plan,5 5 Canisius, V: 2, 1604, 780ff. primarily for their literary interest. Canisius (d.1610) was unaware of the paradigmatic character of the Plan but thought it was a site plan of the monastery of St. Gall "as it looked at the time of Abbot Gozbert." He was the first to identify the "Cozb[er]tus" of the dedicatory legend with Abbot Gozbert, who presided over the monastery of St. Gall from 816-836, and inferred correctly from the fact that the abbot was addressed as "my sweetest son" (dulcissime filie) that the author of the Plan was a man of higher rank and must have been a bishop.6 6 "Extat in bibliotheca S. Galli Tabula quaedam seu (ut vocant) mappa sane per quam vetusta et ampla ex pergameno ad Gozpertum Abbatem, in qua etiam totum monasterium secundum omnes etiam abiectissimas officinas descriptum est (ut quidem ego colligo ex eo, quod ibi appellat author Gozpertum filium) ab Episcopo aliquo, qui fuerit vel Monachus, vel studiosus, vel certe alias demum Monachis et Monasterio familiaris. Eam tabulam index quidem centenarius nominat S. Martini Monasterii, ex eo, ut arbitror quod aliquid in tergo ipsius est vita S. Martini, sed ut ex titulis et situ manifestum est, non est, nisi S. Galli Monasterii, prout fuit Gozberti temporibus Monasterium" (ibid.). One of the consequences of the rediscovery of the Plan by Canisius was that some time in the seventeenth or eighteenth century (the date can no longer be established) the Plan was strengthened with a backing of linen, which concealed the Life of St. Martin. On the basis of the interest awakened by Canisius, the great Benedictine scholar Jean Mabillon (1632-1707) featured in the second volume of his Annales ordinis sancti Benedicti7 7 Mabillon, Annales, II, 1704, 570ff. the first graphical reproduction of its explanatory titles. This engraving was neither complete nor free of errors, but being published in a widely distributed historiographical work, made the contents of the Plan accessible to the learned world. I.1.2 THE FIRST MONOGRAPHIC STUDIES It took another 140 years for the Plan to become the subject of a separate study. The first monographic treatment of the Plan was published in 1844 by Ferdinand Keller, the founder of the Antiquarische Gesellschaft of Zurich.8 8 Keller, 1844. It included as a novelty an attempt to interpret the construction of the buildings shown on the Plan. Keller intended to publish a full scale lithographic facsimile edition of the Plan, but the stone on which the design was drawn broke apart during the first printing and was subsequently replaced by a smaller stone on which the outlines of the Plan were reduced to four-fifths the original size. The explanatory legends were superimposed in their original dimensions upon this reduced image, and in this discordant form the Plan was published, together with a detailed description of its drawings and legends. Although by no means free of errors and omissions— the most serious of which is the omission of the dedicatory letter—Keller's "facsimile" nevertheless was an excellent specimen of lithographic reproduction and formed the basis for all future research. In the English-speaking world the Plan became known through an enlarged and annotated translation of Keller's text by Robert Willis, published in the 1848 volume of the Archaeological Journal;9 9 Willis, 1848. in France, through Albert Lenoir's treatment of the subject in his Architecture monastique of 1852,10 10 Lenoir, 1852, 24ff. and through a translation of Willis into French by M. A. Campion,11 11 Campion, 1868, 361-406. which appeared in the Bulletin monumental of 1868. The latter formed the basis of Leclercq's widely read description of the Plan of St. Gall in Cabrol-Leclercq's Dictionnaire d'archéologie chrétienne et de liturgie12 12 Leclercq, in Cabrol-Leclercq, VI:1, 1924, cols. 86-106. which added nothing original to the study of the Plan. I.1.3 ENTRY OF THE SPECIALISTS It was only natural that the Plan of St. Gall, once published, should become an object of primary attraction to the students of vernacular architecture who were not slow in recognizing its signal importance for the history of medieval house construction. This aspect of the Plan was the concern of such men as J. R. Rahn (1876), Rudolf Henning (1882), Julius von Schlosser (1889), Moriz Heyne (1899-1903), Karl Gustav Stephani (1902-3), Christian Rank (1907), Franz Oelmann (1923-24), H. Fiechter-Zollikofer (1936), Otto Völkers (1937), and Karl Gruber (1937 and 1952).13 13 For the titles of the works cited here and in the subsequent paragraph, see Bibliography, Vol. III. Of deeper and even wider impact were the discussions raised by the design of the Church and the claustral structures of the Plan, as well as by certain discrepancies between the drawing of the Church and the measurements given in its explanatory titles. The literature of these subjects has swollen into discouraging proportions. It includes the writings of such men as: Hugo Graf (1892), Georg Dehio (1892 and 1930), Wilhelm Effman (1899 and 1912), August Hardegger (1917 and 1922), Friedrich Ostendorf (1922), Joseph Hecht (1928), Ernst Gall (1930), Joseph Gantner (1936), Hans Reinhardt (1937, 1952, and 1962), Edgar Lehman (1938), Fritz Victor Arens (1938), Otto Doppelfeld (1948 and 1957), Walter Boeckelmann (1956), Wilhelm Rave (1956), Karl Gruber (1960), and Wolfgang Schöne (1960). Landmarks in this sequence of studies were the articles of Otto Doppelfeld (1948) and Walter Boeckelmann (1956), each of which offered a new solution to the difficult problem of the "dimensional inconsistencies" of the Plan. Less successful were Wolfgang Schöne's (1960) and Adolf Reinle's (1963-64) attempts to settle this question. The thorny problem of the origin of the cloister was studied by Julius von Schlosser (1889), Joseph Fendel (1927), and Ossa Raymond Sowers (1952). To add to these names the countless references made by other authors who addressed themselves to various aspects of the Plan in studies not specifically devoted to this subject would be a hopeless and unrewarding task. An indispensable reference work that no student of the Plan can by-pass is Hermann Wartmann's exhaustive publication of the documentary sources of St. Gall (186392).14 14 Wartmann, 1863-92. An informative review of the economic history of St. Gall, based on this material, is Hermann Bikel's Wirtschaftsverhältnisse des Klosters St. Gallen;15 15 Bikel, 1914. a valuable study of the monastery's literary and scriptorial activities is J. M. Clark's The Abbey of St. Gall, as a Centre of Literature and Art.16 16 Clark, 1926. I.1.4 A NEW ERA: THE FACSIMILE EDITION OF 1952 A new era in the history of the investigation of the Plan was initiated in 1952 with the publication, under the auspices of the Historische Verein des Kantons St. Gallen, of a facsimile reproduction of the Plan.17 17 Der Karolingische Klosterplan von St. Gallen, eight-color facsimile offset print, published by the Historische Verein des Kantons St. Gallen, the Clichéanstalt Schwitter and Co., Zurich, and E. LoepfeBenz, Rorschach. This praiseworthy undertaking was initiated and carried out by the late Hans Bessler of St. Gall and his lifelong friend Dr. Johannes Duft, the distinguished director of the Stiftsbibliothek, who together nursed this project through all its critical stages.18 18 For the two articles in which the project was announced, see Bessler, 1950 and 1951. Printed by the most advanced methods of color reproduction, this facsimile has not only secured the survival of the Plan in hundreds of widely distributed copies, but has also opened the field for new studies on the scale and construction methods used in the laying out of the buildings shown on the Plan.19 19 See below, p. 77ff. The 1952 facsimile was accompanied by a descriptive text by Hans Reinhardt,20 20 Reinhardt, 1952. which appeared as the 92. Neujahrsblatt of the Historische Verein des Kantons St. Gallen, together with an article by Johannes Duft on the previous history of the Plan,21 21 Duft, 1952. an analysis by Dietrich 1.A PLAN OF ST. GALL VERSO OF THE PLAN WITH THE LIFE OF ST. MARTIN INSCRIBED MORE THAN THREE CENTURIES AFTER THE PLAN WAS DRAWN ON THE RECTO. THE PLAN OF ST. GALL The first fold divided the parchment into two equal areas. The and &amp; 3rd foldings were then made to the first fold. For ease in folding the outer rows X and Y were made slightly shorter than the two center rows. 1.B Compactly folded the manuscript can now be returned to the library shelf. The blank space (space with no writing) functions as front and back cover. THE LIFE OF ST. MARTIN AND THE FOLDING OF THE PARCHMENT IN RELATION TO THE READING SEQUENCE 1.C THE UNFOLDING PROCEDURE AND READING SEQUENCE The scribe planned the LIFE OF ST. MARTIN to be easily read with the pages following each other in numerical order from left to right. The reader, on taking the manuscript from the shelf, had in hand a "package" as shown in fig. 1, diagram 8. Laying the LIFE on the table, the reader opened the package. Before him, in normal reading position, he saw page 1 on the left and page 2 on the right: After reading pages 1 and 2, page 1 was turned backwards (on fold line 4) to the left, and page 2 was turned to the right (on fold line 5). The reader then saw a rectangle like this: The row of pages 3, 4, 5, 6, was brought toward the reader and laid flat on the table. This is what he saw—pages 7, 8, 9, 10, in reading sequence left to right: So far the page numbers flowed in normal sequence, left to right. Page 11, however, was clearly in view but upside down. The parchment was rotated 180 degrees to permit the upside-down pages to be read. After reading the sequence of pages 11, 12, 13, 14, left to right, in fig. 5, the parchment was rotated back to the position shown in fig. 4. There was more to be read; 14 was not the last page of the LIFE OF ST. MARTIN. At this stage, the reader lifted the lower row of pages, 7, 8, 9, 10 (on fold line 3), toward him and placed the parchment face down on the table. This is what he saw: In the lower left corner, on the back of page 7, in reading position and clearly in view, was the last page of the LIFE OF ST. MARTIN, page 15. On the remainder of the parchment, intact and without erasure, was displayed Haito's Plan of St. Gall: a graphic configuration, a senseless geometric abstraction. Three centuries after its conception and delineation, it was neither with meaning nor historical significance to a reader of the LIFE OF ST. MARTIN, until its discovery or rediscovery in 1604 by Henricus Canisius (See p. 2, above). We can be grateful that the LIFE OF ST. MARTIN was not treated to conventional bookbinding techniques composed of cut leaves, folded and sewn into signatures. The marvel of the survival of the parchment has been treated by Dr. Johannes Duft (see above, p. 1, note 1). Schwarz of the manner in which the Plan was folded by the twelfth-century monk,22 22 Schwarz, 1952. and a report by Hans Bessler, on the technical measures taken for the preservation of the Plan.23 23 Bessler, 1952. Reinhardt did not propose to undertake a comprehensive treatment of the subject and did not claim to deal with it in an exhaustive manner. He offered a new solution to the controversial issue of the inconsistent measurements of the Church, and advanced some new thoughts about the origin of the two circular towers, but touched only briefly on the difficult problem of the reconstruction of the guest and service structures of the Plan. In 1949, during the preparatory stages of this great facsimile edition, while the Plan was under photographic examination in the Landesmuseum of Zurich, it was freed from the linen backing with which it had been reinforced during the seventeenth or eighteenth century.24 24 See the report of Schwarz, op. cit. This brought to light the text of the Life of St. Martin which covered the verso of the Plan. X-rays and other penetrating photographic methods brought back the outlines of the erased large service structure in the northwest corner of the monastery (fig. 405), but failed to revive its explanatory titles.25 25 See II, 159, fig. 405. The last hope that these legends could ever be recovered vanished when Dr. Duft discovered that they belonged to a group of obliterated texts that had fallen victim to the chemical experiments undertaken either by the distinguished historian Ildefons von Arx (1755-1833), or perhaps by Anton Henne, who served as provisional librarian between 1855 and 1861.26 26 See Duft, 1952, 37-38; and 1951, 252-56. I.1.5 THE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM AT ST. GALL, 1957 It had been one of the wishes of Hans Bessler that the publication of the facsimile edition of the Plan of St. Gall should be followed by a symposium of scholars concerned with the Plan, and that the work that would emerge from this gathering should subsequently be made available in a scholarly publication. Hans Bessler did not live to see both of these dreams fulfilled. A symposium, organized and conducted by him and Dr. Johannes Duft, was held in St. Gall from July 12-16, 1957.27 27 Made possible by the generous support of the City and the Canton of St. Gall, as well as a group of private citizens, this symposium brought together scholars from Switzerland, Germany, France, and the United States. The lectures and discussions of the meeting were reviewed by Poeschel, 1957; and idem, in Studien, 1962, 23-32; Bessler, 1958, 229-39; K. Gruber, 1960, 15-19; Duft, in Studien, 1962, 13-15; and Reinhardt, in Studien, 1962, 57-64. The publication of the studies that emerged from the symposium had to be undertaken by Dr. Duft alone and appeared as a memorial for Bessler under the title, Studien zum St. Galler Klosterplan, in the Mitteilungen zur Vaterländischen Geschichte, published under the auspices of the Historische Verein des Kantons St. Gallen.28 28 Studien, 1962. It contained, apart from a masterful review of the previous literature on the Plan by Johannes Duft,29 29 Duft, ibid., 33-56. a fundamental analysis of the paleographical problems of the Plan by Bernhard Bischoff;30 30 Bischoff, ibid., 67-78. two articles by the writer of the present study, one on the question of the originality of the Plan,31 31 Horn, ibid., 79-102. the other on the relation of the Plan to the monastic reform movement;32 32 Ibid., 103-27. an article on the altars of the Plan by Iso Müller, OSB;33 33 Müller, ibid., 129-76. a study of Hildemar's commentary on the Rules of St. Benedict and its implications for the Plan by Wolfgang Hafner;34 34 Hafner, ibid., 177-92. a study of the plants and gardens by Wolfgang Sörrensen;35 35 Sörrensen, ibid., 193-277. and two brief essays by Heinrich Edelmann, one dealing with the relation of the Plan to the actual building site of the monastery of St. Gall,36 36 Edelmann, ibid., 279-89. the other with the history of the three-dimensional model of the buildings of the Plan which was executed in 1877 by the sculptor Jules Leemann of Geneva for the Historisches Museum of the city of St. Gall, where it is still on display.37 37 Ibid., 291-95. THE CONTROVERSY ABOUT THE SCALE OF THE PLAN A new study dealing with the "dimensional inconsistencies" and the presumptive scale (or "scales") of the Plan was published in 1963/64 by Adolf Reinle.38 38 Reinle, 1963/64, 91-109. It departs completely from all previous views expressed on this subject and offers a radically different interpretation of the large axial title of the Plan that records the length of the Church as being 200 feet. The merits and demerits of this thesis, as well as the opinion of others who had been intrigued by this problem, were discussed in an article of my own published in the September-December issue of the Art Bulletin of 1966.39 39 Horn, 1966, 285-308. The old, yet still controversial, problem "Schema oder Bauplan," was briefly and successfully reviewed by Konrad Hecht,40 40 K. Hecht, 1965, 165-206. in an article published in 1965, which also offered some new and important observations about the shrinkage of the parchment upon which the Plan is drawn, and the relevance of this change to the interpretation of the scale of the Plan. I.1.6 COUNCIL OF EUROPE EXHIBITION KARL DER GROSSE at AACHEN, 1965, AND ITS IMPETUS Recently a powerful impetus was given to the study of the Plan of St. Gall by Dr. Wolfgang Braunfels who invited the authors of the present work to furnish him with the research and architectural drawings for a three-dimensional model of the monastery shown on the Plan, to be put on display at the Council of Europe Exhibition Karl der Grosse, held in the city of Aachen in the summer of 1965. The birth of this book, whose beginning reaches many years back, is intimately connected with this project, and my gratitude to Dr. Braunfels for motivating this final push has no limits. There is no more acid trial for any theoretical assumptions about the three-dimensional appearance of buildings known only in simple line projection than that of testing them in the constructional reality of a scale-drawn model. As in previous studies posing similar problems, I found myself in the fortunate position of being able to draw on the professional knowledge, constructional experience, and superior draftsmanship of Ernest Born and Carl Bertil Lund, without whose expert and devoted collaboration that project could never have been carried out.41 41 For other collaboration, see Horn and Born, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1965, 1968, 1969. We are fortunate, in turn, to have found in Siegfried Karschunke a model-builder of rare resourcefulness and impeccable skill. It is on the work-drawings made for this model that most of the reconstruction drawings of this book are based. The costs of making these drawings were carried by the University of California; the costs for the construction of the model itself by the Council of Europe.42 42 After the closing of the Karl der Grosse exhibition, the model was transferred to the Burg Frankenberg Museum, Aachen, and is now under the guardianship of the Director of the Museen der Stadt Aachen. A new model, in process of construction, will become the property of the University Art Museum, University of California, Berkeley. A brief description of the model and the criteria used in the reconstruction of its various installations was published in the catalogue of the Aachen Exhibition.43 43 Karl der Grosse, Werk und Wirkung, ed. Wolfgang Braunfels (Aachen, 1965), 402-10; also published as Charlemagne, Œuvre Rayonnement et Sarvivances, ed. Wolfgang Braunfels (Aachen, 1965), 391-400. Also cf. Karl der Grosse, Lebenswerk und Nachleben, for a listing of five volumes in this definitive series. OTHER MORE GENERAL WORKS &amp; NEW CRITICAL EDITIONS I cannot conclude this review of the historical and bibliographical vicissitudes of the Plan of St. Gall without drawing attention to two further events of vital importance for this study, neither of them directly concerned with the Plan. The first of these was the publication in 1910-43 of the six volumes of Emile Lesne's monumental Histoire de la propriété ecclésiastique,44 44 Lesne, 1910-43. a veritable storehouse of knowledge, harboring a wealth of information on the monastery as a legal, manorial, administrative, and educational institution. The second was the publication, in 1963, under the general editorship of Kassius Hallinger, OSB, by the Pontifical Athenaean Institute of St. Anselm, in Rome, of the first volume of the Corpus consuetudinum monasticarum,45 45 Corpus consuetudinum monasticarum, ed. K. Hallinger, I, 1963. Since these lines were written, this publication was augmented by two further volumes (II, 1963; III/IV, 1967). a new critical edition of the monastic consuetudinaries of the eighth and ninth centuries, elucidated by a critical apparatus of incomparable excellence and including inter alia the new edition of such crucial contemporary sources as the resolutions, preliminary and final, drawn up in 816 and 817 in connection with the two reform synods of Aachen,46 46 Legislatio Aquisgranensis, ed. Semmler, Corp. Cons. Mon. I, 423-82; superseding earlier editions of the monastic legislation of 816-817, Bruno Albers (ed.), Consuetudines monasticae, III, 1907, 79ff. and 115ff. as well as that masterpiece of administrative and manorial logistics, the so-called Statutes of Adalhard of Corbie (Consuetudines Corbeienses), drawn up in January 1821/22 by one of the most distinguished abbots of the Frankish empire.47 47 Semmler, in Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 355-422; superseding an earlier edition by Leon Levillain, 1900, 338-86. A complete translation of this informative source, by my colleague Charles W. Jones, will be found in Appendix II.48 48 See Vol. III, 93ff. The publication of this vast collection of monastic consuetudinaries was preceded and accompanied by a series of penetrating studies on the monastic legislation enacted during the reign of Louis the Pious, from the pen of one of its principal editors, Dr. Joseph Semmler,49 49 Semmler, 1958, 1958/60, 1960, 1963; and Verhulst and Semmler, 1962. which opened new avenues for the understanding of the monastic reform movement that forms the spiritual home of the Plan of St. Gall. My indebtedness to the Corpus consuetudinum monasticarum and the distinguished editors and commentators is visible in countless places throughout this book. 2. PLAN OF ST. GALL: THE DEDICATORY LEGEND Addressed to Abbot Gozbert of St. Gall (806-836) by a churchman of higher rank who fails to identify himself, this letter of transmission discloses (in the term EXEMPLATA) that the Plan is not an original but a copy, and therefore presumes the existence of a prototype. The nature of its scripts reveals that the copy was made in the Abbey of Reichenau, perhaps around 820, but not earlier than 816/817 or later than 830, the year in which Gozbert began to rebuild his monastery with the aid of the Plan. The placement of the letter on the Plan's upper margin reveals that this scheme was to be viewed from west to east, not from south to north as would be the case in similar post-medieval, and modern layouts. A typographic transliteration of the letter with English translation is shown on the opposite page I.1.7 THE SCOPE OF THE PRESENT STUDY The opinions voiced on the various problems raised by the Plan of St. Gall are numberless and, scattered as they are in a vast array of books and disparate journals, prove to be beyond the control of anyone but the most dogged specialist. The time, therefore, is ripe for a general synthesis of this scattered knowledge, and for a thorough and comprehensive review of the issues raised in these discussions. Two queries, hitherto unsolved, require special consideration, and perhaps more space than is desirable in the context of the summary study that we have proposed. The first of these is the highly controversial question of the scale and construction methods followed in the Plan of St. Gall, its initial mental conception and the actual drawing up of the original scheme. The second is the question of the constructional nature of the monastery's guest and service structures. The former is the most tangled and most widely debated single issue of the Plan;50 50 See below, pp. 77-111. the latter, the most difficult and most complex, but also probably the most rewarding. To settle it would be a breakthrough, not only because of the light it would throw on the history of monastic building, but also because of the contribution it would make to our knowledge of vernacular architecture at the time of Charlemagne and Louis the Pious.51 51 It forms the scope of Vol. II of this study. I. 2 THE DEDICATORY LEGEND I.2.1 WORDING AND IMPLICATIONS Our primary source of information concerning the circumstances that led to the making of the Plan is the transmittal note of seven lines that is written on the upper margin of the Plan (fig. 2): Haec tibi dulcissime fili coz&amp;#x0180;te de posicione officinarum paucis exemplata direxi. quibus sollertiam exerceas tu?. meamq. deuotion? utcumq. cognoscas. qua tuae bonae uolun tati satisfacere me segnem non inueniri confido. Ne suspiceris autem me haec ideo elaborasse. quod uos putemus nr??s indigere magisteriis. sed potius ob amor? dei tibi soli pscrutinanda pinxisse amicabili fr?n?itatis intuitu crede. Uale in xp?? semp memor nri am?. Translated freely into English this text reads: For thee, my sweetest son Gozbertus, have I drawn this briefly annotated copy of the layout of the monastic buildings,1 1 Like Bernhard Bischoff (in Studien, 1962, 67ff) and Wolfgang Hafner (ibid., 178ff), I am translating officina in the comprehensive sense of "monastic buildings" rather than in the limited sense of "workshops" suggested by Poeschel (1957, and in Studien, 1962, 29ff). Cf. below pp. 50ff. with which you may exercise your ingenuity and recognize my devotion, whereby I trust you do not find me slow to satisfy your wishes. Do not imagine that I have undertaken this task supposing you to stand in need of our instruction, but rather believe that out of love of God and in the friendly zeal of brotherhood I have depicted this for you alone to scrutinize. Farewell in Christ, always mindful of us, Amen. This transmittal note provides the following points of information: 1. In undertaking his task the author of the Plan of St. Gall had available for his guidance a prototype plan, since he refers to his own work as exemplata, that is, "copied."2 2 Faulty translation of exemplata, past participle of the verb exemplare —"to copy" or "to transcribe"—has confused the discussion of the Plan of St. Gall ever since Robert Willis (1848, 87) interpreted exemplare in the sense of "to make" or "to work out." Keller (1844), Campion (1868), and Cabrol-Leclercq (VI:1, 1924) by-passed the issue by not translating the transmittal note. Reinhardt (1937, 277, note 2; and 1952, 16) translated the term exemplare in the sense of "to make by way of example." The first to suggest that exemplare must be translated in the sense of "to copy" was Alphons Dopsch (1916, 67). His view was shared by Konrad Beyerle (I, 1925, 82), and by Hecht (I, 1928, 23). The latter translated the passage into German: "Mein süsser Sohn Gozbert, ich habe diese Kopie der Anlage des Klosters an dich gesandt . . ." Bischoff's convincing arguments (Studien, 1962, 67-68) have settled this problem once and for all. See also Horn (Studien, 1962, 79-80); and below, pp. 15ff. 2. The Plan was to be used for some specific building program, since it was transmitted to its recipient, Gozbert, with the remark "with which you may exercise your ingenuity." 3. The Plan must have been made at Gozbert's request, since its maker states: "Whereby I trust you do not find me slow to satisfy your wishes." 4. The writer of the transmittal note was a person of higher standing in the administrative hierarchy of the church than its receiver, since otherwise he could not have addressed him as "my sweetest son." I. 3 ABBOT GOZBERT, ORDERER &amp; RECEIVER OF THE PLAN I.3.1 GOZBERT'S IDENTITY There is general agreement that the "Gozbertus" to whom the dedicatory legend is addressed is the abbot of this name who presided over the monastery of St. Gall from 816 to 836, and who around 830 initiated a building program whose aim was totally to reconstruct this old and venerable settlement.1 1 An earlier view of Keller's (1844, 11) and Meyer von Knonau's (1879, 523), according to which the Cozertus named in the transmittal note was identical with Gozbert the Younger (a nephew of Abbot Gozbert of St. Gall who is frequently mentioned in documents since 816) is now generally abandoned; cf. Duft, in Studien, 1962, 42-43. That the Plan was made for St. Gall is suggested not only by the fact that it has been in the possession of the library of this monastery ever since the ninth century, but also by the more explicit evidence that the high altar of the church of the Plan is dedicated jointly to St. Mary and St. Gall (altare sca? mariae &amp; sc?? galli).2 2 See below, pp. 139ff. I.3.2 ST. GALL AT THE TIME OF GOZBERT'S ACCESSION In 816, when Gozbert became abbot, the Monastery of St. Gall must have consisted of an aggregation of unimpressive and superannuated buildings. The houses of the original cell, erected in the Irish tradition3 3 The first settlement, built by St. Gall for himself and twelve companions, consisted of a small wooden oratory, whose entrance was so low that a thief called Erchuald smashed his head against the door lintel in making a hasty escape from the sanctuary. The houses of the monks were likewise built in timber. For a summary on what is known about the original cell see Poeschel, 1961, 4-6. His sources are chaps. 29 and 30 of the Vita Galli confessoris triplex, published by Krusch in Mon. Germ. Hist., Script. rer. Merov., IV, 1902, 229-337. had been substantially remodelled by Abbot Otmar (719-759)4 4 The most recent discussion of the life and the accomplishments of Abbot Otmar is to be found in Duft, 1959, where all of the basic sources are compiled (Latin and German translation). who in compliance with an order issued in 747 by King Carloman and his brother Pippin5 5 On this important event see Duft, op. cit., 24-25 and 42-43. converted the abbey from the Irish to the Benedictine rule. This change in custom undoubtedly necessitated the replacement of the loosely scattered houses of the original settlement6 6 On the traditional layout of the Irish monastery see below, p. 243. by a more ordered claustral complex where the monks slept in a single dormitory and took their meals in a common eating hall. Just precisely how this was done, remains obscure. The sources make it fairly clear, however, that Otmar replaced the modest timbered oratory of St. Gall with a masonry church, the nave of which rose to a height of 40 feet.7 7 That it was built in stone can be inferred from the fact that when this building was demolished in 830 to make room for Gozbert's new church. its walls were destroyed by a battering ram (muros ecclesiae machinis aggressi, crebris arietum ictibus ruere compulerunt). Vita sancti Otmari, chap. 16; ed. von Arx, Mon. Germ. Hist., Script. II, 1829, 46-47. The height of the church is mentioned in chap. 12 of this Vita where it is said that a serf fell from the roof of the church with a load of shingles on his shoulder and, after a fall of "not less than forty feet" landed on the sarcophagus of the Saint unharmed (cum et altitadine tecti unde supradictus home cediderat, non minus quadraginta pedum mensura a terra esset suspensa). Op. cit., 45-60. This building had beneath its presbytery a crypt sufficiently large to accommodate not only the sarcophagus of St. Gall, but also an altar and whatever additional space was needed for the attendant monks and priests to celebrate religious services at and around this altar.8 8 The sources are Vita sancti Golli, chaps. 13, 65, and 72. For more detail see below, pp. 141ff and 169ff. As far as the rest of the monastery is concerned, the sources simply tell us that Otmar "adapted the layout of the monastery to the diverse needs by erecting all around dwellings that were suited for the use by the monks" (undique versum habitacula monachorum usibus congrua disposite construens eiusdem sancti statum loci utilitatibus diversis aptavit)9 9 Liber de miraculis sancti Galli, chap. 10; ed. Duft, 1959, 41-43; and Vita sancti Otmari abbatis, chap. 1; ibid., 24-25. Poeschel, 1961, 9 seems to me to strain these sources when he expressed the view that the wording of these passages suggests that Otmar did not abolish the Irish layout of the original settlement with its scattered houses, where monks lived in individual cells. and that this program included a hospice for pilgrims and paupers as well as a special infirmary for lepers.10 10 Vita sancti Otmari, chap. 2; ed. Duft, 1959, 26-29. There is no evidence that Otmar's successors continued this work or improved upon it. But the history of succeeding decades shows that much of the property of the abbey was unrightfully seized by the Counts Warin and Ruthard, who imprisoned Otmar and put him into exile, and that similar infractions were committed by the Bishop of Constance, in whose diocese the abbey was located.11 11 On the fraudulent alienation of many of the abbey's outlying estates by the Counts Warin and Ruthard and the infractions committed by Bishop Sydonius of Constance see Vita sancti Otmari, chaps. 5-7 (ed. Duft, 1959, 32-35); Liber de miraculis sancti Galli, chaps. 14-17 (ibid., 44-53); and Ratpert's De casibus sancti Galli, chap. 6 (ibid., 54-57). Economically St. Gall entered into a period of stagnation, if not actual decline. I.3.3 ADMINISTRATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS, DECISION to REBUILD THE MONASTERY Abbot Gozbert not only stopped, but reversed this trend and thus led the monastery into an age of unprecedented prosperity. Even in the first year of his abbacy he scored a brilliant success by obtaining territorial independence from the see of Constance.12 12 On the relation of St. Gall to Constance, see Mayer, 1952. For other literature on Gozbert's achievements, see Duft's "Gozbert," 1964, 692. Two years later, in 818, the monastery was granted the formal immunity of a royal abbey.13 13 The document, which frees the monastery from the control of the Bishop of Constance and places it under the sole and direct jurisdiction of Emperor Louis the Pious, is reprinted in Wartmann, I, 1863, 226, No. 234. In the years that followed, Gozbert not only retrieved, through vigorous litigation, the rights and properties that the abbey had lost through fraud and lawless alienation, but augmented its wealth beyond all previous standards by his skill in soliciting additional gifts.14 14 With regard to Gozbert's contributions to the economic growth of St. Gall, see Bikel, 1914, 10ff; and Hecht, I, 1928, 17. By 830 the monastic economy had gathered sufficient strength to enable him to launch his most ambitious project, the monastery's architectural reconstruction. We are well informed about this project by reliable contemporary sources that tell us that Gozbert started the work by destroying the old church, and that he progressed with the new church so rapidly that it could be dedicated in 837 (one year after his resignation) in the presence of the bishops of Constance and Basel, and the abbot of the nearby monastery of Reichenau.15 15 An excellent summary of Abbot Gozbert's progress in rebuilding the church will be found in Hecht, ibid., 29ff with ample reference to the original sources, the most important of which is Ratperti casus sancti Galli, chap. 16; ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1872, 28ff. Cf. also Poeschel, 1961, 29ff. It was Gozbert's need for proper guidance in the execution of this building project that had prompted him to request, from a churchman of higher rank, the copy of a master plan for a monastic settlement, which we now know as the Plan of St. Gall. To what extent he used the Plan in pursuing this task will be discussed in a later chapter. I. 4 THE MAKER OF THE PLAN: BISHOP HAITO OF BASEL? I.4.1 OTHER CONTENDERS &amp; OTHER VIEWS Although there is little doubt about the person for whom the Plan of St. Gall was made, we are not certain about the identity of the person who made the Plan. In the vast and steadily increasing body of literature that has been devoted to this problem ever since the Plan of St. Gall was first discussed by Henricus Canisius in 1604,1 1 Canisius, V:2, 1604, 780ff. its authorship has been attributed to such diverse persons as Einhard, the friend and biographer of Charlemagne;2 2 Mabillon, Annales, II, 1704, 571-72. Gerungus, a distinguished official at the emperor's court;3 3 Mon. Germ. Hist., Script., ed. von Arx, I, 1826, 60, note 4. Frotharius, bishop of Toul;4 4 Digot, 1853, 127ff. Digot's attribution of the Plan of St. Gall to Bishop Frotharius of Toul was based on two arguments: the fact that Bishop Frotharius was an experienced architect (a capacity in which he also was employed by the court), and that there was a distinct analogy in style between the transmittal note of the Plan of St. Gall and the Latinity of the letters of Bishop Frotharius (the latter have been published by Dom Martin Bouquet, VI, 1870, 386-98). Both arguments are extremely tenuous. Digot's views were adopted without modification by Leclercq, and became widely known through the latter's article, "Saint-Gall," in Cabrol-Leclercq, VI:1, 1924, cols. 87-88. Ansegis, abbot of Fontanella (St.Wandrille);5 5 Jacob Burckhardt, in a review of Ferdinand Keller, 1844; see Kaegi, II, 1950, 554-57. Hrabanus Maurus, abbot of Fulda;6 6 Rahn, 1876, 89. Reginbertus, headmaster of the monastic school at Reichenau;7 7 Dopsch, 1916, 63ff. and Haito, bishop of Basel (803-823) and abbot of the nearby monastery of Reichenau (806-823).8 8 Beyerle, 1925, 82. I.4.2 HAITO: THE MOST REASONABLE CHOICE Konrad Beyerle, who proposed Bishop Haito as the author of the Plan, pointed with good reason to the fact that Haito's dual rank of bishop of Basel and abbot of the monastery of Reichenau would well account for that peculiar blend of paternal condescension ("my sweetest son Gozbertus") and brotherly devotion ("in the friendly zeal of brotherhood I have depicted this for you") that characterizes the spirit of the address with which the author of the Plan transmits the product of his labors to Gozbert.9 9 Ibid. Reinhardt rejects this line of reasoning with the argument that, as bishop of Basel, Haito could not have addressed Abbot Gozbert as "my sweetest son," because the abbey of St. Gall lay in the diocese of Constance, not Basel, and therefore Haito was not his direct superior.10 10 Reinhardt, 1952, 16-17. It is true that even after it was granted manorial independence, in 816, the monastery of St. Gall remained under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the See of Constance, but the contention that only the direct superior could address an abbot in this manner is not based on historical evidence. Whatever the boundaries of his diocese, in the hierarchy of the church, the bishop held the higher rank.11 11 The jurisdictional authority of the bishop over the abbot had been established by St. Benedict of Nursia in chapters 62, 64, and 65 of his Rule (see Benedicti regula, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 144ff; ed. McCann, 1952, 140ff; ed. Steidle, 1952, 302ff) and was continually reasserted in the Middle Ages despite unceasing attempts on the part of the abbots to free themselves from episcopal control. See the pertinent remarks on the episcopate and monachism in Hauck, II, 1912, 58ff, 241ff. To be sure, Haito was not the only bishop in the empire of Louis the Pious to hold an episcopate and an abbacy at 3. PLAN OF ST. GALL HOUSE FOR HORSES &amp; OXEN &amp; THEIR KEEPERS Detail showing writing of both scribes the same time—there were few in fact who did not.12 12 Cf. Hauck's informative remarks on this subject, ibid., 208. But as abbot of Reichenau, Haito was a close neighbor of Abbot Gozbert of St. Gall and therefore unquestionably well acquainted with him. None of the other contenders for authorship of the Plan of St. Gall have these qualifications. Einhard was trained at Fulda and in the palace school at Aachen, and while as the emperor's personal friend and adviser he played a prominent role at the court, he never rose to a church position higher than that of abbot.13 13 For a brief review of Einhard's career, see von Schubert, 1921, 742-43. Einhard was a lay abbot, and does not seem to have received even the lower orders. That he, only an abbot, could not have used the address dulcissime fili to another person of the same rank had already been pointed out by Digot (1853, 128). To this argument I have added the observation that the standard formula used by Einhard in addressing other abbots always ended with the words "Einhard the Sinner" (Horn, in Studien, 1962, 107, note 21). The collection of Einhard's letters (by Hampe in Mon. Germ. Hist., Ep. V, 1899, 105-45) contains one letter addressed to Abbot Gozbert of St. Gall (ibid., 129, No. 39). Its opening line reads: "Religioso Christi famulo Gozberto venerabili Abbati E[hinhartas] P[eccator]." This has a ring quite different from the dulcissime fili of the author of the transmittal note of the Plan of St. Gall. For a more complete account on Einhard, see the works discussed by Francois L. Ganshof, 1924. The name of Gerungus, who held the rank of an ostiarius at the Palace of Aachen, has never been taken seriously by any student of the Plan, apart from its original proponent, and was convincingly refuted in 1884 by Joseph Neuwirth.14 14 Neuwirth, 1884, 14-15. Hrabanus Maurus, the famed abbot of Fulda, was trained in the schools of Fulda and Tours, and rose to the rank of bishop only toward the end of his life, in 847.15 15 For a brief review of the life of Abbot Hrabanus Maurus, see von Schubert, 1921, 731-33. Abbot Ansegis of St.-Wandrille was trained in St.-Wandrille and possibly at the palace school of Aachen.16 16 See Gesta abbatum Fontanellensium; ed. Loenwenfeld, 1886, 49; and the more recent edition of Lohier-Laporte, Gesta SS. Patr. Font. Coenobii, 1936, 92ff. Ansegis, born around 770, entered the monastery of St.Wandrille at the time of Abbot Geroaldus (787-806), a relative of his, who introduced him to the palace ("Denique, tenente locum regiminis huius coenobii Geroaldo abbate, propinquo suo, hoc accessit monasterium tonsuramque capitis ab eo suscipit. Denique non multo post ad palatium eum perducens, in manus gloriosissimi regis Karoli commendare studuit.") For further information on Abbot Ansegis, see the article by P. Fournier, "Anségise," in DHGE, III, 1914, cols. 447-48 and the translation of the Constitution of Ansegis by Charles W. Jones, III, Addendum II, 125. Bishop Frotharius of Toul, the only one besides Bishop Haito of Basel who would have qualified by virtue of rank, was schooled in the monastery of Gorze.17 17 See Gesta episcoporum Tullensium; ed. Waitz, VIII, 1848, 637, and the article "Frothaire," in Chevalier, I, 1905, col. 1621. Reginbertus, lastly, the headmaster of the school of Reichenau, who would have qualified by virtue of his training, stood in no relation to Abbot Gozbert that would justify the address dulcissime fili.18 18 Dopsch's suggestion of "Gozbert's aged teacher, Reginbertus of Reichenau" has been convincingly refuted, in my opinion, by Beyerle (1925, 82), who proved that there is no evidence that Gozbert received his training at the school of Reichenau. While it is conceivable—although perhaps not very likely—that a teacher, as pater spiritualis (a possibility that Father Iso Müller had brought to the attention of the International Symposium at St. Gall in 1957), might continue to use the address dulcissime fili even after his former pupil had risen to the rank of abbot, this would be applicable to Reginbertus of Reichenau only, of course, if it could be established that Gozbert had been his pupil. This leaves Bishop Haito of Basel as the only reasonable choice among all the persons proposed as makers of the Plan. Moreover, new weight was added to this view in 1957 by Bernhard Bischoff's careful paleographical analysis of the textual annotations of the Plan, which showed that the explanatory titles were written in the monastery of Reichenau. 4. PLAN OF ST. GALL NORTH PORCH OF WESTERN PARADISE First three lines by second scribe, last three lines by main scribe I. 5 THE EXPLANATORY LEGENDS AND THE SCRIPTORIAL HOME OF THE PLAN I.5.1 DISTINCTION BETWEEN GENERAL AND SPECIFIC TITLES Apart from the transmittal note discussed above, the explanatory legends of the Plan consist of 340 titles of varying length which describe the purpose of each building, the function of the individual rooms, as well as the equipment and furnishings therein. The general purpose of each building, as a rule, is described in a verse (hexameter or distich), written parallel to and at a small distance from the entrance wall of the house to which it pertains. The titles that define the internal functions of each building are written in prose.1 1 I must stress this point, since Bischoff's remark that in a great many cases the verses "simply synthesize or paraphrase the significance of an individual structure without adding anything new to what may be gathered more clearly from the prose inscriptions" is misleading (Bischoff, in Studien, 1962, 74). For the majority of buildings supplied with metrical legends this is distinctly not the case. I cite as a typical example the inscriptions of the House of Distinguished Guests: the general purpose of this house is expressed in a hexameter that runs parallel to the entrance side of the building, Haec domus hospitibus parta est quoque suscipiendis. The verse explains the general purpose of this structure and could be simply translated: "This, too, is a house for guests" ("too," in contradistinction to the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers). This general definition is not repeated in any of the prose titles entered in the interior of the structure, all of which designate the purpose of individual rooms, or the nature of an individual piece of furniture in these rooms. Bischoff's unawareness of the difference between the general (metrical) and specific (prose) titles may have been occasioned by the untraditional use of the term domus, which on the Plan of St. Gall is never used to designate the whole of a house (its classical and traditional meaning), but always refers to the large central hall in the interior of the house which contains the hearth and serves as general living room (for further details, see II, 77, and III, Glossary, s.v. They are always inscribed in the center of the area they describe or as close to the center of that area as conditions permit. Exceptions to this are made in only a few cases, where the object is too small to accommodate its title, such as the cupboards (toregmata) in the dining hall of the House for Distinguished Guests (fig. 396),2 2 See II, 160. the abbot's living room (fig. 251),3 3 See below, pp. 321ff. and the Monks' Refectory (fig. 211).4 4 See below, pp. 269ff. I.5.2 TWO HANDS REPRESENTING TWO STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT IN THE SCRIPTORIUM OF REICHENAU A careful paleographical analysis by Bernhard Bischoff of the textual annotations of the Plan established the monastery of Reichenau as the scriptorial home of the Plan.5 5 See Bischoff, in Studien, 1962, 67-78; and reprint of this study in Bischoff, Mittelalterliche Studien, I 1966, 41-49. Bischoff distinguishes two hands, working in close co-operation but representing two different developmental stages of writing within the scriptorium of the abbey of Reichenau: that of a younger man, the "main scribe," who is responsible for 265 of the 340 entries, and that of an older man, the "second scribe," who wrote the remainder. The main scribe rendered his legends in a deep-brown ink almost bordering on black. He wrote in a small, crisp, and finely articulated Carolingian minuscule, making use of relatively closely spaced and nearly perpendicular letters with long ascenders.6 6 For further paleographical distinctions, see ibid., 69; and below, p. 53f. This scribe is also responsible for the letter of transmittal on the upper margin of the Plan (fig. 2) and for ten legends written in capitalis rustica.7 7 One in the road that gives access to the Church, five in the Church itself, one in the church of the Novitiate and the Infirmary, one in the Monks' Vegetable Garden, one in the Goosehouse and one in the Henhouse. The second scribe rendered his legends in a pale-brown ink. He wrote a minuscule of more rigid perpendicularity, spacing his letters a little farther apart and using shorter ascenders. The entries of this scribe are confined to the designations of the trees and plants in the two monastic gardens (figs. 414 and 426),8 8 See below, p. 101, and III, Appendix I. the names of the trees in the Cemetery (fig. 430),9 9 See below, pp. 212ff, and III, ibid. the titles of the ten altars in the aisles of the Church (fig. 93),10 10 See below, p. 122, and III, ibid. the titles for the altars in the Church towers;11 11 See below, p. 120, and III, ibid. as well as some lines which look like additions, such as the supra camera et solarium in the Abbot's House (fig. 251),12 12 See below, pp. 321ff, and III, ibid. the infra supra tabulatum in the House for Horses and Oxen (fig. 3),13 13 See below, pp. 271ff, and III, ibid. and the first three lines of the verse that identifies the function of the Porch connecting the western paradise of the Church with the grounds of the House for Distinguished Guests (fig. 4).14 14 See below, p. 128, and III, ibid. Bischoff was able to identify the hand of the main scribe as that of a monk who, at an earlier stage of his career, wrote a Vita sancti Bonifatii on fols. 2v-19 (fig. 5) of a hagiographical ms. (Karlsruhe, Codex Augiensis CXXXVI) written in the monastery of Reichenau under the direction of its erudite librarian, Reginbert. His script suggests that he is a younger man, whose style of writing has been influenced by a temporary sojourn in Fulda.15 15 Bischoff, in Studien, 71-74. 5. VITA SANCTI BONIFATII. KARLSRUHE, BADISGHE LANDESBIBLIOTHEK. Codex Augiensis CXXXVI, fol. 14v Script written by main scribe of the Plan of St. Gall (courtesy of the Badische Landesbibliothek, Karlsruhe). Illustration enlarged 1.07 ×. The script of the second scribe is that of an older man, and its basic paleographical features are so similar to those of Reginbert himself—the last among the classical Carolingian writers to use this type of script (he died in 846)—that Bischoff feels it might well be the product of Reginbert's own hand.16 16 Ibid., 73, note 16: ". . . die Identität des `alemannischen' Schreibers, der die Arbeit leitete . . . mit Reginbert möchte ich für wahrscheinlich halten, ohne sie jedoch für bewiesen anzusehen." From the nature of his textual entries, which have the appearance of what Bischoff calls "katalogartige Nachträge," Bischoff infers that the second hand acted in a supervisory capacity, filling in and completing where the knowledge of the main scribe ended. Contrary to this general relationship, however, there is one entry—the legend that defines the function of the Porch connecting the western paradise of the Church with the grounds of the House for Distinguished Guests—in which the first three lines are written in the ductus and pale-brown ink of the "supervising" hand (the hexameter, Exi &amp; hic hospes uel templi tecta subibit), whereas the three lines that complete this verse are written in the style and dark-brown ink of the main hand (the pentameter, Discentis scolae pulchra iuuenta simul). The co-operation between the main scribe and the supervising scribe, Bischoff infers from this, must have been extremely close. I.5.3 CONCEPT OF AUTHORSHIP &amp; HAITO To what extent do Bischoff's findings on the paleographical nature of the explanatory titles of the Plan confirm or contradict our theory of Haito's authorship? They make one point quite clear: Haito cannot have been identical with the scribe who wrote the letter of transmittal and the majority of the other titles of the Plan. At the time the Plan was made, Haito was not a young man. He was already around fifty-eight years of age in 820.17 17 With regard to Haito's career, see Horn, in Studien, 1962, 102; and idem, 1962, 110. These findings, however, do not in my opinion disqualify Haito from the authorship of the Plan. The concept of authorship in the Middle Ages is complex. Bischoff himself furnishes us with an excellent case in point. The above-mentioned Codex Augiensis CXXXVI contains on folio IV an annotation in which Reginbert of Reichenau refers to himself in unequivocal terms as the "fabricator" of the book, "Hunc libellum . . . meo studio confeci." Yet besides this entry on folio IV, some chapter headings on folios 21r, 24r, and 28r, and some isolated corrections here and there, no other line of this work is written in his own hand.18 18 Bischoff, in Studien, 71-72. It is not necessary, with this concept of authorship, to expect that the person who in the transmittal note of the Plan defines himself as its maker should actually have traced the Plan or written its explanatory titles. He is the person who directed that the Plan be made, and who— once it was made—transmitted it to the person by whom it had been requested. Bischoff has established that the explanatory titles of the Plan were written in the monastery of Reichenau, perhaps under the supervision of Reginbert, with the assistance of a scribe who had co-operated with Reginbert in other literary endeavors. Reginbert is not a likely candidate for the authorship of the Plan for reasons that I have stated in the preceding chapter. This leaves, once more, as the only logical choice, Bishop Haito of Basel who, as the superior of the two, might very well have availed himself of their joint support in making the Plan. As one of the leading bishops and abbots in the empire, Haito is furthermore a person who can be expected to have had access to the prototype plan. I. 6 ORIGINAL OR COPY? I.6.1 SOME TECHNICAL OBSERVATIONS That the Plan of St. Gall is a "copy" rather than an "original" must be inferred not only from the fact that its maker refers to it as exemplata, i.e., "transcribed" or "copied," but also from a variety of observations of a technical nature, on which I have reported in a previous study.1 1 The observations reviewed here were first presented in a paper read before the International Symposium at St. Gall, in the morning session of June 13, 1957, and subsequently published in Studien, 1962, 79-102. A careful examination of the particulars of the design of the Plan shows that it was traced, like a modern "overlay," on pieces of parchment that were superimposed upon a prototype plan. This is revealed by the following facts: 1. The Plan does not show any underdrawing, as would be inevitable in a layout of this complexity if it were an original design. 2. The Plan exhibits in several places angular distortions in the alignment of rectangular structures which are characteristic of the displacement that occurs in tracing if in the course of work the overlay inadvertently shifts a few degrees from its initial alignment with the original and this shift is not immediately corrected. 3. The drawing is full of minor inaccuracies and inconsistencies that appear to be incompatible with the exacting calculations prerequisite to the development of an architectural drawing of this complexity; and it is rendered in a fluid style not apt to be found in the work of a man who went through the developmental labor of this demanding task. In what follows I shall elaborate on these observations. ABSENCE OF UNDERDRAWING In figure 6, I have reproduced a detail of a well-known architectural drawing of the thirteenth century which renders the ground floor of the southern tower of Cologne Cathedral.2 2 Reproduced with the kind permission of Professor Siegfried Freiberg of the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Vienna. For a reproduction of the entire drawing (No. 16.873 of the Kupferstichkabinett der Akademie der Bildenden Künste) see Hans Tietze, 1931, 169. Misinterpreted by Tietze in several respects, the plan was thoroughly rediscussed and reevaluated by Hans Kauffmann, 1948, 80-88. This design, which is a typical example of its kind, shows how in laying out his plan a medieval architect avails himself of an elaborate framework of auxiliary construction lines and reference points which he presses into the parchment with a fine stylus or silverpoint before committing his drawing to ink. This constructional reference work guides his eye as the drawing is being executed and remains visible as an underdrawing, in the form of thin grooves and fine prickings,3 3 These fine prickings are not so easily detected on photographs as on the original. Two typical examples, not discernible in the reproductions shown in figure 6, are indicated by arrows. in those portions of the design which are not covered by ink in the final stage of the work.4 4 For further details see Horn, in Studien, 1962, 82. In contrast to this, on the entire Plan of St. Gall there is not a single line of this type to be found.5 5 In an earlier stage of my studies (Horn, ibid., 82-83) I expressed the thought that a shaded ridge that runs in the axis of the southern nave arcade (most clearly visible in interstice of the first two columns, counting from west, and in its prolongation of their axis through the western paradise) might have served as a base line to fall back on in case the two skins should shift in the course of tracing; but the fact that this line (not drawn with the aid of a stylus, but more likely the result of a deliberate folding and restretching of sheet 2 before it was attached to sheet 1; cf. below, 35ff) coincides with the deflected rather than the original axis of the Church discredits this view. The absence of such auxiliary construction work is most conspicuous in 6. ARCHITECTURAL DRAWING: DETAIL, FACSIMILE 13th century VIENNA, AKADEMIE DER BILDENDEN KÜNSTE, KUPFERSTICHKABINET Plan of buttressed pier in the southwest tower of Cologne Cathedral. The drawing of which this detail is a part measures 700 × 610 mm. See comments for figure 9. 7. PLAN OF ST. GALL Alignment of Outer School, House for Distinguished Guests, and Kitchen, Bake, and Brew House for Distinguished Guests. The superimposed black lines show which course the outer walls of buildings would have taken had they been drawn with instruments. The largest departure from parallelism at the end of lines running askew because of inaccuracies incurred in tracing are 4 mm at the bottom of fig. 7 and 6 mm at the top of fig. 8. areas where buildings of equal width are grouped in single and double rows, or in the interior of buildings whose layout is so complex that it could not have been drawn without a linear frame of reference. This can be illustrated by some typical examples. ABSENCE OF GUIDING CONSTRUCTION LINES IN THE ALIGNMENT OF BUILDINGS Reproduced in figure 7 is a portion of the building site to the north of the Church, showing (from top to bottom) the western end of the Outer School, the House for Distinguished Guests, and the Kitchen, Bake, and Brew House for Distinguished Guests. Examination of the open spaces between these structures shows that the parchment here has never been touched by a stylus. This had noticeable consequences for the style of these drawings: the walls that form the outer boundaries of these houses do not stay "in line," most drastically so in the case of the Kitchen, Bake, and Brew House, whose southern gable wall slants away from its proper alignment by an angle of two degrees. If the parchment surface had been provided with guiding construction lines, the draftsman's hand could never have slipped away from its regular course as far as it did when drawing the southern walls of the Kitchen and Bake House, converting a building that was of rectangular shape into a trapezoid structure. An even more flagrant case of the divergence of lines meant to run parallel to one another is to be found on the opposite side of the Plan in the alignment of the three buildings that contain the Mill, the Mortar, and the Drying Kiln (fig. 8). This kind of linear aberration might easily occur in the process of copying when the translucency of the skin on which the Plan was being traced was temporarily marred by changing light conditions, but would be unlikely to occur on an original where the quill of the draftsman followed the grooves of a constructional underdrawing. On the Plan of St. Gall such grooves can be discovered neither on the recto in the form of the familiar furrows nor on the verso in the form of thin ridges. Throughout the entire expanse of the Plan, with its total of forty separate structures of varying size, no trace is to be discovered of any underdrawing that would have enabled the architect to fix the dimensions of an individual structure within the aggregate of its superordinate building site, or the boundaries of the individual building site within the layout of the entire Plan. Yet it is obvious that even the most accomplished architectural draftsman could not assemble such a variety of different structures into an over-all design of such complexity without the aid of a guiding underdrawing. In the absence of underdrawing, the design can only have been produced by tracing. Parchment, because of its relative opacity, is not an ideal medium for tracing; but designs can be traced directly from one sheet of parchment to another, as may be established easily by experimentation in any library that is provided with scraps of medieval manuscripts.6 6 It cannot be done easily if the two skins are laid flat upon the surface of a dark table, but can be accomplished without difficulty if they are held against a windowpane or against a lighted surface reflecting the sun in sufficient strength to project the design of the original through the transparent body of the skin above it on which the design is to be redrawn. I am most grateful to Dr. Johannes Duft for helping me to establish this fact by superimposing sheets of medieval parchment of varying thickness from the archives of the monastery of St. Gall and observing their translucency under different light conditions. To produce a tracing from an original of some 30½ × 44 inches is nevertheless not an easy task, even though the tracing was done on three separate sheets. In order to keep the original under sufficient tension to provide a solid base for the hand of the copying draftsman and to permit him to move it in the direction of the required light, it must have been mounted on a wooden frame. To a medieval scribe the mounting and stretching of skins on wooden frames was a familiar practice, as it was a standard procedure in the manufacture of parchment. (Since these lines were written I have had occasion to experiment with recently manufactured sheets of parchment, and have been able to infer from this that fresh parchment is considerably more translucent than parchment yellowed by age. If the sheets on which the Plan of St. Gall is drawn were at the time of their manufacture as white and translucent as modern pieces of parchment of the same thickness, the tracing could have been produced on a table.) ABSENCE OF GUIDING UNDERDRAWING IN THE INTERNAL LAYOUT OF INDIVIDUAL BUILDINGS An examination of the procedure followed in the construction of the internal layout of the various buildings leads us to the same conclusions. No building illustrates this fact more persuasively than the Monks' Dormitory. The Dormitory of the monks (fig. 60.A) accommodates a total of seventy-seven beds. These are arranged in a complicated pattern, resembling the letter U along the two side walls, and the letter H (the U-pattern of the side walls coupled) along the center of the building. One does not have to look twice at this complex arrangement to realize that it is impossible to distribute seventy-seven beds in the manner just described within an area of such small dimensions without a carefully calculated underdrawing. Yet intricate as this layout is, the basic frame of reference from which it was developed was ingeniously simple. It consisted, most likely, of a simple grid of squares of the type that I have reconstructed in figure 60.B, making use of a measurement that serves as a basic unit value throughout the entire Plan. In the development of the primary design for such a layout, which must have been worked out before the building was inked onto the original plan, such a square grid may have been pressed into the parchment in full detail. As the design was transferred to the master sheet in the final assembly, there was no need to retrace the square grid in its entirety, but a minimum of auxiliary co-ordinates and prickings must, nevertheless, have been laid down to enable the draftsman to fix the width and length of each bed and to enter it in its proper place. Yet nowhere in the interstices between the beds, on the Plan of St. Gall, is there the slightest trace of such auxiliary construction work. It is omitted from the internal layout of the buildings shown on the Plan, and absent as well from their external alignment. 8. PLAN OF ST. GALL Alignment of Mill, Mortar, and Drying Kiln 9. ARCHITECTURAL DRAWING: DETAIL, FACSIMILE 13th century [courtesy of Vienna Akademie der Bildenden Künste, Kupferstichkabinet] The spiral depicting the stairwell in the southwest tower of Cologne Cathedral was constructed with compass and straightedge against a framework of auxiliary lines and reference points pressed into the parchment with a fine stylus or silverpoint before the drawing was inked—a procedure wholly different from the manner in which the Plan of St. Gall was drawn. The only freehand parts of this drawing are those which because of their intricacy of design were not feasible to draw otherwise. Figures 6 and 9 are details of the same drawing and are reproduced in this work at the same size exactly as they were drawn on the original. Drafting at this scale of fine detail is essentially a freehand operation. ABSENCE OF CENTER POINTS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF CIRCLES To construct a circle accurately, one must firmly anchor the center leg of the compass in the material on which the circle is to be drawn. The point of this leg has to penetrate deeply enough to stay in place while the outer leg strikes the circle. This is bound to leave a mark in the parchment, and for this reason, on all medieval architectural drawings on which circles have been drawn with the aid of a compass, there is always a clearly visible depression or minute hole in the skin, which reveals the point from which the circle was struck. I refer once again to the drawing of the southwestern tower of Cologne Cathedral as a typical case. It contains two circular installations, a spiral stairwell built into the masonry of the southwestern corner pier (fig. 9) and a circular opening in the vault of one of the two inner bays of the tower (the latter not reproduced here). In both instances the hole that the center leg of the compass left in the parchment as the circle was struck appears as a small but clearly perceptible mark. For purposes of comparison, five circular installations shown on the Plan of St. Gall are reproduced in figures 10-13. Figures 10.A-B are the ambo and the baptismal font in the nave of the church; figures 11.A-B are the two circular towers that flank the Church to the west. Figure 12 is the enclosure for the hens to the south of the House of the Fowlkeepers. No trace of the center point is found in any of these drawings. Furthermore, these circles are too inaccurate to have been constructed with the aid of a compass. A circle drawn by compass forms a continuous line of equal thickness, all points of which are equidistant from the center point, as is well illustrated by the circle that forms the outer boundary of the stairwell of Cologne Cathedral. The circles reproduced in figures 12-13, on the other hand, are drawn in successive motions of the rotating hand, the beginning and end of which can still be identified in many cases. Thus, for instance, close inspection of the Plan of St. Gall shows that the outer circle of the Henhouse (fig. 12) was drawn in five separate p. 20 strokes. The circle must have been started at the top with a leftward motion and continued counter-clockwise in four successive strokes, as I have indicated in figure 13. As the draftsman passed through this course, he must have rotated the two skins on which he worked in a clockwise motion, a procedure which he repeated when he entered the large explanatory title enclosed by the circle that identifies this structure as the Henhouse. As he approached the close of the circle, the draftsman discovered that his terminal stroke was not in alignment with his opening stroke, corrected this discrepancy with an additional stroke which ran parallel to the first, but about 1 mm. farther out. While the circles are neither continuous nor accurate enough to have been drawn by compass, they are far too accurate to have been drawn without auxiliary construction lines. As no such lines are to be discovered, we are once more left with no alternative but to assume that the circles were traced directly from an underlying original. ANGULAR DISTORTIONS CAUSED BY A SHIFT IN THE RELATIVE POSITION OF ORIGINAL AND OVERLAY My second argument in support of the contention that the Plan of St. Gall is not an original rests on the observation that in several areas the drawing exhibits angular distortions that owe their origin to a shift in the alignment of original and overlay. This observation is of crucial importance not only for the question of originality but also because it gives us a clue for establishing the sequence in which the buildings were traced. We shall analyze this phenomenon in detail in a subsequent chapter.7 7 See below, pp. 35ff. For the present discussion, suffice it to stress that we are faced here with a type of linear deflection caused in the process of tracing when an inadvertent shift between original and overlay is not immediately detected and corrected. These deflections are unlikely to occur on an original, as the underdrawing would contain each individual building within the area assigned to it, and would prevent the parallels from running askew. The author of the Plan of St. Gall was able to dispense with an elaborate system of auxiliary reference lines, since for him the original itself performed the function of the underdrawing. But as it was delineated on a different surface, his drawing was subject to displacement in relation to the original. INCOMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THE FLUID EXECUTION OF THE DRAWING AND THE PRECISE DRAFTSMANSHIP REQUIRED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORIGINAL SCHEME My last and final argument in favor of the proposition that the Plan of St. Gall is not the original version of the scheme is based on the observation of a profound discrepancy between the fluid style of the drawing and the extraordinary precision of construction that must have been employed in the development of the original scheme—not only as the dimensions of each individual building were established, but also in the even more complicated task of fitting the aggregate of structures into a coherent and scale-consistent whole. No single line of the Plan has the mark of having been drawn by rule or compass, as is the case with all the principal lines of the pier and the tower of Cologne Cathedral (figs. 6 and 9). The draftsman of the Plan of St. Gall rendered his lines with a broad quill in firm and fluent strokes, the ease of which reveals the self-assurance of an experienced hand; but being drawn without the aid of supporting instruments, his rendering abounds with inaccuracies and inconsistencies that are incompatible with the precise draftsmanship required in the development of the original scheme. About the nature of the latter more will be said below. The observations presented here admit of no other explanation than that the Plan of St. Gall is a copy that was traced on sheets of parchment superimposed upon a prototype plan. This raises the question of the nature and origin of the prototype plan. PLAN OF ST. GALL 10.A Ambo in the nave of the Church See also vol.

HENHOUSE Analysis of procedure followed in drawing of circle superimposed upon facsimile red print (authors' interpretation) I. 7 THE PLAN AND ITS RELATION TO THE MONASTIC REFORM MOVEMENT* * The argument presented in this chapter was first committed to paper in the summer of 1959, but because of a delay in printing it was not published until 1962 (Horn, in Studien, 1962, 103-27). Between 1959 and 1963 the monastic reform movement became the subject of a series of penetrating studies by Joseph Semmler (Semmler, 1958/60; 1960; 1963; and Verhulst and Semmler, 1962), culminating in a new edition of old and recently discovered sources, the Corpus consuetudinum monasticarum, I, 1963. I have rewritten my previous study on the Plan of St. Gall and its relation to the monastic reform movement in the light of Dr. Semmler's work. In doing so I have had the good fortune of being able to draw on the advice of one of the greatest students of Carolingian history, Professor François Ganshof, who was kind enough to read my study of 1962 with patience. I.7.1 THE PROTOTYPAL CHARACTER OF THE PLAN It has long been observed that the Plan of St. Gall, although obviously made to assist Abbot Gozbert in the reconstruction of his monastery, is not a plan for a specific site, but is rather an ideal scheme that demonstrates what buildings an exemplary Carolingian monastery should be composed of and in what manner they should be arranged.1 1 On the question of "site plan" or "general plan," see Keller, 1844, 4; Willis, 1848, 89; Dehio, 1930, 51; Hardegger, Schlatter, and Schiess, 1922, 21; Hecht, 1928, 29-30; Reinhardt, 1937, 277; and idem, 1952, 18. The Plan is inscribed into a rectangle, not dissimilar to the shape of a Roman military camp,2 2 For similarities and discrepancies see below, p. 114ff. and does not reflect the particular topographical conditions of the monastery of St. Gall, wedged as it was into an area of irregular shape formed by the capricious course of two converging streams.3 3 The topography of St. Gall is extensively dealt with in Hardegger, Schlatter, and Schiess, 1922, passim; by Edelmann, in Studien, 1962, 279-89. Cf. II, 314, fig. 505. It was in view of the ideal, schematic character of the Plan that Alphons Dopsch, in 1916, made the suggestion that the original version from which the Plan of St. Gall was derived might be a product of the great monastic reform movement that stirred the life of the Church during the reign of Louis the Pious.4 4 Dopsch, 1916, 71ff. Hans Reinhardt, in 1952, challenged this view. Before entering into the particulars of his argument, however, it is necessary to make a few remarks about the general scope of the monastic reform movement and the legislation resulting from it. I.7.2 THE GENERAL AIM OF THE MONASTIC REFORM MOVEMENT The general aim of the monastic reform movement was to create a single, universally binding code of rules (una consuetudo) to replace the mixed rule (regula mixta) that prevailed in the preceding period, a code of rules that settled points not foreseen in the Rule of St. Benedict of Nursia, and suppressed prescriptions that had become superannuated or impracticable. The soul and leader of this movement was Benedict of Aniane, the friend and adviser of Louis the Pious. Under his guidance the movement reached its climax in two synods—during which the empire's leading bishops and abbots congregated in the sacristy of the imperial chapel at Aachen—the first in the autumn of 816, the second in the summer of 817.5 5 For a general background of these two synods, see von Schubert, 1921, 617ff; Schmitz, I, 1948, 102ff; and Semmler, 1960, 309ff. The deliberations of each synod resulted in a set of resolutions which the attending dignitaries were instructed to make known to their monks upon return to their respective monasteries. The resolutions passed during the first synod of 816 consisted of thirty-six chapters, the original text of which was only recently discovered by Joseph Semmler in a manuscript at Wolfenbüttel dating from about 820, which furnishes us with the important date, August 23, 816.6 6 Herzog-August-Bibliothek, Cod. Wolfenbüttel, Vogel 27, fols. 89r-91r; see Semmler, 1960, 318. The text has been published by Semmler in Corpus consuetudinum monasticarum, I, 1963, 451-68. Prior to Semmler's discovery of this authentic contemporary copy of the capitulary, the contents of the resolutions of the synod of 816 had been known only through a promulgation by Bishop Haito of Basel to his monks in the abbey of Reichenau and Murbach, the so-called Statutes of Murbach.7 7 The history of the so-called Statutes of Murbach is fascinating. Formerly attributed to Abbot Simpert of Murbach, this document was first ascribed to Bishop Haito of Basel by Otto Seebass (1891) in a brilliant, yet highly speculative, analysis, on the details of which I have reported in Studien, 1962, 110-11. Seebass was not familiar with the original text, but only with a copy of about 1500 that was written in the monastery of Murbach, and later found its way into St. Ulrich and St. Afra in Augsburg. The attribution of this text to Bishop Haito of Basel was questioned in 1958 by Semmler (1958/60, 273-85, and 1963, 15-82); but at about the same time, Christian Wilsdorf discovered in the Archives départementales du Haut-Rhin at Colmar the original Carolingian rotulus from which the copy at St. Ulrich and St. Afra had been made (see Wilsdorf, 1961). An analysis of the script of this manuscript by Professor Bischoff suggests that the rotulus was written by scribes of the scriptorium of Basel (according to a personal communication to me from Dr. Semmler, dated November 7, 1963). The rotulus of Colmar, therefore, is now generally accepted as being the authentic Carolingian text of the Statutes of Murbach. It has been published by Semmler in Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 437-50 under the title Actuum praeliminarium synodi primae Aquisgranensis commentationes sive Statuta Murbacensia (816), hereafter referred to as Statuta Murbacensia. The resolutions adopted during the second synod consisted of forty-three chapters, and were promulgated in an imperial ordinance dated July 10, 817, the famous Capitulare monasticum of Louis the Pious.8 8 First published by Alfred Boretius in Mon. Germ. Hist., Leg. Sec. II, Capit. I, 1883, 343-49; subsequently by Bruno Albers in Cons. mon., III, 1907, 79-93. These texts are now superseded by Semmler's edition in Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 469-810 under the title Synodi secundae Aquisgranensis decreta authentica (817). Although the Statutes of Murbach lists considerably fewer resolutions than either of the two imperial capitularies, it is in many respects of greater historical interest because it contains, in addition to the resolutions themselves, an extensive commentary by Bishop Haito that clarifies the intent of the new legislation and suggests procedures for its implementation. Haito's remarks provide insight into the disagreements that must have prevailed during the first synod of Aachen, and exhibit his doubt of the finality of some of the more controversial resolutions passed by this assembly. There are instances where he declares it his intention to postpone action on a particular issue,9 9 A typical example of this is to be found in Haito's commentary on chapter 21, which prohibits the use of baths for the healthy monks (see below, p. 22). and others where he states he will refuse to implement a resolution, suggesting that less restrictive action on it might be forthcoming in the future.10 10 A typical example of the latter is his reaction to the resolution that threatens the abbot's right to live in a separate house (see below, p. 22). A second definite suggestion that further legislation may be expected is to be found in Haito's commentary on chapter 20 "until we hear of a more specific ruling" ("usquedum decretum manifestius inde audiatur"); cf. below, note 37. Others among the returning bishops and abbots may have reacted in a similar manner,11 11 With regard to this opposition, see Lesne, 1920; Levillain, 1925; Hafner, in Studien, 1962, 177; and Semmler, 1963, 76ff. and the fact that a second synod was called into being only a year later is, in itself, an indication that not everything was settled during the first one. In general the resolutions of the second synod were milder than those of the first; the liberal and more humanistic wing among the reformists apparently won out over the restrictive asceticism promoted by Benedict of Aniane and his supporters.12 12 On the internal conflicts of St. Benedict of Aniane, his initial ascetic leanings and his gradual conversion to the more tolerant humanism of St. Benedict of Nursia, see Hauck, 1912, 588ff; Hilpisch, 1929, 117ff. For the accomplishments and personality of Benedict of Aniane in general, see Narberhaus, 1930, passim; the article by Schmitz, "Benoit d'Aniane," in DHGE, VIII, 1934, cols. 177-88; Schmitz, I, 1948, 103ff; Schmitz, 1957, 401-15; and the article by Semmler, "Benedikt v. Aniane," in Lexikon für Theologie und Kirche, I, 1958, cols. 179-80. It is important to consider this moderation of policy by the second synod, as it bears directly upon the interpretation of certain specific resolutions that affected the architectural layout of the Plan. I.7.3 SPECIFIC RULINGS OF THE MONASTIC REFORM MOVEMENT AFFECTING MONASTIC ARCHITECTURE Hans Reinhardt, in questioning Dopsch's thesis that the Plan of St. Gall was a product of the monastic reform movement, pointed to two conspicuous features of the Plan which in his opinion militated against such a connection. One of these was that the monastery was furnished with bathhouses not only for the sick but also for the healthy brethren; and the second, that on the Plan the abbot was provided with a residence of his own. Both of these establishments, Reinhardt contended, had been interdicted by Aachen.13 13 Reinhardt, 1952, 18. In advancing this criticism, however, Reinhardt failed to take into account that in both cases the resolutions passed at the second synod modified those of the first. The synod of 816, to judge from Bishop Haito's report, prohibited the use of baths by the healthy monks, reserving this privilege to the sick,14 14 "Usus balnei interdictus omnino est excepto quibus necessitas infirmitatis insistit." Statuta Murbacensia, chap. 21; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 447. yet when this issue was taken up again in the second synod, the assembly did not retain the strictness of the prohibition of the preceding year, but liberalized it by the ruling: "That the use of baths shall be left to the judgment of the prior."15 15 "Ut opus balnearum in arbitrio prioris consistat" (Synodi secundae decr. auth., chap. 10; ed. Semmler, ibid., 475). This was a return to the more tolerant attitude of St. Benedict of Nursia, who granted the privilege of bathing to the sick "as often as may be expedient; but to the healthy, and especially to the young, let them be granted seldom."16 16 "Ualnearum usus infirmis, quotiens expedit, offeratur, sanis autem et maxime iubenibus tardius concedatur" (Benedicti regula, chap. 36; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 96; ed. McCann, 1952, 90-91; ed. Steidle, 1952, 228-30). The Plan of St. Gall includes among its buildings a bathhouse for the monks,17 17 See below, pp. 262ff. a bathhouse for the novices,18 18 See below, p. 315. a bathhouse for the sick,19 19 See below, p. 315. and a bathhouse for the abbot.20 20 See below, p. 321. There is nothing in either the number, size, or furnishings of these installations that would conflict with the ruling of the second synod; and the bathhouse for the monks, equipped as it was with no more than two tubs for seventy-seven monks (this is the number of beds in the dormitory), could scarcely do more to conform to the Rule of St. Benedict, or to testify to the conservative "judgment of the prior." The question of a separate house for the abbot is a different and considerably more complicated matter. It appears to have been one of the more delicate issues discussed in Aachen. As one weighs the respective merits of the rulings that touch this matter, one cannot avoid the impression that rather than face the issue squarely, the leaders of the Church proposed to solve it by indirection. It looks very much as though during the first synod of Aachen some of the more extreme reformists argued for legislation which, if enacted, would have deprived the abbot of his right to a separate house and kitchen. This may have been the intent of a preliminary resolution referred to in chapter 4 of the Statutes of Murbach, which directs: "That the abbots shall be subject to the same rules as the brethren in meal and drink, in their sleep, and in all other matters."21 21 "Ut abbates communes esse debeant suis monachis in manducando, in bibendo, in dormiendo seu in ceteris quibuslibet causis" (Statuta Murbacensia, chap. 4; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 443). As in the question of baths, so in this issue, too, the thinking of the reformists tended to become more flexible in the ensuing deliberations as the synods progressed. The official capitulary of 816 repeats the clause that puts the abbots on the same footing with the monks "in meal and drink," etc., but adds to this the important qualification, "provided that they are not engaged in some other useful task."22 22 "Ut ea quam monachi sui habent mensura sint abbates contenti, in manducando, in bibendo, in dormiendo, in uestiendo, in operando, quando in aliis non fuerint utilitatibus occupati" (Synodi primae decr. auth., chap. 23; ed. Semmler, ibid., 464). The capitulary of 817 drops the issue altogether.23 23 Ibid., 471-81. The synod of 816 is quite specific about the fact that the abbot should not eat with the guests by the gate of the monastery,24 24 "Ut abbas vel quispiam fratrum ad portam monasterii cum hospitibas non reficiat" (Synodi secundae decr. auth., chap. 25; ed. Semmler, ibid., 464). i.e., in the house held ready for the reception of distinguished guests. The synod of 817 eliminates this ruling also. Neither of the two capitularies contains a clause that challenged the abbot's right to live in his own house. To introduce such legislation would have been an abrogation of a time-honored mandate of the great St. Benedict himself, who in chapters 53 and 56 of his Rule had directed: "Let there be a separate kitchen for the abbot and guests,"25 25 "Coquina abbatis et hospitum super se sit" (Benedicti regula, chap. 53; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 125; ed. McCann, 1952, 118-23; ed. Steidle, 1952, 257-60). and "Let the abbot always eat with the guests and pilgrims. But when there are no guests, let him have the power to invite whom he will of the brethren."26 26 "Mensa abbatis cum hospitibus et peregrinis sit semper. Quotiens tamen minus sunt hospites, quos uult de fratribus uocare in ipsius sit potestate" (Benedicti regula, chap. 56; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 131; ed. McCann, 1952, 126-27; ed. Steidle, 1952, 273). How doubtful of the legality of any attempt to tamper with these regulations of the founder of western monachism some of the members of the synod of 816 must have been, may be gathered from Abbot Haito's reaction. Pointing to the irreconcilable conflict between the spirit of this attempt and the Rule of St. Benedict, Haito exclaims: "In this matter, to be sure, I wish to follow the authority of customary procedure, which cannot be overruled by the dictates of some new legislation."27 27 "In hoc quippe negotio uti regulari potestate uolo cui non preiudicat alicuius nouae constitutionis censura" (Statuta Murbacensia, chap. 4; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 443). And in answer to the edict "that the abbot shall not take his meal with the guests by the gates of the monastery," Haito remarks: This we have never done. In the abbot's auditorium, however, where the abbot is used to read and engage in conversation with the brethren and with the guests, separately or together, we have on rare occasions shared a meal with the guests. This custom we wish to retain unless interdicted by the issuance of a more explicit ruling.28 28 "Quod nos in usu numquam habuimus. In auditorio uero, ubi abbas legere solet et cum fratribus et hospitibus uicissim seu communiter habere solitus est, comedere cum hospitibus ualde raro usi fuimus. Quem usum nisi certius interdicatur habere uolumus" (Statuta Murbacensia, chap. 22; ibid., 447-48). In professing this view, Haito informs us: This auditorium of the abbot lies between the claustrum and the gate of the convent, so that he can receive in conference the brethren without inconvenience to the guests, and the guests without inconvenience to the brethren.29 29 "Qui locus in confinio claustri et ianuae monasterii situs est, ita ut fratres sine inpedimento hospitum et hospites sine fratribus ad conloquium recipere possit" (Ibid., 448). The auditorium to which Bishop Haito refers as the traditional place for the abbot to take his meal with the guests can only have been a room in the abbot's own house, and since this house lay outside the claustrum near the gate of the monastery—precisely where it is shown on the Plan of St. Gall—it must have been provided with its own kitchen.30 30 That the abolishment of the abbot's right to live in a separate house was not the sense in which the final legislation of Aachen was interpreted in its own time, is suggested by the fact that the establishment of separate quarters for the abbot became a standard feature of the ensuing monastic building tradition; see II, 347ff. A review of the resolutions of the two synods of Aachen which deal with the abbot's right to eat and sleep in his own residence, then, provides no evidence to challenge the theory that the Plan of St. Gall was a product of the monastic reform movement. It argues, rather, in favor of it. Moreover, there are other features of the Plan that give added support to this thesis. THE TRANSFER OF HOUSES FOR THE WORKMEN AND CRAFTSMEN FROM AN EXTRAMURAL TO AN INTRAMURAL LOCATION A directive issued in chapter 4 of the first synod stipulated that the monks should help "with their own hands" (propriis manibus) in the bakehouse and in other workshops, and should not stray outside for the acquisition of these necessities.31 31 "Ut in quoquina, in pistrino et in ceteris artium officinis propriis operentur manibus et uestimenta sua lauent oportuno tempore" (Synodi primae decr. auth., chap. 4; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 458). It is Bishop Haito's commentary to this directive that reveals to us the synod's intent to place the houses for the workmen and craftsmen within the monastic precinct, rather than outside. Prior to the issuance of the regulation, in the monastery of Reichenau at least, the workshop for the craftsmen lay outside the monastic compound; and in implementing this rule, Haito ordered, "that the fullers, the tailors, and the shoemakers be instructed to perform their work of providing the monks with their necessary clothing in the future within the confines of the monastery, and not without, as was the custom in the past." He adds "that this change should be effected by the calends of next September."32 32 "Instruendi sunt fullones, sartores, sutores, non forinsecus sicut actenus, sed intrinsecus, qui ista fratibus necessitatem habentibus faciant; quae indutiae usque kalendas septembres proximas dande sunt" (Statuta Murbacensia, chap. 5; ibid., 444). The location of the Great Collective Workshop and the House of Coopers and Wheelwrights, immediately to the south and west of the Monks' Cloister, may be interpreted to be a direct implementation of this same directive. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SEPARATE QUARTERS FOR VISITING MONKS Another point of agreement between the Plan of St. Gall and a specific ruling of Aachen is to be found in the establishment of special quarters for visiting monks. Chapter 24 of the second synod rules, "that a dormitory shall be erected by the side of the church where the visiting monks may sleep."33 33 "Ut dormitorium iuxta oratorium constituatur ubi superuenientes monachi dormiant" (Synodi secundae decr. auth., chap. 24; ibid., 478). This regulation is new, as it was not included in the Rule of St. Benedict, who, in an entire chapter devoted to the question, "How pilgrim monks are to be received" (De monachis peregrinis, qualiter suscipiantur), did not make the slightest reference to special lodgings for visiting monks.34 34 Benedicti regula, chap. 61; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 141-43; ed. McCann, 1952, 138-41; ed. Steidle, 1952, 300-302. On the Plan of St. Gall the Lodging for Visiting Monks is shown as a separate apartment, addorsed to the northern wall of the church in the immediate vicinity of the transept.35 35 See II, 140ff. THE TRANSFER OF THE SCHOOL FOR LAYMEN AND SECULAR PRIESTS TO A LOCATION OUTSIDE THE CLAUSTRUM A last point in favor of the theory that the scheme of the Plan of St. Gall is the product of the monastic reform movement is to be found in the fact that in this scheme the school for laymen and secular priests is on a site outside the Claustrum.36 36 On this point Reinhardt (1952, 17) agrees. The first synod of Aachen did not rule on the subject of schools, but one should not infer from this that the issue had not been raised at that time. Haito touches upon the matter briefly in his discussion of the rules concerning the reception of the novices, and from the tenor of his commentary it is tempting to conclude that the absence of any binding regulations concerning monastic schools in the statutes of the first synod was caused by the assembly's inability to reach an agreement on this important question rather than by its failure to raise the issue: As far as the reception of the secular priests and of the lay students is concerned, the synod does not furnish us with any directive. This being as it is, they shall continue to be received in the customary fashion, so far as possible, until we shall hear of a more explicit ruling in this matter.37 37 "De sacerdotibus uero uel scolasticis suscipiendis preceptum synodi non habemus; et ideo susceptio eorum regularis quantum possibilitas sinit habeatur, usquedum decretum manifestius inde audiatur" (Statuta Murbacensia, chap. 20; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 447). The expression "so far as possible" could mean a number of things. It could refer to the availability of suitable quarters for the secular students, or the availability of a sufficient number of teachers properly trained to instruct them. The apposition "until we shall hear a more explicit ruling in this matter" makes evident that action was expected in the future, and the second synod did not fail to take it. But the wording of this subsequent action poses some problems of interpretation. Chapter 5 of the second synod refers to the issue of schools with the terse sentence: "There shall be no other school in the monastery than that which is used for the instruction of the future monks."38 38 "Ut scola in monasterio non habeatur nisi eorum qui oblati sunt" (Synodi secundae decr. auth., chap. 5; ed. Semmler, ibid., 474). If the word "monasterium" in this sentence were interpreted to refer to the monastery as a whole, this ruling would certainly ban the instruction of laymen and secular priests from the monastic educational system. It is in this sense that the statute appears to have been interpreted by such scholars as Emile Lesne39 39 Lesne, V, 1940, 25. and Dom Jean Leclercq.40 40 Leclercq, 1948, 5. There are good historical reasons, however, to suggest that "monasterium" was used here in the sense of "claustrum" rather than as reference to the monastery in its entirety. One of these is the fact that the severity of this statute, if the complete abolishment of lay instruction had been its manifest intent, would be entirely out of line with the general spirit of the resolutions of the second synod, which were consistently more liberal and more tolerant than those of the first. Second and more important, however, is the testimony of history itself; for in its actual implementation, the rule laid down in chapter 25 of the second synod did not result in the abolishment of lay instruction but in the division of the monastic educational system into an "outer school" (schola exterior) and an "inner school" (schola interior), the former for the education of the laymen and secular priests, the latter for the instruction of the monks.41 41 Cf. von Schubert, 1921, 711-12: "Die notwendige Folge aber davon war, dass neben der Schule im Claustrum, die schola interior, eine äussere Schule, schola exterior oder publica, für die künftigen Weltkleriker entstand, die an Frequenz die erstere oft weit übertraf." On the frequency of occurrence of outer schools in monasteries from the ninth to the eleventh centuries, see Berlière, 1921, 550-72. The monastery of St. Gall itself appears to be a typical example of this development. Its two schools are frequently referred to in contemporary narratives, the most notable of which is a passage in chapter 2 of Ekkehard's Casus sancti Galli, from which we learn that at the time of Abbot Grimald (841-872) the Irish monk Marcellus was placed in charge of the Inner School and the monk Iso in charge of the Outer School.42 42 "Traduntur post tempus Marceilo scolae claustri cum Nokero postea cognomine Balb?ulo et caeteris monachici habitus pueris, exteriores autem, id est canonicae, Ysoni cum Salomone et ejus comparibus" (Ekkeharti (IV.), Casus sancti Galli, chap. 2; ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 10-11; ed. Helbling, 1958, 23). Later teachers, such as Ratpert, the two Notkers, and the four Ekkehards, taught in both, and some among them served as the head of both.43 43 "Nam cum apud suum Gallum ambas scolas suas teneret" (Ekkeharti (IV.), Casus sancti Galli, chap. 89; ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 317; ed. Helbling, 1958, 161). On the Plan of St. Gall the Inner School is established in a special claustral structure that lies to the east of the Church and is provided with its own chapel, refectory, dormitory, and warming room; the Outer School lies to the north of the Church between the Abbot's House and the House for Distinguished Guests. The Library and the Scriptorium, two indispensable facilities for both schools, lie midway between them. As the Inner School was confined to the training of the novices,44 44 See below, pp. 311ff. the advanced training of the regular monks may have been conducted in the Scriptorium and Library. In proposing that the term "monasterium" in the statute of the second synod was used in the sense of "claustrum," I do not wish to maintain that the total exclusion of lay instruction from the monasteries may not have been one of the acknowledged goals of the fanatics in the reform movement. The introduction of facilities for the instruction of laymen and the secular clergy no doubt had posed problems of a disturbing nature, and the education, side by side, of laymen, secular priests, and monks must have had a disquieting influence on monastic peace and discipline. But to overcome these shortcomings by the complete exclusion of all outsiders from the monastic schools would have been a measure too radically opposed to the educational policy of Charlemagne who, in ordering the establishment of monastic schools for the education of laymen and secular priests in the first place, had assigned to the monasteries a clearly defined responsibility within the empire's general educational system.45 45 Charlemagne's school legislation is discussed at length and with ample references to original sources in Hauck, 1912, 192ff; Hartig, 1925, II, 621ff; and de Ghellink, 1939, 84ff; we shall touch upon it again briefly in our discussion of the Outer School below, pp. 168ff. Many of the bishops and abbots who attended the synods of Aachen were of sufficient age to have played a decisive role in the implementation, if not the original framing, of this policy. Complete abolishment of lay instruction would have been too radical a measure to be accepted without opposition, and the history of the monastic schools shows clearly that, in this issue also, the extreme wing among the reformists did not win out. I.7.4 CONCLUSIONS The arguments set forth on the preceding pages speak plainly, I think, in favor of Dopsch's theory that the scheme for a monastic settlement which is copied in the Plan of St. Gall was a product of the monastic reform movement. The ideal character of this scheme is in full accord with the general spirit of this movement, which aimed at the establishment of a universally binding rule for the monks to replace the mixed rule that prevailed in the preceding centuries. The arrangement of the buildings shown on the Plan of St. Gall aimed in the same manner at the establishment of guiding rules that could be followed in the physical layout of a monastic settlement. It terminated the ambiguities that had arisen from the never completely settled battle between the tradition of the Irish and the Benedictine monks. Moreover, it established in architectural terms a modus vivendi et habitandi between the monks and the laymen by confining the former to an inner and the latter to an outer yard, and in this manner settled a conflict that had been created by a steadily increasing influx of serfs and workmen during the two preceding centuries as the monastery assumed more and more the character of a great manorial estate. It was an architectural program whose conception depended on policy decisions of major magnitude—no less complex in physical terms than the web of regulations that affect the monks' religious and temporal life—requiring a consensus of opinion as could only have been attained in assemblies of leading dignitaries of the Church such as occurred at Aachen in 816 and 817. Lastly, but not least: it embodied features which, as I believe to have established on the preceding pages, were the implementation of specific resolutions taken at Aachen. They are: establishment of separate quarters for visiting monks, transfer of the houses for workmen from an extramural to an intramural location, and separation of the educational system of the monastery into inner and outer schools. The existence of bathhouses for the novices and healthy monks would have violated the legislation of the first synod, but they were not in conflict with the legislation of the second synod, which returned to the more tolerant views of St. Benedict of Nursia. A separate house for the abbot, while nowhere authorized in sharply defined terms, is an implicit precondition of the legislation of the second synod.46 46 Edgar Lehmann (1965, 312ff) believes that the theory that the Plan of St. Gall is a product of the monastic reform movement is erroneous. The generous dimensions given to the Church (in its original concept), the existence of baths, the largeness of the number of monks for which the monastery was designed, the detached location of the Abbot's House, the presence of an Outer School are, in his opinion, not compatible with the spirit of the movement fostered by Benedict of Aniane. Lehmann's argument is correct to the extent to which it implies that the Plan, in its over-all conception, reflects a generosity of thinking that is more expressive of the "culture friendly" monastic policy of Charlemagne and his advisors than of the ascetic attitudes that gained ascendancy under Louis the Pious. (For more details on this, see the chapter "Some Reflections About the Prototype Plan.") Yet Lehmann's conclusion, I think, is wrong. It is based on an underevaluation of the political and spiritual complexities of the reform movement. The old councilors of Charlemagne, such men as Bishop Hildebold of Cologne (d. 819) and Bishop Haito of Basel (d. 836), were still alive and their presence at the two synods was an intellectual and cultural force to be reckoned with—a powerful one at that, as may be gathered from the tenor of Bishop Haito's reaction to some of the reformist proposals made during the first synod, especially when these were in violation of the Rule of the greater and more time-honored of the two St. Benedicts. It was precisely the issue of the baths and questions involving the location of the Abbot's House that roused his indignation. The reformists lost this battle. I. 8 PRESUMABLE DATE OF THE PLAN Since the Plan is dedicated to Abbot Gozbert of St. Gall, its execution must fall into the time between Gozbert's appointment to his abbacy in 816 and his resignation in 836 (he died in 837). As it was made to guide Gozbert in the reconstruction of the monastery of St. Gall, the upper limit of this span may safely be depressed to the year 830, when this project was started. The prototype from which the Plan of St. Gall was copied appears to date from the year 817. We do not know at what point in his career Abbot Gozbert conceived of the idea of rebuilding his monastery; nor do we have any means of judging by how many years his request for guidance in this project preceded actual construction. Bishop Haito, the presumptive "author" of the Plan, died in 836. From the tenor of his transmittal note one is tempted to infer that the Plan was drawn when Haito was still at the full height of his two careers, i.e., before his retirement, in 823, from his episcopate at Basel and his abbacy at the monastery of Reichenau. The traditional date for the Plan, of "around 820," might therefore be retained, provided that it be understood that this is clearly not a compelling conclusion. STYLUS MUSEE D'HISTOIRE ET D'ART, LUXEMBOURG The stylus, essentially a very simple tool of iron, bronze, sometimes of hardwood, bone or ivory, has one or both ends pointed according to the purpose for which the instrument was used. The example illustrated, Gallo-Roman, with one end pointed, the other formed like a small, blunt chisel, was probably for a professional writer. The pointed end, needle sharp, was for pricking through the parchment, the blunt end for scoring the parchment surface as a guide for writing or ruling. 14. COLOGNE, CAROLINGIAN CATHEDRAL. PLAN OF HILDEBOLD'S FOUNDATIONS [after Willy Weyres, 1966, 408, fig. 10] Excavations by Otto Doppelfeld beneath the pavement of the Gothic cathedral (heavily bombed in World War II) revealed seven building horizons ranging from the Roman occupation (per. I-IV) through the Merovingian (per. V-VI), to the time of construction of the Carolingian cathedral (per. VIIA-B). The plan displays in dark shading the foundations of Hildebold's church, begun probably after the coronation of Charlemagne in 800, but still not complete when Hildebold died in 819. The stippled areas in the church are remains of the floor of the Merovingian cathedral, a structure about 49 m long and 20-22 m wide; its precise shape can no longer be determined. Toward the end of Merovingian or in early Carolingian times (possibly after the elevation of Hildebold to the See of Cologne in 787) the Merovingian cathedral was enlarged westward with the addition of transept and semicircular atrium. I. 9 THE PROTOTYPE PLAN I.9.1 SOME REFLECTIONS ABOUT IT AND ITS RELATION TO THE CAROLINGIAN CATHEDRAL OF COLOGNE CONCEPTUAL AFFINITIES WITH COLOGNE CATHEDRAL With its emphasis on the monastery as a general cultural institution1 1 For more detail on this point, see below, pp. 351ff. and its generous allotment of space provided for the reception of secular dignitaries2 2 For more detail on this point, see below, II, 155. the layout of the Plan of St. Gall displays a largesse d'esprit that appears more akin to the educational and administrative policies promoted by Charlemagne and his advisors than to the constrictive atmosphere prevalent in monastic life at the time of Louis the Pious. Nowhere is this boldness of approach more clearly disclosed than in the exuberant dimensions of the Church of the Plan. Prior to 1948 the idea that an exemplary Carolingian monastery church could attain a length of 300 feet appeared doubtful to many. The Abbey Church of Fulda, 321 feet long and 100 feet wide, had always been considered exceptional, and the rebellion of the monks of Fulda against its inordinate size appeared to confirm this view.3 3 For a more detailed discussion of the controversy between Abbot Ratgar and the monks of Fulda, see below, pp. 187ff. But Otto Doppelfeld's excavation of the foundations of the Carolingian church of Cologne brought to light under the pavement of the present Cathedral the remains of a church that corresponded to the Church of the Plan of St. Gall not only in size but also in the essentials of its layout (figs. 14-16).4 4 On the excavation of the foundations of the Carolingian church of Cologne, see Doppelfeld, 1948, 1-12; 1948, 159-83; 1953; 1954, 69-100; 1954, 46ff; 1958; and latest review and reconstructions by Weyres, 1965. A late but trustworthy tradition ascribes the construction of this edifice to Archbishop Hildebold of Cologne (787-818),5 5 Cf. Clemen, Neu, Witte, 1938, 39ff; and Doppelfeld, 1954, 99. a relative of Charlemagne and one of his most trusted councilors.6 6 Hildebold was appointed to the see of Cologne ca. 787. He became arch-chaplain in 891, archbishop of Cologne in 794/95, and died in 819. For further information, see Franzen, 1960, and Neuss-Oediger, 1964, 151ff. Like the Church of the Plan of St. Gall, the church of Hildebold was about 300 feet long and about 80 feet wide. As in the former, the nave in the latter had a width of about 40 feet, and the aisles half of that, about 20 feet. In both churches the transept arms and the fore choir repeat the dimensions of the crossing square. Both churches had apses at either end, a semicircular paradise with a covered walk in the west and an uncovered paradise in the east. The similarities are very close and so striking, Doppelfeld concluded, that one must have served as model for the other. In the plan of the church of Cologne, he believed, he had found the prototype for the layout of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall.7 7 "Das Schema der Kirche des St. Galler Klosterplanes ist nicht irregendein Phantasiergebilde, sondern eine sehr reale Wirklichkeit, nämlich die genaue Nachbildung der im Bau befindlichen Kölner Domkirche" (Doppelfeld, 1948, 10.) RELATIVE CHRONOLOGY Unfortunately, we do not know precisely when Hildebold's church was started; therefore, it was to be expected that Doppelfeld's view of its priority over the Church of the Plan of St. Gall should be challenged. Adolph Schmidt voiced the opinion that both buildings might have a common root in a prototype plan developed during the two reform synods of Aachen (816-817).8 8 "Es fehlen aber direkte Beweise für eine Abhängigkeit des Ideal-planes vom Kölner Grundriss des Hildebold-Doms, obwohl die Vermutung naheliegt, dass gemeinsame Wurzeln, in den Richtlinien der Reformsynode von Inden (Kornelismünster) [sic; it should be "Aachen"] liegen, die im Jahre 816 abgehalten wurden" (1956, 407). Irmingard Achter, Albert Verbeek, and Fried Mühlberg went so far as to question the Carolingian origin of Cologne Cathedral altogether and ascribed it to the time of Archbishop Bruno (953-956).9 9 Achter, 1958, 185; Verbeek, 1958, 188; Mühlberg, 1960, 41ff. Doppelfeld never budged from his original position10 10 Doppelfeld, 1958, 191ff. and further excavations seemed to confirm his view. In a careful and exhaustive re-analysis of the entire archaeological and documentary evidence available, Otto Weyres11 11 Weyres, 1966, 384-423. arrived at the conclusion that the concept of the church, the foundations of which are shown in figure 14, is essentially that of Archbishop Hildebold—a concept created on its initiative under the impact of the enhanced significance that the empire of the Franks had acquired through the coronation of Charlemagne at Rome in the year 800—and for that reason probably put into effect in the years immediately following this important event. Hildebold, who held the position of arcicapellanus at the court of Charlemagne, had witnessed with his own eyes the construction, step by step, of the Palace Chapel, Aachen (ca. 790-800). His own cathedral at Cologne with its thin walls, then already 300 years old, had become outdated. Before the year 800 Hildebold had already made an attempt to enlarge it westward with a semicircular atrium (by more than 20 years older than the semicircular atria of the Plan of St. Gall).12 12 Weyres, 1966, 408 and 409. In contradistinction to Doppelfeld, who originally interpreted this atrium as the beginning of the new Carolingian church, Weyres considers it to be an enlargement of the Merovingian cathedral, undertaken by Hildebold after his accession to the episcopal see in 787 and prior to Charlemagne's coronation in Rome in 800. After the coronation of Charlemagne in Rome, Weyres argues, Hildebold took the decisive step of tearing down the entire ancient fabric of the Merovingian cathedral and of laying the foundations for a new one (fig. 15): an aisled church with apse and counter apse, a western transept, and an extended eastern choir. The foundations of this building (VIIa) are well attested, yet nothing is known about its elevation. When Hildebold died in 819, the project was not finished, but it must have been sufficiently advanced at this time to be identified with him by later generations. Certain conditions of the masonry and the soil suggest that after Hildebold's death, construction was disrupted or moved very slowly. There is good reason to believe that the building was close to completion when Archbishop Gunther was deposed in 864, since in the troubled six years that followed not much could have been done.13 13 Ibid., 406. The church was solemnly dedicated by Archbishop Willibert on September 27, 870 in the presence of the archbishops of Mainz, Trier, and Salzburg and all of the suffragans.14 14 Annales Fuldenses, ed. Pertz, Mon. Germ. Hist., Script., I, 1826, 383; and Anselmi gesta episcopi Leodiensium, ed. Pertz, Mon. Germ. Hist., VII, 1846, 200. The imprints of two piers on the foundation of the northern row of arcades disclose that the nave walls of this building (VIIb) were supported by piers, 5.67 m. long (15 Roman feet), at a clear interstice of 4.17 m. (14 Roman feet). A reconstruction of this church, as proposed by Weyres, is shown in figures 15 and 16. There is no conclusive evidence that the elevation of this church was identical with that which Bishop Hildebold had in mind. The imprints of its pillars were found on a level of the foundations that seemed to lie above the fabric completed at the time of Bishop Hildebold. COLOGNE: CAROLINGIAN CATHEDRAL (VIIB) 15.B LONGITUDINAL SECTION. LATE CAROLINGIAN CATHEDRAL, COLOGNE 15.A PLAN, LATE CAROLINGIAN CATHEDRAL, COLOGNE. RECONSTRUCTION [after Willy Weyres, 1966, 410, figs. 11 and 12] Changes in the masonry technique of the foundations of Hildebold's church (fig. 14) suggest that work on this building was discontinued (possibly at Hildebold's death in 819) before its walls had risen to any appreciable height. The duration of this interruption is unknown, and since no rising portions of the walls are left, the precise nature of the elevation of Hildebold's cathedral can no longer be determined. The cathedral was completed by Archbishop Willibert and formally dedicated in 870. This late Carolingian church made full use, without any changes, of the foundations built by Hildebold, the later masonry being distinguishable from that of Hildebold's work by its inclusion of a reddish mortar. Enough of the rising portions of Willibert's walls and nave supports remain to make it clear that the nave walls rested on rectangular piers rather than on columns. Figures 15 and 16 are attempts to reconstruct the elevation and interior view of the cathedral. While the interstices of the arcades of this church are considerably narrower than those of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall (cf. figs. 109 and 110) they are spiritually related to them by the daring height of their rise. Weyres' conclusions about the date and building sequence of Cologne Cathedral are persuasive and suggest that if there were any conceptual links between the Church of the Plan of St. Gall and the Carolingian cathedral of Cologne, it was the latter that influenced the former, as Doppelfeld had proposed in the first place, and not the other way round. LIKELIHOOD OF HILDEBOLD'S INVOLVEMENT IN ORIGINAL SCHEME My own analysis of the Plan of St. Gall and its relation to the monastic reform movement15 15 See above, pp. 20ff. has made a good case for the assumption that someone, or some group, at Aachen had been charged with the responsibility of working out a master plan which was to show how the resolutions taken by the assembled abbots and bishops about monastic life and ritual reflected themselves in the physical layout of an exemplary monastery. Bishop Hildebold, or someone close to him, may have been in charge of this project. The emphasis that it gives to houses used for the reception of visitors—and in particular to the reception of the emperor and his court—16 16 See II, 155. makes one want to assign it conceptually to a man who grew up in the time of Charlemagne rather than in the time of Louis the Pious. These facilities are treated with special care, if not a touch of lavish attention, and give the impression of being devised by a man who was not only thoroughly familiar with the architectural needs of the traveling emperor, but also sufficiently convinced of the unison of regnum and sacerdotium in the office of the sovereign to justify the inclusion of that much space for his reception on the hallowed grounds of a monastery. We do not know to what extent the prototype plan was formally approved at Aachen. It may have been discussed and endorsed in toto. Or it may have been accepted with certain specific reservations. Some issues, as we have seen, were controversial.17 17 See above, pp. 20ff. It was Boeckelmann who first expressed the intriguing view that at the two synods of Aachen, two parties were wrestling about the aims of the future reform of the church: an "old guard" who had reached the peak of their career under Charlemagne and were now gradually dying out, and another group of men who supported St. Benedict of Aniane in his advocacy of more constrictive reforms.18 18 Boeckelmann, 1956, 132ff: "Wir vermuten, dass auf dem Konzil zu Inden [sic; it should be Aachen] im Jahre 816 zwei Parteien—die absterbende des grossen Karl und die neue Benedikts—um die künftige musterhafte Kirchenform gerungen haben. Der Klosterplan ist noch von der alten Karlspartei entscheidend bestimmt und eingebracht worden, hat aber sofort bei der Partei Benedikts Protest hervorgerufen. Niederschlag des Einwandes sind die wenigen Massinschriften." My own studies of Bishop Haito's commentary to the preliminary acts of the first synod19 19 See above, pp. 20ff. and Semmler's analysis of the antagonistic views held by such men as Abbot Adalhard of Corbie (who was put into exile before the synods started)20 20 Semmler, 1963, 15-82, especially chap. V, "Der Gegenspieler: Adalhard von Corbie," 76ff. have confirmed this view. There is good cause to believe that among the various topics that were subject to controversy at Aachen—such as the permissibility of baths,21 21 See above, pp. 22ff. the issue of whether there should be a secular school in the monastery,22 22 See above, p. 23. and the delicate problem of where the abbot should sleep and eat—23 23 See above, p. 22. was also the question of the optimal length of the church. COLOGNE. CAROLINGIAN CATHEDRAL 16. INTERIOR VIEW TOWARD THE WEST [reconstruction by Willy Weyres, 1966, 415, figure 1] Of the three monumental churches that emerged from the union of REGNUM and SACERDOTIUM struck by Charlemagne's coronation in Rome only Fulda was completed during the emperor's reign (not without difficulties, cf. pp. 187-89). The dedication of Cologne in 870 virtually coincided with the collapse of the empire. 17. PLAN OF ST. GALL.

Detail of border framing picture of St. Luke 19. Detail of border, framing picture of Christ [courtesy of the Bibliothèque Nationale] In 817 Abbot Ratgar of Fulda was deposed from his abbacy by Emperor Louis the Pious, apparently on the ground that Abbot Ratgar, in erecting at Fulda the largest church then existing north of the Alps (321 feet long and 100 feet wide), had taxed the brothers' physical and mental resources beyond endurance, ruined the monastery's economy, and shortened the lectio divina, neglected the traditional hospitality due pilgrims and other guests, and forced the monks to violate time-honored customs in many other ways.24 24 For a fuller discussion of the conflicts of Fulda, see below, pp. 187ff. These events show clearly enough that the issue of what the desirable length of a monastic church should be was very much alive at the time of the synods. It is quite possible, therefore, that the reduction of the length of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall from 300 feet (shown in the drawing) to 200 feet, as stipulated in one of its explanatory titles is, as Boeckelmann suggested, not the expression of a change of spirit that occurred between the time when an original scheme was drawn (816-817) and the time when the copy was made (around 820), but a corrective measure imposed upon the original scheme when it was discussed and endorsed at Aachen.25 25 Bischoff (in Studien, 1962, 77) has drawn attention to an interesting variation in the literary style of the passages in which these modifications are enunciated. Generally, the function of a particular building is expressed in the form of a subjunctive or of a plain indicative. The two metrical legends that list the dimensions of the interstices in the arcades of the nave and in the gallery of the western paradise (Nos. 4 and 5) use the imperative form of the infinitive. In adopting this change in his copy, Bishop Haito did not take it upon himself to alter the drawing. He retraced the layout of the prototype plan as he found it on the original drawing. AN ORNAMENTAL DETAIL SUGGESTING THE COURT SCHOOL AS THE CONCEPTUAL HOME OF THE PROTOTYPE PLAN There is an interesting ornamental detail on the Plan of St. Gall which suggests that the prototype plan might, indeed, have been drawn by a hand that was trained in the scriptorium of the court of Charlemagne, namely the "tendril"-shaped design which designates the trees in the Monks' Cemetery (fig. 17).26 26 For more details on the Monks' Cemetery, see II, 21. This motif has close parallels in a group of sumptuously illuminated manuscripts formerly designated as "Ada School" (after the legendary donor of one of its principal manuscripts) but now generally ascribed to the Court School.27 27 For a recent review of the manuscripts of the Court School, see Mütherich, 1965, 9-53. The motif appears first in the Godescalc Gospels, the earliest richly illuminated manuscript of the group, written and illuminated by the monk Godescalc (781-783) upon the request of Charlemagne (fig. 18).28 28 For the Godescalc Gospels, see Koehler, text vol. III, 1958, 22ff. There one also finds its classical prototype form (fig. 19). It reappears in the canon arches of the Ada Gospels, written around 800 by a certain "Ada Ancilla Dei," reputed to have been a sister of Charlemagne (fig. 20).29 29 For the Ada Gospels, see ibid., 34ff and 83ff. It is found again in the canon arches of the Harley Gospels (fig 21),30 30 For the Harley Gospels, see ibid., 56ff. and the Gospels of St. Medard de Soissons,31 31 For the Soissons Gospels, see ibid., 70ff. both from the beginning of the ninth century, as well as in various places of the Lorsch Gospels (figs. 22 and 23), one of the latest and most illustrious manuscripts of the Court School, written and illuminated around 810, presumably upon the request of Charlemagne (now in part in Alba Julia, Roumania, Bibliotheca Documentara Batthyaneum; in part in the Vatican Library, Pal. lat. 50).32 32 For the Lorsch Gospels, see ibid., 88ff and the magnificent facsimile edition published by Wolfgang Braunfels in 1967. The motif does not appear to be common to any of the other major schools of the period.33 33 It found its way into the Utrecht Psalter (Utrecht, University Library, written during the episcopate of Archbishop Ebo, 806-835). In this manuscript, however, the motif is only used as a designation for vines, never for trees. For a typical example see the illustration to Psalm LXVI (67), which shows two vines, each attached to a stake at the side of a tree (De Wald, n.d., Pl. CXII). I am tempted to ascribe the drawing of the prototype plan to a man who was trained in the tradition of the Court School. For reasons already given, this man must have worked in close association with Bishop Hildebold of Cologne, who as sacri palatii arcicapellanus (a title which he held from 791 to the day of his death in 819) continued to remain, even under the reign of Louis the Pious, the highest ranking churchman in the empire. More evidence in favor of the supposition that the original scheme of the Plan was developed by someone close to the imperial court is to be found in the striking similarities between the geometrical square-grid pattern used in the dimensional layout of the Plan with those which were employed, almost two decades earlier, in the layout of the palace grounds at Aachen.34 34 Eight of the guest and service buildings are of virtually identical design. Of these one might be able to identify, by the type of their furnishings and the presence of facilities for cooking, baking and brewing, the House for Distinguished Guests and the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers. The purpose of the others would be undeterminable without explanatory titles. There is no reason to assume that the scheme of the prototype plan differed in any appreciable manner from that of the copy. The very fact that the copy was made by tracing precludes this. Even the textual annotations must have been an integral part of the original, since without them, the purpose of a great number of buildings of virtually identical design would have remained incomprehensible.35 35 See above, pp. 9ff and below, pp. 139ff. Clearly not part of the original plan, of course, were the letter of transmission and the inscription of the main altar of the Church, which relate to the specific purpose of the copy.36 36 For evidence to support this conjecture see our remarks in "Confirming Evidence: The Palace Grounds at Aachen," below, pp. 104ff.

The Godescalc Gospels (figs. 18-19) can be dated with accuracy; the others are datable only on stylistic grounds. 22. LORSCH GOSPELS BUCHAREST, National Library (formerly Alba Julia, Roumania), fol. 71r about 810. [after Braunfels, 1967, 141] Detail from text of St. Matthew Gospels. In the frames of the text columns of the Lorsch Gospels the tendril motif appears, in linear form as on the Plan of St. Gall, on at least eighteen different folios, besides numerous variations and enrichments on other folios including the more plantlike classical prototype form. 23. LORSCH GOSPELS BUCHAREST, National Library (formerly Alba Julia, Roumania), fol. 10v ca. 810 [after Braunfels, 1967, 20] Detail of the fifth canon arch. The churchman in charge of the technical and aesthetic execution of the prototype plan (816-817) was trained at the so called "Court School"—a scriptorium that flourished in the emperor's entourage. It produced a magnificent series of sumptuously illustrated manuscripts in which decorative motifs of the preceding Hiberno-Saxon school of illumination (7th and 8th centuries) fused with classical tradition under the influence of a new group of Romano-Christian and Romano-Byzantine manuscripts that must have found their way to the emperor's court. The Godescalc Gospels is the earliest known manuscript of this school. It was executed between 771 and 773, at Charlemagne's request, by the scribe Godescalc, a member of the emperor's following. The illustrious manuscripts produced by the Court School during the next four decades included the Ada Gospels, the Harley Gospels, and the Gospels of St. Medard. The work of the school reached an aesthetic height in the Lorsch Gospels. Written and illuminated around 810, and kept during the Middle Ages in the monastery of Lorsch, it was done entirely in gold and includes, besides the twelve canon arches, portraits of the four evangelists and a striking image of Christ in Majesty at the beginning of Matthew. At some unknown time after the Middle Ages, the Lorsch Gospels were separated into two parts. The Gospels of Mark and Matthew, were transmitted to the Biblioteca Documentaria Bathyaneum and were eventually moved to the National Library, Bucharest; the Gospels of Luke and John came to be held by the Vatican Library. At the Council of Europe exhibition, KARL DER GROSSE (Aachen, 1965), the two parts of the Lorsch Gospels were re-united for the first time in centuries, and subsequently published in a superb facsimile edition, under the editorship of Wolfgang Braunfels. The union between classical illusionism and northern linearism that characterizes the style of Court School manuscripts has its parallel in architecture in the modular reorganization of the monolithic spaces of the Early Christian basilica, the nature and cultural significance of which is analyzed below in our discussion of square schematism (pp. 221ff). 24.A THE PLAN OF ST. GALL The drawing above illustrates how the large skin upon which the Plan is drawn is composed of an aggregate of five separate pieces of calfskin which, after being sewn together, form a drawing surface 113 cm high × 78 cm wide, a size impossible to obtain from the hide of a single animal. Our interpretation of the manner in which these skins were sewn together is given in the analysis of details reproduced and annotated on the pages that follow. Figure 24.B (page 36) shows in shaded tones the locations of these details. I. 10 HOW THE PLAN WAS DRAWN AND ASSEMBLED I.10.1 NUMBER OF SHEETS &amp; SEQUENCE IN WHICH THEY WERE SEWN TOGETHER The Plan is drawn upon a piece of parchment composed of five separate sheets of calfskin (not lamb or goat, as was formerly believed)1 1 Cf. Bischoff's remarks on this subject in Studien, 1962, 73, note 16. and sewn together by threads of gut (fig. 24, nos. 1-5). The drawing is on the softer inner side of the skins, which show traces of scraping and are slightly roughened by pumice stone. The edges are irregular, most markedly so on the right-hand side of the Plan, where the skins did not yield sufficient surfaces to allow the corners to be squared. The largest over-all dimensions of the Plan are 30¾ × 44 3/16 inches (78 × 112 cm.).2 2 As the edges are very irregular, the dimensions vary from place to place. The length varies between 44 3/16 and 44 inches (112.3 and 111.8 cm.); the width between 30¾ and 28 11/16 inches (78.2 and 73 cm.). The original dimensions are more likely to have been in the neighborhood of 32 × 46 inches. Konrad Hecht, who engaged in some interesting speculations on this subject, estimates the over-all shrinkage to which the parchment was subjected in ten centuries of aging to amount to 5 to 6 percent of the original surface area.3 3 Konrad Hecht, 1965, 194ff. Even today the dimensions vary slightly in response to changing humidity conditions.4 4 According to observations made by Dr. Duft; see below p. 97. The distribution of the monastic buildings over the five component sheets of the Plan is as follows: sheets 1 and 2 accommodate the Church, the Claustrum, the guest and service structures to the north of the Church as well as in the corner between the Church and the Claustrum; sheet 3 accommodates the service structures south of the Claustrum; sheet 4, the Novitiate and the Infirmary, the Cemetery, and all the other structures to the east of the Church; sheet 5, the stables for the livestock and all the other agricultural service structures to the west of the Church. The sequence in which the sheets were sewn together can be reconstructed from the manner in which they overlap each other. First, sheet 2 was attached to sheet 1 from below. Next, sheet 3 was sewn onto sheets 1 and 2, again from below. Then sheets 4 and 5 were sewn to sheet group 1, 2, 3 from above (fig. 24, nos. 1-5). The material used for threading the seams is a natural uncolored gut identifiable as such even on the facsimile (in contrast to the green pieces of thread that were used at a relatively recent date to patch together certain sections along the former folding lines of the Plan where the parchment was torn). A closer look at these seams suggests that not all of them were stitched by the same hand. The seams that hold sheets 1, 2, and 3 together are made in short stitches and take a surprisingly swerving course, while the seams through which sheets 4 and 5 are attached to the sheet-group 1, 2, 3 follow a very straight course and are sewn in longer and more elegant stitches.5 5 I owe this observation to my graduate student Anita Merrit, who has considerable experience in sewing. It looks very much as though some dissatisfaction had arisen in the draftsman's mind over the coarse manner in which sheets 1, 2, and 3 were sewn together, resulting in an improved performance where sheets 4 and 5 are attached. There is clear evidence that sheets 1, 2, and 3 were sewn together before the drawing was started, since the lines of the drawing all run in a continuous motion over the edges of these sheets, from the higher lying sheet on to the lower one. Where sheet 1 overlaps sheet 2 (fig. 25, the lines must have been drawn in the direction from sheet 1 to sheet 2 since the quill did not smear, as it would inevitably have done had the stroke been conducted upward from sheet 2 over the edge of sheet 1. Where sheets 1 and 2 overlap sheet 3, again, the lines were drawn from the higher sheet (1 and 2) to the lower lying one (3). For more detail I refer the reader to the explanatory caption of figures 26-28. In general the draftsman moved his line in a continuous stroke across seam and edge, but in some cases he stopped at the edge of the higher sheet and started a new stroke on the lower sheet, so that the impact of the quill with the edge of the higher sheet bent the start of his line into a hook (fig. 28 and 29). The ductus of the line shows all of the possible effects of the encounter of the quill with the seam and the edge of the sheets: a slight tendency for the ink to spatter at these critical points, a minute disruption of the straightness of the line as the quill takes a slight leap from the edge of the upper skin to the surface of the lower, and a minute tendency to swerve at this point. Nowhere in sheet-group 1, 2, 3 is any part of the drawing covered up by an overlapping margin of the adjacent sheet—clear evidence that this group of sheets must have been sewn together before the drawing was started. Sheets 4 and 5 must have been drawn separately and sewn onto sheet-group 1, 2, 3 only after the latter had been completed (fig. 24). This can be inferred from the fact that a number of lines on sheets 1 and 2 are covered up by the overlapping margin of sheet-group 4, 5. Thus, for instance, the easternmost portion of the eastern apse of the Church (fig. 30) is completely drawn out on sheet 1, but covered up by the overlapping edge of sheet 4, as one can see when lifting the overlapping edge from the front side of the Plan. Similarly, the ascending stroke of the letter A of the great axial inscription AB ORIENTE IN OCCIDENTEM . . . appears on both the covered portion of sheet 1 and the 24.B PLAN OF ST. GALL EXAMINATION OF CONDITIONS WHERE LINES OF THE DRAWING CROSS OVERLAPPING SEAMS A key plan for figures 25 through 32 The "window" areas of the Plan shown on opposite page define the location of those areas of the drawing which are examined in detail in figs. 25 through 32. In all these places the scribe's lines cross seams and overlapping edges, thereby revealing much about the sequence in which the five component sheets of parchment were assembled. Figs. 33-40 attempt to illustrate the eight successive stages of the growth of the tracing. The interpretation is based primarily on two types of observation: 1. The progress of work as inferred from the manner in which the lines are drawn in critical areas where they run across the overlapping margins of two joined pieces of parchment (figs. 25 through 30). 2. The detection of certain angular distortions in the layout of buildings, which we attribute to a mainly inadvertent shift in the relationship of overlay and original, incurred in the process of tracing. The draftsmanship of the Plan adheres to a prevailing concept of rectangularity in its overall design as well as in the inter-relation of many internal systems of rectangularity. Even unaided, the eye is able to discern deflections between adjacent systems, in several places. We are convinced that these could not have occurred in the construction of the original drawing from which the Plan was copied. The draftsmanship of the Plan of St. Gall exhibits a high degree of manual expertise, but the Plan was traced and therefore not dependent on any mechanical aid. The original scheme, by contrast, must necessarily have been constructed. Large and complex as it was, its author could not possibly have accomplished the orderliness and scale correctness by which it was characterized without mechanical aids, such as graduated straightedges, T-squares and or other similar devices, the use of which would have precluded angular deviation. The rectangular distortions in the Plan, and its deflections from the square, we are convinced, were caused by difficulties encountered in the act of tracing, an operation far from simple in a time when aids such as light boxes, tracing paper, and adhesive tape for securing both the original parchment and the overlay parchment with absolute precision, were unknown. overlapping margin of sheet 4.6 6 The connecting portions of the semicircle of the eastern paradise, however, were drawn after the sheets had been attached to each other. The are does not continue under the margin. The same condition can be observed at the western end of the Church (fig. 31). Here the porch was drawn out in its entirety on sheet 2 before sheet 5 was sewn onto it from above. Sheet 5 also covers the lower portion of the word habebit in the porch inscription, not to the extent, however, of having to be redrawn on sheet 5. From these conditions it follows conclusively that the drawings of sheet-group 1, 2, 3 must have been completed before the sheets 4 and 5 were added to this group.7 7 Hecht, 1965, 168ff questions this conclusion without convincing evidence. Cf. my counterargument in Horn and Born, 1966, 288, note 20. (For additional evidence, see extended caption of fig 30.) There is no conclusive evidence to show that sheet 5 was drawn at a later stage than sheet 4. But it is obvious that the buildings on sheet 4 are of greater importance for the life of the monastic community than the service structures shown on sheet 5, and therefore would command a higher priority in attention. Moreover, the draftsmanship of certain buildings on sheet 5, exhibiting signs of fatigue as will be shown in a later place, suggests that this portion of the Plan was the last to be drawn. I.10.2 SUCCESSIVE STAGES IN TRACING THE PLAN Certain peculiarities in the drawing tell us a good deal about the working procedures of the draftsman and about the sequence in which the buildings were traced. It is quite obvious that the draftsman was right-handed, and that he made his copy by tracing the successive portions of the drawing from left to right and from top to bottom. Our analysis of the manner in which the quill responded to the hurdle of the seams and edges of the overlapping margins of the respective sheets left no doubt on this score (see the extended captions of figs. 26-29). There is no dearth of further confirmatory evidence. The distinctive marks of the first impact of the ink with the parchment as the quill touches the skin, and the tendency of the ink to diminish in bulk as the line stretches out and to trail into a thin tail as the quill is lifted can be observed in scores of places. Also to be noticed in this connection is the fact that the ductus of the draftsman's line was relatively straight and sure when he started his work on the left-hand side of the skin and remained so as long as his hand retained a firm base. But it developed a tendency to swerve as his hand reached a point where it began to lose its rest, as it was bound to do, at the lower right-hand corner of the sheet. Clear evidence of this is: the Bake and Brew House for Distinguished Guests (the last to be drawn of the buildings that lie to the north of the Church); the Medicinal Herb Garden (the last installation to be drawn on sheet 4); and the houses for the cows and foaling mares and their keepers (the last to be drawn on sheet 5). The primary clue to identifying the sequence in which the buildings were drawn is the number of shifts in the relative position of original and overlay that occurred in PLAN OF ST. GALL 25.A OVERLAPPING EDGES OF SHEETS 1 AND 2 ACROSS HOUSE FOR DISTINGUISHED GUESTS AND THE MONASTERY CHURCH Sheet 2 was sewn to sheet 1 from below, a procedure that can be demonstrated by the scribe's lines, which run in continuous motion over the edges from the higher-lying to the lower sheet, and from left to right east to west). The design reveals extraordinary skill of draftsmanship. The line crosses the seam in a continuous motion, wherever the quill finds free passage in the interstice between the gut, and drops from the upper to the lower-lying sheet with almost no displacement or tremor. Nowhere in sheet group 1, 2, 3 is a part of the lower sheet covered by the overlapping margin of the upper sheet—clear proof that sheets 1, 2, 3 were sewn together before the tracing was begun. PLAN OF ST. GALL 26. DETAIL OF FENCE, MONKS' REFECTORY TO GREAT COLLECTIVE WORKSHOP Drawn from left to right, the line stops on reaching the seam. It starts out again immediately behind the seam and runs in smooth and continuous motion from sheet 1 over its edge down to sheet 3. 27.A COVERED PASSAGEWAY, MONKS' KITCHEN TO MONKS' BAKE &amp; BREW HOUSE The upper line crosses seam and edge of sheet 1 in continuous motion. The lower line stops on reaching the protruding portion of the gut, makes a fresh start behind it, and runs smoothly across the edge onto the lower surface of sheet 3, it makes a minute jump westward. 27.B A CORNER OVERLAP This interesting detail shows the corner at which sheets 1, 2, 3 overlap each other, clearly revealing that sheets 1 and 2 must have already been joined before sheet 3 was attached from below. PLAN OF ST. GALL 25.B CHURCH 25.C MONKS' CELLAR AND LARDER. CONDITION AT FENCE TO WEST In drawing the choir screen, which connects the second pair of nave columns transversely, the draftsman had to guide his quill lengthwise over the protruding ridges of the seam, an ennervating experience which he later tried to avoid by moving the line away from the seam when he encountered similar conditions in drawing the west wall of the Cellar. PLAN OF ST. GALL 28. HOUSE OF COOPERS AND WHEELWRIGHTS. DETAIL At A and C the line runs smoothly and continuously over seam and overlapping margin of sheet 1 down to sheet 3. At C the line stops at the edge of sheet 1 and starts fresh on the lower-lying sheet 3, being bent into a hook by the impact of the quill with the edge of sheet 1. 29. HOUSE FOR HORSES AND OXEN. DETAIL The lines are drawn from left to right smoothly across the seam, and in one case (third line from bottom), smoothly over the edge of sheet 2; but in all other cases the line stops at the edge of sheet 2 and makes a fresh start on sheet 3. The edge of the overlapping sheet bends the start of the line into a hook. PLAN OF ST. GALL MONASTERY CHURCH, WESTERN APSE AND PARADISE 30. The two easternmost portions of the apse are completely drawn out on sheet 1, but covered up by the overlapping edge of sheet 4—clear proof that sheet 4 was not attached to sheet group 1, 2, 3 when the Church and the Claustrum were drawn. By inspecting the original, one would observe that the rounding arcs of the apse on sheet 1 extend beyond the seam by which sheet 4 is fastened to sheet group 1, 2, 3. the process of tracing, entailing deflections in the drawing which cannot have been part of the original concept.8 8 The observation that original and overlay shifted on several occasions as the Plan was traced was first made by me in Studien, 1962, 97ff. In the meantime this theory has been greatly refined in a graduate seminar report of Marc Pessin; the analysis that follows is our joint work. A left-to-right and top-to-bottom movement frequently referred to in the following stages of growth for tracing the Plan is not exclusively controlled by convention in direction of writing. In tracing, top-to-bottom issues mainly from the need to avoid smearing ink. (Writing executed in clay or wax, as in many ancient languages, could be from right to left). The tracer is influenced by long established writing convention, but he is not governed by it. He traces where it is most convenient, moving freely from area to area according to the matter he is working on. Drying time of the writing fluid used has much to do with the tracer's sequence. On completing a series of lines in one area he relocates, usually to a safe distance removed from lines still wet, then shifts back to the previous part of a different part. Thus while tracing sequence may generally be left to right, discontinuity is a characteristic in the Plan. When drawing a set of lines perpendicular to another set, a draftsman prefers to turn the sheet roughly 90° or to shift his position similarly, rather than draw from the same position— pushing the pen or pulling it toward him is avoided. However each method is used. The one adopted, extremely a matter of personal choice, is related to the tracer's temperament, his experience, kind of materials, and equipment used, lighting conditions and other matters. If the Plan abounds with inexplicable details of execution it is because tracing, like drafting, is a highly subjective skill, defiant of rational prediction or logical deduction, except in a very general way. In offering this study and analysis of the tracing stages of the great Plan, the authors are humble in mindfulness of the problem and respectful of the scribes and draftsmen who made it. PLAN OF ST. GALL PORCH GIVING ACCESS TO WESTERN ATRIUM OF CHURCH 31. The last word of the explanatory title of the Porch, HABEBIT, is partially covered by the overlapping margin of sheet 5, which was sewn onto sheet group 1, 2, 3 from above. The Porch had been drawn in its entirety on sheet 2 before sheet 5 was sewn onto it. PLAN OF ST. GALL. DETAIL, BAKE AND BREWHOUSE OF THE HOSPICE FOR PILGRIMS AND PAUPERS (NORTH OF FENCE) AND HOUSE FOR HORSES AND OXEN (SOUTH OF FENCE) 32. The corners of these two buildings are partially covered by the overlapping margin of sheet 5, which suggests that these buildings were drawn at a time when sheet 5 was as yet not attached to sheet group 1, 2, 3. 33. STAGE 1 OF TRACING The draftsman faces the Church from the west and traces the eastern parts of the Church and Dormitory with their subsidiary buildings from left to right. Sheet group 1, 2, 3, sewn and assembled for the draftsman to work on, is shown with color tint. Pale red lines indicate Plan not traced at this stage. Sheets 4 and 5, illustrated in subdued line, are incorporated as part of the Plan later as shown in figure 40. COMMENTS In our study of the Plan of St. Gall, over a long period of years, it has constantly been necessary to have a line, or base of reference, from which to take measurements or from which to relate one element of the Plan with another. The north row of columns of the Church nave appears to offer the most satisfactory remaining evidence on which to establish a kind of base or reference line. It will be seen on the facsimile reproduction (see p. 3, n17) that a line drawn between the center of the most easterly column W (fig. 34) of the north row of columns establishes probably the "strongest" line on the Plan. This line, Z-Z, is shown extended to the border, top and bottom. Nine columns intermediate between these two extremity columns E-W, deviate but slightly from this imaginary line. This line, incidentally, contains the longest clearly defined measure of the Plan. The reference to 300 feet, length of the Church, elsewhere on the Plan, is not so explicit. The corresponding row of columns on the south side of the nave deviates only very slightly more from a similar line exactly parallel to the line of the north row. The longitudinal axis of the Church has been taken as a line midway between and parallel to these two rows of columns and is shown on the drawings as a ruled dot-and-dash line, Y-Y. It is a useful reference line from which, visually, to detect the presence or absence of symmetry. In the following analytic remarks the east-west geometry of the nave serves as a base from which deflections or angular relationships are referred. The axis of the Church has been taken as an axis of ordinates. Because the north row and the south row of columns (the piers of the crossing square are included in the column count) are so slightly affected by aberrations in tracing, it is likely that they were among the first items to be drawn by the draftsman and were completed (fig. 33) prior to shifting movements made later, consciously or inadvertently (see note, pp. 48, 49). As for a convenient reference line (X-X) exactly at right angles to the nave geometry, the north-south walls of the Dormitory are satisfactory, although a wobbly condition toward the south near the Refectory is noticeable and suggests that the draftsman was beginning to have tracing troubles which were to plague him intermittently from there on to completion. The pair of north-south walls of the Cellar likewise is normal to the control geometry of the nave. STAGE 1 (fig. 33) Facing the Plan from the west the draftsman started the drawing on sheet-group 1, 2, 3 with the eastern end of the Church, moving from left to right and from the top downward as far as the second pair of nave columns, then in a southerly direction to the Annex for the Preparation of the Holy Oil and Bread, the Monks' Dormitory and its auxiliary buildings, until the south walls of the Monks' Privy and the Monks' Laundry and Bathhouse were reached. The irregular course of the lines discloses that the draftsman worked without instruments, completing each individual area before moving on to the next one. As he traced the beds in the southern part of the Dormitory [3],* * Numbers in [brackets] refer to building numbers of Plan, p. xxiv. the overlay apparently slipped slightly to the left about one module,9 9 See pp. 89 and 91 for an extended discussion of this term. thus extending this building a little more to the south than it was meant to be. The discussion that continues is concerned with tracing and drafting procedure, with countless movements of hand, body and pen, which can never be reconstructed with certainty or uncovered by intellectual process. The remarks, stages 2-8, with comments in captions for figures 33-40, are pursued as a valid component of inquiry into genesis—copy or original? 34. STAGE 2 OF TRACING Just before the scribe draws the south wall of the Dormitory, a shift occurs between original and overlay, causing an angular deflection between Dormitory and Refectory, which is transmitted to Cloister Yard, Cellar, as well as parts of the Church from column 5 westward. * LEGEND Z prime reference nave columns, north row (line continuous) y line parallel to Y, Z Y parallel to Z axis of Church and reference ordinate (line dot-and-dash) X reference co-ordinate, normal to Y and Z (line continuous) a, c line deflected by angle from reference ordinate Y(Z) (line dotted) ? angle of deflection from ordinate Y(Z) ?′ angle of deflection in excess of ? [applies to figure 35, page 44] NOTE Continuous line system is square with the nave geometry, i.e., continuous lines are either parallel or perpendicular to the axis of the Church. Dotted line system is square with the angle of deflection. STAGE 2 (fig. 34) As the last lines of the Dormitory were drawn, a second, more consequential shift took place. This time it was not in a sideward direction, but was a rotary motion. This may be inferred in that the Cloister Yard, obviously meant to form a square, is not quadrate but trapezoidal (fig. 36). East-west walls of the Refectory [6] are not parallel to the Church axis, as they should be, but are inclined to it. Prior to this shift the Church tracing possibly had been confined mostly to its eastern parts and the columns of the nave (comments, p. 47) but not including its exterior walls on the north and south. Tracing of the south side of the Church began near the nave column pair 3. The effect of this deflection is shown on the Church north wall, west of (near) column pair 4. We believe that the draftsman, after working on the Church, generally peripheral to the area of the chancel, altar, and crossing, then moved to the uncompleted part of the Cloister Yard and the buildings around it, in the sequence of the Refectory, cellar [7], and Kitchen [8]. The ductus of the lines defining the stave curvature of the large barrels in the Cellar (decreasing in strength from east to west) suggests that he still faced the drawing from the west as he drew this building. This position would not be an impossible one for tracing the Refectory. 35. STAGE 3 OF TRACING After Church and Claustrum were completed the draftsman rotated the skins counterclockwise by 90 degrees and traced the buildings to the north of the Church, in the sequence: Abbot's House, Outer School, House for Distinguished Guests, without correcting the deflection caused by the shift that occurred at the end of Stage 1. A number of further shifts occurs as this latest portion of the tracing is finished. STAGE 3 (fig. 35) The draftsman is positioned to look south. He draws in sequence: Abbot's House [14,13], Outer School [12], House for Distinguished Guests [11], and Kitchen, Bake and Brewhouse for Distinguished Guests [10]. The first buildings in the sequence have their east-west walls parallel to the nave geometry. However, the third building [11], its south half in a deflected position, its north side with a curious bent wall alignment, may imply a struggle by the draftsman to correct the angular shift and return to parallel position. In the fifth building [10], its east-west (south) wall is deflected to exceed all other angular deviations, save one, the east-west walls of building [40]. That he traced these houses facing the Church from the north is disclosed by the ductus of a good many lines which decrease in strength as they are drawn from left to right and from the top to the bottom. The shift between original and overlay had moved the Abbot's House slightly to the east of its proper position. The draftsman compensated for this displacement by drawing the gallery, connecting the Abbot's House with the northern transept of the Church, on a slightly slanted, rather than rectangular, course to the nave geometry. 36. STAGE 4 OF TRACING The draftsman shifts his skin back into its original position working from left to right in this sequence: Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers [31]. House for Coopers and Wheelwrights and Brewers' Granary [39], Drying Kiln [29], Kitchen, Bake, and Brewhouse for Pilgrims, Paupers [32], and house for Horses and Oxen and their Keepers [33]—again without correcting the shift. STAGE 4 (fig. 36) When the tract to the north of the Church was finished we believe that the draftsman rotated the parchment back to the position of Stages 1 and 2, and then traced buildings west of the Claustrum probably in this sequence: Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers [31], House of Coopers and Wheelwrights and Brewer's Granary [39], Drying Kiln [29], Kitchen, Bake, Brewhouse for Pilgrims and Paupers [32], and house for Horses, Oxen, and their Keepers [33]. The north-south lines of these five buildings are practically perpendicular to the nave geometry (west wall of [32] is deflected), whereas the east-west lines of each of these buildings follow the same deflection found in the Refectory. The condition (one set of lines square, the other oblique), an interesting one, may be evidence of effort by the draftsman to recover, in part, from the troublesome deflection described in Stages 1, 2. The ductus of the lines leaves no doubt. The draftsman faced the Plan from the west as he traced these houses (thicker ends at the top as the lines were drawn from east to west, and at the left as they were drawn from north to south). 37. STAGE 5 OF TRACING The draftsman swings the skins clockwise by 90 degrees and traces the buildings that lie to the south of the Claustrum by facing the monastery from the south. The alignment of these buildings discloses that the shift had been detected and corrected. The deflection of the south walls of the buildings [28, 27] is similar to the deflection of the north wall, east end of the Church, line C, figure 34. STAGE 5 (fig. 37) When the tracing had reached the stage defined in fig. 36, the draftsman had become aware of the fact that overlay and original had moved, and he decided to realign the two skins. He readjusted the sheets, thus bringing the buildings south of the Claustrum back into their original position (not entirely, but nearly so), necessitating a deflection of the line that connected the south wall of the Drying Kiln (traced before readjustment) to the corresponding south wall of the Mortar House [28], the deflected line continued eastward as the south wall of the Mill [27], to its north-south wall on the east, at which point it was restored to normal position and in alignment with the south wall of the Workshop Annex [26]. The other buildings of this group appear to have been drawn, generally, from left to right and from top to bottom in this sequence: Monks' Bake and Brewhouse [9], Mortar House [29], Mill House [27], Great Collective Workshop [25], with Annex [26], and Granary [24]. These buildings have their east-west and north-south walls perpendicular to each other and are square with the nave geometry. STAGE 6 (fig. 38) The sequence of tracing the buildings on sheet 4 (which we presume to have been separately drawn and completed before it was sewn on to sheet-group 1, 2, 3) is difficult to establish. The most functional approach for the draftsman would have been to face this section of the Plan from the east, since this would keep the bulk of the original away from his body. But tracing the circles of Hen and Goose Houses [23, 21] required a complete rotation of the skins; 38. STAGE 6 OF TRACING The buildings east of the Church were traced on sheet 4 before this sheet was attached to sheet group 1, 2, 3. The draftsman apparently drew the buildings from left to right, facing the monastery from the east. Evidence of shifts and deflections during the act of tracing, visible on sheets 1, 2, 3, 5, is almost absent. The prolonged axis of the Church coincides with the axis of the Novitiate-Infirmary complex [17], the walls of which are square with the axis. Walls of other buildings on this sheet are square, or deviate from square no more than would ordinarily be expected in tracing large sheets. Sheet 4 adheres closest to perpendicularity with respect to the nave geometry. other areas of this tract, especially the Cemetery [y], suggest that the draftsman may have worked from several sides. (The southern line of the square that encloses the cross seems to be drawn from west to east; the northern line, from east to west.) A slight displacement occurred when this sheet was sewn on to the center group of sheets. The axis of the Chapel [17a, b] of the Novitiate [17c] and Infirmary [17d] lies on the axis of the Church, Y-Y. Where sheet 4 laps on top of sheet group 1, 2, 3, (figure 24.A), a total of six building wall lines cross from one sheet to another sheet. On the Plan, where sheet 5 overlaps sheet group 1, 2, 3, only two lines cross from sheet to sheet. Laps made at some north-south lines might have had as many as 50 or more lines in conjunction. Was the troublesome problem of conjunction of lines, where sheets overlap, a consideration in making the copy? Certainly the assembly, as made, has the least possible number of crossover line breaks. 39. STAGE 7 OF DRAWING Like their counterparts in the east the buildings lying west of the Church were traced upon a separate piece of parchment (sheet 5) before this sheet was sewn on to the center group of sheets (1, 2, 3). The draftsman faced the monastery from the west as he drew this portion of the Plan. In the course of tracing, considerable clockwise twist took place. The greatest deviation from square with the nave geometry is exhibited in the lower right hand corner (southwest). STAGE 7 (fig. 39) The last sheet of the Plan to be traced was the tract south of the Church containing anonymous building [34] in the northwest corner south of the access road of the Church, and south of the road, building [38], use uncertain, with five buildings for livestock and their keepers. Sheet 5 presents perplexing interest. Building [34], literally rectangular, is also square with the nave geometry, as it ought to be. Moving southward to the right, access road and buildings [35, 38], display clockwise deflection which agrees with that of the Refectory. Continuing southward, deflections progressively increase in magnitude to their maximum in [40], in the southwest corner of the Plan. What gains the attention as one surveys the full expanse of the parchment is this: the well ordered pattern of the building layout that pervades the rest of the Plan in all its parts, apparently goes awry in the lower right corner in an odd dipping and tilting configuration. An explanation for this departure from ordered regulation is not obvious. 40. STAGE 8 (FINAL) OF DRAWING Sheets 4 and 5 have been attached to sheet group 1, 2, 3. for LEGEND see figure 34 Z prime reference, nave columns, north row (line continuous) Y parallel to Z (line dot-and-dash) y parallel to Y, Z (line continuous) X reference co-ordinate, normal to Y, Z (line continuous) a line deflected by ? angle of deflection from Y, Z. ?? accumulated deflection NOTE Short dash line and X-dash line are lines deflected greater than ? It is reasonable to assume that the parchment, as we know it today, has always been irregular in shape on the right (south on the Plan), that is, the shape was not altered by some unexplainable local contraction or shrinkage. Top and bottom of the parchment are, respectively, about 92 and 93 per cent of the median width. It is also reasonable to assume that the original Plan was drawn with normal consistency in all parts without distortion (including the lower right corner) on a parchment generally rectangular like the left side of the existing parchment. The Goose House posed no problem to the tracer since the circular form of its plan fitted neatly into the irregular shape at this location (sheet 4 of the asembly). At the lower right of the parchment there was a different condition. Buildings 37 and 40, both rectangular in plan, rather than circular, suffered in the double set-back from the general alignment of the south buildings (right) of the Plan. That the draftsman did not make this revision quite fit is illustrated by the south and west boundary fence lines intersecting just outside of the confining edge of the parchment (sheet 5). Conditions here support a belief that the draftsman was striving to overcome the constrictive inadequacy of the parchment and that the angular deviation from square, seen here, in part at least, is evidence of an attempt to compensate for inadequate space on which to trace directly from the original parchment. Thus, the lack of necessary space invited a degree of irregularity in tracing that was not inadvertent—a compelling argument, it seems, that the existing Plan is a copy. In other words, to achieve his objective— fitting an image into a space too small—by composing all the elements of the original within the space at his disposal without drastically changing the size of the buildings not appreciably altering the scale of the Plan, the draftsman began making incremental adjustments as be traced, starting at a point somewhat removed from the trouble spot at the southwest corner of the parchment. His estimate of small incremental adjustments of contraction and deflection, as he proceeded with the task, was remarkably successful. Apparent distortion, and lack of symmetric perfection at this location are really no less than a brilliant solution to an impossible task. E.B. Slovenliness and deterioration of line quality, the first signs of boredom, exhaustion, declining interest in the act of drafting, are not in evidence. On the contrary, the crisp, neat execution prevailing elsewhere in the Plan persists here. Ennui and enervation of draftsman do not seem to explain this problem.* * See note for Figure 40 beginning on page 47. In tracing the buildings the draftsman had to struggle with the relative opaqueness of the sheet upon which he traced his copy, or perhaps even with the difficult problem of holding his sheets in a position that would allow the reflected sunlight to penetrate the superimposed parchments with sufficient strength to make the design of the original readable through the body of the overlay. By contrast the explanatory titles could be inscribed under optimal conditions for the writing hand, as the parchment, with its tracing completed, rested on the hard surface of a table where the arm found solid support. The calligraphic precision and firmness of the script leaves no doubt on this score. Since some of the inscriptions of sheet-group 1, 2, 3 continue under the overlapping margins of sheets 4 and 5, the explanatory titles of the center group of sheets, as has been shown, must have been completed before sheets 4 and 5 were added. It is logical to presume that the inscriptions of the two outer sheets (4 and 5) likewise were entered before these sheets were attached to the center group, since they would be easier to handle separately than after attachment. In general (but by no means exclusively so) the scribe's working procedure paralleled that of the draftsman. The majority of the titles of the Church were inscribed transversely, the scribe facing the Church from the west, the position in which the parchments were held as this building was traced. He rotated the skin counterclockwise by 90 degrees before inscribing the long axial title defining the length of the Church, plus the two other longitudinal titles that list the span of the columnar interstices of the nave arcades. Still facing the Church from the north, he inscribed the titles of the Scriptorium and the Library as well as those of all the lodgings that range along the northern aisle of the Church (Visiting Monks, Master of Outer School, and Porter). The titles of the corresponding rooms on the southern side of the Church were entered from the opposite direction, which required a counterrotation of the parchment by 180 degrees. Further rotations were necessitated by the inscriptions of the semicircular titles of the two atria as well as the two circular towers. Again the principle of rotation was used in placing the inscriptions of the Cloister Yard and the buildings around it. Here the scribe stationed himself conceptually in the center of the cloister garth and entered his inscriptions clockwise, rotating the parchment counterclockwise beneath his hand as he moved from building to building around the four corners of the square, until he had made a complete turn of 360 degrees. Other cases involving complete rotation are the circular enclosures for the chicken and geese and the title hic mansiunculae scolasticarum in the Outer School. For the rest, i.e., all of the buildings ranging peripherally around the Church and the claustral block, the scribe followed the simple procedure of inscribing his titles facing each respective tract from the outer edge of the Plan, which relieved him of the need to bend far over the parchment. Exceptions to this rule are made only in those cases where the particular shape of a room forced the scribe to enter his titles at right angles rather than parallel to the edge of the Plan (typical cases: Abbot's House, and House of the Fowlkeepers). There are, however, two notable exceptions: the title that defines the functions of the large cross in the Monks' Cemetery, and the letter of transmittal entered on the margin to the east of the cemetery. They face west, like the majority of the titles of the Church, thus suggesting that the Plan was to be primarily viewed from the west. An inscription that does not fall into the normal pattern is the title designating the entrance to the Library, perhaps an afterthought. It straddles the north wall of the fore choir and faces east, in contrast to all other titles written transversely into the church. I. 11 THE CONCEPTUAL HOMOGENEITY OF THE PLAN I.11.1 HOMOGENEITY IN QUESTION On three different occasions, and each time for different reasons, the conceptual homogeneity of the Plan of St. Gall has been questioned: first, in 1952 by Hans Reinhardt,1 1 Reinhardt, 1952, 8; and reiterated in Studien, 1962, 59. second in 1957 by Erwin Poeschel,2 2 Poeschel, 1957; and again in Studien, 1962, 29-30. and third in 1963/64 by Adolf Reinle.3 3 Reinle, 1963/64, 108ff. REINHARDT, 1952 Reinhardt expressed the view that the buildings that appear on the large rectangular tract to the east and west of the Church (sheets 4 and 5) were not part of the original scheme but an afterthought or a later addition. He inferred this from the fact that sheets 4 and 5 were added to the center portion of the Plan only after the buildings on the latter had been delineated and inscribed with their explanatory titles.4 4 Reinhardt, loc. cit. Reinhardt's factual observations on this score were correct and important, but to infer from them that the scheme of the Plan was a compilation of parts created at different times involves a confusion between the conceptual homogeneity of the original scheme and the physical assemblage of the various pieces of parchment on which the copy was traced. A monastery could hardly function without the buildings that appear on the top and bottom sheets of the Plan, which consist of such basic and indispensable monastic facilities as the Novitiate, the Monks' Infirmary, the Cemetery, the House of the Physicians, the House for Bloodletting, the Vegetable Garden and the Gardener's House, the houses for the chicken and geese and their keepers, as well as the entire aggregate of buildings west of the Church which shelter the milk- and cheese-producing animals so vital to the monastic economy. An analysis of the distribution of the buildings and their respective functions in the monastic community discloses that there is no conceptual disparity along the lines that Reinhardt suggests. Some of the most vital monastic needs are met by installations that lie on sheet 4 to the east of the Church (Novitiate and Infirmary, House of the Physicians, House for Bloodletting), whereas some of the most basic service functions are accommodated in houses shown on the center portion of the Plan (sheetgroup 1, 2, 3) together with Church and Claustrum (Granary, Great Collective Workshop, Mill, Mortar, Drying Kiln, House of Coopers and Wheelwrights, House for Horses and Oxen and Their Keepers). POESCHEL, 1957 Poeschel believed that Reinhardt's view of the composite origin of the Plan was corroborated by the fact that in his letter of transmittal the author of the Plan of St. Gall refers to the monastic buildings as officinae, i.e., "workshops."5 5 Poeschel, loc. cit. This, Poeschel argued, can only mean that the layout of the Church and the Cloister had already been worked out in a previous drawing and that the Plan of St. Gall was primarily concerned with the development of the service structures. It would have been sounder, historically, to infer from the use of the word officina that the author of the transmittal note employed this term in the general sense of "building" or "installation," rather than to take the radical step of concluding from its occurrence that the Plan was patched together in separate conceptual stages. A closer look at the use of the word officina in medieval literature subsequently proved, indeed, beyond any shadow of doubt, that the word was employed in this broader sense —not only in the monastic nomenclature of the ninth century, but even in the language of the very founder of western monachism, St. Benedict.6 6 Cf. Bischoff in Studien, 1962, 67-68; and Hafner, ibid., 178-79. "The workshops wherein we shall diligently execute all these tasks," we are told in chapter 4 of the Rule, "are the enclosures [claustra] of the monastery and stability of the congregation,"7 7 "Officina uero, ubi haec omnia diligenter operemur, claustra sunt monasterii et stauilitas in congregatione" (Benedicti regula, chap. 4, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 35; ed. McCann, 1963, 32-33; ed. Steidle, 1952, 114). to which the ninth-century commentators Basilius and pseudo-Paulus add: ". . . and properly does he [St. Benedict] refer to these workshops in the plural form, because the places in the monastery where the `work of God' is done are many; one workshop is the place where the Holy Scriptures are read, another one is the place for prayer, another one the place where the sick are attended to, and still another one the place where the dead are buried."8 8 "Et bene dixit officina plurali numero, quia diversa sunt loca in monasterio, ubi dei opera aguntur. Verbi gratia, aliud officinum est ubi legitur, aliud ubi oratur, aliud ubi infirmis servitur, aliud ubi mortuus sepelitur" (Hafner, in Studien, 1962, 179). The commentary leaves no room for misinterpretation: "workshop" is a term that applies to the Church as well as to all of the claustral structures. It is applicable, even, to the monastic cemetery. REINLE, 1963-4 Reinle's reasons for questioning the conceptual homogeneity of the Plan were of an entirely different order. In his analysis of the dimensional incongruities between the Church as it is shown on the Plan and the measurements listed in some of its explanatory titles,9 9 See below, pp. 78ff. he had come to the disconcerting conclusion that the drafter of the scheme made use of no fewer than three different scales: 1. A foot equivalent to 34.0 cm., which determined the dimensions of the Church and the Cloister.10 10 Reinle, 1963/64, 108ff. 2. A foot equivalent to 29.2-29.7 cm., used in the construction of the Novitiate and the Infirmary.11 11 Ibid., 105-106. 3. A foot equivalent to 30.0 cm., used in the planning of the guest and service structures of the monastery, as well as of the Monks' Cemetery and Garden.12 12 Ibid., 106-107. These findings, Reinle concludes, show that the Plan is composed of heterogeneous parts, compiled from several disparate sources.13 13 Ibid., 108-109: "Völlig unerwartet enthüllt die massliche Untersuchung des Planes, dass er sich aus heterogenen Teilen zusammensetz. Das aber bedeutet wohl nichts anderes, als dass diese Teilkomplexe aus verschiedenen Quellen stammen und kompiliert worden sind." I am venturing to add to Reinle's three scales as a fourth possibility the conjecture that all of his calculations are wrong. They are advanced not on the basis of a thorough and exhaustive scale analysis of the Plan, but on the simple assumption that certain key dimensions of the Plan—such as the length of the Church or the width of the Cloister Yard—correspond to certain demarcations on a straightedge graduated in Carolingian feet, the precise value of which is unknown. Reinle observed correctly that the 40-foot width of the nave of the Church corresponds to 6.7-6.8 cm.14 14 Ibid., 92-93. This he considers to be the equivalent of one fifth of a Carolingian foot: 33.5-34.0 cm. Here again he allows himself to be trapped in an anachronism. The medieval foot, as will be amply stressed, was not divided into fifths but into twelfths.15 15 See below p. 83. Reinle's reason for believing that the large building to the east of the Church, which contains the Novitiate and the Infirmary, was drawn on a scale different from that used in the layout of the Church is that none of the principal internal parts of the Novitiate and the Infirmary can be understood as a fraction of the Carolingian foot of 34.0 cm.16 16 Op. cit., 106: "Uberraschender weise ergeben sich in keinem der Hauptmasse Teile des Karolingischen Fusses von 34.0 cm." The answer to this is very simple. It cannot—because Reinle's reconstitution of the Carolingian foot used for his construction of the Church is wrong. The same criticism can be extended to the other deviational scale that Reinle believed he recognized in the layout of the guest and service structures of the Plan of St. Gall. Reinle's attempt to question the conceptual homogeneity of the Plan of St. Gall appears no more convincing than those of Reinhardt and Poeschel. It is also no less distressing. Like them it violates, on inadequate grounds, the very spirit of the historical forces that produced the Plan. I.11.2 THE CAROLINGIAN CONCEPT OF CULTURAL UNITY (UNITAS): A COUNTER ARGUMENT Recent studies have made it clear that the scheme for an exemplary monastery that is known to us through the Plan of St. Gall was a statement of policy drawn up on the highest levels of political and ecclesiastical administration and conceived within the framework of a monastic reform movement whose overriding preoccupation was to establish unity (unitas) where life had been controlled by disparate traditions (diversitas), to put "a single rule" (una regula, una consuetudo) in the place of the mixed tradition (regula mixta).17 17 On this particular point see Semmler, 1963, 76 and above, pp. 20ff. It is an historical incongruity to propose that a document conceived in this spirit would have been patched together from fragments drawn in disparate scales, thus perpetuating in its technical execution the very disorder that it strove to overcome on a conceptual level. The two synods of Aachen did not deal specifically with the needs for uniformity of scale and measures. Yet chronologically, the Carolingian battle for standardized weights and measures even antedates the monastic reform. The capitularies of Charlemagne abound with directives promulgated for the purpose of establishing unity where diversity prevailed. In his Admonitio generalis, issued on March 23, 789, the emperor rules "that everybody shall make use of the same and correct measures and of just and equal weights, in the towns as well as in the monasteries, whether selling or buying."18 18 Admonitio generalis, March 23, 789, chap. 74: "Omnibus. Ut aequales mensuras et rectas et pondera iusta et aequalia omnes habeant, sive in civitatibus sive in monasteriis, sive ad dandum in illis sive ad accipiendum, sicut et in lege Domini praeceptum habemus, item in Salamone, Domino dicente: `pondus et pondus, mensuram et mensuram odit anima mea' " (Mon. Germ. Hist., Leg. II, Capit., 2, ed. Boretius, 1883, 60). The capitulary of Frankfurt, issued in June 794, speaks of a "recently established royal modius" (modium publicum et noviter statutum);19 19 Synodus Franconofurtensis, 794, chap. 4; ibid., 74. and from the celebrated book of instructions to the managers of royal estates, the Capitulare de villis, we learn that standard molds for such measures of capacity were kept in the royal palace.20 20 Capitulare de villis, chap. 9, ed. Gareis, 1895, 30: "Volumus ut unusquisque iudex in suo ministerio mensuram modiorum, sextariorum—et situlas per sextaria octo—et corborum eo tenore habeant sicut et in palatio habemus." The date of the Capitulare de villis is controversial. For recent discussions, see the literature quoted in Ganshof, 1958, 162. Again in 802 Charlemagne entreats his missi to see to it that "just and uniform measures" be employed throughout the empire.21 21 Capitulare missorum speciale, 802, chap. 44: "Ut aequales mensuras et rectas et pondera iusta et aequalia omnes habeant" (ibid., 104). The date 802 is not certain. It was in the pursuit of the same drive toward uniform standards that the emperor dispatched special messengers to Monte Cassino for the purpose of finding the precise weight of the pound of bread (libra panis) and the measure of wine (hemina) that St. Benedict had assigned to the monks as their daily allowance.22 22 On the daily measure of wine, cf. below p. 277 and 296ff; on the daily measure of bread, II, 255. The insistence with which the capitularies reiterate the need for uniformity of weights and measures bears witness to Charlemagne's profound preoccupation with binding rules in such matters. Directives to maintain established standards and severe warnings against their adulteration were reissued by Charlemagne in 80623 23 Capitulare missorum Niumagae datum, 806, chap. 18; ed. Boretius, op. cit., 132. and 813,24 24 Capitulare canonibus excerpta, 813, chap. 13: "Ut pondera vel mensura ubique aequalia sint et iusta" (ibid., 174). and by Louis the Pious in 820,25 25 Episcoporum ad Hludovicum Imperatorem relatio, c. 820, chap. 7: "Ut aequales mensurae et iuste in omnibus provinciis imperii vestri sint secundum legem Domini iubentis: `Sit tibi aequas modius iustusque sextarius.' Quapropter diversitatem mensurarum in multis pauperes valde gravantur" (ibid., 367). 829,26 26 Episcoporum a Hludowicum Imperatorem relatio, 829: "De mensurarum namque inaequalitate et modiis iniustis et sestariis, quae Domini lege haberi prohibentur, qualiter res ad certam correctionem perduci possit, non satis perspicue nobis patet, eo quod in diversis provinciis diversae ab omnibus pene habeantur; hoc tamen modis omnibus optamus et admonemus, ut saltem nullus duplices mensuras in sua dominatione aut habeat aut haberi permittat: quoniam hac occasione multos pauperes adfligi in plerisque locis cognovimus" (Mon. Germ. Hist., Leg. II, Capit. 2, ed. Boretius and Krause, 1897, 44). 844,27 27 Capitulare septimanicum apud Tolosam datum, 844, chap. 2: "Ut unum modium frumenti et unum modium ordei atque unum modium vini cum mensura, quae publica et probata ac generalis seu legitima per civitatem et pagum atque vicinitatem habetur, episcopi a persbiteris accipiant, et frischingam sex valentem denarios aut sex pro ea denarios et non amplius exigant; et si haec non accipiant, accipiant, si v volunt, pro his omnibus duos solidos in denariis, sicut in Toletano or Bracharense consensu episcopi considerasse dicuntur" (ibid., 256). and 847.28 28 Additamenta ad capitularia Regum Franciae Orientalis, 847; ibid., 179. It is true that practically all of the measures specifically mentioned in these ordinances are measures of weight and capacity: the "peck" (modius), the "sixteenth part of a peck" (sextarius), the "bucket" (situla), and the "basket" (corbus).29 29 On the respective values of these capacity measures and their equivalents in liters, see below, p. 298; on Abbot Adalhard's reference to a newly established modius, see Appendix II, Vol. III. These measures were essential for the barter and trade, which formed the basis for the entire Carolingian economy. They would be the first to be singled out, if a general principle would have to be illustrated by specific examples. But it would be absurd to presume that measures of length were not an implicit part of these directives. The drive for uniformity was programmatic and universal. It pervaded the whole of the political, administrative, economic, and spiritual life of the Carolingian era, both under Charlemagne and Louis the Pious.30 30 On this point see Semmler, 1960, 309-88. On the highest level the aim was the "unity of the empire." A precondition of the unitas regni was the "unity of the church." The unitas ecclesiae, in turn, depended on uniform standards of conduct (una consuetudo) both for the secular clergy and for the monks. A blueprint for this unity (forma unitatis)31 31 The term forma unitatis appears in a passage of the life of St. Benedict of Aniane, the prime mover of the monastic reform movement under Louis the Pious, which describes his accomplishments as follows: "Cunctaque monasteria ita ad formam unitatis redacta sunt, acsi ab uno magistro et in uno imbuerentur loco. Uniformis mensura in potu, in cibo, in vigiliis, in modulationibus observanda est tradita" (Vita Benedicti abbatis Anianensis, ed. Waitz, Mon. Germ. Hist., Script., XV, 1887, 251ff). were the directives for canons and canonesses which were framed in the synod of 816 and the rules controlling monastic life which were issued at this same council and at the synod of 817.32 32 The most recent edition of the legislation of the two synods at Aachen, A.D. 816 and 817, is that of Joseph Semmler, "Legislatio Aquisgranensis," in Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 433-582. The importance of these events for the whole of the state was underscored not only by the fact that these directives emerged from assemblies that were held in the royal palace of Aachen33 33 In that part of the royal palace which was designated by the name ad Lateranis. For more details on this, see Semmler, 1963. but also that they were subsequently promulgated by the emperor himself in the form of official capitularies and thus acquired the character of public laws.34 34 On this point, cf. ibid., 65. Surely enough, no truly binding unity might ever have been attained in all of these segments of life and on all levels. But to propose—as Reinle's theory of the multiplicity of scales in the Plan of St. Gall implies—that a blatant violation of these concepts of unity would have been perpetrated in a document of paradigmatic significance, drawn up in the palace itself under the eyes of the country's leading bishops and abbots, appears to me to be an incongruous historical assumption. It is an incongruous assumption even on simple visual grounds. In his reliance on precision instruments and modern slide rules Reinle has neglected a powerful tool of visual analysis: the human eye. For to the naked eye the consummate conceptual and technical homogeneity of the Plan reveals itself with infinitely greater strength than could be disclosed by any mechanical devices. The order in which the buildings are arranged is immaculate throughout the entire width and length of the Plan. Since the Plan is traced without the aid of a straightedge or the benefit of a compass, it is full of minor irregularities. Yet despite these shortcomings—inevitable in a freehand tracing, and especially one of such bulky dimensions—one cannot fail to observe that each building was developed within the boundaries of a superordinate building site in careful alignment with its companion structures, and that the aggregate of these larger building sites of the Plan form a mosaic of perfect order and rationality. This order is tight and consistent. It does not show, at any place, the kind of break or formal incompatibility that one associates with an architectural composition pieced together from heterogeneous parts. I. 12 METHOD OF RENDERING I.12.1 USE OF DIFFERENT COLORS FOR DRAWING AND EXPLANATORY TITLES All linear work on the Plan is rendered in a clear vermilion ink which has retained its original intensity. The lines are traced without the aid of instruments, in firm and fluent strokes suggesting that the draftsman had experience with this type of drawing. The textual annotations are written in a deep-brown ink, bordering on black. In the crossing, transept, and forechoir of the Church, brown ink is also used to thicken the architectural line (fig. 99), obviously with the intent of clarifying the basic spatial divisions of the Church, which are somewhat blurred in this area by the heavy concentration of stairs, altars, benches, and choir screens.1 1 See below, p. 137. Not available to me when these lines were written was an article by Gerhard Noth, published in 1969, where it is suggested that this thickening of certain lines in transept and presbytery occurred "just before and in connection with the reconstruction of the church of St. Gall by Abbot Gozbert." This is possible, even probable. Yet one cannot exclude the alternative that this might have been done already in the scriptorium of the abbey of Reichenau (after the Plan was finished, but before it was transmitted to Abbot Gozbert) as a last clarifying measure, undertaken by the corrector, perhaps upon the suggestion of Bishop Haito, in response to the desire to identify more clearly the outlines of the basic building masses of nave and transept (cf. below, p. 137). I am utterly unconvinced of Noth's conjecture that the thickened lines were meant to convey the idea that the transept was internally divided into three virtually separate compartments by strongly protruding wall spurs. It is much more reasonable to assume that these lines were added to emphasize the fact that the nave intersected the transept in its full height and width, and to preclude a confusion between the boundaries of these two primary spaces with lines that designate such secondary appurtenances as choir screens, steps and benches of which there is a heavy concentration in these parts of the church. On Noth's reluctance to admit the concept of a disengaged crossing for the Church of the Plan of St. Gall, see the arguments offered below, pp. 92ff. It is impossible to say whether this was done at the time the Plan was copied, or at a later stage, preparatory to its use in actual construction. The Plan of St. Gall is not the only Carolingian manuscript where a vermilion red is used for the delineation of buildings. The Zentralbibliothek in Zurich has among its holdings an early ninth-century copy of Adamnan's book De locis sanctis,2 2 For Cod. Rhenaug. LXXIII, see Katalog der Handschriften der Zentralbibliothek Zürich, III, 1936, 190-91. Adamnan, abbot of Iona from 679 to 704, based his book De locis sanctis (presented to King Aldfrid the Wise of Northumbria in 701) on the travel account of Arculf, a Frankish bishop and pilgrim, who visited the Holy Land about 680 and on his return to Gaul was driven by adverse winds to Britain where he took refuge in the monastery of Iona. See S. Adamnani . . . de locis sanctis, ed. Migne, Patr. Lat., LXXXVIII, 1844, cols. 779-815, and the annotated English translation published by Macpherson in 1899. For excerpts see Schlosser, 1896, 50-59; and Preisendanz, 1927, 20ff. For better and more recent editions and translations (brought to my attention by Charles W. Jones) see James F. Kenny, Sources, I, 1929, 285-88. written in the scriptorium of the monastery 41. PLAN OF THE HOLY SEPULCHER, CHURCH OF JERUSALEM ZURICH, Zentralbibliothek. Codex Rhenaugensis LXXIII, fol. 5r* * Figures 41, 42, 43, 44 reproduced at same size as the original. [courtesy of the Zentralbibliothek, Zurich] This plan, as well as the plans shown in the three subsequent figures, were drawn by Walahfrid (d. 849), who copied them from drawings displayed in Adamnan's De locis sanctis. Adamnan, abbot of the monastery of Iona from 679-708, in turn derived his knowledge about the layout of these buildings from the verbal account of the Frankish bishop Arculf who visited the Holy Land around 680, and from drawings engraved into wax tablets by Arculf for Adamnan's benefit. 42. THE CHURCH OF MOUNT SION ZURICH, Zentralbibliothek Codex Rhenaugensis LXXIII, fol. 9v [courtesy of the Zentralbibliothek, Zurich] of Reichenau (Cod. Rhenaug. LXXIII), which displays the plans of a group of Early Christian pilgrimage churches of the Holy Land drawn, it seems, by the hand of Walahfrid Strabo,3 3 Preisendanz, loc. cit. viz., on fol. 5r, the Holy Sepulcher Church of Jerusalem (fig. 41); on fol. 9v, the Church of Mount Sion (fig. 42); on fol. 12r, the Ascension Church on Mount Olive (fig. 43); and on fol. 18v, the cruciform church of Samaria (fig. 44). As on the Plan of St. Gall, so here, the architectural plans are drawn in red, while the explanatory titles are written in black. This suggests that red might have been the preferred color for architectural drawings in the early Middle Ages. I.12.2 COMBINATION OF VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL PROJECTION All buildings and installations shown on the Plan are rendered in vertical line projection. In certain instances, however, to this projection is added a straight-on view, showing the elevation of a wall as though it were lying flat on the ground. Examples of this are: the arcaded walls of the cloister walks (Monks' Cloister [fig. 191], Novitiate and Infirmary [fig. 236]), the arcuated porches of the Abbot's House (fig. 251), and details such as the crosses on the altars of the Church (fig. 251), or the monumental cross in the graveyard (fig. 430). In tracing these elements the architect made use of the mason's age-old habit of sketching architectural elevations on the ground when explaining the design of a building to an apprentice or a client. The method was even more familiar to carpenters, who not only laid out but actually cut, assembled, and jointed many of their roof-supporting trusses on the ground before raising them into the vertical plane with pulley and ropes. The designer of the scheme of the Plan employed this device with discretion—only in places that offered sufficient space to use it without obstructing other architectural features or blurring the general clarity of the Plan. In this manner he succeeded in conveying to the builder, in unmistakable language, not only the design but also the exact proportions of the great galleried porches that surrounded the cloister yards and served as connecting links between the claustral buildings. The combination of vertical and horizontal projection in one and the same architectural drawing or plan probably is a principle as old as architecture itself and common to all periods. It was firmly established in Egyptian art and was there refined to a point where it depicted not only the planimetrical layout of the buildings with which it was concerned, but also the human events that took place in these settings. This led to compositions of great complexity, in which features drawn in elevation (favored because of their ability to tell a story more fully and more conspicuously) tended to overcrowd and blur the plan.4 4 With regard to Egyptian architectural drawings, see H. Schäfer, 1963, 136-42. The house shown in figure 45.A-B is a simple and easily readable example of this tradition. Others are not so susceptible to easy interpretation.5 5 Cf. Borchard, 1896, and 1907-8. It is not so widely known that an admixture of vertical and horizontal projection is also found in Roman architectural drawings, although there it is not used with comparable 43.

Zentralbibliothek. Codex Rhenaugensis LXXIII, fol. 18v [courtesy of the Zentralbibliothek, Zurich] profusion. This can be inferred from the famous Forma urbis, the now-fragmentary plan of Rome that was incised in marble during the reign of Emperor Septimius Severus, between A.D. 205 and 208.6 6 For the most recent edition, see Carettoni, Colini, Cozza, and Gatti, 1960. Generally rendered in vertical projection (typical examples are shown in fig. 46), this plan shows arcuated elements incised in elevation in at least three different places, each time in connection with the representation of an aqueduct (fig. 47.A-C).7 7 The aqueducts rendered in elevation occur on fragments 215, 223, and 612. Carettoni et al., op. cit., II, plates 41, 42, 56, respectively; discussion, ibid., I, 206. As on the Plan of St. Gall this delineation of arch forms occurs only in relatively uncluttered areas of the Forma urbis; in more crowded sections a more compact symbol of piers, or bars connected by two curved lines, is used (fig. 47.D-F) for aqueducts as well as other types of arches. I.12.3 LACK OF DEFINITION OF WALL THICKNESS The walls of the buildings of the Plan of St. Gall are rendered as simple lines. This fact has given rise to two widely held assertions of questionable validity. One of these, voiced as early as 18488 8 Willis, 1848, 89: "The walls of the buildings, the furniture, and every detail, are alike made out by thin single red lines, without regard to the proportional thickness of the different objects." and frequently reiterated, is that the designing architect failed to give any consideration to wall thickness. The other, more recently advanced, is that any preoccupation with wall thickness would have been intrinsically incompatible with the ideal character of the Plan.9 9 Poeschel, 1957, 28; 1961, 14; and in Studien, 1962, 28: "Die Welt in der es Mauerstärken gibt ist eine andere, realere, als jene des Kloster-planes, der ein Idealschema darstellt." As far as the first of these two contentions is concerned, attention must be drawn to the fact (generally overlooked in previous discussions of this point) that there are two significant exceptions: the bases of the columns in the nave of the church and the foundations of the arcade piers in the western paradise are rendered as squares, in their full planimetrical extension. Second, although the draftsman drew his walls in simple lines, there is clear indication that he was fully aware of the complications that might arise in the actual erection of buildings drawn in linear projection in such areas of the site where the masonry in two adjacent structures would congest the available building space, unless special provisions were made to forestall that eventuality. The fact that the aisles of the Church are 22½ feet wide and not 20 feet, as their titles prescribe, finds its explanation, as will be shown later on, in the draftsman's awareness of this danger.10 10 See below, pp. 97ff. Yet even here he does not go so far as to draw the walls with two parallel lines, but guards himself against cluttering his plan with unnecessary details by simply moving his wall lines farther outward and thus introducing a safety margin of 2½ feet on either side of the Church. His decision to render the walls of the buildings by single rather than double lines has little to do with the ideal or paradigmatic nature of his subject, but is clearly conditioned by the small scale of the Plan. Even today, as Konrad Hecht has pointed out correctly, an architect faced with the design of a project of similar complexity, drawn at a comparable scale, would invariably choose the same method.11 11 Hecht, 1965, 199. It was for this very reason that the architects who designed the monumental marble plan of the city of Rome chose EGYPTIAN WALL RELIEF 45.A 45.B FROM A TOMB, VICINITY OF Schech Abd el Gurna [after Borchard, 1907-1908, 59, figs. 1 and 2] A. Tracing of relief. The dotted lines give the location of explanatory titles. B. The plan of the house as it would be rendered in a modern architectural drawing. The stage of the scene is a rectangular house, the plan of which is traced in vertical-line projection, while the roof-supporting columns are rendered in section by a symbol formed by two concentric circles. The doors are shown in elevation, some horizontally, others vertically, whatever the available space suggested as the more advantageous solution. The figures are shown in elevation in the customary Egyptian manner. 46.A.B.C. FORMA URBIS ROMAE ROME, ANTIQUARIUM COMMUNALE DEL CELIO [after Carettoni, Colini, Cozza, and Gatti, Rome, 1960] These fragments are of a plan of the city of Rome, etched in marble during the reign of Emperor Septimius Severus, between A.D. 205 and 208. This plan, incised on numerous marble slabs, was installed near the Forum of Peace, on the wall of a building which before the fire of 192 served as municipal archives. A probable outgrowth of the emperor's fiscal reform, the plan may have served as a monumental compilation and permanent record of numerous archival and boundary maps. Mounted on a base 4 meters high, the plan itself covered a surface about 42½ feet (13m) by about 59 feet (18m), an impressive area of ca. 2,500 square feet (234 sq. m). It was drawn at a scale of 1:240, occasionally varying to 1:245. The walls of the overwhelming majority of buildings are drawn in single-line projection. A typical example of this method is shown in A, a marble fragment showing the plan of the Horrea Lolliana and adjacent structures (fragment 25; Carettoni, pl. XXV). Exceptions to the rule are found in the rendering of the plans of temples, where the cellar walls are indicated by parallel lines, as is shown in fragments 31bb and 37a, delineating the temples of Argentina and Juno (IBID., pls. XXIX and XXXII, respectively). single-line definition as their standard mode for rendering walls.12 12 The Plan of St. Gall, as will be shown later on, was drawn at a scale of 1:192 (see below, pp. 83ff). The Forma urbis Romae was drawn at a scale of 1:240, varying occasionally to 1:245. See Carettoni et al., op. cit., I, 1955, 210. When the Romans were faced with the task of drawing the plan of an individual building, at a larger scale, they defined the walls in thickness by two parallel lines, as was done on the marble slab of Claudia Octavia, now in the Museum of Perugia (fig. 48), and on a number of other Roman fragments displaying house plans.13 13 For the marble slab of Claudia Octavia see Hülsen, 1890; and Carettoni et al., op. cit., 210; and Arens, 1938, 19. This mode of rendering is of great antiquity and we can safely assume that it was used at all times in all civilizations. It existed in Egypt at the side of the more pictorial representations of the type exemplified by figure 45.A, as is clearly displayed by the detail of a house plan of the New Kingdom shown in figure 49. Indeed the most accomplished plans of this kind, as Ludwig Borchard has pointed out, were probably those which Egyptian architects chiseled in full size into the pavement of sacred sites, to be used as guidelines for the masons who built the walls of the temples that rose in these places.14 14 Borchard, 1896, 72 and 123. Cf. Schäfer, 1963, 136. The designers of the Forma urbis were not entirely consistent in their use of the single line, but interspersed it with a small number of buildings where walls are defined by parallel lines. This was done, it seems without exception, in the rendering of temples (here exemplified in figures 46.B-C)15 15 A full account of these will be found in Carettoni, op. cit., 207ff. and it looks very much as though this departure from the regular method may have been motivated by the desire to throw into visual prominence buildings of a strictly religious nature. The designer of the Plan of St. Gall could have introduced a similar variation—the church plans in the Cod. Rhenaug. LXXIII (figs. 41-44) show clearly enough that the definition of wall thickness by means of parallel lines is fully within the range of working patterns of a Carolingian architect. If he chose to stay away from this type of rendering, he did so predominantly for stylistic reasons, viz., the desire for homogeneity of design and, above all, an unwillingness to clutter up his plan with parallel lines that could be confused with benches, or run parallel to benches, as they would have done practically everywhere along the walls of the Church. I.12.4 DIFFERENTIATION OF LEVELS IN DOUBLE-STORIED STRUCTURES Whether a building on the Plan is a single- or a double-storied structure cannot be inferred from its linear layout. Structures of several stories are designated as such by their explanatory titles. One must infer from this that other buildings, which are without such explanations, are one-storied. The multi-level buildings are: the Dormitory (fig. 208), the Refectory (fig. 211), and the Cellar (fig. 225), the Abbot's House (fig. 251), the choir and crypt of the Church, the Sacristy and the Vestry, the Scriptorium and the Library (fig. 99). In projecting the design of these buildings onto his parchment, the draftsman is not consistent, but switches from the rendering of the ground floor to that of the second story, whichever is of greater interest to him. Thus, he depicts the layout of the Refectory with its tables and benches in full detail and merely indicates with the inscription supra uestiarium that the Refectory is surmounted by an upper level serving as storage for the monks' clothing (fig. 211). In the case of the Dormitory (fig. 208) he follows the opposite procedure. He depicts the layout of the upper story with the beds of the monks and explains with the inscription subtus calefactoria dom' that the building has a lower level, which is occupied by the warming room of the monks. Conversely, in the case of the Cellar (fig. 225), he dwells with loving care on the two impressive rows of wine and beer barrels set up on the ground floor, and suggests by the legend supra lardari?. &amp;' necessarior? repositio that the Cellar is surmounted by the Larder. In only one case, namely that of the choir and the crypt, are elements of two levels combined on the same surface. The area is of crucial importance from a liturgical point of view, and the draftsman uses this device to make absolutely sure that it is clearly understood in what manner the pilgrims are given access to the tomb of St. Gall. The designers of the Forma urbis Romae also seem to have felt free to switch from the predominantly ground-floor layout method to an ideographic rendering of the superstructure, when this was a more interesting and significant aspect. Buildings such as the Colosseum (fig. 50.A) or the Theater of Marcellus (fig. 51.A) are rendered in bird's-eye view, or in a combination of bird's-eye view and planimetrical projection. Thus in the Colosseum a sequence of elliptical lines defines the four major sections of the theater, corresponding to the podium and the three maenia for the spectators, suggesting rows, yet not specifically representing them in their actual number.16 16 Carettoni, op. cit., 296, Colosseum; op. cit. 188, Theater of Marcellus. In the representation of the Theater of Marcellus (fig. 51), in addition to the semicircular tiers of seats and the passage ways (praecinctiones) by which these are separated, there is a complex system of fan-shaped passages that intersect the seats radially. Some of these represent the ascending stairs in the superstructure that connect the three tiers (cavea) of seats (and would have been visible to anyone seated in the theater); others show the hidden ramps (cryptae) in the substructure (not visible from above) that give access to the upper deck through openings (called vomitoria, because they "spit out" the masses of spectators into the galleries). This is an ideogrammatic contraction on one and the same plane of elements belonging to different levels and not visible simultaneously from the same point of inspection. A comparison of the portrayal of these two buildings on the 47.A,B,C,D,E,F FORMA URBIS ROMAE, FRAGMENTS ROME, ANTIQUARIUM COMMUNALE DEL CELIO [after Carettoni et al., 1960, vol. II] A. Fragment 517.

Aqueduct with arches shown in vertical projection by curved lines connecting with crossbars (IBID., pl. L). * position of fragment not identified Forma urbis with modern architectural drawings of the same subjects (figs. 50.B and 51.B) shows in the rendering of these details how little they conform to a consistent scale or to dimensional accuracy—and how difficult it is (especially in the case of the Marcellus Theater) to determine what belongs to the upper deck and what to the supporting structure. To render the relationship of all these elements in accurate planimetrical projection would have necessitated making as many separate plans as there are different stories in each building (or a combination thereof as is done in figs. 50.B and 51.B), which was clearly beyond the scope and function of the Forma urbis. In his rendering of the Colosseum the designing architect confined himself to portraying in a crudely abbreviated form what a spectator would have seen of the elliptical seating arrangement of this amphitheater, had he hovered vertically above it. In his portrayal of the Theater of Marcellus, by contrast, he made an attempt to combine distinctive features of the substructure (not visible from above) with distinctive features of the upper deck (visible from above) without making it clear what belongs to one, what to the other. The conception of the Plan of St. Gall is highly superior in this respect. In his layout of the transept and the presbytery of the Church (fig. 99), where the component parts of several levels are shown in simultaneous projection, the author defines the interrelationships so clearly that the eye finds no trouble in establishing that the presbytery is raised above the level of the transept by seven steps and that the vaulted arms of the ambulatory corridor crypt lie beneath that level. He makes it unequivocally clear that the longitudinal arms of that crypt run along the outer surface of the choir walls and terminate in a transverse arm that gives access to the tomb of St. Gall. He leaves no doubt about the length and width of these arms. With all of this I do not mean to imply that a Roman architect might not have been equally proficient. To place this entire problem into proper historical perspective the reader must here be reminded of the fact that the Forma urbis was not only drawn at a considerably smaller scale (1:240) than the Plan of St. Gall (1:192), but also that it included buildings of exasperating constructional complexity and most important of all, that it was never meant to serve as a building plan to be used in construction; it was more in the nature of a real estate record. Considering its scale and its purpose, it renders with admirable conceptual simplicity the layout of such complex structures as the Colosseum and the Theater of Marcellus.17 17 For modern plans and descriptions of the Theater of Marcellus see Calza-Bini, 1953, 1-43; Bieber, 1961, 184-85 and Ward Perkins in Boethius-Perkins, 1970, 186-88. For the Colosseum see Durm, 1885, 342-45; Colagrossi, 1913; and Ward-Perkins, op. cit., 221-24. A full bibliographical record for each building will be found in Platner, 1929, 513-15 (Marcellus Theater) and 6-11 (Amphiteatrum Flavium). I.12.5 LACK OF SPECIFIC INFORMATION CONCERNING BUILDING MATERIALS The Plan does not give explicit instructions for the materials with which the individual buildings were to be constructed. All installations are rendered in a uniform line, and this line may stand for a masonry wall, a wooden fence, the outlines of a bench or a table, or a seedling bed in the vegetable garden. It is fairly obvious, however, both in view of the peculiarity of their design and the prevailing building customs, that stone construction was envisaged for the nuclear claustral structures: the Church, with its columnar order, its circular towers, and apses; the Cloister, with its round-arched galleries and portals, as well as the monastic buildings directly contingent to the Cloister; the Dormitory, the Refectory, and the Cellar. To these should be added the complex that contains the Novitiate and the Infirmary with its round-arched cloister walks and round-apsed chapels, and, finally, the Abbot's House with its arcuated porches. Whether masonry can be postulated for any of the remaining structures is a controversial question to which special attention will have to be given later in this study.18 18 See II, 83ff. I.12.6 DIFFERENTIAL ATTENTION IN THE RENDERING OF DOORS An interesting case of discrimination between buildings of lesser and greater importance can be observed in the rendering of the doors. Throughout the whole expanse of the Plan the location of a door is designated by two short strokes intersecting the walls at right angles. In buildings of major importance, the wall line stops as it reaches the first crossbar and takes a fresh start in the center of the opposite bar . In buildings that hold a lesser rank in the religious or social hierarchy of the monastery the wall runs through as a continuous line, and the crossbars simply intersect it . This is, of course, a faster way of rendering, which the draftsman first substituted sporadically for the more exacting manner as his hand got tired in the tracing of individual structures, and then consistently as he turned from the primary to the secondary buildings. In the Church (fig. 55), the most important building of the Plan and the first to be traced, there is only one instance of the abbreviated form: one of the passages in the barrier that connects the penultimate freestanding pair of columns, significantly enough, in a place where the line straddles the seam of two connecting sheets of parchment. In the atrium west of the Church there are two more cases: the two openings in the wall that connect with the passages of the two towers. There is none in the Abbot's House (fig. 251), nor the Outer School (fig. 407), and only one in the House for Distinguished Guests (fig. 396), one of the entrances to the stables of the horses. 48. MARBLE SLAB OF CLAUDIA OCTAVIA PERUGIA, MUSEO ARCHEOLOGICO NATIONALE DELL' UMBRIA [courtesy Soprintendenza alle Antich?tà dell' Umbria] The slab displays the plan of a sepulchral monument (large building, right), and the house of its guardian (smaller building, left). The third plan (in center, and at top) shows the basement of the guardian's house. Walls are rendered by two parallel lines; doors are indicated by continuation of the outer line or by interruption or bending of both wall lines. Stairs are indicated varyingly as a sequence of parallel lines or as two converging lines. The dimensions of the room are designated by Roman numerals. Gatti, who analyzed the plans, came to the conclusion that they were drawn in three different scales: that of the sepulchral monument at the scale of 1:84; those of the guardian's house at the scales of 1:140 and 1:230, respectively (see Carettoni ET AL, 1960, I, 210). The incidents increase as the draftsman works himself through the claustral structures, and thereafter the abbreviated method of rendering becomes routine. The first building drawn entirely in this style is the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers (fig. 392). In some of the more important guest and service buildings, such as the Great Collective Workshop (fig. 419), and the House for Horses and Oxen and Their Keepers (fig. 474), the two methods are judiciously combined: the disrupted line for the principal entrances, the undisrupted line for the secondary doors. In the buildings to the east of the Church the continuous line is standard; the disrupted line, the exception. And in all of the buildings that lie to the west of the Church, there is only one occurrence—obviously accidental—of the disrupted line, in the House for Sheep and Shepherds and Their Keepers. I.12.7 THE PLAN IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE The method of rendering used in the Plan of St. Gall is closely related to that displayed in the great marble plan of the city of Rome made under Emperor Septimius Severus, and belongs to the same historical tradition of rendering. Functionally, these two plans have little in common. The Forma urbis delineates an existing condition, the layout of a grown city. The Plan of St. Gall does not define how it is, but how it should be. These differences, however, had little, if any, effect on the manner in which the two plans were rendered. Like the architects who designed the Forma urbis, where wall thicknesses are indicated in a few judiciously selected categories of building, the author of the Plan of St. Gall would have been fully capable of rendering the walls of his buildings in full thickness. Like the former, he chose not to employ this method for the same reason an architect today would use single line projection instead of double line projection for the rendering of walls, namely, the complexity of his subject and the smallness of the scale in which it was drawn. There is good evidence that the Forma urbis was still in place on the walls of SS. Cosmas and Damian in the Carolingian period,19 19 Carettoni, op. cit., 250. and thus could have been seen by the Frankish emperors who visited Rome and the architects who traveled in their following. Moreover, there are more substantive reasons for thinking that the designer of the Plan of St. Gall was familiar with the layout of the city of Rome.20 20 See our discussion below, pp. 204ff, of the historical background of the two semicircular atria of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall and of the classical design of the building complex that contains the Novitiate and the Infirmary. If it was the purpose of the Plan of St. Gall to depict on a single spread of parchment the layout of the buildings and furnishings of a paradigmatic medieval monastery, it would be hard to improve upon the method of rendering that the designer chose in order to accomplish this task. One of the most successful features is the freeness and flexibility of mind with which the designer switches from the rendering of the ground floor to the rendering of an upper level— 49. EGYPTIAN HOUSE PLAN In this plan dating from the New Kingdom, wall thickness is rendered by parallel lines. wherever the complexity of the layout of the upper floor suggested such action—and chooses to explain the nature and function of the repressed story with the aid of an explanatory title. To do it differently would have required supplementary drawings. Even from a purely technical point of view the Plan of St. Gall is a highly sophisticated document. It tells the story of a very complex architectural situation with ingenious simplicity. One of the designer's overriding preoccupations was the retention of clarity in the over-all appearance of the settlement. He was detailed where attention to detail was imperative in the light of function; but he did not hesitate to omit almost entirely such features as stairs where their delineation would have impaired the clarity and easy readability of the primary elements of his drawing. With all its medieval idiosyncraises, the Plan of St. Gall has a surprisingly modern flavor. Its analytical precision and clarity compare favorably with any modern site plan drawn at a comparable scale. The designer did not hesitate to enliven his plan with elevations in a few places, where this method promised to convey his thoughts more fully; but in departing in this manner from his general mode of rendering he proceeded with a deep sense of discrimination and with conspicuous self-restraint. Above all he carefully resisted any temptation to indulge in architectural pictorialism. This quality is strikingly revealed if one compares the Plan of St. Gall with the twelfth-century plan of the Waterworks of Christchurch Monastery at Canterbury (fig. 52) where everything is shown in elevation as in a child's drawing. 50.B FLAVIAN AMPHITHEATRE (COLOSSEUM) PLAN ROME, ANTIQUARIUM COMMUNALE DEL CELIO [after Durm, 1885, 344, fig. 310] This composite plan of the Colosseum shows four different levels. 50.A FORMA URBIS ROMAE ROME, ANTIQUARIUM COMMUNALE DEL CELIO [after Carretoni, 1960, vol. II, pl. XXIX] These fragments show the seating arrangement of the Colosseum as if seen from above. COMMENT: for figure 50.A and FORMA URBIS ROMAE, generally The illustration, using the lower portion of the graphic scale graduated 0-100 metres, scales 186 metres on its major axis. This compares with 187.5 metres (615 feet) commonly given for the length of the Colosseum, a variance of less than 1 percent between present day measurements and the sculptured mural version that records the measurements of engineers at a time when the plan was cut in place in stone. FORMA URBIS ROMAE stands as a remarkable demonstration of the state of the art of drawing, with knowledge not only of measure, but the skill of taking measurements and translating these measurements precisely into a graphic configuration of great accuracy. Far exceeding any practical function, such as a cadastral plan for administrative purposes, must have been its effect on the mind of the beholder. The impact on a viewer of the plan of Rome, incised in stone for all time, spread across a wall 59 feet wide and rising, on its base, to 56 feet, could not but impress even the most sophisticated Roman. For the visitor from beyond the hills of Rome and from lands afar, the effect could not have been less than overwhelming. The conjecture is tempting, that the sculptural mural map may have been seen, if not by the great Carolus himself, by learned men of his court and soldiers of his entourage in the course of their duties in Rome. A record of achievement, symbol of law and order and authority, invincible and eternal, it seemed without doubt, and a fitting inspiration as well, for an emperor and his sometimes loyal and always ambitious followers. The comparative scale, included with the illustration, compares the scale of the sculptured plan above, the line (40 cm), with the actual "on the ground" measure (100 m), below. The ratio, 41.7 cm. to 100 m, is almost 1:240. The ratio between the scale of illustration 50.A and the Colosseum computes at about 1:951.7 (derived from the relation between 19.7 cm = 187.5 m). Thus the illustration is about ¼ the size of the rendering of the plan on the sculptured wall. 1/952/1/240 = 240/952 = 1/3.98 [or ¼] I. 13 OMISSIONS AND OVERSIGHTS I.13.1 INTENT OR INADVERTENCY It would be incongruous to expect that a plan comprising forty buildings and other installations, such as a cemetery and gardens, would be free of omissions or oversights. A few of these do indeed exist, but for absolute errors one looks in vain. The majority of missing features, which might appropriately be termed omissions, appear, however, to have been left out by intent rather than by neglect or inadvertence. Most conspicuous among these are: the lack of consistent attention to stairs and privies; the absence of any suggestion of waterways to operate the monastery's water-driven machinery and to dispose of the monastery's waste; and, perhaps, the absence of a peripheral wall enclosure. I.13.2 STAIRS The traditional assertion that "stairs are omitted altogether" on the Plan1 1 "Nirgends sind die Treppen verzeichnet," Reinhardt, 1952, 23. The same idea is voiced by Leclercq, in Cabrol-Leclercq, VI:2, 1924, col. 92. is incorrect. Where stairs are vital to the liturgical service or are of an extraordinary construction, they are delineated with the greatest care. Two flights of seven steps (septem gradus, similiter) lead from the crossing of the Church to the forechoir (fig. 99). The altars in the transept rise from platforms that are raised by two steps over the pavement of the transept arms (fig. 99). The apse of St. Peter at the western end of the church is raised by one step over the contiguous pavement of the nave (fig. 84); the same condition is found in the two apses of the church of the novices and the sick. Finally, the altars of St. Michael and St. Gabriel at the top of the two circular towers are made accessible by a circular stair, the winding course of which is delineated by meticulously drawn spirals (fig. 84). On the other hand, one observes with some surprise that the large double-storied buildings of the monks, which surround the cloister, contain not the slightest suggestion of stairs. We do not know at which point and by what means the monks entered the Vestiary, above the Refectory (fig. 211), or the Larder, which lies above the Cellar (fig. 225). The structure which houses Dormitory (above) and Warming Room (below) has four exits. One of them, a passage leading to Bathhouse and Laundry, is designated by its title as issuing from the Warming Room. The others may refer either to ground level or upper story—or to doors located one above the other on two levels. The Privy was probably on Dormitory level with cesspool and running water beneath, but might also have been accessible from ground level by stairs connecting Warming Room and Dormitory internally (for suggestions how this might ROME.

These details the designing architect left to the ingenuity of the builder—perhaps to protect the Plan from being overloaded with particulars. It is to policy decisions of this kind, bringing relief to areas that required minute attention to other details, that the Plan owes its extraordinary over-all clarity. I.13.3 DOORS AND WINDOWS The location of all exits and entrances is treated with the greatest care, not only the opening by which each individual structure is made accessible from the outside, but also all the doors giving access, internally, from one room to another. There are altogether some 290 doors shown on the various buildings of the Plan, and only five true oversights that I can find: two doors in the House of the Gardener (fig. 426)2 2 No doors give access to the rooms of the gardener's helpers (cubilia famulorum). and three in the Monks' Bake and Brew House (fig. 462)3 3 There are no doors to give access to the cooling room in the brewery, the room where flour is stored in the bakery, and the room where the dough is laid out in the bakery. are not shown. The architect does not lavish quite the same degree of attention on the designation of gates that give access from court to court through enclosing fences. Here, as in the case of the privies, he appears to discriminate between the higher and lower levels of monastic polity. A gate in the passage that connects the Abbot's House with the Church (fig. 251) permits the Abbot to inspect the buildings lying east of the Church, and at the same time admits the novices and the sick to the Church on the days of the great religious festivals.4 4 During the remaining part of the year the sick and the novices attend service in their own chapels, cf. below, pp. 311ff. A gate in the fence that separates the grounds of the House of the Physicians from those of the House for Bloodletting insures that the physicians have free access to the structures that come within their professional care. Gates in appropriate places of the enclosure of the Outer School (fig. 407) permit the headmaster to communicate with his own quarters (addorsed to the northern aisle of the Church) and allow the students to attend the divine services by passing through the quarters of the visiting monks into the northern transept of the Church. Yet one looks in vain for gates in any of the fences that enclose the various installations of the large service yard in the western tract of the monastery site, with its stables and houses for the emperor's staff. Here, again, I believe we cannot speak of these omissions as oversights. The draftsman was eager to make it clear that these installations should be surrounded by walls or fences, but the builder, as he adapted the elements to the terrain, would have to determine exactly where these enclosures should be made accessible by gates. He used the same discretion in the designation of windows. Arcaded openings are delineated with the greatest care (Monks' Cloister, cloisters in the Infirmary and the Novitiate, porches in the Abbot's House);5 5 See above, p. 55. and to make unmistakably clear what he had in mind, he switched from vertical to horizontal projection. In all other instances, windows are omitted—with one exception, the Scriptorium (fig. 99), where to neglect the appropriate conditions for lighting would have had disastrous consequences.6 6 See below, p. 147. Openings for ventilation are indicated in the Monks' Privy (fig. 497), again to stress an important functional need. Had windows been shown in such buildings as the Dormitory, the Refectory, and the Cellar, they would have impaired the clarity of the internal layout of these structures. In the majority of the other houses, windows could not even be expected, because these houses belonged to a building type that had no windows, as we shall show later.7 7 See II, 79. I.13.4 FIREPLACES AND LOUVERS The primary device for heating the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall, as will be shown later,8 8 See II, 117ff. is an open hearth (locus foci) located in the exact center of the house; above it in the ridge is a lantern or louver (testu) for the escape of smoke and for light and air. In most of the larger houses these two devices are entered very carefully; but in some they are omitted, most conspicuously so in the workshops of the wheelwrights and coopers, and the workshops of the goldsmiths, blacksmiths, and fullers. Again, I do not think that these are oversights. Rather they stem from the draftsman's desire to avoid endless reiteration of a feature that had been clearly established in all of the truly important houses of the Plan, and could, therefore, be taken for granted, the more so in installations where fire was needed not only for warmth, but also for professional reasons. I.13.5 WATERWAYS The availability of a good water supply was a prime condition for the proper functioning of a monastic settlement. This was expressed in unmistakable terms by St. Benedict9 9 Benedicti regula, chap. 66; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 140-41; ed. McCann, 1952, 152-53; ed. Steidle, 1952, 320-21. and can be inferred from countless later accounts of the selection of suitable sites for new monastic settlements. Most monasteries were built in the immediate vicinity of a stream. When, toward the middle of the sixth century, Cassiodorus the Senator founded the monastery of Vivarium near his ancestral home of Scyllacium, in Calabria, Italy, he established it on the river Pellena, deflected its flow so that it brought drink to the brothers, serviced the monastery's garden and mills, and filled the ponds (vivaria) for the stocking and breeding of fish.10 10 Cassiodori Senatoris Institutiones, I, ch. xxix, ed. Mynors, 1937, 73-75, and translation by Leslie Webber Jones, 1946, 131. In like manner, during the reign of King Pepin (751-768), when Count Wilbertus and Countess Ada searched for an appropriate site for the new monastery of Lièssies, they gave primary consideration to the availability of "water for the running of the mill, the serving of the bakery, kitchen, garden, and the other monastic workshops."11 11 Vita sanctae Hiltrudis (d. 790), chap. 2; see Schlosser, 1896, 226, No. 705. Even the hermits were dependent on a good supply of water. St. Gall, in 612, established himself with full deliberation at the side of a pool which nature had carved beneath a waterfall of the river Steinach, in Switzerland, and which he had found to abound in fish. And a century later when this cell of the Irish missionary was converted into a cenobitic monastery by Abbot Otmar (719-759) it was—again deliberately— erected at the side of this stream.12 12 Vitae Galli auctore Walahfrido, Book I, ch. 11 and Book II, ch. 10; see Vita Galli confessoris triplex, ed. Krusch, 1902, 292 and 319; and Sankt Otmar, ed. Duft, 1959, 24-25. Elaborate waterworks are known to have been installed by Sturmi (744-799) in the monastery of Fulda to provide the brothers with drinking water and to create the required slope for the sluices which carried the water to the mills.13 13 Catalogus abb. Fuldensium, see Schlosser, 1896, 121, No. 386. For more information on monastic water power see the chapter on "Facilities for Milling, Crushing and Drying of Grain," II, 225ff. In general the water required for the sustenance of the community and the operation of its water-driven works was diverted from this stream at the upper side of the monastery, conveyed to the monastic workshops through a carefully constructed system of flues, and then directed back to the bed of the stream at a lower level, carrying with it all of the monastery's waste. In many English abbeys of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, where the buildings themselves have disappeared, the course of the waterways is now completely exposed, and can be studied under ideal conditions.14 14 Especially fine examples are Rievaulx, Fountains, Jervaulx, and Byland. When a stream of running water was not available nearby, the supply had to be brought in from a distant source by means of an aqueduct.15 15 Around 835 Abbot Habertus of Lobbes tried to cut an aqueduct through steep mountain slopes to put it into the service of his mills but failed and was forced to abandon his project. Folcuini gesta abbatis, chap. 12; see Schlosser, 1896, 67, No. 237. Such a system of aqueducts existed at the Canterbury monastery and is depicted on two large sheets of parchment, now inserted (with somewhat trimmed margins) into the famous Canterbury Psalter of the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge.16 16 The Canterbury Psalter, Trinity College Library, Ms. 110, fols. 284b and 285; see M. R. James, 1935, last two plates. Drawn around 1165, probably by Wibert (d. 1167) who engineered the system, these drawings (one of which is shown in fig. 52.A) trace the course of the water from its source in the surrounding countryside through five settling tanks—located in cornfields, vineyards, and orchards—to a circular conduit house; thence, through a passage in the city walls into the precinct of the monastery itself. There is branches out into several separate subterranean systems serving the monastic houses and workshops, and finally it empties into the large sewers from which the waste is carried into the town ditch.17 17 For a more detailed description see Willis, 1868, 158ff. A literary parallel to this depiction of a medieval monastic water system is to be found in Book II of the Vita prima sancti Bernardi, written in 1153 by Arnold of Benneval, who refers to the reconstruction of the monastery of Clairvaux after St. Bernard's return from Rome in 1133 and the construction of its waterworks as follows: With funds abounding, workmen were gathered from outside, and together with them the monks applied themselves to the impending project with utmost zeal. Some cut the timbers, others squared off the stones or constructed the walls, still others divided the river Aube through a system of branching channels and lifted the bubbling waters into the mills. Even the fullers, the bakers, the tanners, the blacksmiths, and all the other craftsmen set themselves to the task of fitting out the contrivances suited to their work, so that the foaming river, diverted into every installation through subterranean channels, may gush forth on its own account and rush to wherever this is desired, until at length all the services peculiar to these offices being rendered and the houses cleansed, the once diverted waters may return to their original bed and restore the river to its proper volume.18 18 The Vita prima sancti Bernardi is in Migne, Patr. Lat. CLXXXV:1, 1879, cols. 225-380 (excerpts in Mortet-Deschamps, II, 1929, 23-27). It consists of five books of composite authorship, written between ca. 1145 and 1155, by men who all had been friends of St. Bernard and were eyewitnesses to the events described in their accounts. For further details, see Williams, 1927, 7ff. The Plan of St. Gall nowhere suggests the existence of any waterways. But it would be incorrect to infer from this that the availability of water and its distribution throughout the various monastic shops and houses was not a factor of first importance in establishing their sites. The majority of the privies are so placed that wastes can be sluiced through straight channels, and the water-driven mills and mortars are located at the monastery's edge, where water of an adjacent stream was apt to be within easy reach. All other shops and houses are placed in such a manner as to tie them without difficulty into a logical and simple water system. Figure 53 shows how easily a well-planned system of waterways could be superimposed upon the Plan of St. Gall. 52.A PLAN OF A WATERWORKS: CANTERBURY, CHRISTCHURCH MONASTERY [by courtesy of the Trustees of Trinity Library, Cambridge] This plan of Christchurch waterworks, together with a supplementary and unfinished plan of the extra-mural parts of the same waterworks, is inserted as a foreign leaf in the famous Canterbury Psalter (Cambridge, Trinity College Library, ms. 110, fols. 284b and 285). The plan dates around 1165 and was probably drawn by Wibert (d. 1167). It is reproduced here slightly reduced from its original size of 11?″ × 16?. For a detailed description and a brilliant analysis of the principles of delineation used in making this extraordinary drawing, see Willis, 1868, 158ff and 176ff. Additional literature is cited in James, 1935, 53. 52.B PLAN OF A WATERWORKS: AN INTERPRETATION CANTERBURY, CHRISTCHURCH MONASTERY [analysis by Willis, 1868, modified by Wysuph, Horn, Born, 1975] 52.C DESCENT BY GRAVITY FROM SUPPLY SOURCE AT A HIGHER LEVEL TO TERMINAL DEBOUCHEMENT The delineation of Christchurch Monastery tells more as pictorial representation, and of architectural appearance, than it reveals of functional building planning: waterways shown are schematic. The document shows a water source on high ground, east of the Monastery, flowing through five (settling?) tanks in cornfields, vineyards, and orchards, through the monastery wall to Laver I (east cloister), thence to Laver II (Great Cloister), thence returning on the east to Laver III. This waterway, with Lavers I, II, III, may be taken as the primary supply system (solid blue line in Plan and Diagram). Three secondary branches (segmented blue line) are designated on Plan and Diagram as 1, 2, 3. Branch 1 leaves the main line between Lavers I and II, flows southward to a cemetery fountain, then on to debouche in the Piscina. Branch 2 flows northward from Laver II to a point south of the Brewery where it turns abruptly eastward to serve the monk's bathhouse, then flows southward to a tank or catchbasin (M) on the drainage line (solid red line). Branch 3, departing where Branch 2 flows eastward, serves the Brewery. A short eastward leg serves the Bakery, a short westward leg, the Abbot's House. From Laver III, at the end of a short extension eastward, the primary line terminates, draining into the Piscina (blue dotted line). In addition to the potable supply system a scheme of drainage (red), more or less polluted, is discernible. Originating in the Great Cloister, it descends southward and terminates beyond the walls on the north. The interpretation (figs. 52.B, 52.C) assumes that the drainage line (red), descending in a short arc from Vestiarium to abut the roof line on the infirmary complex, continues directly northward through or under the structure to join the drainage system (from Piscina and tank M) at or near the Infirmary toilets; thus, non-potable water never comes in contact with the Piscina. I.13.6 PERIPHERAL ENCLOSURE WALL Whether built of wood or stone, or simply in the form of a hedge, the outer monastery wall is an intrinsic expression of the concept of monastic seclusion. In 320, when St. Pachomius founded the earliest Christian coenobium in Tabennessi near Dendera in the Upper Nile Valley, he surrounded it with a wall,19 19 This can be inferred from the Rules of St. Pachomius, the earliest version a translation from Greek into Latin by St. Jerome in 404; see Boon, 1932. The monastery wall is mentioned in chap. 84 (ibid., 38), the gate in chaps. 1, 49, 51, and 53 (ibid., 13, 25, 26, 28). perhaps not so much for defensive purposes as for insulating the monastic enclosure from the noise and impurities of the secular world. The wall became the symbol of monkish self-determination and collective integrity.20 20 Cf. Sowers, 1951, 56. Medieval texts distinguish time and again between that which is "within" (infra, intrinsecus) or "without" (extra, extrinsecus, foris, subtus, juxta), which presupposes a separating enclosure.21 21 Cf. Lesne, VI, 1943, 48. I cite as a typical example Bishop Haito's interesting comment on a directive issued during the first synod of Aachen: "Instruendi sunt fullones, sartores, sutores non forinsecus sicut actenus, sed intrinsecus, qui ista fratribus necessitatem habentibus faciant. Statuta Murbacensia" (chap. 5; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 444. Cf. Horn in Studien, 1962, 120-21). In Irish and Anglo-Saxon monasteries this enclosure often consisted of earthen ramparts with a moat or ditch in front and a wooden palisade above,22 22 A "fosse with palisade" is mentioned in the Rule of St. Columba (aut extra vallum, id est extra septum monasterii); see Migne, Patr. Lat., LXXX, col. 219. The term "septum" also appears in the Life of St. Columba; see Adamnan's Life of Columba, ed. Anderson, 1961, 218; see Sowers, 1951, 196. or even more simply, just a hedge of thorn (sepes magna spinea, quae totum monasterium circumcingebat), as at the monastery of Oundle, a foundation of Wilfrid.23 23 Life of Wilfrid by Eddius Stephanus, ed. Colgrave, 1927, 192. A wooden palisade enclosure existed at the monastery of Lobbes as late as the twelfth century,24 24 Gesta abbatum Lobbensium, chap. 23; ed. Arndt, Mon. Germ. Hist., Script., XXI, 1869, 326: "Ambitum quoque monasterii idem abbas ad id tempus sepe lignea ex parte clausum cinxit." That other parts were masonry can be inferred from a later passage: "Domum etiam hospitum . . . infra muri ambitum a parte australi aedificiare quidem cepit" (ibid., 327). A wall entirely of wood was built at St.-Denis by Fulradus, contemporary of Charlemagne; see Schlosser, 1896, 213, No. 662. but from the end of the eighth century, monastery walls were with increasing frequency built of stone;25 25 A typical example is the masonry wall Angilbert built around St.Riquier; see Hariulf, Chronique de l'abbaye de Saint-Riquier, II, chap. 8; ed. Lot, 1894, 61: "Deo delectentur deservire, ipso adjuvante, muro curavimus firmiter undique ambire." (Cf. n.9, p. 347 below.) and from the end of the ninth century, many of these walls assume a distinctly defensive function (murus in modum castri).26 26 Lesne (VI, 1943, 49) notes that when Jean de Gorze rebuilt the wall in the tenth century, he made it like that of a fortress, able to withstand seige: "Primum claustram muro in modum castri undique circum sepsit quod hodieque non modum munitiones, set et se opus sit oppugnationi adesse perspicitur" (see Vita Johannis Gorziensis, chap. 90; ed. Pertz, Mon. Germ. Hist., Script., IV, 1841, 362). In view of these facts, the absence of a peripheral wall enclosure on the Plan of St. Gall presents a puzzle. Was it a feature so self-evident to the inventor of the scheme that he did not bother to include it? Ot should we presume that it existed on the original, but was omitted in the copy? There are two reasons why I believe that it existed on the original. First, the fences that separate the grounds of the houses to the north and the south of the Church were useless unless they connected with a peripheral wall enclosure.27 27 See below, pp. 91ff. Second, our analysis of the scale and construction methods used in the Plan will show that the location of the axis of the Church as well as the major site divisions of the monastery are related to a system of framing lines (fig. 62), which on the original would only have meaning if they defined an outer wall enclosure.28 28 Ibid. The copyist might have dropped this feature for various reasons: for one, simply because his sheet of parchment was not large enough to include it; for another, because a rectangular wall perimeter may have been meaningless on the reconstruction of the monastery of St. Gall for which the copy was to be used. The monastery of St. Gall was wedged into an irregular area shaped by the capricious course of the Steinach, whose steep embankments may have served as an acceptable substitute for masonry walls for a considerable stretch along the southern and eastern boundaries of the monastery site. No such natural defenses existed to the west and to the north, where the terrain is flat. Yet even here there must have been a clear demarkation, either architectural or topographical, between the grounds of the monastery and the grounds of the secular settlement that had begun to rise around it. There is documentary evidence for the existence, in Carolingian times, of a protective perimeter of masonry walls. When the monastery was attacked by the Magyars in 926 the monks found themselves compelled to throw up a temporary system of heavy defense (castellum fortissimum) on the spur of a nearby mountain.29 29 Ekkeharti (IV.) Casus sancti Galli, chap. 51; ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 193-98; ed. Helbling, 1958, 104-5. See Duft, 1957, 43-47. This has been interpreted to mean that the monastery was not sufficiently fortified to block their advance.30 30 Stephani, II, 1903, 86. It was doubtlessly in response to this alarming event that Abbot Arno, in 953-954, decided to construct a masonry wall with thirteen towers (muros . . . cum turris tredecim) that encompassed not only the monastery, but with it the entire city (urbs) of St. Gall.31 31 Ekkeharti (IV.) Casus sancti Galli, chaps. 71 and 136; ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 250-54 and 431-34; ed. Helbling, 1958, 131-32 and 226-27. See Duft, 1952, 24-34; Duft, 1957, 48-52. I.13.7 PRIVIES With regard to privies either the designer of the original scheme or the copyist was guilty of an oversight. The apartment of the master of the Infirmary and the adjacent room for those who are critically ill (fig. 236) lack this facility. It is obvious that privies of the same design as those provided for the master of the novices and for the sick room of the novices were needed in the Monks' Infirmary in the portion that corresponds exactly to the Novitiate. In all other cases where privies are missing, I believe they are left out intentionally.32 32 Privies are absent from houses of the gardener, fowlkeeper, workmen, Hospice of Pilgrims and Paupers, and all houses for animals and keepers in the service yard west of the Church, as well as in the house for the emperor's entourage, also located in that tract. More will be said about this in the chapter on monastic sanitation.33 33 See II, p. 300ff. I.13.8 KITCHEN FOR SERFS AND WORKMEN The ensemble of buildings shown on the Plan of St. Gall includes no fewer than six kitchens: the Monks' Kitchen34 34 See below, pp. 284ff. (drawn with all of its furnishings), the Abbot's Kitchen,35 35 See below, p. 321. the Kitchen for the Novices,36 36 See below, p. 315. the Kitchen for the Sick,37 37 See below, p. 315. the Kitchen for the Distinguished Guests,38 38 See II, 151ff. and the Kitchen for the Pilgrims and Paupers.39 39 See II, 165ff. In view of the meticulous attention given to the need for all of these installations, we are surprised to note the absence of a kitchen and dining hall for laymen. The aggregate number of serfs, workmen, and servants living within the monastic enclosure, as a rule, exceeded that of the monks.40 40 See below, pp. 342ff. Where did they eat? Clearly, not in the Refectory. This would be impossible not only because there is no entrance into the Refectory for the serfs and servants; but also because a regulation of the Second Synod of Aachen (817) prescribes "that laymen should not be conducted into the refectory for the sake of eating and drinking" (Ut laici causa manducandi uel bibendi in refectorium non ducantur).41 41 Synodi secundae decr. auth., chap. 14; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 476. Emil Lesne's contention42 42 Lesne, VI, 1943, 194. that the meals of the servants were not prepared in the Monks' Kitchen is right, in my opinion, if for no other reason than because of the differences PLAN OF ST. GALL WHAT SCHEME OF WATERWAYS? The Plan invites speculation concerning the water supply for the needs of the monastic population and the removal, beyond the confines of the site, of wastes and waters polluted by man and beast. The Plan does illustrate, as a paradigmatic concept, the composition of structures. But what conditions, topographic, hydrographic, climatic (winds, snow, rain) governed considerations for site selection? Essential to the operation and good health of the monastery were good drainage, an adequate supply of potable water, and a well-functioning scheme of sanitation, all conditions related to the type of terrain. The site illustrated in figure 53 is entirely assumptive. Contours provide downslope to the south: a downslope to the west of about 15 feet in the length of the Plan is shown, (roughly 0.25 inch per foot, or 25 inches per 100 feet). That of 83 privies shown on the Plan, 74 are on or near the north and east boundaries, may or may not allude to planning for odors as related to prevailing winds, or to a system by which, for most of the privies, excreta could be removed by water-carriage for building sites on terrains where generous slope and abundant water supply existed. Besides solid wastes, sewage comprises water fouled from baths, kitchen use, lavatories, and also surface drainage from rain or snow. These fluid wastes may have been removed by surface channels, or by subsurface conduits, probably of terra cotta made with nesting joints (such as present day "bell and spigot" clay pipe). Drinking water is best distributed by conduit with tight or sealed joints to prevent leakage and contamination from without. These two waterways, supply and waste, must be distinct and separate at all points through their full length. Bronze and lead, and sometimes wood, were used for piping by the Romans. Delivery of drinking water by horse drawn tank or barrel was possible. Probably all of these materials and modes of water supply and disposal of sewage were in use for a monastery of the period and, no doubt, varied according to the availability of materials, the skill of local craftsmen and the level of technology of the region. On sites where no water was available for sluicing of sewage, surface or underground, excreta was probably disposed in pits or middens, and treated with ashes or floor dust and sweepings, then removed at intervals and applied as manure on neighboring ground. From the agricultural view this was sound practice; from the view of hygiene, not to be tolerated. Nevertheless, such practice existed and exists today in some communities. While the 50 privies along the north boundary suggest planning for a system of sewage removal, the mills and mortars on the south boundary imply the presence of a running stream as a power source for their operation. It is notable that only those buildings of the Plan designated for occupancy by clerics or by men of noble status are provided with privies. The various buildings for essential services to the monastery, including services requiring high expertise (cooking, beer and wine making, goldsmithing, etc) have no privies. These men, about 70 percent of the monastery population, made shift for themselves according to the customs of the time and the regulations of the establishment. The nine privies in Building 4, the Monks' Toilets (adjacent to Building 3, the Monks' Dormitory) attached to the core of the Plan, pose a problem for sewage removal. A surface sewage ditch does not seem likely here in the midst of clean water lines; removal from this central location in underground conduit by water would be no small feat even if feasible. The proximity of these privies to the Monks' Vegetable Garden X and the Monks' Orchard Y may indicate that an agricultural destination for human wastes produced in Building 4 was intended. Figure 53 suggests how, within the scheme of topography shown, supply lines could penetrate the east boundary of the site. Interior branches we do not show. The Plan of St. Gall, by the careful ordering of its structures, could adapt well to an engineered system of water supply and waste drainage consonant with the state of the art of the plumber and the sanitary knowledge of the time. E. B. SCALE: ? ORIGINAL SIZE (1:1536) in diet of monks and servants. The monks were forbidden to eat meat; the servants were not.43 43 See my remarks on the diet of the monks and the serfs, below, pp 275ff. To provide two completely different menus in a kitchen not more than 30 feet square for about 300 people44 44 On their respective numbers, see below, pp. 342ff. would not have been feasible. The 370 pigs that the monastery of Corbie hung in its larder annually were for the serfs, the guests, and the sick.45 45 See III, Appendix II, p. 118f. Abbot Wala of Corbie (826-833), in his list of monastic officials, mentions a cellerarius familiae, i.e., a cellarer for the laymen, who is subordinate to the prior, and provides the monastery's servants with their drink.46 46 See below, p. 333. Hildemar (845850) in his commentary to the Rule of St. Benedict refers to a monk whose special task was to take care of the serfs' needs for food and drink.47 47 Expositio Hildemari; ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 459. Yet nowhere in the vast body of Carolingian consuetudinaries, or for that matter in any other contemporaneous sources as far as I know,48 48 Dr. Joseph Semmler, too, with whom I have had the pleasure of corresponding about this matter, is not aware of the existence of any other documentary sources that would throw further light on this question. Chapter 26 of the first synod of Aachen (816) prescribes: "Ut seruitores non ad unam mensam sed in propriis locis post refectionum fratrum reficiant quibus eadem lectio quae fratribus recitata est recitatur" (Synodi primae decr. auth., chap. 26; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 465). One might feel tempted to interpret this directive as referring to the serfs and workmen, as Emile Lesne has done (op. cit., 194), but the servitores mentioned in this resolution are not the monastery's lay servants, but the "servers" (servitores or hebdomadarii) who are chosen from among the monks for a weekly term of kitchen duty (see below, p. 279f.). A proper translation of this chapter would read: "That the servers take their meal, not at one table, but each at his proper place [i.e., the place in the Refectory assigned to him according to the date of his entry into monastic life] after the brothers have eaten, and that they be given the same reading as was given to them." It is in this sense that the passage was interpreted by Semmler, 1963, 44. is there any evidence for the existence of a kitchen for laymen. The Plan of St. Gall, I believe, enables us to solve this puzzle. It suggests that the meals of the serfs and the servants were cooked in their own houses, which differ from those of the monks in that they were furnished with hearths and in this way equipped for the cooking of meals.49 49 See II, 117ff. The serfs apparently continued within the monastic enclosure to eat as they had before they entered the monastery's service and to live in the same kind of houses. Had the serfs and workmen eaten at a common table, their considerable number would have required the monastery to have been provided with a dining hall and kitchen even larger than that provided for the monks. The absence of such structures on the Plan cannot be interpreted as an oversight or omission, because presumably the dining arrangements were handled in quite a different way. It would nevertheless be unreasonable to assume that every layman cooked his own meals. In fact, this was probably not even done by every group of servants living together in a given house. It is more logical to assume that the meals for the lay servants were prepared and eaten in two or three of the larger service structures strategically located so as to accommodate people living in different parts of the enclosure. I feel this view is supported by an unusual arrangement in the House for Horses and Oxen and Their Keepers.50 50 See II, 271ff. This house is provided with a large central hall with benches all around its walls, offering sitting space for forty-three people (fig. 54). The hearth is three times as large as the hearths in the other houses and has inscribed into it an -shaped symbol, which might well stand for the kind of boom or rigging that in the Middle Ages was used to hang pots over open fires. It is here, in my opinion, that the meals were cooked and eaten by all the serfs and herdsmen who lived west of the Great Collective Workshop.51 51 See II, 189ff. The latter house, too, may have served a similar purpose. It is occupied by men of higher skills and its yard is separated from that of the herdsmen by a conspicuous fence. A third center of this kind may have existed in the area of the gardeners and the fowl-keepers.52 52 See II, 203ff. 54. PLAN OF ST. GALL HOUSE FOR HORSES AND OXEN (BUILDING 33, SEE PLAN PAGE XXIV) The hall of this building (DOMUS BUBULCORUM ET EQUOS SERUANTIUM) may have served as kitchen and dining space for herdsmen of this and other houses. Its unusually large hearth, and benches ranging around the walls, offering seating for over forty people, appear to attest communal use of this space. 56. PLAN OF ST. GALL Plan of Monastery Church as interpreted by Ostendorf [after Ostendorf, 1922, 42, fig. 53] (Illustrated above at about 1:600) 55. PLAN OF ST. GALL Plan of Monastery Church, shown ½ original size, scale 1:384 I. 14 SCALE &amp; CONSTRUCTION METHODS USED IN DESIGNING THE PLAN I.14.1 INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE DRAWING AND THE EXPLANATORY TITLES In 1848 Robert Willis first expressed the view that the Plan of St. Gall was not drawn to scale and should be considered merely as a diagrammatic scheme.1 1 Willis, 1848, 89: "The plan has evidently no pretension to have been laid down to scale." The view was reiterated by A. Campion in a French translation of Willis' article, published in Bulletin Monumental, XXXIV 1868, 361-406, and was inherited from there by Henry Leclercq: "Le dessinateur n'a aucun souci de mettre à l'échelle . . . le plan doit être considéré comme un simple diagramme" (in Cabrol-Leclercq, VI:1, 1924, col. 88). Even as late as 1937 Reinhardt remarked: "Comme le dessin de l'église, celui des autres constructions ne peut être pris a l'échelle. Le dessin est purement schematique" (Reinhardt, 1937, 277). Since then the question of its measurements and construction method has become the subject of a perplexing controversy. Although in the course of this dispute practically every leading architectural historian of the Middle Ages has had his say, no unanimity has yet been reached in this matter.2 2 A systematic study to settle this controversy could not be undertaken before the publication in 1952 of the facsimile color print, which made the Plan accessible to analysis by compass and rule, a task impossible to undertake previously because of the risk of damage to the original. The controversy was caused by the fact that the dimensions given in the explanatory titles of the Church (the only place on the Plan where dimensions are listed) could not be brought into agreement with the manner in which the building is drawn. The titles that contain these dimensions are written by the main scribe,3 3 See above, pp. 13ff. four in the small and finely articulated minuscule in which most of the other legends of this scribe are written, and one in a widely spaced capitalis rustica. They are (fig. 55): 1. In the longitudinal axis of the Church, written in capitalis rustica, in groups of two and three letters, so as to extend the entire length of the Church: AB ORI EN TE IN OC CI DEN T? LON G?T?. PED? .CC. traditionally transcribed as: AB ORIENTE IN OCCIDENTE[M] LONGIT[UDO] PED[UM] CC. and accordingly translated: FROM EAST TO WEST THE LENGTH [IS] 200 FEET. 2. In the nave, written crosswise, midway between the altar of the Holy Cross and the ambo: Latitudo interioris t?p?li ped? xl The width of the nave of the church [is] 40 feet. 3. In the aisles, in line with the preceding title: Latitudo utriusque porticus pedum xx The width of each aisle [is] 20 feet 4. Between the interstices of the columns of the nave arcades the distich: Bis senos metire pedes interque columnas [southern row] Ordine quas isto constituisse decet [northern row] Measure twice six feet between the columns To have them arranged in this way is suitable. 5. In the interstices of the piers of the western Paradise the hexameter: Has interque pedes denos moderare columnas Between these columns measure ten feet. 59. PLAN OF ST. GALL. MONASTERY CHURCH DETAIL, FACSIMILE RED PRINT The south transept arm of the Monastery Church (A) is shown in original size (scale 1:192). The superimposition of lines at 2½ foot intervals running north-south (B) and east-west (C) demonstrate that internal area divisions are calculated as multiples of a 2½-foot module. The complete 2½-foot modular grid (D) forms a conceptual prime condition for laying out all values smaller or larger than 40 feet. Many other students of the Plan have observed that a conflict exists between the figures defining the width of the Church and those which are given for its length. If a scale is constructed on the basis of the 40-foot width of the nave and applied to the length of the Church, the over-all dimensions of the latter would come not to 200 feet (as is stipulated in No. 1), but to 300 feet; and if the same 40-foot scale were applied to the interstices of the two great columnar orders, the axial distance from the column to column would not amount to 12 feet (as stipulated in No. 4), but to 20 feet, since the drawing shows this span as being exactly one-half the width of the nave. How is this conflict to be resolved? I.14.2 PREVIOUS INTERPRETATIONS CONTRADICTORY TITLES NOT PART OF THE ORIGINAL SCHEME Two of the earlier students of the Plan, Hugo Graf4 4 Graf, 1892, 454 note 26. and August Hardegger5 5 Hardegger, 1917, 45ff; and Hardegger, Schlatter, Schiess, 1922, 68 note 1. proposed to solve these inconsistencies with the assumption that the explanatory titles were not part of the original textual annotations of the Plan but were inserted at a later time, presumably when the plan was subjected to a final revision before the actual construction of the church by Abbot Gozbert in 830. Bischoff's palaeographical analysis of the inscriptions has disproved this view by establishing that the titles that list the dimensions of the Church were written by the same hand that wrote the letter of transmittal, whose writer refers to himself explicitly as the author of the Plan.6 6 See above, pp. 13ff. The measurements, for this reason, cannot be ascribed to a revision undertaken by Abbot Gozbert or any of his builders. Their inconsistency with the drawing is an intrinsic feature of the Plan itself. THE TITLES NOT THE DRAWING REFLECT THE INTENT OF THE ORIGINAL SCHEME In attempting to explain this disturbing incongruity three further theories have evolved. One group of students of the Plan proposed that the linear layout of the Church was only a schematic concept and that the true intent of the draftsman was revealed not in the drawing, but in the accompanying explanatory titles. The main proponents of this view are Georg Dehio,7 7 The first modified drawing of the Plan was published by Dehio and von Bezold, Plates I, 1887, pl. 42 fig. 2. The same drawing is reproduced in all editions of Dehio's Geschichte der Deutschen Kunst; see 1st ed., I, 1919, 25, fig. 37. Joseph Hecht,8 8 Hecht, I, 1928, 27ff and pl. 8 fig. a. Hecht questioned the trustworthiness of the drawing, because no other monastery churches of comparable length were attested for the Carolingian period (ibid., 28). This view is incompatible with the measurements of the abbey church of Fulda, with a length of 321 feet (see below, pp. 187-89), and was further weakened by Doppelfeld's discovery under the pavement of Cologne Cathedral of the foundations of a Carolingian church that was 300 feet long; see above, p. 26, fig. 14, and p. 27. Wilhelm Pinder,9 9 Pinder, 1937, 69, fig. 4.

All made an attempt to reconstruct what they believed to be the author's "true intentions" by modifying the plan of the Church in the light of the measurements listed in its explanatory legends.12 12 For a discussion of the respective merits of these reconstructions, see below, p. 178f.

Facsimile reproduction of the red drawing of the Plan (see caption, page 13, vol. III) B. Same, with 2½-foot module superimposed C. Probable scheme by which the layout shown in A was constructed After the area analyzed in Fig. 59, the Monks' Dormitory embodies the next most obvious proof that in designing the Plan, the maker used an accurately graduated scale. The basic unit of this scale, the 2½-foot measure, the designer obtained by halving four times in succession the width he assigned to the nave of the Church, its transept, and all the basic claustral structures (see pp. 89-90 and Ernest Born's diagrams and captions, pp. 92-93). A 2½-foot module was a felicitous size for the basic unit of measurement applying to a settlement the size of the monastery of the Plan. It was large enough to account for critical space (seating, sleeping) and small enough to obviate the need to draw in excessive detail, and thus to cloud the view of the community's buildings. With a practical understanding, the maker of the Plan rounded up his dimensions to the next higher—never the lower—module: furnishings or features that might, when installed, lay in size between one and another module, were drawn to the larger size. This choice was deliberate. The beds of the Monks' Dormitory, and all other places where beds are depicted on the Plan (Abbot's House, House for Distinguished Guests, Dormitory for Visiting Monks), are examples of it. All these beds are assigned a width of one module and a length of three. One module 2½ feet (30 inches) might be considered adequate for the width of a monk's cot, but three modules totalling 7½ feet seems overly long. However, the space of two modules, 5 feet, would surely have been too short for a grown man. The longer increment allowed the designer to indicate just how many were expected to sleep in a space the size of the Dormitory; to suggest a possible bed arrangement while permitting enough more space to accommodate furnishings; and, by accumulation of "extra" measure, ultimately to account for space required by such constructional features as wall thick- nesses and staircases, nowhere specifically indicated on the Plan. Such issues would have been resolved as a function of supervision in actual construction, decisions delegated to an experienced artisan who not only could understand and interpret the Plan and its maker's intentions, but who also knew how to deal with practicalities of building a wing to house 76 men. More discussion of these issues is offered, pp. 112-13, and II, 225ff. 60. titles. To them the Church with the thickness of its walls reconstructed, would have looked as it is shown in figure 56 (a proposal made by Ostendorf).19 19 See note 14 above. Doppelfeld, the most articulate exponent of this group, has proposed that the inconsistencies between the drawing and the measurements given in the explanatory titles can be easily resolved if one were to assume that the scribe who wrote these legends converted the figure 300 (in Latin, CCC) into 200 (in Latin, CC) by inadvertently dropping one of the C's; and that he committed a second error by confusing a d with an s and thus inadvertently converting the crucial word bis denos ("twice ten," equaling twenty) of the intercolumniary legend of the arcades of the nave of the church into bis senos ("twice six," equaling twelve). If these errors of the copyist are corrected, Doppelfeld concluded, all the discrepancies between the drawing and its explanatory titles would disappear, and the text and drawing would endorse one another.20 20 Doppelfeld, op. cit., 11-12; likewise, Rave, loc. cit. Doppelfeld had another reason for believing in the trustworthiness of the drawing: his own excavations beneath the pavement of Cologne Cathedral which had brought to light the foundations of a Carolingian monastery church whose dimensions were virtually identical to those of the Church of St. Gall.21 21 Doppelfeld, op. cit. THE INCONSISTENCIES NOT PART OF THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT BUT A CORRECTIVE MEASURE Doppelfeld's argument was persuasive, and it was based on a hypothesis subsequently proven to be correct, namely, that the Plan of St. Gall is not an original but a copy.22 22 See Bischoff, in Studien, 1962, 67ff; and Horn, in Studien, 1962, 79ff; and above, p. 15. Yet even before this fact was established, Doppelfeld's view was challenged by Walter Boeckelmann.23 23 Boeckelmann, 1956b, see especially 131-32. The incompatibility between the drawing and the explanatory titles, Boeckelmann contended, was not the product of an erring scribe, but the reflection of a conflict that had arisen at the council of Aachen, held in 816,24 24 Boeckelmann mistakenly locates the synod at Inden. between the bold dimensional thinking of the old ecclesiastical leaders who had shaped the policy of the church under Charlemagne and the constrictive views of the leaders of the reform party who controlled the church under Louis the Pious. A plan worked out by the "old guard" had come under the criticism of the reform party. The dimensions listed in the explanatory titles were not meant to explain the drawing, but to correct it. And since the proponents of these corrective measures did not take it upon themselves to revise the drawing in the suggested sense, "the disagreement was not solved in the Plan, the conflict remaining preserved." Boeckelmann's view, in my opinion, is correct. It reconciles more of the conflicting traits of the Plan than any of the previous hypotheses. More recent investigations have shown that there indeed existed a serious ideological split at the synods of Aachen between an old conservative group of churchmen and the leaders of the reform party, which affected other aspects of the Plan.25 25 See Horn, in Studien, 1962, 108ff, and above, pp. 20ff. CONFLICTING VIEWS ON SCALE OF THE PLAN But Boeckelmann's theory was challenged, in turn, in 1965 by Adolf Reinle,26 26 Reinle, 1963/64. who came forth with a new interpretation of the textual incongruities of the Plan that departed radically from all views previously expressed on this subject. The meaning of the axial title of the Church, so Reinle contended, is not as is generally assumed, FROM EAST TO WEST THE LENGTH IS 200 FEET but rather, THIS PLAN IS DRAWN AT THE SCALE OF 1:200 Reinle arrived at this interpretation in the following manner: 1. PED?, he maintained, must not be transcribed as PEDUM (genitive plural of pes = "foot"), but as PEDA or PEDIA (imperative form of the verb pedare or pediare = "to measure in feet").27 27 Ibid., 97. 2. LONG?T?. must not be read as LONGITUDO (nominative of the noun longitudo = "length"), but as LONGITUDINE (ablative form of the noun longitudo = "in length").28 28 Ibid. 3. .CC. is not the simple cardinal figure ducentum = "two hundred," but must be interpreted as a multiplicative term, in the sense of ducenties = "two hundred times." Reinle, accordingly, transcribes the title: AB ORIENTE IN OCCIDENTEM LONGITUDINE PEDA DUCENTIES and purports this to mean FROM EAST TO WEST, IN LENGTH, MEASURE TWO HUNDRED TIMES, or THIS PLAN IS DRAWN AT THE SCALE OF 1:200.29 29 Ibid., 98. This interpretation is untenable on two counts: first, it is based on an improper textual exegesis; and second, it ascribes to the ninth century a method of defining architectural scale relationships that does not antedate the French Revolution.30 30 I have discussed the shortcomings of Reinle's interpretation at length in a separate study (Horn, 1966, 285-308) and am confining myself here to a review of my principal objections to his argument. 61. PLAN OF ST. GALL CHURCH AND CLAUSTRUM The 40-foot module is superimposed upon the facsimile red drawing (shown ½ original size; 1:384) IMPROPER TEXTUAL EXEGESIS It is apparent that Reinle's interpretation of the axial title of the Church has been undertaken without reference to the Latinity of the other titles of the Plan and their system of graphical abbreviations. The Plan, as we have seen,31 31 See above, pp. 13ff. is furnished with some 340 separate entries of varying length, the majority in prose, the remainder in verse. The prose is lucid and not susceptible to misinterpretation at any point. The verses are often flowery in style, but their syntax and sense are always clear. There is nothing equivocal about the distich that defines the interstices between the columns of the nave arcades (No. 4) or the hexameter that defines the interstices between the piers of the western Paradise (No. 5). And there is nothing equivocal about the style or syntax of any of the other titles of the Plan. It is inconceivable within the total context of these legends that the drafter of these texts would have framed one of the most crucial lines of his commentary in so sloppy a manner as to mislead some seven generations of Latinists into interpreting as a simple designation of length what he meant to be a ratio of scale. If PED? had been meant to stand for PEDA, the scribe would have found himself compelled to make this clear by spelling the word out—as he had done in title 4 (metire) and title 5 (moderare) where this form is used—in view of the fact that PED? is the traditional abbreviation for PEDUM. By the same token, he would have had to make it clear that LONG?T? stood for LONGITUDINE, rather than allowing it to be read as LONGITUDO. And if the capital letters CC were meant to convey the meaning "two hundred times," rather than the figure 200, the scribe would have had to make this clear, since such a use of the letters would have differed distinctly from their traditional usage. The need for this clarification would have been the more pressing because clearly all of the other dimensional titles on the Plan are designations of simple linear length. No reader of the Plan can fail to notice that the syntax of the longitudinal title of the Church (No. 1) and the two titles that describe the width of the nave and the aisles (No. 2 and 3) is identical. Each consists of a subject (LONGIT[UDO], Latitudo, Latitudo), a prepositional phrase (AB ORIENTE IN OCCIDENTE[M], interioris templi, utriusque porticus), and a predicate phrase (PED[UM] .CC., pedu[m] xl, pedum xx). The verb est is missing, but is implicit in the text, and it is, therefore, entirely proper to translate these respective passages (1, 2, 3, above) as: FROM EAST TO WEST THE LENGTH IS 200 FEET THE WIDTH OF THE NAVE IS 40 FEET THE WIDTH OF EACH AISLE IS 20 FEET What was it that induced Reinle to engage in such arbitrary textual exegesis? This question takes us to our second main objection: ANACHRONISM IN MENSURATION Reinle believes he has discovered that the Plan of St. Gall was drawn at a scale of 1:200.32 32 Reinle, op. cit., 93 and 98. He is not the first to advance this view. Wilhelm Rave had expressed himself along similar lines in 1956,33 33 Rave, 1956, 47: "Die Planung des Baumeisters ist geradeso wie noch meistens unsere heutigen Vorentwürfe im Masstab 1:200 aufgetragen." and Emil Reisser likewise, in a study published posthumously in 1960.34 34 Reisser, 1960, 53 and 80. The Plan is, indeed, drawn to a scale that comes close to what we would define today as a ratio of 1:200. But it is one thing to observe that the Plan was drawn at a scale that corresponds or comes close to the ratio of 1:200; it is quite another to claim that it was actually drawn at that scale. In proposing this view, Reinle is caught in an anachronism. The concept 1:200 is not a medieval concept and does not make sense within the medieval system of mensuration. If a modern architectural drawing is said to be laid out at a scale of 1:200, this means that one unit on the drawing corresponds to 200 identical units on the ground. The base of this ratio is decimal. A medieval architect could not have expressed himself in these terms, since the two basic units of measurement with which he worked, the foot and the inch, were internally divided not into tenths, but into twelfths and sixteenths (a system that still persists in England and the larger Anglo-Saxon world) or into twelfths and twelfths (the pied royal de France, which was used in France until the introduction of the metric system).35 35 For general information see the articles "Weights and Measures" in Encyclopedia Britannica, and "Poids et Mesures" in Grande Encyclopédie, XXVI, Paris, n.d., 1184-96, as well as the literature there cited. The foot and its primary subdivision, the inch, were derived from the human body.36 36 Vitruvius, De Architectura, Book 3, chap. 1.5 expresses himself on this issue as follows: "Mensurarum rationes . . . ex corporis membris collegerunt, uti digitum, palmum, pedem, cubitum" (see Vitruvius, On Architecture, ed. Granger, I, 1931, 160ff). Twelve thumb-breadths of a fully grown man equal the length of his foot (fig. 57). This is the raison d'être for the twelve units of the English foot. The French word pouce, the Old French poulcée, the Latin pollex—all meaning "thumb"—reflect the history of the genesis of this measure. Like the English foot, the Latin foot consisted of twelve units37 37 With regard to the Roman foot, see Jacono, 1935, 167-68; for a fuller account see Hultsch, 1862, 59ff; 1882, 74ff. Of great importance for the medieval history of the inch is Bede's chapter "De ratione unciarum" in his De temporum ratione, chap. 4, which Charles W. Jones brought to my attention. See Bedae opera de temporibus, ed. Jones, 1943, 184-85. The smallest unit of measure derived from the human body is not the inch (uncia) but the digit (digitus), the breadth of a finger. It formed the base of the Italic foot (equivalent to 11.66 modern English inches) which had sixteen digits. Four digits formed a hand (palmus) and four hands formed a foot (pes). See Hultsch, loc. cit. "Inch," Anglo-Saxon ynce, comes from Latin uncia = "a twelfth"; and the duodecimal graduation of the Roman foot is reflected in the series: uncia = 1/12; sextans = 2/12 or ? quadrans = 3/12 or ¼ triens = 4/12 or ? quincunx = 5/12 semipes = 6/12 or ½ septunx = 7/12 bes = 8/12 or ? dodrans = 9/12 or ¾ dextans = 10/12 or ? deunx = 11/12 62. PLAN OF ST GALL: SHOWING 40 FOOT MODULE SUPERIMPOSED UPON THE ENTIRE SITE OF THE MONASTERY The human body does not offer reliable guidance for divisions smaller than the breadth of a thumb. These smaller units could only be obtained by instrumental operations, and the simplest, easiest, and for that reason, probably the oldest, way of graduating a distance into a sequence of consistently decreasing smaller units is the method of continuous halving—a procedure by means of which a whole is reduced to a half, a half to a quarter, a quarter to an eighth, and eighth to a sixteenth (fig. 58).38 38 Cf. Perry, 1955, 80. This is the procedure that created the sixteen graduations of the English inch.39 39 The tenacious survival in the modern Anglo-Saxon world of the sedecimal graduation of the inch appears to suggest that this was also the traditional way of subdividing the inches in medieval England. Yet this is not born out by a reading of chapter 4 of Bede's De temporum ratione (used as a standard text without rival in Carolingian times), as Charles W. Jones brings to my attention. Here the inch is defined as being divided into twelve and even twenty-four parts, a division retained in all of the Carolingian glosses to this treatise, of which more than forty sets have been examined by Jones (see Bedae opera de temporibus, ed. Jones, 1943, loc. cit.). An analysis of Bede and other related texts may in fact suggest a dichotomy in the approach to duodecimal and sedecimal systems, between the theoreticians and the practitioners of measures and weights. Charles W. Jones, in a personal letter, addresses himself to this subject as follows: "Bede (A.D. 725) treated weights and measures, primarily the divisions of pound (libra) and ounce (uncia), in his classroom textbook, De temporum ratione, chap. iv (Clavis patrum latinorum, n. 2320; see also Pat. Lat. XC, cols. 699-702). Therein he recognized no other fractional principle than duodecimalism, despite his addiction as an exegete to the concept of ten, its square, and cube. He positively states that duodecimals are used not only for weights (including numismetrics) but also for times (months, hours, points, moments) and for lines, planes, and volumes of bodies (Jones, 1943, 184.2-3; 185.26-28, 44-49). "I have examined about twenty different sets of glosses for that chapter, but only the following sets contain remarks pertinent to this topic: Berlin MS 130, written A.D. 873 at Metz; Munich MS 18158, an eleventh-century copy from Tegernsee of a ninth-century text; 21557, an adaptation of 18158; Valenciennes MS 174, written about A.D. 840 at Saint-Amand (duplicated in Brussels MS 9837-9840, saec. xii/xiii); Vatican MS Rossi lat. 247, copied in the Loire region [Fleury?] about A.D. 1018 from an exemplar of ca. 820. (The complete set of glosses from the Berlin MS will be published in the forthcoming Corpus Christianorum edition of Bede's Opera didascalica.) Bede's was the basic text on the subject in Carolingian schools: about 150 codexes containing that chapter are extant today. The masters seem to have disregarded Isidore's treatment, Etymologiarum liber XVI, xxv-xvii, although it was in common circulation. But they do quote Priscian's De figuris numerorum liber ii, 9-iii, 16 (ed. H. Keil, Grammatici Latini III, Leipzig, 1859, pp. 407-11), sometimes verbatim and several times by name. Priscian dealt with both decimals and duodecimals, but the glossators quite obviously tried to eliminate decimalism by recasting his statements. Nor, with one exception which I will mention, did these glossators introduce any suggestion of sedecimalism. "In short, the scholastic evidence points exclusively to duodecimal measures in Carolingian as in early-English times. "Such proof by silence might seem to refute use of sedecimals, but we know that medieval scholasticism often was remote from practice. An analogue is the void between Boethian and Gregorian music. I agree with you that a master builder, with rod and plumbline, would be apt to think in multiples of halves. The Metz glossator (Berlin MS) seems to lend some support to this surmise. Bede had stated; Item decorporibus, sive miliarium, sive, stadium, sive iugerum, sive perticam, sive etiam cubitum, pedemve aut palmun partiri opus habes, praefata ratione facies. Denique et in Exodo dimidium cubiti semis appellatur, narrante Moyse, quod habuerit arca testamenti duos semis cubitos longitudinis, et cubitum ac semissem altitudinis. ("Also you hold to the same fractions in measuring bodies, whether miles, or stades, or acres, or rods, or even cubits, feet, or hands, whenever you need to divide. In fact, in Exodus a half cubit is called a `semis,' because, according to the statement of Moses, the Ark of the Testament was two and a half cubits in length and a cubit and a half in height.") The Metz glossator writes: We know nothing about the internal divisions of the Carolingian inch, but whether it was graduated into twelfths or into sixteenths, this much is certain: there was no common decimal denominator between a Carolingian inch and a Carolingian foot that could be expressed in the ratio 1:200. The modern metric scale is based on a comparison of parts of like nature, all of which can be understood either as fractions or as multiples of ten. The medieval scale has no such common unit of reference. It is a combination of a variety of different forms of graduation (sedecimal, duo- 1. Corporibus. Scilicet non solum de temporibus. 2.

Id est dimidium. Accusativus a semis. "Bede had asserted that the traditional measures had to be adapted to duodecimals. But the Metz glossator, in introducing these definitions, gratuitously introduced other schemes of fractions. Granted (2) that a mile is a thousand paces, a league is 3/2 thousand. A stade (3) is 125 paces, an eighth of a mile. An acre (4) is 48 paces, a rod (5) ten paces. At this stage of the pattern, medietas (6), the mid-point, becomes a congenial concept for one half, not only for the semi-pound (7) but for the semicubit, `and therefore it is used in measuring bodies,' a usage justified for Bede by no lesser an authority than Moses (Exodus xxv.10) who used dimidium and semissem in the same sentence interchangably. Hence it seems that the Metz glossator found it easy, with his mind centered on the building measurements of Noah's and Moses' arks, to introduce a scheme of fractions quite at odds with the duodecimalism he was teaching as the determining ratio of weights and measures." 63. PLAN OF ST. GALL: ONE LINE OF A GRID, 160 FOOT MODULE, FIXED THE CHURCH AXIS decimal, and decimal), whose relation to one another cannot be expressed in the terms of a decimal sequence. It would be correct to say that the Plan of St. Gall is drawn to a scale in which one sixteenth of a Carolingian inch on the drawing corresponds to one Carolingian foot on the ground. To convert this scale into a relationship in which the ratio is expressed in the form of like units requires that the base value of one sixteenth of an inch be multiplied first by 16 (the sixteen parts of the inch) and then by 12 (the twelve parts of the foot): 16 × 12 = 192,40 40 That the Plan of St. Gall was drawn to a scale of 1/16″:1′ was first expressed by me in the French edition of the catalogue to the Council of Europe exhibition dedicated to Charlemagne: "Le plan est entièrement dessiné d'après une échelle, ou le 1/16e d'un pouce sur le parchemin représente un pied sur le terrain. Converti en une relation d'unités egales, cela signifie 1:192 (1/16 × 16 × 12 = 192/16), rapport de grandeur qui approche l'échelle métrique du 1:200, mais qu'il ne faut aucunement confondre avec celle-ci; puisque la relation 1:200 n'existait pas dans le système métrologique médieval, où le pied est divisé en 12 pouces, et le pouce en seize seizièmes" (see Charlemagne, oeuvre, rayonnement et survivances [Dixième Exposition sous les Auspices du Conseil de l'Europe], ed. Wolfgang Braunfels, Aix-la-Chapelle, 1965, 399). the number of sixteenths of an inch in a foot. The ratio 1:192 is not far from the ratio 1:200, but it is not identical with it and should, under no circumstances, be confused with it.41 41 I am delighted to find that in an article that became available to me only after the present study was completed, Konrad Hecht had independently come to the same conclusion: "Der Masstab 1:200 ist für einen mittelalterlichen Plan zwar plausibel, aber doch irrig, denn dieser Masstab setzt die dezimale Teilung des Fussmasses voraus. . . . Der St. Galler Plan wurde nicht im Masstab 1:200, sondern im Masstab 1/16″:1′ entsprechend 1:192 gezeichnet" (Hecht, 1965, 187-88). In medieval mensuration the scale relationship 1:200 not only did not exist, it would have been meaningless.42 42 The figure 200 is not a natural break in a system that is based on fractions of 12 and 16. It acquired meaning only after the adoption of the metric system—a system of consistently graduated units of like dimension which departed so radically from the chaotic, but deeply ingrained, forms of mensuration which it supplanted that it could have been inaugurated only under the auspices of a political revolution and enforced by the mandate of an ensuing dictatorship. For a brief résumé of the adoption of the metric system, see Arthur E. Kennelly, 1928, 12-27; for a comprehensive, detailed account of the establishment and propagation of the metric system and the operations that determined the meter and the kilogram, see Favre, 1931 and Bigourdan, 1901. This fact by itself precludes that the axial title of the Church could have meant what Reinle purports it to mean, and thus we are taken back to Boeckelmann's interpretation as the most reasonable explanation of the dimensional incongruities of the Plan. EARLY EXPRESSION OF THE VIEW THAT THE PLAN WAS DRAWN TO A CONSISTENT SCALE In contrast to those who held that the Plan of St. Gall was purely a schematic rendering, Boeckelmann believed that the Plan was drawn to a definite scale and that the key to this scale was to be found in the 40 feet that the draftsman ascribed to the width of the nave of the Church. He observed that values consistent with this scale can be recognized in the dimensions of many other areas of the Plan. The Cloister Yard, for example, if measured in the light of the 40-foot width of the nave, forms a square of 100 feet; the rectangular area in its center, a square of 20 feet.43 43 Boeckelmann, 1956, 126. Boeckelmann was not the first to make this observation. As early as 1938, Fritz Viktor Arens had drawn attention to the fact that many of the dimensions of the Plan of St. Gall were based upon a decimal system consistent with the 40-foot width of the nave of the Church.44 44 Arens, 1938, 62ff. He also observed another important fact, that if one attempted to redraw the Plan of St. Gall in the light of the measurements given for the length of the Church (200 feet), the Cloister and all service structures of the Plan would be reduced to a size in which they could no longer perform their designated functions.45 45 Ibid., 66-67. Arens drew attention to the fact that the dimensions of the beds in the Monks' Dormitory make perfect sense if interpreted in the light of the 40-foot width of the nave of the Church, but become unrealistic if related to the 200 feet stipulated for the length of the Church. Emil Reisser (1960, 53) came independently to the same conclusions: "Eine von mir vorgenommene Nachprüfung hat ergeben, dass man mindestens das im St. Galler Plan eingeschriebene Mass von 40 Fuss (zu 0.33) = 13.20 Meter für die Mittelschiffsbreite der Kirche . . . annehmen muss, wenn die Räume der übrigen Bauten eine brauchbare Grösse erhalten sollen." My own analysis of the Plan confirms this observation. Not only would the monks, including the Abbot and the visiting noblemen, no longer fit into their beds, but the Refectory would be too small to seat the monastery's contingent of monks, the horses would lack the required floor space to stand in their stables, the workmen could not carry out their crafts and labors. The Cloister Yard would be by one third below what Hildemar, a ninth-century monk, defined as the desirable minimum (cf. below, p. 246). It was the most stringent argument in favor of the assumption that if any of the measurements given in the explanatory titles of the Plan reflect the original scale, it is the 40-foot figure listed for the width of the nave, and not the 200-foot figure listed for the length of the Church. Arens' and Boeckelmann's observations were fundamental. Yet neither Arens nor Boeckelmann realized their full significance. Their failure to do so was probably caused by their awareness that, whereas the dimensions of many of the larger installations of the Plan can clearly be interpreted as multiples of ten, many others—and in particular the majority of all the smaller dimensional values of the Plan— are inexplicable in the context of a decimal scale. I.14.3 SCALE USED IN DESIGNING THE PLAN A WORD OF CAUTION In turning, at this juncture, to an account of my own conclusions on the scale that was used in designing the Plan, I should like to start with a word of caution. While I hold the view that the Plan was drawn to a definite scale, and that this scale was applied consistently throughout the entire 64. PLAN OF ST. GALL. MONKS' VEGETABLE GARDEN The vegetable growing plots measure two modules wide, 5 feet (60 inches) and would require a reach of no greater than 30 inches from the work space between plots, an efficient size for hand cultivation. The clear work space between the cultivated strips, 1-1½ modules wide (45 inches) was adequate for a gardener with barrow or basket. The center aisle, 2 modules wide, permitted two men with their barrows or vegetable baskets to easily pass each other. The planning stresses no waste motion, no scattered lost effort. This was not a garden in which to play at gardening. It was close to life, the need to live and the desire to live. Nowhere in the Plan is the sense of urgency, the necessity of collaboration and conservation of resources more dramatically and concisely expressed than in this simple composition of eighteen rectangular garden plots. Adjacent, on the north, where fruit ripened for the monks' table, was the Monastery Orchard which served a second purpose as the Monks' Cemetery (always efficient even in death) where the monks took their long final rest. Modularity was born of sacred numbers. Each was but a finite and measureable feature of divine and infinite order communicated to men from heaven by a vast scheme of symbolism. The passion for order still persists, but the explanations are not the same. * For extended treatment of the Monks' Vegetable Garden see II, 204, 205. Cemetery and Orchard are treated on page 211, vol. II. Characters in black squares identify buildings of the Plan, page xxiv, and III, 14 (Catalogue of Inscriptions). E.B. A submodule grid of 1¼ feet is superimposed on the plots of the vegetable garden (red drawing, same size as original; scale 1:192) breadth and width of the scheme,46 46 The core of the views advanced on the following pages were first presented by me in a paper read at the International Symposium held at St. Gall in the summer of 1957 (reviewed by Poeschel, 1957, 9-29; Idem. in Studien, 1962, 27-28; by Bessler, 1958; by Doppelfeld, 1957; by Gruber, 1960; and by Knoepfli, 1961, 312-14. I have touched in print upon these problems briefly in Studien, 1962, 94-95 as well as in the catalogues of the Council of Europe Exhibition Karl der Grosse, ed. Wolfgang Braunfels, Aachen, 1965, 409-10 (French edition, p. 399); and in more detail in an article entitled "The `Dimensional Inconsistencies' of the Plan of St. Gall and the Problem of the Scale of the Plan," published in The Art Bulletin, XLVIII, 1966, 285308. An abridged version of this article was read at a meeting of the Herbert M. Evans History of Science Dinner Club, on 2 January 1968. It was in the ensuing discussion that Professor Charles L. Camp remarked on the similarity of the series 640, 160, 40, 10, 2 1/2 of the Plan of St. Gall with the American land measuring system of 1785, an observation in the pursuit of which Hunter Dupree made the fascinating historical discoveries reviewed in III, Appendix III. I do not think anyone could expect to be able to determine without any shadow of doubt the precise dimensions of every building, or any piece of furniture, shown on this scheme. This is impossible for a number of reasons. Most important among these are that the Plan is not an original but a copy, and that this copy was traced, without the aid of any supporting instruments, through the opaque body of large and rather unmanageable pieces of parchment that had to be held against a light surface in order to acquire the requisite transparency.47 47 Cf. above, pp. 15ff. This was bound to introduce a multitude of minor inaccuracies and inconsistencies that are incompatible with the precision of draftsmanship required in the development of the original scheme. Moreover, there is clear evidence, as I have demonstrated elsewhere, that in the process of tracing, original and overlay changed their respective positions, in several instances causing a substantial measure of distortion. This is noticeable especially in the alignment of the claustral structures with the Church and in the distorted layout of the stables in the southwestern corner of the settlement.48 48 Cf. above, pp. 19 and 37ff. Despite these malformations, minor or major as they may be, the Plan of St. Gall retains enough of the precision of the prototype to permit the conclusion that the original was based on a consistent and carefully calculated scale, and to allow us to reconstruct the basic graduations of this scale. The primary reason why this problem was not solved in the past is, I think, that most of the students who took an interest in this matter were Continental Europeans reared on the metric system. Being raised in this system, I, too, could not avoid interpreting the scale of the Plan—as I presume many others tried before me—by constructing a straightedge on which the value forty (width of the nave) was graduated into forty equal units. Applying this scale to the various buildings of the Plan as well as to the open spaces between them, I recognized quickly, yet not without consternation, that a staggering majority of the dimensions appeared to coincide with intermediate values that did not make sense in terms of an even numerical progression. I was puzzled by the frequent occurrence of such values as 2½, 7½, 12½, 17½, 22½, 27½, and so on, and in a special sense by the heavy recurrent rate of what appeared to be a standard value, namely, the width assigned to the steps, benches, and beds. It was larger than 2, yet smaller than 3, and appeared to make sense only if interpreted as 2½. I was puzzled by these observations until it occurred to me that the conditions that they reflected might be related to the possibility that the inventor of the scheme availed himself of a scale that was not based on the continuous sequence of equal numerical values used in the decimal system, but emerged from the geometrical thinking of the developmentally older sedecimal system that survives in the subdivisions of the English inch. I consequently designed a scale in which the value 40 was internally graduated into sixteen units, each of a length of 2½ feet, and the entire riddle of the Plan unfolded itself. I shall demonstrate the validity of this assertion with a scale analysis of two areas of the Plan which lend themselves with particular ease to this type of investigation. THE 2½-FOOT MODULE (STANDARD MODULE) Figure 59 shows a scale analysis of the southern transept p. 78 arm of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall. The surface area covered by this part of the Church forms a square, each side of which is equal to the width of the nave, i.e., 40 feet. In the second and third drawing shown on this page, this square is subdivided into sixteen strips, first from north to south, then from east to west; in the last drawing the two systems are combined. The experiment proves that all the internal area divisions of the southern transept arm are conceived as multiples of a 2½-foot square. The passageway that gives access to the crypt is three units wide and sixteen units long (7½ × 40 feet), the platform on which the altar of St. Andrew stands is three units wide and ten units long (7½ × 25 feet). The steps and benches have a standard width of one unit (2½ feet) and vary in length between five, six, and ten units (12½ feet, 15 feet, and 25 feet). The intervals between the steps and benches likewise can be brought into a system of logical relationships, if interpreted as multiples of a 2½-foot square. An analysis of the adjacent area of the Dormitory of the Monks (fig. 60.A) enables us to establish this point with p. 80 even greater persuasiveness. The complicated layout of the beds in this building is inconceivable without the use of a carefully constructed system of auxiliary construction lines. It is easily understandable if it is conceived as being developed within a grid of 2½-foot squares (demonstrated in fig. 60.C). The overall analysis of Cloister and Church suggests that the building was meant to be sixteen 2½-foot units wide and thirty-four 2½-foot units long (40 × 85 feet). Each bed is one unit wide and three units long (2½ × 7½ feet), with 65. PLAN OF ST. GALL. KITCHEN AND BATHHOUSE OF THE ILL A 1¼-foot module grid is superimposed on this detail from the facsimile red print (scale 1:192, original size). the exception of a small number of beds near the two gable walls which had to be shortened to leave sufficient room for the entrances and exits located in these walls. A glance at the drawings shown in figure 60.B discloses that the boundaries of the beds do not in all cases coincide with the boundaries of the underlying squares. The beds that lie at right angles to the long wall straddle the grid lines with their center axis. This suggests the possibility of the use of an even smaller module, which we shall discuss later. The superimposition of the square grid on the original drawing (fig. 60.B) reveals the means by which the draftsman, in copying this building, extended its length by one unit beyond what it was meant to be through an accumulation of small errors. The center group of beds in the northern half of the Dormitory has a length of twelve 2½-foot modules. The corresponding group of beds in the southern half of the building is thirteen 2½-foot modules long. It is obvious that they were meant to be of identical size. Figure 60.B shows with great precision those places where the draftsman took on these additional increments of space (first and second transverse row in the southern half of the building). This was probably due to two slight and almost imperceptible shifts in the relation of the original parchment to the tracing sheets. By the time the draftsman had reached the end of the second row of beds, he had inadvertently picked up an excess of an entire module. This lengthened the Dormitory from thirty-four to thirty-five standard modules, or from 85 feet (length of the original) to 87½ feet (length of the copy).49 49 Hecht (1965, 175) observed that the square grid of the schematic drawing of the Dormitory, which I published in Studien, 1962, 91, fig. 7, is by one standard module shorter than the drawing (16 × 34 units); he tried to correct my "mistake" by a square grid measuring 16 × 35 units. The mistake is not mine, but that of the monk who traced the Plan of St. Gall. In analyzing the dimensional layout of this as well as any other building of the Plan it is important that the overall dimensions of each respective structure be ascertained by its relation to neighboring or superordinate units before an attempt is made to decipher its internal relationships. THE 40-FOOT MODULE (LARGE MODULE) This module controls the proportions of the Church and the layout of the Claustrum (fig. 61). The transept and nave of the Church, being of equal width, by necessity form a square at their area of intersection. As is the case in certain Romanesque churches of Normandy and the Rhineland two centuries later, the dimensions of this square determine the layout of the remaining portions of the church. Thus on the Plan of St. Gall the transept of the Church forms an oblong composed of three times the area of the crossing unit. The nave is a space composed of four and one-half such units, while three more units of identical size are added to the east of the transept; the forechoir, the sacristy, and the library. It should be noted that in the nave the squares are arranged in such a manner that the corners coincide with the axis of each column. The 40 feet assigned to the width of the nave must for that reason be interpreted to relate not to the clear span between the bases of these columns, but to the distance from axis to axis of each corresponding pair of columns. That the Church of the Plan of St. Gall is laid out according to a system of squares has been observed by many previous students of the Plan, but a fact that appears to have been entirely overlooked is that the entire aggregate of buildings forming the Claustrum is developed in a similar manner. A glance at figure 61 shows that the body of the Church can be inscribed into a grid of 40-foot squares (three units wide and nine units long), and the claustral structures that abut the Church to the east can be entered into an adjacent grid of identical squares (three units wide and five and one-half units long). I have no doubt that this is the manner in which the drawing was started. But attention must be drawn to the fact that the alignment of the drawing with the grid is not perfect. There are two discrepancies—not large, yet conspicuous enough to cause some concern. One of these is that the aisles of the Church are not 20 feet wide, as one should expect them to be in the light of their explanatory titles (latitudo utriusque porticus pedum xx); instead they measure 22½ feet. The other is that in certain places the Dormitory and the Refectory extend over the southern boundaries of the 40-foot grid of the Claustrum by as much as 5 feet. I believe that these deviations are the result of purposeful modifications undertaken as the drawing progressed from its initial conception into its final stages; and I shall discuss this point in detail later. THE 160-FOOT MODULE (SUPER MODULE) The discovery that the Church and the Claustrum were designed ad quadratum raises the question of whether the site plan for the entire monastery may not have been developed from the dimensions of the crossing square. To answer this question is not easy, because the Plan of St. Gall fails to inform us about the location of the walls that separate the monastery from the secular world. We do not know where the grounds of the monastery begin and where they end. It is probable, however, that this problem may be solved by a simple proportional speculation. Measured from west to east—or more precisely, from the westernmost fences of the agricultural service structures west of the Church to the easternmost lines of the building masses east of the Church—the monastery grounds are sixteen times the width of the nave of the Church (640 feet), a round and very convincing number, in which the figure four plays a determinant role (fig. 62). By contrast, the distance between the outermost lines of the building masses sited along the southern edge of the monastery and the outermost lines of the building masses on the northern side amounts to 11½ times the 40-foot width of the nave of the Church (fig. 62). The proportion 11½:16 is not a likely medieval relationship. A more convincing proportion would be 12:16 (or 3:4). There is some evidence, not easily discarded, which suggests that in the south and north the monastery grounds were meant to extend beyond the outer building masses, since the fences of some of the buildings located along the southern and northern border of the monastery site run out into the space which lies beyond these structures, and end only at the end of the parchment. Two such fences, running north, may be seen on either side of the Outer School; another runs south in extension of the west wall of the House for the Workmen (fig. 62). There are other considerations of a practical nature which would require a buffer zone between the outer building lines and the monastery wall. The water-driven machinery of the Mill and Mortar houses are dependent on flues and sluices that can only have run to the south of these buildings, and a similar safety margin of space would have been desirable in the north for servicing the privies. A buffer zone of 10 feet added to the building masses, on either of the two long sides of the Plan, would take care of these necessities and would result in a meaningful overall proportion (12:16 or 3:4) for the Plan (fig. 62). The acceptance of such an overall modular scheme would, moreover, help us to settle two other puzzling aspects of the Plan. It would explain the location of the Church. It has never been clarified why the Church lies where it does on the Plan. It is obvious that it had to be off-center. Had it been placed in the center of the Plan, the southernmost buildings of the Claustrum would have been moved to the southern edge of the monastery, leaving no room for the subsidiary claustral structures, such as the Monks' Bake and Brew House, the Mill, and the Mortar. But what determined the exact distance by which the axis of the Church was to be off-center? If we assume that the monastery site was calculated as an oblong, sixteen 40-foot modules long and twelve 40-foot modules wide, the entire monastery site could be conceived as having been inscribed into a grid of twelve supersquares, each formed by four 40-foot squares, and therefore measuring 160 × 160 feet (fig. 63). Within the linear frame of reference established by such a grid the difficult problem of the axial position of the Church—incomprehensible in terms of the layout of the Roman castrum, with which it has frequently been compared—would find a surprisingly simple explanation. The axis of the Church would coincide with the first, the axis of the Refectory with the second of the two longitudinal lines of the grid. The same grid would also explain the transverse division of the monastery into its four principal building sites: A western zone, accommodating the houses for livestock and their keepers and two houses to take care of the knights and servants who travel in the emperor's following; A central zone, of twice the surface area of the western zone, accommodating the Church, the Claustrum, and all of the buildings that lie to the north and south of this complex; An eastern zone, coequal in surface area with the western zone, accommodating the Novitiate and the Infirmary, the Cemetery, and several other installations. The western and eastern group of buildings are each inscribed into a surface area formed by three 160-foot squares; the central block of buildings extends over six. DIAGRAM I THE SEQUENCE OF PROGRESSIVE DICHOTOMY USED IN THE SCHEME OF MEASUREMENTS EMPLOYED IN THE DESIGN AND DRAWING OF THE PLAN The standard module, 2½ feet, is obtained by successively halving the large module (40 feet) four times. The value of the exponent, column B, indicates the number of times that the number 40 has been halved. The procedure shown here that yields successively smaller units of measurement, decreasing from 40 feet to 2½ feet by successive halving is "reversible," and is reversible by the same pattern of geometric progression shown here, but in the "opposite" direction yielding progressively larger values. Thus larger modules, multiples of 40 feet, such as 160 feet and 640 feet, are evolved from the same standard module and using the same pattern of development. This is illustrated on the opposite page in Diagram II. In Diagram II one can visualize the grand symmetry of the scheme of measures by which the design of the Plan was ordered and controlled. For example, 640 is symmetrically disposed with respect to 2½ about the sacred number 40 taken as a pivot or point of origin. In the pattern of such a formula, the infinitely great and the infinitely small participate with equal significance, in a scheme, it seemed, of divine order. The crossing square, four equal sides each of 40 feet, indeed defined a holy space. Forty, the number of greatest value in the series of NUMERI SACRI, was chosen by the designer of the Plan of St. Gall as that dimension in feet for the crossing square of the Church, the holy space unsurpassed in meaning and felicity to all inhabitants of the monastery. It was clearly discernible from tracing drafts, in our study of the Plan, that 160 feet, four times forty, was the major module of the Plan. This is the largest measure which is a common multiple of the Plan. Four units of this module, or 640 feet, is the length of the Plan, and three units of this module, or 480 feet, is the width of the Plan. The reason that the 160-foot module, four times the 40-foot dimension of the crossing square, was chosen as a module may be understood by perusing Diagrams I and II, giving attention to the numerical sequences in columns A, B, C, in each figure. Diagram I portrays a progression of halving starting with the 40-foot module and DESCENDING to 2½ feet. Diagram II starts out with the 40-foot module, extends the geometric series in the opposite upward direction by doubling. The values obtained by doubling, from 40 to 160, correspond at each level of ascent, to the smaller values obtained by the descent from 40 to 2½ feet. The bar elements of Diagram II illustrate the progression graphically: however, it is Column B that cogently reveals the homogeneity of the numerical relationships as a scheme that established the intrinsic pattern of measurements used in the Plan of St. Gall. DIAGRAM II THE SUPERMODULE, 160 FEET, ITS DERIVATIVES, 640 FEET AND 480 FEET, AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE LARGE MODULE † 640 is the "height" or east-west dimension of the Plan * 480 feet, the "width," or north-south dimension of the Plan, is an element in this geometric progression. It is derived by taking the sum of the two elements of the progression 320 &amp; 160, or 3 × 160. With sacred numbers 3 and 4 as multipliers and 160 as a multiplicand, 480 and 640 emerge as the dimensions, in feet, of the Plan. Sacred numbers, NUMERI SACRI, are treated extensively under I.17, page 118; see also remarks, caption, page 109. We noticed that, out of the scared number 40, the values of 2½, 10, 40, 160, 640 are generated by exponential values of 4, 2, 0, -2, -4. Although the more sophisticated notation of Column B was probably not common knowledge in the 9th century, the notation of Column C was understandable. There is no magic in this simple observation. But it is apparent that the multiplier 4, operating on 40 and yielding 160 was not chosen by caprice. A module less than 40 facilitated the arduous work of design. The number 480, 3 times 160, is not one of the natural steps of the progression between 2½ and 40, as shown in DIAGRAM II. This strongly suggests that the CAUSA PRIMA of the dimension system of the Plan was the longitudinal axis of the Plan of the Church, extended to east and west to satisfy designing a plan of paradigmatic significance and future influence. The axis of the Church was extended one module of 160 feet to the east (of the front line of the altar of St. Paul) and one module of 160 feet to the west of the entrance to the covered walk of the west paradise. This established the length of the Plan, four modules of 160 feet or 640 feet. One module of 160 feet north of the axis and two modules of 160 feet south of the axis gives three modules of 160, or 480 feet, the width of the Plan. That the dimensions of the Plan are in the proportion of 3 to 4 was more than good theology. The numbers 3, 4, and 5 are the key to accurate construction of a rectangle in land surveying and in building construction. E. B. THE CAROLINGIAN MEASURE AND SCALE USED IN DESIGNING THE PLAN On the basis of the calculations listed below we compute the length of the foot used in designing the Plan to have these equivalents: In English and U.S. standard measure: 1′ ?″. In metric measure: 32.07cm This computation can only be understood as an approximation of the real Carolingian foot that the draftsman of the Plan himself used. The computation must be corrected, first by the diminution in size to which the parchment was subjected through shrinkage throughout the ages of its existence, and second, minor distortions caused by shrinkage of photographic elements in development, or of the paper on which the facsimile was printed, during drying. Our computation of the "foot of the Plan" as reflected in the Löpfe-Benz facsimile is based on an analysis of the longest clearly measurable dimension shown on the drawing, namely the span extending from the center of the arcade columns that stand at the entrance wall of the church to the center of the columns that form the easternmost boundary of the crossing square. This span encompasses five and one-half 40-foot squares and consequently represents a length of 220 "Plan feet". Owing to uneven shrinkage or irregularities in the drawing this distance varies slightly depending on whether it is measured along the axis of the northern, or of the southern row of nave arcades. Using an engine-divided scale of good manufacture with 16 divisions to the inch based on the U.S. standard foot (identical with the British standard foot) we arrive at the following figures: 231 + 232/2 = average value = 231.5 units (measure on south row = 232 units of 1/16 inch, measure on north row = 231 units) 231.5/220 = 1.05227 feet—12? inches—32.067 cm This is the measure of the foot of the Plan. [computation: 12 inches = 30.480 cm. ? inch = 1.587 cm/32.067 cm] THE 1¼-FOOT MODULE (SUBMODULE) There is good reason to assume that in certain installations the inventor of the scheme made use of a submodule by halving his standard module of 2½ feet, thus arriving at the smallest module of 1¼ feet. I refer to this unit as a "submodule" because it is used sparingly, in contrast to the 2½-foot unit which is used as a standard module throughout the length and width of the Plan. I have pointed out that 2½ feet is one sixteenth of 40, the width assigned to the nave of the Church; 1¼ is one thirty-second of this measure. The peculiar values 2½ and 1¼—strange to anyone accustomed to working with a metric scale—will ring a more familiar tone if it is remembered that these units correspond to 30 and 15 inches. The Plan contains a number of installations which cannot be explained in any other manner than on the assumption that they have been constructed on a 1¼-foot module. We have already encountered it in our analysis of the Dormitory p. 80 (fig. 60). The most convincing evidence for the use of the submodule, however, is in the Monks' Vegetable Garden p. 88 (fig. 64). The Garden covers a surface area that is twenty-one standard 2½-foot units wide and thirty-three standard 2½-foot units long (52½ × 82½ feet). It consists of two rows of planting beds, nine on either side, made accessible by a carefully designed system of paths: three running lengthwise, ten crosswise. The planting beds are 5 feet wide and 20 feet long. The width of the crosspaths by which they are separated is less than 5 feet but more than 2½ feet. The only logical way to relate nine planting beds 5 feet in width to ten paths the width of which is less than 5 and more than 2½ feet within the available surface area, is to assume that the draftsman conceived this layout within a grid of squares of one-half the value of his standard square, i.e., a submodule of 1¼ feet. This module would allow him to develop the respective width of the planting beds and the paths with absolute precision, lengthwise in the simple sequence of 3 · 4 · 3 · 4 · 3 · 4 · 3 · 4 · 3 · 4 · 3 · 4 · 3 · 4 · 3 · 4 · 3 · 4 · 3, and crosswise in the sequence of 3 · 16 · 4 · 16 · 3. The 1¼-foot module is also used in the Kitchen and Bath houses of the Novitiate and the Infirmary (fig. 65). These buildings are each nine by eighteen of the 2½-foot modules. They are internally divided into two coequal squares of nine by nine 2½-foot modules, one containing the Bath House, the other the Kitchen. The hearth in each of these two installations forms a square that is composed of four 2½-foot modules. To place a square of four 2½-foot modules concentrically into the interior of a square of eighty-one 2½-foot modules is possible only within the framework of a 1¼-foot grid. In such a grid each side of the Kitchen and Bath House would be graduated into eighteen units of 1¼ feet. The position of the hearth could be struck off with absolute precision in the sequence 7 · 4 · 7; the position of the bath tubs, with their diameter of three submodules, in the sequence 2 · 3 · 2 within the squares of seven submodules left in the four corners. There are four or five more buildings on the Plan—not counting several smaller areas here and there—in which the submodule appears to have been employed (Abbot's House, House for Distinguished Guests, cloisters of the Infirmary and the Novitiate, and possibly the Refectory), but to interpret how exactly it was used in each case is difficult because the module is so small. A distance of 1¼ feet on the Plan amounts to not much more than twice the thickness of the stroke of the quill with which the Plan was drawn. Since the lines were traced without the aid of a straightedge, even the slightest irregularity in the movement of the hand would tend to blur the intent of the original scheme. Therefore, rather than weakening the argument by interpreting details which may be susceptible to different solutions, I should like to confine myself to establishing that this module was used by focusing on those areas in which its existence can be clearly demonstrated. I.14.4 THE SCALE OF THE PLAN AND ITS RELATION TO THE CAROLINGIAN FOOT Having established that the Plan was drawn to a consistent scale we must then ask whether this scale was invented for this specific purpose, or whether it was related to any regular Carolingian system of measurement. I believe that the original scheme of the Plan of St. Gall was drawn with a regular Carolingian straightedge, 40 Carolingian inches long, and that the designer of the scheme established the overall dimensions of the monastery site by assigning to it a length of 40 and a width of 30 Carolingian inches. The modern English foot is the equivalent of 30.48 cm. The classical Roman foot was 29.60 cm. The Carolingian foot was larger and, despite Charlemagne's attempt to standardize weights and measures, appears to have been afflicted by a good deal of regional variation. Kutsch, Schmidt, and Behn in measuring Carolingian churches believed that they were able to establish its length as 34.00 cm.; Hanftmann and Arens as 33.29 cm.; Rave as 33.3033.50 cm.; and Doppelfeld as 30.04 cm.50 50 Kutsch, I, 1928, 94ff; Schmidt, 1932, 32ff; Behn, 1934, passim.; Hanftmann, 1930, 229ff; Arens, 1938, 41ff; Rave, 1957, 52ff; Doppelfeld, 1948, 12. The studies of Felix Kreusch51 51 Kreusch, 1966, 463-533. and Leo Hugot52 52 Hugot, 1966, 534-72. suggest that the Palace Chapel at Aachen was built on a Carolingian foot whose length corresponded to 33.30 cm. This is the exact equivalent of the old Drusian foot, which the agrimensor Hyginus tells us was in use in the territory of the Tungri53 53 "Item dicitur in Tungris pes Druhianus, qui habet monetalem pedem et sescunciam." Hyginus, De Limitibus constituendis, ed. W. Goes (Amsterdam, 1674), 210. and which Drusus adopted from the Belgians as a northern standard for the border settlements of the Agri Decumates. This foot, two digits longer than the Roman foot, appears to have been the traditional standard measure of the Franks and may have formed the base of the commonest building foot used in medieval France and England.54 54 Thus according to Sir William M. Flinders Petrie, in his article "Weights and Measures, Ancient," Encyclopaedia Britannica, XXIII, London, 1967, 378: "It connects with the base of the English land measure . . . was the commonest building foot in medieval England (13.2 inches). It was also the basis for French architecture, the canne (of 78.24 inches) or six feet of 13.04 inches." 67. PLAN OF ST. GALL No other drawing shows the unique conceptual elegance of modular design to any higher degree of purity and perfection: the dimensioning of the two intersecting spatial volumes of nave and transept as multiples of a 40-foot square, and determination of the width of the aisle in an ingenious division of the 40-foot measure (16 modules of 2½ feet) as is shown in figure 67. Possibly, in a preliminary draft of the Plan, the aisle had been taken by the designer as one half of the nave width. This could account for the inscription PEDUM XX (see caption for figure 68). Further consideration, probably of a pragmatic nature, resulted in the aisle width adopted, 3 + 3 + 3 units—3 modules for the width of the aisle altars and 3 modules clearance space on each side of each altar. This method of division gave a splendid trinity of threes, with 7 modules left over, all in admirable conformity with St. Augustine's admonition on number (page 118). This illustrates well how a scheme of modularity can be selectively manipulated to yield relationships of some complexity, variety and interest, quite removed from unmitigated repetition of the same measure, inherent in a grid of equal divisions. The grid can be banal, but it need not be. Imaginative manipulation of the sacred number dogma as seen here, while not exactly typical practice, besides revealing cognition of alternatives to monometric schematism, responds to exigencies of a situation. Theology, liturgy, convenience, amenity, and structure, needed to be resolved in an effective layout, and were. Figure 67 notes the concept as it existed in the author's mind before modifications that would have to be made in places where a purely intellectual concept—easy to express in a simple line drawing—came into conflict with progmatic realities such as allowances for wall thickness. Such conflict was inevitable where two buildings shared a common wall in which case the space needed for masonry would have to be subtracted from the interior of these buildings rather than from the open areas around them. STEP 1: CONSTRUCTION OF THE LAYOUT OF THE MONASTERY CHURCH The foot used in the Plan of St. Gall, if calculated on its present dimensions, amounted to 32.16 cm. However, attention must be drawn to the fact that the parchment on which the Plan is drawn was subject to a considerable amount of shrinkage. Even today, as Dr. Duft has observed, when displaying the Plan in its showcase, the surface of the parchment expands and contracts in response to the changing humidity content of the air. Konrad Hecht, who has made some interesting observations on this subject55 55 K. Hecht, 1965, 194-97; in an interesting paragraph entitled "Das Schwindmass des Planes." estimates the mean loss by shrinkage to which the Plan was exposed through the ages to be 5 to 6 percent. If we modify the figure obtained from the present shrunken surface of the Plan by this quotient, the metric equivalent of the Carolingian foot which was used in the Plan is more likely to have been around 34.00 cm., which would conform to the findings of Kutsch, Schmidt, and Behn. It could equally well have been the exact equivalent of the old Drusian foot of 33.30 cm., which appears to have been the historical prototype of the Carolingian foot. Tabulated in their respective order of magnitude, the relation of the graduations shown on the straightedge used in designing the Plan to the actual dimensions for which they stood are as follows: 1. Dimensions of the entire monastery site: 30 × 40 Carolingian inches = 480 × 640 feet. 2. Super module: 10 × 10 Carolingian inches = 160 × 160 feet. 3. Large module: 2½ × 2½ Carolingian inches = 40 × 40 feet. 4. Standard module: one sixteenth of 2½ Carolingian inches (i.e., one sixteenth of 40 feet) = 2½ feet. 5. Submodule: one thirty-second of 2½ Carolingian inches = 1¼ feet. It should be noted that the value of the crossing square (2½ Carolingian inches square) is developed from the value of the next largest module (10 Carolingian inches square) in the same manner in which the value of the small unit (one sixteenth of 2½ Carolingian inches) is developed from the crossing square: by the method of binary section. All the surface calculations of the scheme are determined, accordingly, by a geometrical ground relationship in which each smaller base value is calculated as one sixteenth of the superordinate value: the large module (40 feet square) is one sixteenth of the super module (160 feet square), the small module (2½ feet square) one sixteenth of the large module (40 feet square). In handling these modules, the designing architect displayed an extraordinary sense of discretion, using each for its specific purpose: the super module (160 feet square) for the calculation of the overall relationship of the site, the location of the axis of the Church, and the grouping of the principal building masses (fig. 63); the large module (40 p. 86 feet square) for the square schematism of the Church and Claustrum (fig. 61); the small module for all dimensions that were too small to be expressed by any of the larger modules (figs. 59 and 60). pp. 78, 80 The Plan is drawn to a scale in which one foot on the ground corresponds to one sixteenth of a Carolingian inch on the parchment (which corresponds roughly to the metric scale of 1:200), a ratio that one would consider even today ideal for a plan of this kind, as it allows for easy readability of details without obscuring primary values. Figure 66A-D shows all of these relationships coordi- p. 94 nated on a straightedge that would correspond to one-fortieth of the yardstick of 40 Carolingian linear inches, which we presume the drafter of the Plan used in designing the scheme. See also Diagrams I, II, pages 92 and 93, above. I.14.5 PURPOSEFUL MODIFICATIONS One of the remarkable qualities of the planner of the scheme of St. Gall is that, although he exhibits an extraordinary sense of sophistication in the working out of modular relationships, he does not hesitate to modify his schematism when special conditions so require. I have already alluded to this fact in my discussion of the 40-foot module. There are two deviations from the use of this module, which call for an explanation. One of these is that accurate measurement of the aisles of the Church shows them to be not 20 feet wide as their explanatory title requests (latitudo utriusque porticus pedum xx) but 22½ feet; the other is that the Dormitory and the Refectory extend in places as much as 5 feet southward over the 40-foot grid of the Claustrum (figs. 61 and 62). What caused these modular incongruities? Are they due to the carelessness of the copyist? Or are they purposeful modifications? The latter possibility was suggested by Arens, the former by Poeschel. Arens thought that the surplus in the width of each aisle owed its existence to the draftsman's desire to provide enough space for the thickness of the walls of the church.56 56 Arens, 1938, 63-64. Poeschel contends that since the draftsman makes no concessions to the thickness of the walls at any other place, it would be illogical to expect him to do so here.57 57 Poeschel, 1957, 28; 1961, 14; and in Studien, 1962, 28. Although Poeschel's argument is not to be dismissed lightly, I am inclined to agree with Arens. We cannot infer from the fact that the drafter of the Plan rendered the walls of his buildings as simple lines that he was unaware of the difficulties that might arise from this method of rendering the more congested areas of the Plan unless they were forestalled by special provisions from the very start. In the case 68. PLAN OF ST. GALL A comparison of this with the preceding figure shows how the draftsman, in developing his final version of the plan of the Church, modified the square schematism of the original concept—in which the aisles (PEDUM XX) were assigned a width of exactly one half of the width of the nave—by moving the aisle walls one 2½foot module further outward. An instrument-drawn grid of auxiliary lines, similar to the one above, enabled the architect to plot the bases of nave columns, as well as the location of altars and all other Church furnishings with a precision so great that their exact dimensional values were not lost in the freehand tracing to which the Plan of St. Gall owes its existence. The lines of the Plan as drawn on the parchment vary considerably in width from less than 1/32 to over 1/16 of an inch, representing, at the scale of the document, less than 6 inches to more than a foot. These widths do not relate in any way to actual wall thicknesses. The draftsman had a clear notion of line in the abstract Euclidean sense of defining the limits of an area. The lines comprise a diagram drawn to scale with astonishing accuracy. As an instrument of communication it transmits, at this scale and at this stage in the evolution of the Plan, all that can be expected of any plan at this stage. It is a graphic image delivering a message concerned with policy and concept. Wall thicknesses of structures as they might take shape in the future were irrelevant in mind of the drafter and to the purpose. Quite possibly he did have some vague notion that certain structures or parts of them might be of masonry, wood, or metal, according to the traditions of the time. Uppermost in his thoughts was the message. In viewing the purpose of the Plan in this light, as a paradigmatic delineation of Benedictine planning policy for a "model" monastic establishment, the Plan stands on its own, without embroidery of detail that would come with development by others for a particular site. The Plan is capable of interpretation in more than one way, and that was part of its intent. If the Plan is interpreted today, in this way, or that way, we are doing no different than what was intended. It is this capacity of the Plan to stir the imagination almost 13 centuries after it was drawn in the Scriptorium at Reichenau that is among its remarkable characteristics, a property common to all great works of art. E.B. STEP 2: CONCEPTUAL GROWTH OF THE LAYOUT OF THE MONASTERY CHURCH of the freestanding buildings, the linear style of the draftsman posed no problems as the space required for the wall thicknesses in subsequent construction could easily be borrowed from the open yard surrounding the building, and did not have to be subtracted from the building itself. But where a group of major masonry buildings butted against each other, as in the case of the Church and the adjacent claustral structures (fig. 61), the problem was serious. Here the builder would have been forced to borrow the space that he needed for the masonry either from the interior of the Church or from the contiguous gallery of the cloister, where spatial congestion was undesirable, since this gallery, besides serving as a passageway, was used for the daily assembly of the monks in chapter. To obviate these contingencies the designer introduced two safety measures: first, by increasing the width of the aisles of the Church from 20 to 22½ feet; second, by enlarging the contiguous cloister walk from 12½ feet (the width of the other three wings of the Cloister) to 15 feet. Without changing his style of rendering he thus interposed a safety area 5 feet wide along the crucial line of encounter of Church and Claustrum. He left it to the builder to determine precisely what the thickness of the walls should be but freed him from the need of invading any of the adjacent spaces with his masonry as the building went up. It is obvious that the insertion of this safety margin between the Church and Claustrum would affect the layout of the latter as well as its relation to the square grid. Thus the cloister yard, instead of measuring 100 × 100 feet, covers a surface area of 100 × 102½ feet; the Dormitory, instead of measuring 40 × 80 feet, as one would expect in the light of the 40-foot module, measures 40 × 85 feet; in consequence all the buildings lying at the southern edge of the claustral grid extend 5 feet beyond the southern boundary of that grid. On the north side of the Church it was equally undesirable that any usable space be sacrificed to wall construction. Here, too, the required space would have had to be subtracted from either the Church or the contiguous Lodgings for the Visiting Monks, the Master of the Outer School, and the Porter. I.14.6 SUCCESSIVE STAGES IN THE CONCEPTUAL GROWTH OF THE LAYOUT OF CHURCH AND CLAUSTRUM If the observations on the modular basis of the Plan presented in the preceding paragraphs of this chapter are correct, the procedure followed in the construction of the layout of the Church and the Claustrum can be reconstructed as follows: p. 96 Step 1 (fig. 67): The draftsman first constructed the grid of 40-foot squares which determined the overall dimensions of the Church. This grid established the boundaries of the nave, the transept, and the choir, as well as those of the two subsidiary contiguous spaces of the Sacristy and the Scriptorium. The transept was composed of three, the nave of four and one-half 40-foot squares. The introduction of an extra half-square in the nave was inevitable, if the draftsman started from the premise that his church should be 300 feet long. The columns of the nave arcades were plotted at a distance of 20 feet, so that each second column came to coincide with one of the corners of its corresponding 40-foot square. The width of the aisles, at that stage, was meant to be half the width of the nave, i.e., 20 feet. Step 2 (fig. 68): In working on the internal layout of the Church, the draftsman was aware that an acute shortage of space would occur in actual construction if no allowance was made for the thickness of the aisle walls where the Church was abutted by other masonry structures. He took account of this contingency by moving the center line of his aisle walls 2½ feet further out and producing the safety strip previously mentioned. Within the schematic floor space of the church created in this manner, he could now map out the foundations for his columns and altars by a system of auxiliary construction lines which divided the Church lengthwise in the sequence 5 · 15 · 5 · 15 · 5 · 15 · 5 · 15 · 5 · 15 · 5 · 15 · 5 · 15 · 5 · 15 · 5 · 15 and crosswise in the sequence 5 · 5 · 7½ · 5 · 5 · 12½ · 10 · 12½ · 5 · 5 · 7½ · 5 · 5 The altar screens in the aisles are inscribed into 7½-foot squares, the altars in the nave, the ambo, and the baptismal font into 10-foot squares. The system of auxiliary construction lines shown in figure 68 is the minimum required for the internal layout of the Church. Had the wall thickness been inked in as solid bars, the Church would have appeared as shown in figure 56. This is the manner in which it was interpreted by Graf, Ostendorf, and Gall, and it is interesting to note that this concept can be translated into the language of a modern architectural drawing without sustaining the slightest distortion. Had the designer of the Church intended to draw the Plan in this manner, it would have been fully within the scope of his capabilities. If he confined himself to the more abstract procedure of simple linear definition, it probably was because he had the task of designing the layout of not just a church, but an entire monastery comprised of a multitude of buildings of greatly varying dimensions, where the drawing out of wall thicknesses would have introduced unnecessary complications. Step 3 (fig. 69): After the floor plans of the Church were completed, the draftsman could lay out the cloister yard with a relatively simple system of auxiliary lines, inheriting from the 69. PLAN OF ST. GALL STEP 3: CONSTRUCTION OF CLOISTER YARD. METHOD USED IN DEVELOPING LAYOUT OF YARDS AND WALKS Our analysis of the cloister yard reveals an intense preoccupation not only with the mystique of the square, but also with sacred numbers 3, 4, 10, 40 (see pp. 118-25). The cloister yard is inscribed in a 100-foot square within which is inscribed a 75-foot square, which in turn accommodates in its center a 20-foot square. The sides of each are respectively, 40, 30, and 10 standard 2½-foot modules. The porch arches, arranged in groups of 4, are each inscribed in a 5-foot square (area: 4 standard modules); the passages between them into rectangles 4 modules wide and 3 high. Church, of course, the five-foot displacement from the superordinate grid of 40-foot squares which transmitted itself to all of the contiguous structures (Dormitory, Refectory, and Cellar). The cloister yard was designed to cover a surface area 100 feet square, and as a strip 12½ feet wide was taken off on either side for the covered walk (15 feet in the north), a surface area 75 feet square was left for the open pratellum in the center. Arches which open into the latter from the center of each covered walk are 10 feet wide and 7½ feet high, while the galleried openings on either side measure 5 × 5 feet, leaving in the corners a solid piece of masonry 7½ feet long. The square in the center of the pratellum measures 20 feet on each side. I.14.7 DIFFICULT OR INSOLUBLE FEATURES Although the Plan of St. Gall reflects the original scheme with an amazing accuracy, the irregularities that slipped into the design as it was traced through the opaque body of the sheets of parchment created a number of problems that are hard to settle and may have to remain unsolved. Foremost among these are certain aspects in the layout of the Cellar, the Scriptorium, and the Medicinal Garden. THE CELLAR In contrast to the Dormitory and the Refectory, to which it corresponds in all other respects, the great monastic Cellar, which lies on the western side of the cloister yard, is not 40 feet wide, but has a width that ranges somewhere between 35 and 37½ feet (fig. 70.A-C). The building is firmly drawn except for its western long wall, which swerves inward and is a little more shaky than the draftsman's average line. Its curve runs parallel to a seam that fastens two sheets of parchment and it looks as though its wriggling and swerving course owed its existence to the copyist's desire to avoid this seam. Had the copyist drawn the western long wall at the exact distance of 40 feet from the opposite wall, he would have had to superimpose the line that defines the course of that wall on the seam for a considerable distance, running his quill over the projecting loops of the thread. It appears probable to me that it was the wish to avoid this complication that pushed the line of the western long wall of the Cellar further inward. By how much he displaced this line, the draftsman could not even judge at this point, as the overlapping edges of the two connecting sheets of parchment which separated him from the original prevented him from actually seeing the corresponding line of the prototype plan. The layout of the remaining portions of the Cellar presents no problem. The dimensions of the barrels, both small and large, as well as of all the interstices between them, are multiples of the 2½-foot module (fig. 70.C). The small barrels are 10 feet long and have a central diameter of 5 feet. Their outside curvatures are struck with a radius of 12½ feet. The large barrels are 15 feet long and have a central diameter of 10 feet. Their stave curvatures are struck with a radius of 15 feet. The rails on which the small barrels rest are 5 feet apart. The distance between the rails of the large barrels is 7½ feet. SCRIPTORIUM &amp; NORTHERN TRANSEPT ARM An irregularity which, I confess, I cannot solve, is found in the dimensions of the northern transept arm and of the adjacent Scriptorium (fig. 61). Both of these spaces should be 40 feet square, but are slightly less. In order to be 40 feet square the head wall of the northern transept and the adjoining wall of the Scriptorium would have had to project by 2½ feet beyond the line of the outer wall of the Rooms for the Visiting Monks, which abut the northern aisle of the Church. Yet the Plan does not show such a projection. Is this through error of the copyist? Or was it a purposeful modification undertaken by the drafter of the prototype plan? I am inclined to assume the former, as only a 40-foot square would provide for a symmetrical layout of the transept and a consistent arrangement in the windows and writing desks along the northern and eastern wall of the Scriptorium. However, one cannot be sure of this. In general, the designer strove for symmetry, but to contend that he did so without exception is a different matter. THE MEDICINAL GARDEN A third case difficult to settle is the apparent displacement of the Medicinal Garden (fig. 62). It lies in the northeastern corner of the monastery site, but is out of line with the protruding outhouses and hypocaust flues of the Novitiate and the Infirmary. It was the last installation to be drawn on the sheet containing all the buildings lying to the east of the Church. I can explain its peculiar position only by the assumption that the copyist lost space through an accumulation of small irregularities, as he drew the last row of buildings near the right-hand edge of sheet 4 in the sequence, House for Bloodletting, House of the Physicians, Medicinal Garden. THE HOUSES FOR THE COWS AND THE FOALING MARES The dimensions of the houses for the cows and the foaling mares can only be guessed at, as the narrowing of the parchment at the southwestern corner of the monastery forced the copyist to decrease the size of these two houses along the southern edge of the monastery site (above, p. 48f.; figs. 483 and 487). To what extent it is impossible to say. I.14.8 CONCLUSIONS The foregoing analysis of the construction methods employed in the Plan of St. Gall should dispel, once and for all, the widespread belief that medieval architectural drawings were not made "to scale."58 58 See above, p. 77 n.1. In contradiction to traditionally 70. PLAN OF ST. GALL. MONKS' CELLAR The swerving uncertain ductus of the line which defines the position of the western long wall of the Cellar (inconsistent with the firmness of the drawing elsewhere in the Plan), as well as departure from the correct position of this line (not 40 but 35-37 1/2 feet distant from the opposite wall) is conditioned, in our opinion, by two factors: 1. This line is drawn where the overlapping margins of two connecting sheets of parchment (sheets 1 and 2; cf. above, pp. 35-37 and p. 34, Fig. 24.A) which, because of their thickness, made it impossible for the draftsman to see the corresponding lines of the prototype plan as he traced it; and because 2. the draftsman tried to avoid the stitching by which the two sheets were sewn together (shown in grey tint within the margin of the parchment) and which his quill would have had to straddle had he drawn the line at its proper geometrical position. (Cf. fig. 235, p. 286, and caption.) A. Facsimile reproduction of the red drawing of the Plan (see caption, page 13, vol. III) B. Same with 2½-foot module grid superimposed C. Possible scheme by which the layout shown in A was constructed prevailing views—but in confirmation of certain observations made by Boeckelmann and Arens—this analysis demonstrates that the author of the original scheme of the Plan availed himself not only of a clearly definable scale, but that he applied this scale throughout the entire layout of the Plan with full consistency and logic. From the methods employed in modern scale construction the Plan of St. Gall differs neither in the logic of its graduations, nor in the truthfulness with which this graduation reflects the variations of the rendered object. From the methods of modern scale construction the Plan of St. Gall differs in two points only: first, in the fact that it flows from a basically modular type of thinking; and second, that its basic working units are derived as fractions or multiples from a dimensional master value. If a modern architect assigns to a given area a value of 40 feet, he does so with the aid of a ruler, on which the value 40 is graduated into forty equal parts of one. On the scale of the Plan of St. Gall, quite differently, the magnitude 40, as is found, was not subdivided into forty units of one, but into sixteen units of 2½. Why the author of the Plan of St. Gall divided his 40-foot scale into 16 units of 2½ rather than into 40 units of one must by necessity remain a matter for speculation. The value 2½, as my colleague Hunter Dupree points out to me, was a fundamental unit of the English surveying system. Two and one-half feet is the length of the English pace (the space traversed by one step).59 59 On the English pace of 2½ feet (the distance measured from the heel of one foot to the heel of the other as it touched the ground in walking), see Murray, op. cit., sub verbo. The Roman pace (passus) was twice the length of the English pace, that is, five feet (the distance measured from the heel of one foot to the heel of the same foot when it touched the ground again). The Roman pace was internally divided into two gradus of 2½ which may have been the prototype of the medieval English pace. Gradus, in Classical Latin, is used both as a designation for a step taken in walking and as a designation for a step forming a tread or rung of a stair or ladder. On the Plan of St. Gall it appears in connection with seven steps (septum gradus) which lead from the crossing to the fore choir. It is amusing to note that their tread had a standard value of 2½ feet. See above, p. 89. (On the Roman passus, see Hultsch, 1862, 65ff and 1882, 79f). Attention should be drawn in this connection to the fact that in the elevations of at least two outstanding Carolingian buildings, the Palace Chapel at Aachen and the Gate House of the Abbey of Lorsch, the 2½ foot module is systematically used as a unit of measure (see Arens, 1938, 47 and 75 and for later examples, ibid., 95, 106 and 107; for more incidental use of the 2½ foot module see ibid., 14, 19, 27, 30, 32, and 43). Since these lines were written Hunter Dupree has deepened our knowledge on these relationships as well as their connection with later measuring systems in two illuminating studies, a summary of which will be found in Appendix III, Vol. III. Could it be that the 2½-foot standard module of the Plan of St. Gall was the equivalent of a traditional and widely used Carolingian pace? And that the superordinate modules of 40- and 160-foot squares were calculated as meaningful multiples of that pace? There are other historical factors which may have contributed to the genesis of such relationships. To subdivide a primary value of 40 into sixteen equal fractions (or to arrive at that value by multiplying sixteen times a primary value of 2½) as has been pointed out on the preceding pages, is one of the easiest and, for that reason, also the oldest operations of the human mind, requiring no other instrument than a straightedge and a compass (method of continuous halving or doubling). In chosing this procedure, the draftsman may also have been influenced by the eminently sacred connotations associated in his day with the two basic figures used in this operation, the figures 40 and 4. The choice of the figure 40 for the width of the nave can hardly be considered an accident. Forty was a number which in Biblical tradition had been associated for ages with periods of expectation and penitence. Forty were the days of the great primeval deluge, forty the years that the Hebrews spent in the desert, forty the days that Moses passed in expectation on Mount Sinai, forty the days announced by Jonah for the destruction of the city of Nineveh, forty the days that separated the Ascension from the Resurrection.60 60 On the sacredness of the number 40 see Roscher, 1909, 105ff; and Encyclopedia Cattolica, VII, 1952, col. 1996; Enciclopedia Italiana, XXV, 1935, 38; and Ursula Grossmann, 1954, 4-41. The biblical associations connected with the number 40 were so powerful as even to suggest a division of the hour into 40 moments. Bede, as Charles W. Jones points out to me, makes mention of both, a division of the hour into 40 and into 60 moments; but in a commentary to Bede's De temporibus ratione, perhaps written by Henri of Auxerre and quoted in several ninth-century manuscripts, the statement is made that the hour is divided into 40 moments: si vis partyri horam in ·xl· vel diem vel aliquid huiusmodi ipsa xl pars momenti nomen accepit, seniis xx, x momenta quadrans, xxx dodrans. (Jones, 1939, 98 (701-702).) For other manifestations of number symbolism on the Plan of St. Gall see the chapter "Numeri Sacri" below, pp. 18ff. Forty, it should be noted, is not only the width attributed on the Plan of St. Gall to the nave and the transept, but also the total number of buildings of which the monastery is composed. In halving this sacred figure four times in succession, the draftsman put into operation another eminently sacred figure, associated both in the pagan and the Christian tradition with the basic divisions of matter, time, and space: the four elements, the four seasons, the four rivers of Paradise, the four cardinal virtues, the four main prophets, the four evangelists. Whatever his reasons may have been (and I shall say more about the number symbolism of the Plan a little later) p. 118 in organizing the layout of his monastery in a manner in which all values could be expressed as multiples of 40 or as multiples of a fraction obtained by halving 40 four times, the draftsman provided his plan with a scale that could be read and applied by anybody who was familiar with the principles involved or who knew the formula. It is due to the relative largeness of its standard unit (2½ feet) that the Plan owes its easy readability, and that it could be traced upon another sheet of parchment without sustaining any serious loss in clarity and measurability. The development of a modular grid in which all superand subordinate units are derived in logical steps of progression or diminution from the dimensions of a controlling master module was an intellectual achievement of the highest order and a concept that was tragically corrupted when—(I presume at the second synod of Aachen, as the Plan was formally considered for adoption61 61 For more details on this hypothesis see the chapter Reflections about the Prototype Plan, and in particular pp. 29ff. )—it was decided that the length of the church should be reduced from 300 feet (as shown in the drawing) to 200 feet (as stipulated in the axial title of the church) and that the interstices of the arcades should be reduced from 20 feet (as shown in the drawing) to 12 feet (as stipulated in the title inscribed into the arcades). Like the number 40, the number 12 belongs to a traditional repertoire of sacred figures that formed a common currency of metaphor and analogy (the twelve Judaic tribes, the twelve apostles, the twelve months of the year, the twelve hours of the day, et cetera),62 62 For a fuller discussion of the problems touched upon here see the chapter on numeri sacri, below, pp. 118ff. that could be put into circulation on even the most precipitate call. But in contrast to 40, 12 as a dimension is not part of the modular grid of the Plan. Being neither a multiple nor a fraction of 40, it is clearly a foreign body in this system. In introducing this figure for a feature aesthetically as prominent as the arcades of the nave, the churchmen who prescribed this change demolished one of the most precious and most innovative aspects of the Plan: its square schematism. It is probable that we will never be able to establish who they were, these men,63 63 In Fulda it was the monks who first asked for restraint in the construction of a church which they considered to be "of inordinate size" and petitioned that the Abbot be directed to reduce the building program to normal proportions. The grievance was submitted to Charlemagne in A.D. 812 but fell on deaf ears. In 817 however the climate had changed and it became the leaders of the church who espoused this view and in implementing it deposed the abbot (see below, pp. 187ff). yet one thing is certain: they could not, in any manner, have been involved in the design process that went into the making of the original scheme— and they were worlds removed from understanding its unusual aesthetic merits. To shorten the church by 100 feet did not in itself require abandoning the modular scheme. It could have been done in increments of its own control module by the simple elimination of five 20-foot bays in the nave. But the stipulation that the interstices of the arcades be reduced from 20 to 12 feet forestalled any such possibility and effectively destroyed the system of squares in the church. The change was drastic, and, had it been implemented in the drawing, would have required the preparation of an entirely new Plan. We are faced here with a manifestation of the age-old conflict between architectural creativity and administrative control, with disastrous consequences for the former when the latter unwittingly becomes involved in the design process with decisions which, though not necessarily arbitrary, are nevertheless extraneous to the creative act and innocent of any knowledge of technical detail and planning. The author of the original scheme, if he was present at the gathering where these decisions were taken, must have gone through moments of shattering pain. He had produced a scheme of extraordinary conceptual subtleties including the design of a church which, had it ever been built, would have been one of the highlights of early medieval architecture (fig. 110). It took two-and-one-half centuries of further development in western architecture before the ideas first conceived here were embodied in some of the great Romanesque cathedrals of Europe.64 64 For more on this see below, pp. 231-38. I.14.9 CONFIRMING EVIDENCE: THE PALACE GROUNDS AT AACHEN We do not know whether or to what extent, if ever, the modular construction methods used on the Plan of St. Gall were implemented in any of the larger monasteries built or rebuilt during the reign of Louis the Pious. But one other site, a physical and historical reality, can be said to have been organized along similar lines: Charlemagne's Palace at Aachen. While Ernest Born and I were working on the Plan of St. Gall, Leo Hugot of Aachen made a meticulous dimensional survey of the palace grounds and its buildings. None knew of the other's work, which was simultaneously and for the first time displayed in 1965 at the Council of Europe Exhibition Karl der Grosse in Aachen, each in the form of a model, together with two brief explanatory statements that formed part of the official Exhibition Catalogue.65 65 For the Plan of St. Gall, see Horn, 1965, 402-10 ("Das Modell eines Karolingischen Idealkloster") and idem, 1965, 391-400 ("La Maquette d'après le plan de St. Gall"). For the Palace grounds at Aachen, see Hugot, ibid., 395-400 ("Die Pfalz Karls der Grossen in Aachen") and 385-390 ("Le palais de Charlemagne à Aix-la-Chapelle") as well as the more detailed and more comprehensive analysis in Hugot, 1966, 534-72. We acknowledge with profound gratitude Dr. Hugot's generosity in allowing us to make use of his original drawings in the preparation of the red overlays reproduced in figures 41.Y, 71.Y and 71.Za, b, c. Charlemagne's Palace at Aachen was established on the ground of an old Roman settlement that—like most other Roman provincial towns or military camps—was inscribed into a large rectangle, internally divided into four equal quarters by two streets intersecting each other at right angles, conditions that are even today mirrored in the course of certain streets of the city of Aachen (fig. 71.X). In the southeast corner of that rectangle were the famous hot springs, the amenities of which were one of the primary reasons for the selection of this site as the first "permanent" residence of the great ruler. In laying out his residence, Charlemagne did not follow the Roman dispositions blindly. He changed the alignment of his buildings so that the axis of the Palace Chapel would run from west to east, as the liturgy demanded, and since all of the other buildings of the Palace were either parallel or at right angles to the church, this system of building came to lie athwart, at an angle of 38 degrees, the Roman street system. As the Romans had done with their settlement, so Charlemagne also inscribed his residence and its buildings into an area of rectangular shape (fig. 71.Y). In laying out his grounds he availed himself, as the dimensional survey of the site by Leo Hugot shows, of a modular base value consisting of a rod 12 feet long. He placed the Palace Chapel (fig. 71.Y, 1) against the southern edge, the Audience Hall (fig. 71.Y, 5) against the northern edge of a large open square, each side of which had a length of 30 rods = 360 feet. Internally this square was composed of 16 smaller modules, each of which formed an equilateral square of 7 rods = 84 feet. The Palace grounds were intersected by two streets which crossed each other at right angles dividing the site into an outer and an inner court. These streets were each 2 rods broad = 24 feet, bringing each side of the square to a total of 30 rods = 360 feet. Hugot's analysis of the square grid of the Palace grounds (Hugot, 1965, fig. 2 facing p. 524) did not include the site of the Emperor's Audience Hall (fig. 71.Y, 5) or the site of the southern annex to the Palace Chapel; the so-called Secretarium (fig. 71.Y, 4). Ernest Born's analysis, superimposed in red on Hugot's plan shows that with these two buildings included, the whole of the Palace grounds could be conceived as being inscribed into a rectangle, measuring 30 rods in width (30 × 12 = 360 feet) and 52 rods in length (52 × 12 = 624 feet). He emphasizes in his caption to fig. 71.Y the importance of the use of the sacred numbers 3, 4, 10, 12, 30 and 40 in the construction of this grid. The proportions of the Palace Chapel, Hugot's analysis has shown, were as carefully and consistently regulated as the layout of the entire Palace grounds (figs. 71.Za, b, c). The base module, again, is a rod 12 feet long. The chapel itself was fitted into a square, each side of which measured 84 feet = 7 rods (fig. 71.Za). To this cube was added in the east a choir 24 feet deep (2 rods), and on the entrance side a westwork of identical depth. In the vertical plane the 84-foot cube reaches from ground floor to base of the pyramid. The total elevation is composed of: height of outer wall, 48 feet (4 rods); height of gallery roof, 12 feet (1 rod); height of drum, 24 feet (2 rods). The height of the pyramidal roof of the octagon, in this context (the original pyramid has disappeared) can only have measured 2 rods = 24 feet. The total height from the ground to the apex of the structure, accordingly would be 9 rods = 108 feet. This is not the time to go into the structural aesthetics of this important building.66 66 For a recent discussion of the Palace Chapel, see Kreusch, 1966, 463-533 where all previous literature is cited. But I cannot forego the pleasure of remarking on the implications Hugot's findings had with regard to our own work. First of all, it removed whatever residual doubt Ernest Born and I may still have entertained concerning the correctness of our interpretation of the Plan of St. Gall. Second, it added new weight to the arguments which we have advanced in a preceding chapter concerning the provenance of the original scheme from sources close to the Court School as well as to Bishop Hildebold, the titular head of that school (791-819). Bishop Hildebold's church at Cologne, as has been shown in a preceding chapter, served as model for the Church of the Plan of St. Gall.67 67 See our chapter "Speculations about the Prototype Plan," above, pp. 27ff. The site organization methods, which Leo Hugot has shown were used for the Palace of Aachen, are greatly akin in spirit to those which we have shown to have been used in the layout of the Plan of St. Gall. This kinship suggests that the designer of the latter was not only familiar with, but in all likelihood inspired by the former. He might even have had access to the original drawings used for the Palace grounds and its buildings. The importance of Leo Hugot's findings about the modular construction methods used in the layout of Charlemagne's Palace at Aachen can hardly be overemphasized. It is here for the first time in the history of medieval (and possibly Western) architecture and site organization that not only the grounds, but also the most important building on these grounds, the Palace Chapel, are controlled by a binding and all-pervasive rule of modular prime relationships. We shall return to this problem later on in a discussion of the possible historical roots of this concept.68 68 See our chapter "Square Schematism," below, pp. 212ff. AACHEN, PALACE CHAPEL. TRIBUNE DETAIL, BRONZE RAILING, CA. 800 Eight such railings, each 4 feet high and nearly 14 feet long, were each cast in one piece: an astonishing accomplishment of the Carolingian Renaissance. Roman grille work patterns, Byzantine acanthus leaves, and Hiberno-Saxon scroll-and-grid motifs are subsumed in a sophisticated medieval linearism. 71.X AACHEN: THE CITY CENTER. A CADASTRAL PLAN AFTER 1800 WITH CHARLEMAGNE'S PALACE GROUNDS Superimposed in red are the grounds and buildings of Charlemagne's Palace as well as the reconstructed street system of the Roman town of Aquae Granis (redrawn in part by Ernest Born, after Hugot, 1965, fig. 1 facing p. 534, and with the aid of Hugot's original drawing which he generously made available to us for that purpose). Like most Roman towns or military camps this settlement was internally divided into four quarters by two main arterials intersecting each other at right angles. The course of these, as Leo Hugot has shown, are recognizable in the street alignment of the modern city of Aachen. They are: from north to south, the alignment Kockerell Strasse—Klostergasse and Kleine Marschier Strasse (A-B); from west to east, the alignment Jakob Strasse and Grosse Koln-Strasse (C-D). The latter was part of a Roman road that led from Herleen to Kornelismünster into the Eifel Mountains; the former of a road that connected Liège with Julich and Cologne. The city of Aachen (French: Aix-la-Chapelle; Italian: Aquisgrana) owes its name to a Celtic settlement and sanctuary that had sprung up in the vicinity of a cluster of sulphur hot springs which the Romans after their conquest of this territory, in the first century A.D. converted into a watering place for legionaries, pensioners, and other civilians visiting or settling there for recreational purposes or for reasons of health. The Romans referred to this location as Aquae Granis = "the Waters of Granus" (a Celtic deity worshipped in connection with hot springs). In ancient times, as well as in the Middle Ages and up to our own days, this kind of spring was believed to have a curative effect on such afflictions as gout, arthritis and scrofula. At the collapse of the Roman empire the city of Aquae Granis was destroyed (presumably around 375) but the life of the native population appears to have continued. King Pepin bathed in the springs of Aachen in 765 and ordered the baths to be cleaned. Charlemagne signed deeds in AQUIS PALATIO PUBLICO in 768 and 769, and between 777 and 786 rebuilt and enlarged his father's palace. The site became his favourite winter residence from 794 onwards, a date which marks the turning point from ambulant government to rule from a central seat of government, at least during the winter months, the summers continuing to be taken up by warfare. Charlemagne furnished the site with a royal Audience Hall and a monumental Palace Chapel (fig. 71.Z), a residence for himself (location and details of construction unknown) as well as a considerable number of lesser buildings to house his court as well as his bodyguards. The Palace, as was to be expected, gave rise to the growth of a vast cluster of subsidiary establishments, mainly to the north and to the west of the royal court, and acquired the appearance of the town when all of these VICI, together with the Palace, were surrounded in 1172-1176 with a wall by order of Emperor Frederic Barbarossa. 71.Y SITE PLAN OF THE EMPEROR'S AUDIENCE HALL AND THE PALACE CHAPEL AT AACHEN, BUILT BETWEEN 796 and 804 KEY TO NUMBERS OF PLAN 1.

ENTRANCE HALL at ground level connects the OUTER COURT with the INNER COURT 7. BARRACKS for the emperor's guard Superimposed on Hugot's drawing of a part of the Emperor's Palace at Aachen is shown the rectangular schematism on which its plan is based. The basic module, as Hugot's dimensional survey of the site has demonstrated, measures 12 feet. Seven basic modules comprise one major unit. The length of the plan is 7 major units, plus 2 basic modules for the east-west street, plus 1 basic unit for the projection of the north apse of the Emperor's Audience Hall. Thus the length of the rectangle is 7 × 7 plus 3 units, or 52 units; its width is 4 × 7 units plus 2 units, or 30 units—a rectangle 624 feet long by 360 feet wide. What captures our attention is the prevailing scheme of numerical and space relationships. The sacred numbers 3, 4, and 7, with 10, 12, and 40, represent values of measurement that govern or control lines and critical grid relationships and are suffused into the fabric of the plan to form interrelated kinships. For example, the length of the plan, 52 units, saturated with 75 [(7 × 7) + 3] is the sum of 40 plus 12. The width of the plan, 30 units, is the product of 3 × 10 and, with 12 as a multiplier, creates 360 feet [(3 + 3 + 3) × 40]. Such a collection of NUMERI SACRI offers striking evidence of the presence of sacred numbers as a dominating influence in the mind of the Carolingian planner at the heart of the Empire, at this period in the development of western civilization. The aesthetic consequences of this pervasive geometric and numerical schematism is another and different problem. Too, it is not without interest that the 3-4-5 triangular relationship for the formation of a right angle is consonant with the 12-foot grid and would facilitate, in the field, layout for building foundations. In monumental building schemes in particular, and all building in general, this would be advantageous to both the architect and his director and construction foreman on the site. Thus, rectangular schematism, identifiable with esoteric sacred numbers, was well-tailored in some respects to the practical needs of a builder whose responsibilities, far removed from finely woven webs of theology, were characterized by mundane objectives, intolerant of hocus-pocus. E. B. 71.Za AACHEN, PALACE CHAPEL, BUILT BETWEEN 796 and 804 PLAN AND ELEVATIONS BY LEO HUGOT GRID SUPERIMPOSED BY AUTHORS The interesting and developmentally crucial significance of Leo Hugot's discovery of modular principles governing the organization of the Palace Chapel at Aachen is its demonstration, by implication, that even a centrally planned Carolingian building cannot escape the power of transformation which, at the age of Charlemagne, converts the Early Christian basilica into a modular structure. The design of the Palace Chapel at Aachen is based on that of the church of San Vitale at Ravenna, begun around 532 and finished in 546. In both buildings the shape and composition of the primary spaces as well as the formation of the basic morphological features are essentially the same. In each case a tall octagonal center space with fenestrated and dome-surmounted drum is encircled by a peripheral envelope of outer spaces, which, although internally divided into two stories (ambulatory and gallery) are, in their combined height, lower than the center space. In each case the drum with its dome rests on eight huge arches, rising from piers erected in the eight angles of the octagon (cf. fig. 162.B). These are the basic compositional and structural features. Yet in style and spatial concept the two buildings differ distinctly. In San Vitale the shell separating the octagon from its spatial perimeter is made up of semicircular niches that billow out into the body of ambulatory and gallery. Despite their intensive perforation (three arched openings on each level) these curved niches, together with the piers to which they are attached, are aesthetically perceived as a continuous sheet of masonry stretched around the center space. The movement is encircling, not divisive, and the enveloped space, being uninvaded by any of the enveloping features, retains its full corporeal solidity and homogeneity. It is sculpture springing from a concept of spatial mass akin in spirit to the monolithic self-containment of the component spaces of the Early Christian basilica (Cf. figs. 174 and 177.A-C). The stylistic and conceptual archetype and prototype of this manner of molding space is the Roman Pantheon, a body of incomparable globular perfection and beauty contained in a masonry shell of simple cylindrical shape whose surfaces pass in unbroken planar continuity into those of the semicircular dome by which it is surmounted, with no intrusion at any point. The camera—one-eyed and stationary—is incapable of capturing this quality of style, but Giovanni Piranesi, with his uncanny sensitivity for such matters, has portrayed it with great perspicuity in a series of masterful engravings. The design of the Palace Chapel at Aachen by contrast is based upon the concept of spatial divisibility. This quality is strikingly reflected in the manner in which the eight component surfaces of the octagon meet and connect with one another. Instead of billowing niches swinging inward and outward, yet never losing their encircling hold, the Chapel's straight surfaces, separated by sharp lines, rise in undisrupted ascent from the ground to the apex of the vault by which it is covered. The dome over the octagon of San Vitale is circular (or nearly so) and therefore detaches itself distinctly from the octagonal shape of the body of space lying beneath it, the transition from octagonal drum to circle of the dome being achieved by means of squinches. It rests or hovers like a protective lid over the space it covers. The dome over the octagon of the Palace Chapel, by contrast—a cloister vault, not a hemicycle!—is segmented into eight separate parts, like the eight sides of the octagonal shell that supports it. The emphasis thus is shifted from connecting surfaces to separating lines. In Aachen, for this reason, the center space conveys the feeling of being "sliced" or "sliceable" rather than "whole" and "rounded." It could aesthetically be defined as an aggregate of triangular prisms, meeting with their sharp inner edges in the center axis of the building. This is divisive Carolingian modularity: the conceptual equivalent of the modular square division of the Carolingian basilica (figs. 166-173); medieval divisionalism versus Classical corporeality. The differences are discernible with even more striking sharpness in the structural articulation of the outer spaces. In San Vitale, ambulatory and gallery were covered by timber roofs formed by continuous sequences of beams or trusses all lying on the same level, and therefore visually perceived as flat and continuous annular planes (the present vaults are medieval; see Krautheimer, 1965, 170). In the Palace Chapel at Aachen the same spaces are covered, on ground floor level by groin vaults of alternating square and triangular shape; and on gallery level, by rampant barrel vaults alternating with sharply defined triangular spaces. This is cellular medieval organization of space, springing from the same conceptual sources that in the longitudinal layout of the basilica lead to the arch-framed bay division of the Romanesque and the Gothic (fig. 177); and for more visual demonstration, Horn and Born, Viator, 1975, figs. 38, 39.A-B. Centrally planned buildings do not lend themselves with the same ease to modular division and, for that reason, are not part of the mainstream of medieval development. One hundred and fifty years after the construction of the Palace Chapel, a sophisticated Florentine architect created in the Baptistery of that city, a synthesis between classical and medieval, disclosing that even south of the Alps materials inherited from antiquity are reshaped in a similar manner (cf. Horn, 1938, 99-155; reprinted 1973). 71.Zc FRONT ELEVATION 71.Zb SIDE ELEVATION I. 15 THE PROBLEM OF SCALE AND FUNCTION I.15.1 SCHEMATIC DRAWING OR BUILDING PLAN? The practical effect of the mensuration system employed in the Plan of St. Gall was that it provided its users with a scale that enabled them to convert the dimensions of each building as shown on the parchment into the dimensions which were to obtain on the ground with virtually no margin of error. Ernest Born and I had ample opportunity to test this aspect of the Plan, when preparing the working drawings for the three-dimensional reconstruction of the monastery and its buildings put on display in the Council of Europe Exhibition "Charlemagne," at Aachen in the summer of 1965.1 1 See above, p. 6f. We encountered no major obstacles in our task of converting its simple linear projection into scale-true working drawings and these drawings would in fact have been detailed enough to enable a modern team of masons and carpenters to rebuild the monastery in its full dimensions. In this regard, namely the scale-consistent transferability of its dimensions from parchment to ground, the Plan must be defined as a building plan and not as a schematic drawing.2 2 The best and most sober approach to this subject is an article by Konrad Hecht, entitled "Der St. Galler Plan—Schema oder Bauplan"? which was published in 1965 and came to my attention only after this paragraph was written. I am delighted to find that we came, independently, to virtually the same conclusions. See K. Hecht, 1965, 165206. One might, however, entertain some doubt as to whether this definition can be applied with equal assurance in other respects. It has been shown above3 3 "Methods of Rendering," see above, pp. 53ff. that the Plan leaves us in the dark about such important details as the nature of the materials which were to be used in the construction of individual buildings, the thickness of their walls and such constructional details as would have had to be defined had the walls been shown in thickness. This leaves a vast body of unanswered technical questions, especially tantalizing in the case of the guest and service buildings, whose make-up has confused and puzzled scholars for over a century. Yet here, in particular, we must refrain from projecting our own historical ignorance into the mind of the Carolingian mason or carpenter who studied the Plan in preparing himself for a particular building project. Our analysis of the guest and service buildings4 4 See II, 77ff. is painful evidence of the fact that today we can identify the design and constructional make-up of these buildings only through a laborious process of historical research. A Carolingian mason or master carpenter would have settled this task instantaneously in a single intuitive response the moment he laid eyes on the Plan, because he would have recognized the building type as a variant of the house in which he himself was born and lived, and could thus have translated its design automatically into structural realities. The excellent state of preservation of the Plan of St. Gall suggests that it was rarely, if ever, carried to the building site. Anyone who has been involved in building a house knows to what wear and tear drawings used in actual construction are exposed. It would be inclined to think that the Plan of St. Gall never left the monastic library or the abbot's reception room. Its primary practical function probably was to form the basis for a vast body of verbal building directives. It could also have served as the prototype for many other necessary drawings, laid out at a larger scale and in greater detail, which have not survived due to attrition caused by their being used on the construction site. I would consider it a highly hazardous historical inference to conclude from the linear rendering of the walls on the Plan of St. Gall that scale-consistent architectural drawings defining walls in thickness and articulating other structural details implicit in this type of rendering, did not exist in Carolingian times.5 5 Cf. our remarks above, p. 57; and especially with regard to the architectural drawings of Cod. Rhenaug. LXXIII of the Zentralbibliothek at Zurich. I believe that drawings of this kind existed at all times, and would find it hard to presume that a building as sophisticated as the Palace Chapel at Aachen would have been constructed on purely verbal directives, without the aid of detailed plans and elevations. A UNION OF SCHEMATISM &amp; REALISM In stressing the "realistic" aspects of the Plan of St. Gall, however, I do not wish to convey the impression that the Plan is entirely free of "schematicisms." The Plan is schematic in many respects. It is schematic in that all of the monastery's buildings are inscribed into a site of perfect regularity: an oblong whose sides correspond to the proportion 3:4. It is schematic in the sense that this oblong is divided into subordinate areas of comparable regularity within which the houses are rigidly aligned, as in the layout of the insulae of a Roman city—conditions, of course, that in actual construction would have to be modified to adjust to the topographical peculiarities of a given site. Again, the Plan is schematic in the emphasis which it places on modular relationship rather than straight numerical sequences. The largeness of the standard module (2½ feet) was bound to introduce a touch of geometric stylization in the rendering of many of the smaller objects, whose normal dimensions could only be expressed by using fractions of modules. If the customary length of a Carolingian bed was 6 feet and 4 inches (as is standard today), the drafter of the Plan was faced with the alternatives of assigning it a value of two modules, or 5 feet, (which would have made the bed 16 inches too short for a fully grown man) or assigning it a value of three modules, or 7½ feet, (which made it 18 inches larger than necessary). In taking the more generous alternative6 6 See above, p. 80, fig. 60, and pp. 89-90. he not only protected the monks from being crowded into beds where sleep would have been a torture, but also provided the builder with a margin of safety for the indispensable head- and footboards. The size of the beds reveals a principle that can be observed in many other areas of the Plan. Wherever the real dimensions of a small object fell short of the standard module of 2½ feet, the designer rounded such objects off to the next higher module—never the lower one. This was his method of making sure that a building, when actually constructed, could in fact accommodate the appurtenances with which it was to be equipped. It was his method, also, of providing for a safety margin of space for the thickness of the masonry walls, which on the Plan itself were rendered as simple lines. Because of the dimensional restraint that the largeness of the standard module imposed upon the rendering of small objects, the dimensions at this lower order of magnitude must not be interpreted too literally. I am singling out as another typical example the millstones (molae) in the Mill (fig. 438). Their diameter of three standard modules (7½ feet) appears to be too large, even within the highly advanced technology of a paradigmatic Carolingian monastery. We cannot infer from the manner in which these stones were drawn that they were meant to have had the full diameter of 7½ feet. Their intended size could have been at any reasonable point above two modules, or 5 feet, and below three modules.7 7 See II, 225ff. There are other touches of draftsmanship that are "schematic" rather than "realistic," such as the wide interstices between benches and tables in the Monks' Refectory (fig. 211) and in the House for Distinguished Guests (fig. 396). Yet when allowance is made for all of these factors, full emphasis must be placed on the observation that the Plan is not schematic to the point that any of the practical requirements of the buildings had to be sacrificed in order to conform to overriding standards of modular geometricity. In fact one of the most surprising and truly remarkable features of the Plan is that despite its modular schematism it is extremely "realistic"—realistic in the sense that the dimensions of its rooms and installations are designed with an acute awareness of the space needed to carry out their designated function. In the copious literature on the Plan of St. Gall this fact has been almost completely overlooked, yet detailed analysis shows that wherever a building served a practical function it was designed to be large enough to guarantee that that function could be performed adequately. Where it has been designed slightly larger than required (in general by a carefully calculated fraction) the space allowed is never blatantly excessive. There is no doubt in my mind that the architect who developed the scheme of the monastery based his work upon a clearly formulated population plan and adhered to this program with punctilious care as he worked out the dimensions of the respective buildings. A count of the beds of the monks and the various monastic officials discloses that the monastery shown on the Plan of St. Gall was designed to accommodate between 100 and 110 religiosi.8 8 See below, p. 342. There are two buildings on the Plan in which it had to be possible for all of the monks (with the exception, perhaps, of the few who were in charge of the novices) to assemble at the same time. In both places the seating arrangement is worked out to allow room for all of the brothers, leaving some extra seats for visitors. The normal sitting space required by a fully grown man while eating at a table is an area 2½ feet wide; this is what he would need today and what we can safely expect him to have needed in the Middle Ages. At this ratio the benches and tables in the Refectory (fig. 211) could seat a total of 120 monks.9 9 See below, p. 268. The Refectory, accordingly, can accommodate all of the 100 to 110 brothers in a single sitting and allow, in addition, for an extra sixteen seats to take care of an unexpected fluctuation, as well as the normal increase during the great religious festivals of Christmas, Pentecost, and Easter when the novices were permitted to join their elders. There is also a table for visiting monks with a bench capable of seating six; this corresponds exactly to the number of beds that are shown in the lodging for the Visiting Monks.10 10 See below, pp. 137-39. The same realistic awareness of spatial needs is disclosed in the layout of the benches in the Church, on which the monks were seated during the hours of divine services. The long semicircular bench in the apse and the forechoir seats forty-eight monks (fig. 99); sixteen monks can be seated on the freestanding benches for specially trained singers in the crossing; eighteen on the wall benches of the southern transept arm; twenty on the wall benches of the northern transept arm; and five on each of the two freestanding benches of the transept arms. Total: 112.11 11 For the layout of presbytery and transept, see below, pp. 136ff. Another example of the draftsman's keen and consistent apprehension of the spatial realities involved may be found in the House for Distinguished Guests (fig. 396).12 12 For a detailed description of the building, see II, 155ff. The number of toilet seats for servants in the House for Distinguished Guests (again, providing for a sitting area of 2½ feet per person) is identical with the number of beds that could be placed in the servants' sleeping quarters. The bedrooms of the noblemen with private toilet facilities are furnished with four beds at each end of the house. The two stables for their horses under the northern aisle of the house, each with a surface area of 30 × 12½ feet, can accommodate four horses each, allowing in addition to the required standing space sufficient extra space for taking the horses in and out and for feeding them, yet not much more than was needed for that purpose. The same exacting attention to spatial needs can be observed in the layout of the buildings that contain the kitchens, the baths, the baking and brewing facilities,13 13 On the dimensional variations of the three Bake and Brew houses, see II, 251ff. the mills and the mortars—but most conspicuously in the layout of the Monks' Dormitory. This building, as we have seen,14 14 For more details on this, see above, pp. 89ff and below, pp. 249ff. was designed to accommodate seventy-seven beds. Its dimensions (85 × 40 feet) are calculated to perform this task to perfection. Even the dimensions of the barrels in the Monks' Cellar, as will be shown later on, are based on an accurate statistical estimate of the annual storage needs for alcoholic beverages proportionate to the community of the size of the monastery shown on the Plan—as well as the precise volume of cooperage required to meet these needs.15 15 On the dimensional realism of the barrels and the Cellar, see below, pp. 303ff. 71.B KASTEL KÜNZIG, PASSAU, GERMANY ROMAN MILITARY CAMP (90-120).

Stephani (1903)1 1 Stephani, II, 1903, 25-26. and by Joseph Gantner (1936).2 2 Gantner, 1936, 21-27; and idem, I, 1936, 36-37. It was rejected by Franz Oelmann (1923/24)3 3 Oelmann, 1923/24, 236ff. and Hans Reinhardt (1937 and 1952),4 4 Reinhardt, 1937, 267; and 1952, 18. but was vigorously reaffirmed by Rave (1958).5 5 Rave, 1958, 40. A closer inspection shows that neither of these theories can be wholly disproved or fully accepted. There are some obvious similarities: the oblong shape of the site, and the fact that both the castrum and the monastery were enclosures in which a considerable number of men found shelter in a carefully ordered conglomerate of houses. But the functional and spiritual objectives of each of these architectural organisms were different and called for different solutions in the spatial connections and separations of its constituent architectural components. Reinhardt has drawn attention to the fact that the Plan lacks the disposition most characteristic of the Roman 72. PLAN OF A CAROLINGIAN VILLA ST. GERVAIS, GENEVA. Excavated in 1927, 1940, 1950 [Redrawn from Blondel, 1954, 214, fig. 143] castrum, namely the two central arterials intersecting each other at right angles.6 6 Reinhardt, loc. cit. This is correct. An axial system of roads giving access to gates for speedy entry and exit on all four sides was vital to the operation of a military camp. In a medieval monastery this would not only have been useless, it would have violated the principle of physical and spiritual seclusion on which the life of the monks was based.7 7 See below, pp. 241ff. The cloister of the monks, entirely inaccessible to the layman, forms a castrum within the castrum. And the entire area between this inner fortress and the monastery's outer wall is characterized not so much by its web of connecting roads, as by its carefully calculated system of separating fences.8 8 See below, pp. 245ff. In fact, one may go so far as to contend that there is no internal system of roads at all, but rather a carefully ordered sequence of courts or yards with passages leading from one to another through the separating fences. The Church, the Monks' Parlor, and the houses for the guests were the only buildings in the entire settlement where monks and seculars met under the same roof.9 9 See below, pp. 307-308. Yet even in the Church the areas for the monks were carefully segregated from those that were accessible to seculars;10 10 See below, pp. 127-28, and p. 130, fig. 82. and in the Parlor and the guest houses their coming together was allowed only upon the special occasions when a monk was visited by his relatives, or for performing such DORESTAD, NETHERLANDS 73.A 73.B The Dorestad site is adjacent to Wijk-bij-Duurstede, a village close by the Lek and Kromme Rijn. The CASTELLUM proper forms a small protrusion on the west side of a large, long, and narrow walled enclosure, tillable, and a holding space for animals [site plan]. Within the CASTELLUM compound the SALA plan closely resembles the hollow square plan of certain buildings of the Plan of St. Gall. The church stands alone in its church yard, accessible to those within and without the compound. The configuration of layout, as ensemble, well organized, but loose and free, is innocent of resemblance to formal or traditional pattern of architectural planning. There is no trace of CASTRUM or geometric discipline. Carolingian CASTELLUM with royal hall, in use after 725 and 863 [after Holwerda, 1930, 63, fig. 51] ceremonial duties as washing the feet of guests11 11 See below, pp. 307ff. and serving meals to them.12 12 See II, 145ff. Even after making due allowance for all these differences, which are clearly conditioned by the disparate functions of a monastery and a Roman military camp, there still remains the possibility of an influence of the latter upon the formation of the Plan of St. Gall. The oblong shape of the monastery site, together with the orderly arrangement of the houses in parallel rows on sites of rigidly rectangular form is indeed reminiscent of the grid plan of the Roman castrum or, for that matter, of the grid-planned Roman city. The adoption of such features in the Plan of St. Gall might have come about in any of three possible ways, or even by all three in conjunction: first, through direct contact with ruins of Roman camps or towns, which were still extant in the ninth century both south and north of the Alps;13 13 See Rave's remarks on this subject, in Rave, 1958, 44-45. second, indirectly through the influence that the Roman grid plan had exerted on the Early Christian monasteries of Syria and North Africa;14 14 See Bandmann, 1951, 146ff, 152, and Rave, 1929, 39ff. and third, through the influence that the rectangular layout of the Roman castrum had already exercised on certain secular Carolingian fortifications. I am thinking of such sites as the recently excavated Carolingian villa of Saint-Gervais in Geneva, Switzerland (fig. 72),15 15 See Blondel, 1954, 205-30 and 213, fig. 143. the fortified Carolingian camp of Dorestad, Holland (fig. 73),16 16 Here reproduced after Holwerda, 1930, 63, fig. 51. The castellum of Dorestad was excavated in 1926-1928 by J. H. Holwerda. The earliest culture deposits date from around 725. The castle was destroyed by the Norsemen in 863. and the medieval castellum of Sabatz (formerly Hungary; fig. 74),17 17 After Schedel, Liber chronicarum (Nuremberg, 1493), fol. CCLIII; see also Schuchhardt, 1931, 187, fig. 173. which looks like a three-dimensional reconstruction of the camp of Dorestad. Yet even in these military positions, the similarity to the Roman castrum amounts to little more than the oblong shape of the site and its system of defensive towers. For the rest these fortifications have already assumed the tripartite internal division of the medieval castle, with its successive stages of defensive retreat from an outer bailey into a forecourt (curticula) and from the fore-court into the inner court (curtis). In a conspicuous way the economic and spiritual objectives of the monastery called for a similar internal differentiation of the monastic compound: an outer court for the raising of livestock (the majority of the tract lies to the west of the Church), an intermediate court for the reception of visitors and the performance of the basic labors and crafts by the serfs, and a secluded inner enclosure, comprised of Church and Claustrum where the monks, in spiritual and social retreat, were engaged in the service of God (opus Dei). The order and regularity exhibited in the grouping of the basic building masses, through the entire Plan, has an undeniably classical flavor; the intricate methods of measurement by which they are obtained are medieval.18 18 See above, pp. 77ff. The design of the Church and all of the claustral structures is unthinkable without Rome.19 19 See below, pp. 159ff and 187ff. But the houses of the serfs and visitors which are grouped around this complex have their roots in the vernacular architecture of the north,20 20 See below, II, 77-82. as will be shown in the second volume of this work. 74. SABATZ-ON-THE-SAU. MEDIEVAL FORTIFIED CASTELLUM SAVAC ON THE SAVA, YUGOSLAVIA (FORMERLY HUNGARY). From Hartmann Schedel, Liber Chronicarum, Nuremberg, 1493, fol. CCLIII At the confluence of the Sau and a tributary, old Sabatz lay ringed by forbidding defenses. Two main entrances led through the circumvallation into the fort; by land through a large gate (top center), by bridge through a tower gate (bottom center). The outermost walls of woven wattle ran between four towers (one not shown). The riverbanks, staked with a threatening array of sharpened poles, made of utmost difficulty any approach by men in boats, or war machinery. The fort's outer bailey held two rows of timber-framed houses and a heavily fortified stronghold of rectangular plan, surrounded by a moat let in from the river. Passage from bailey to inner fort was through an ingenious center-privoted gate designed for easy passage of foot or mounted troops. Its flanking spiked timber fence formed a triangular staging area before the castle proper. Within its moat the castle lay in two separated parts. The forecourt, beyond the horsemen's gate over a moat bridge, was enclosed by wattle walls between four towers. An inner gate led from forecourt to castle proper by a second bridge and gate. The inner, larger castle was defended by bastioned walls (possibly timber, possibly coursed massonry) along the moat, and by wattle walls running between towers within it—another ring of defense. The level of the innermost fortress and its massive keep was apparently raised above that of forecourt and bailey. The general arrangement—timber structures surrounding a complex of masonry— somewhat recalls that of the Plan of St. Gall. 16 HOW THE WORK OF GOD IS TO BE PERFORMED IN THE DAYTIME XVI QUALITER DIVINA OPERA PER DIEM AGANTUR Ut ait propheta: Septies in die laudem dixi tibi qui septenarius sacratus numerus a nobis sic implebitur . . .

I. 17 NUMERI SACRI 3 4 7 10 12 40 Unde ratio numeri contemnenda non est, quae in multis sanctarum scripturarum locis quam magni aestimnanda sit eluced diligenter intuentibus. Nec frustra in laudibus Dei dictum est: Omnia in mensura et numero et pondere disposuisti. Augustinus, De Civitate Dei, liber XI, cap. 30 Thus we see that we should not underestimate the significance of numbers, since in many passages of sacred scripture, numbers have a meaning for the conscientious interpreter. Not without reason has it been said to praise God: THOU HAST ORDERED ALL THINGS IN MEASURE, NUMBER, AND WEIGHT. Augustine, The City of God, Book XI, chap. 30.1 1 Latin text is from Dombart and Kalb, Corpus Christianorum, XLVIII, 1955, 350. English is after Walsh and Monahan, trans., The City of God, 1952, 236. Throughout the Middle Ages sacred numbers, conceived as an expression of divine order pervading the created world, formed an integral part of theological and secular thought.2 2 On number symbolism in general, see Hopper, 1938, and Ursula Grossmann, 1954. For brief summaries see the articles "numeri sacri" in Enciclopedia Cattolica, VIII, 1952, col. 1995-96 and Enciclopedia Italiana, XXV, 1935, 37-38. St. Augustine was deeply intrigued by this subject and discusses the meaning of sacred numbers in scripture in Book XI, chaps. 30 and 31 of his City of God, as well as in a letter to Januarius, regarding the celebration of Easter (letter LV). Isidore of Seville deals with numbers and number symbolism in his De numeris and Liber numerorum, well analysed (as Charles W. Jones points out to me) in Jacques Fontaine, I, 1959, 369-91 (but for authenticity of these two works see Robert McNally, 1961, 312-15). A widely read Carolingian source dealing with sacred numbers is Hrabanus Maurus, De Laudibus Sanctae Crucis (Migne, Patr. Lat., CVII, 1864, cols. 132-294 and Schlosser, 1892, especially pp. 14-18). A post-medieval treatise, P. Bongi, Mysticae numerorum significationis liber, Bergamo 1585, was not available to me; as well as K. J. Conant's interesting chapter on the dimensions and the number symbolism of Cluny III, in Conant, 1968, 77-80. On the use of number symbolism in medieval literature see the interesting excursus Numerical Composition in Curtius, 1965, 504ff. Recent studies have shown, with increasing strength of evidence, that they played an important role in the thinking of medieval architects.3 3 On the use of symbolic numbers in medieval church architecture, see Sunderland, 1959 and the literature there cited. Since this chapter was written Ernest Born and I have dealt with the subject of number-symbolism in Carolingian architecture more extensively in an article entitled "On the Selective Use of Sacred Numbers and the Creation of a new Aesthetic in Carolingian Architecture," scheduled to appear in the 1975 issue of Viator. The Plan of St. Gall confirms these findings. It offers persuasive proof that sacred numbers were a decisive factor in the conceptual organization of the Plan as a whole, the proportioning of its major building sites and the dimensioning of the individual buildings. Throughout the entire width and length of the Plan there are signs of the recurrent use of certain favorite numbers, in both the manipulation of straight numerical sequences as well as the management of a variety of modular scale relationships. Predominant in the mind of the designing architect, as this analysis will show, are the numbers three, four, seven, ten, twelve, and forty—all associated with eminently sacred connotations. THREE: This holiest of all holy numbers is encountered in a variety of pagan religions where triads of deities acquired a pre-eminent position.4 4 On the symbolism of the number three see Usener, 1903 and the article "Drei" by R. Mehrlin in Reallexikon für Antike und Christentum, IV, 1958, cols. 270-310. On its architectural applications at the monastery of St. Riquier (three churches, triangular shape of cloister yard, recurrence of three in the number of altars and many other liturgical ornaments), see Effman, 1912, 21ff. The number three played an important role in the layout of the monasteries which St. Pachomius founded in Egypt. They were internally divided into groups called tribus, each of which had three to four houses, depending on the total number of monks (S. Pachomii Regula, chap. 14, cf. Boon, 1932, 17). The Babylonian triad Anu, Bel, and Ena; the Indian triad Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva; the Greco-Roman triad Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva found a Christian counterpart in the doctrine of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit). Both the Old and New Testaments abound with references to the sacredness of this number. God created the world by dividing it into its three constituent parts, land, water, and air. He spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai on the third day of the third month and gave the law on the same day. Christ was tempted thrice and spent three days in the tomb. In the Christian liturgy the number is reflected in such devotional formulae as the triple Agnus dei, the triple Mea culpa, the triple Dominus non sum dignus, that have parallels in the Greek and Roman ritual (triple libation, triple pronunciation of the mystical words, triple circumambulation, lustratoria and others). On the Plan of St. Gall the number three is used in the organization of the basic site divisions (figs. 75 and 76). There is an eastern tract, a central tract, and a western tract (fig. 75). The central tract, which has twice the surface area of tract 1 and 2, is internally divided into a straight plot on 75. PLAN OF ST. GALL TRIPARTITE DIVISION OF PRINCIPAL TRACTS TRACT 1: Eastern Tract with Novitiate and Infirmary, plus other medical facilities, Cemetery, horticultural facilities and facilities for breeding and raising poultry. TRACT 2: Central tract with Church and Cloister. TRACT 3: Western tract with houses for monastic livestock and their keepers and such houses as are needed to lodge serfs visiting from outlying estates, and vassals and servants travelling in the emperor's train. 76. PLAN OF ST. GALL TRIPARTITE DIVISION OF CENTER TRACT 1. NORTHERN PLOT. A rectangular strip of land, accommodating facilities that form an intermediary zone between the monastery and the outside world (for its internal subdivisions see fig. 75.C). 2. CENTER PLOT. A P-shaped tract of land accommodating the Church and the houses for the Monks (Dormitory, Refectory and Cellar), the latter ranged peripherally around an open court attached to the southern flank of the Church, and rigidly secluded from all other areas of the monastery site. 3. SOUTHERN PLOT. An L-shaped area to the south and west of the Monks' Cloister, with houses for subsidiary monastic activities (for its internal subdivisions see fig. 77.C). 77. PLAN OF ST. GALL GROUPING OF BUILDINGS IN THREES The Northern Plot accommodates (1) The House of the Abbot, who as the holder of a vast web of manorial estates, was the monastery's primary link with the outside world; (2) the Outer School, where the secular clergy and the sons of noblemen were trained; and (3) The House for Distinguished Guests, where the emperor and his travelling entourage were received. The Southern Plot accommodates in the stem of the L-shaped site (1) the Granary; (2) the Great Collective Workshop; (3) The Monks' Bake and Brewhouse, Mill and Mortar. In the foot of the L are (1) the Hospice for Pilgrim's and Paupers, (2) the workshops and quarters for Coopers and Wheelwrights; and (3) The Houses for Oxen and their Keepers. 77.X PLAN OF ST. GALL THE SUPERMODULE AS UNITS OF THREE &amp; FOUR The role of the numbers 3 and 4 (and their multiple 12) in the layout of the entire monastery site, which in its totality is composed of twelve 160 foot ( = 4 × 40) squares, arranged in three columns from left to right, and four columns from top to bottom—a layout in which the patristic tradition of sacred numbers fuses with a new Carolingian aesthetic based on modular relationships. the northern side of the Plan, a P-shaped plot in the center, and an L-shaped plot to the south (fig. 76). The northern plot is internally divided into three building sites (Abbot's House, Outer School, House for Distinguished Guests), the L-shaped plot to the south is comprised of six building sites—three in the vertical stem of the L (Granary, Great Collective Workshop, Monks' Bake and Brew House) and three in the horizontal bar (Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers, House for Coopers and Wheelwrights, House for Horses and Oxen; fig. 77). The number three, as I have shown in my analysis of the scale and construction methods used in designing the Plan, played an important role in the arrangement of the 40-foot squares that determined the layout of Church and Claustrum, as well as the 160-foot squares that formed the basis for the calculation of the overall dimensions of the monastery site.5 5 See above, pp. 91ff. The Church is inscribed into a grid of squares, three 40-foot units wide and nine 40-foot units long (fig. 61); the cloister into a grid of squares three units wide and p. 82 six units long. The entire settlement is developed within a grid of 160-foot squares, three units wide and four units long (fig. 63). p. 86 Three multiplied by itself is nine. This figure, apart from the instance just mentioned, is reflected in the nine interstices of the nave arcades (fig. 55) and the two rows of p. 76 planting beds in the Monks' Vegetable Garden (fig. 64). p. 88 FOUR: The number four was associated, both in pagan and Christian times with the basic divisions of matter, time, and space: the four humors of the body, the four winds, the four seasons, the four rivers of paradise, the four cardinal virtues, the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, the four main prophets, and the four evangelists.6 6 On the number four see Buckland, 1896; and above, p. 93. On the Plan of St. Gall it determines the internal layout of the most important building site, namely the P-shaped central plot of land that accommodates the Church and the three principal claustral structures. Moreover, it played a crucial role in the calculation of all the basic modular values used in constructing the Plan.7 7 See above, p. 93. SEVEN: In Sumerian and Babylonian times this figure was associated with celestial bodies and spiritual forces: the seven planets, the seven evil spirits, the seven levels of the ziggurat and others.8 8 On the symbolism of the number seven, see von Adrian, 1901 and Roscher, 1901. In the biblical tradition, St. Augustine writes, it was used to express "the whole or completeness of anything." God created the world in seven days and on the last of these, the seventh, he "did not wish to sanctify his creation by any of his words but, rather by his rest."9 9 Augustine, The City of God, Book XI, chap. 31, see The Fathers of the Church, Writings of St. Augustine, VII, 1952, 236; and Augustine, Letter LV, op. cit., IX, 1951, 274. 78. PLAN OF ST. GALL GROUPING OF BUILDINGS AS FOUR IN CENTRAL TRACT A concept of classical beauty, in which function and number symbolism fuse in the grouping of the four principal structures of the monastery and its central and most vital core: Church (1), Dormitory (2), Refectory (3), and Cellar (4). 79. PLAN OF ST. GALL GROUPING OF BUILDINGS AS SEVEN IN CENTRAL TRACT The same group of buildings, counted with all subsidiary structures, result in the number 7, arrived at by the inclusion of the Monks' Latrine (5), their Laundry and Bathhouse (6), and Kitchen (7). 80. PLAN OF ST. GALL GROUPING OF BUILDINGS (WITH OPEN AREAS) IN SEVEN AND TWELVE The eastern tract (a) consists of medical facilities (1, 2, 3), Novitiate and Infirmary (4), their respective bathhouses and kitchens (5, 6), the Cemetery (7), Monks' Vegetable Garden and the house for the gardener and crew (8, 9), and facilities for fowl and their keepers (11, 12). The western tract (b) consists of houses for monastic livestock and their keepers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5); house for serfs and vassals, and servants in the emperor's train (6, 7). In the later Christian tradition all human life is ordered by series of seven. There are seven capital sins, seven virtues, seven sacraments, seven requests in the Pater Noster. Each man passes through seven ages, and the world itself will last no more than seven periods.10 10 Mâle, 1950, 218-19. In monastic life the number is observed in the seven daily services to which the monks are held (Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline).11 11 "Ut ait propheta: Septies in die laudem dixi tibi. Qui septenarius sacratus numerus a nobis sic implebitur, si matutino, primae, tertiae, sextae, nonae, uesperae, completoriique tempore nostrae seruitutis officia persolbamus" (Benedicti regula, chap. 16, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 64; McCann, 1952, 60-61; Steidle, 1952, 1962-63). On the Plan of St. Gall the numeral is reflected in the seven buildings that form the cloister (three major and four minor; fig. 79), the seven houses that lie in the western tract of the monastery (fig. 80), the seven steps (septem gradus) by which the presbytery is raised above the crossing (fig. 99), p. 150 the seven desks for the scribes in the scriptorium (fig. 99), the seven tables in the Monks' Refectory (fig. 211), the seven p. 263 beds that are located in the abbot's dormitory (fig. 251) p. 310 besides that of the abbot and the seventy-seven beds in the Monks' Dormitory (fig. 208). p. 260 TEN: "This number signifies perfection, in an even fuller sense," St. Augustine writes, "because it is composed of the number seven, which embraces all created things, and the number three which stands for the Holy Trinity."12 12 Augustine, Reply to Manicheans' "Fundamental Epistle," The Fathers of the Church, X, 11. It found its most significant embodiment in the Ten Commandments, composed of three precepts pertaining to the love of God and seven to the love of neighbors;13 13 Augustine, Letter LV, op. cit., 276. and it is reflected in Hebraic liturgy in the ten shores of Egypt, the ten ropes of the tent of the tabernacle, the height of the cherubs in the temple (ten cubits) and the ten horns of the apocalyptic beast. It was on the tenth day that Christ ascended to heaven.14 14 Ibid., 284. Ten is the number that forms the basis of the decimal system and it is the universal ten of the Pythagoreans. All the principal dimensions of the Plan and those of many of its larger subdivisions can be interpreted as multiples of ten. The Church in the form in which it is drawn has a length of 300 feet.15 15 See above, p. 79. An axial revisionary title suggests that in actual construction this should be reduced to 200 feet.16 16 See above, p. 77. The cloister yard, including its walks, has a surface area of 100 by 100 feet.17 17 Modified to 100 feet × 102½ feet for reasons discussed above, p. 99. The square with the savin tree in the center measures 20 by 20 feet.18 18 See above, p. 101. Ten is the basic factor in all of the larger modules used in designing 80.X PLAN OF ST. GALL THE ALTARS OF THE PLAN: A TRINITY OF SEVENS This figure illustrates the use of the numbers 3, 4, and 7 in the grouping of the altars in the various churches of the Plan. In number they total 21 (3 × 7). There are many more instances of the use of these numbers through the entire length and width of the Plan, for a fuller discussion and further illustration of which we refer to the article cited in note 3, p. 119, above. THE DELINEATED CROSSES OF THE PLAN Twelve crosses, no more, no less, are delineated on the Plan. First is the great cross of the Monks' Cemetery and Orchard. Within the Church a cross symbol marks the Ambo, the remaining cross symbols mark ten of the 21 altars, four in each aisle, two on the nave axis. the Plan. Multiplied by four it yields the 40-foot square,19 19 See above, pp. 89 and 92. and again by four the 160-foot square.20 20 See below, pp. 91 and 93. The number finds specific mention in the explanatory title that defines the distance (pedes denos) between the piers that support the covered porch of the semicircular atrium that gives access to the Church.21 21 See below, p. 128. TWELVE: The number twelve formed the basis of the Sumerian and Babylonian numerical system, which was duodecimal (the twelve signs of the zodiac, the twelve months of the year, the twelve hours of the day). It played a significant role in the number symbolism of the Jews (the twelve gates of paradise, the twelve tribes of Israel, the twelve bronze calves) and the Christians (the twelve apostles, the twelve stars around the head of the apocalyptic woman, the twelve days from Christ's birth to Epiphany). On the Plan of St. Gall it is reflected in the twelve subdivisions of the East tract (fig. 80), the twelve cubicles for the students of the Outer School (fig. 407), and the twelve II. p. 169 feet (bis senos pedes) assigned to the interstices of the arcades of the Church in one of the revisionary titles of the Plan.22 22 See above, p. 81 and below, pp. 178ff. FORTY: "I think that life itself is represented by the number forty. . . . Not without reason did the Lord remain on this earty forty days, after his resurrection, when he conversed with his disciples in this life."23 23 Augustine, Letter LV, op. cit., 284. For ages this number, as I have already had occasion to point out in a preceding chapter, had been associated in the biblical tradition with periods of expectation and penitence.24 24 See above, p. 103. On symbolism of 40, see Roscher, 1909; Horn and Born, 1966, 306; 1974, 462; 1975, 358ff. It is the value assigned to the width of the nave of the Church of the Plan25 25 See above, p. 77 and below, p. 127. and forms the basis of the grid of squares that determines the proportions of Church and Claustrum26 26 See above, p. 90. as well as the dimensions of the entire monastery site.27 27 See above, pp. 91-94. It is a crucial figure both for the planimetric organization of the monastery site and for the proportions of the Church and the claustral buildings. This is an enumeration of the most obvious incidence of the use of sacred numbers in the design of the Plan. There are others,28 28 Within the church of the Plan are seventeen altars. St. Augustine refers to this number as follows: "In this number a marvelous mystery is revealed. With good reason is the seventeenth psalm alone found intact in the Book of Kings, because it signifies that kingdom in which we shall have no enemies" (Augustine, Letter LVI, op. cit., 288). but perhaps one should not belabor the point. Before abandoning the subject, nevertheless, attention must be drawn to the existence of a broad range of different manifestations of number symbolism on the Plan of St. Gall, not so easily detected by the eye of modern students of the Plan, and least of all by those who were reared in the metric system. I am referring to all such cases where sacred numbers are manipulated in modular, rather than in straight, numerical sequence. The outer boundaries of the monastery site, as has been shown in a preceding chapter, were established in the proportion 3:4,29 29 See above, p. 91. laid down with the aid of a regular straightedge, on which these lengths were 30 and 40 Carolingian inches.30 30 See above, p. 97. The corresponding distance on the ground was 480 and 640 feet,31 31 See above, loc. cit. both multiples of forty. The entire monastery site discloses itself to be inscribed into a grid of twelve (=3 × 4) supermodules, each representing a surface area of 160 × 160 feet.32 32 See above, loc. cit. This area was internally composed of sixteen 40-foot squares. On the Carolingian straightedge, with the aid of which these dimensions were scaled on the Plan, this supermodule corresponded to 10 × 10 inches.33 33 See above, loc. cit. In our analysis of the scale and construction method used in designing the Plan we have shown that all of those installations of the Plan that were too small to be expressed as multiples of 40 feet (width of the nave of the Church) were designed as multiples of a standard module obtained by halving forty, four times in succession, and thus arriving at a base value of 2½ feet, perhaps equivalent to an actual Carolingian "pace."34 34 See above, p. 92. A modular sequence formed by multiples of 2½ produces such imperfect numbers as 7½, 12½, 17½, 22½, 27½. These graduations appear peculiar to anyone who is accustomed to think in sequences of full numbers, but become meaningful once it is understood that on the Carolingian straightedge used by the designer in scaling the Plan, 7½ corresponded to three; 12½ to five; and 17½ to seven standard modules. Typical examples are the two enclosures, one of which serves as Henhouse, the p. 265 other as the Goosehouse (fig. 466). They are formed by concentric circles, struck to diameters of 12½, 27½, and 42½ feet. On the scale used by the designer these values corresponded to five, seven, and seventeen standard modules. The House of the Fowlkeepers, which lies in the middle between these two installations, covers a surface area of 35 feet by 42½ feet. On the straight edge these values corresponded to fourteen (= twice seven) and seventeen (= ten plus seven) standard modules. Examples like these could be multiplied by scores of others. On the Plan of St. Gall, thus, we must conclude that number symbolism is used on different levels: the modular graduations of the Carolingian straightedge with the aid of which the Plan was drawn, the number of feet which corresponded to this module on the ground35 35 A typical example of number symbolism manifested in Carolingian ground units of feet is the layout of the tables and benches in the Monk's Refectory; it is controlled by the figures 10, 30, and 40 (cf. below, p. 263). The seating capacity of these pieces of furniture, on the other hand, is expressed in multiples of the 2½-foot unit: 60 monks in the upper half of the hall, the same number in the lower half. Total: 120 = 10 times 12, not counting 6 additional seats for visiting monks. The table of the abbot seats 12 monks on each of its long arms. Also see p. 268. and the number of actual Carolingian inches that furnished the actual frame of reference for that modular scale. The author of the Plan of St. Gall could switch from any one of these three levels of thinking to any other with the same ease with which a modern Anglo-Saxon carpenter switches from the straight numerical sequence used in listing multiples of feet, through the duodecimal system used in designating inches, to the sixteen divisions used in designating fractions of inches. Numbers meaningful in one system may be replete with symbolism in any of the others. In drawing attention to the use of sacred numbers in the design of the Plan of St. Gall, we must emphasize that the conceptual attitude reflected in this system should under no circumstances be confused with the principle of carefully regulated modular relationships discussed in our chapter on the scale and construction methods used in the Plan (above, p. 77ff). They have different historical roots and different historical implications. Number symbolism is cultural material of old vintage transmitted to the age of Charlemagne in the form that it had attained in the writings of the early Church Fathers. It was the product of theological and biblical speculation and an expression of the belief that the created world was held together by a divinely ordered system of numerical relationships, and that the continuance of life depended on the perpetuation of that system. Sacred numbers, judiciously selected, could be used for aesthetic purposes but had in themselves no binding aesthetic implications. Of the six intensely holy numbers used by the author of the Plan (i.e., the numerals 3, 4, 7, 10, 12, and 40) four are not in any modular relationship to one another (e.g., 3, 4, 7, and 10); and 3, 7, and 12 are not in any modular relationship to 40, the number holding the key position in the aesthetic organization of the Plan. Only 4 and 10 are modules of this crucial figure, 40. It is in the establishment of a coherent p. 39 aesthetic system between these three—4, 10, 40—and the consistent application of that system to the layout of the entire monastery site that a new principle of spatial composition emerges in western architecture and planning. We shall return to this subject in our discussion of the cultural roots and architectural implications of the square schematism of the Plan of St. Gall (below, pp. 212ff). 81. ROME. ST. PAUL'S OUTSIDE THE WALLS, A.D. 385 INTERIOR VIEW LOOKING EAST, FROM AN ENGRAVING BY GIOVANNI BATTISTA PIRANESI, 1749 [after G. B. Piranesi, OPERE, 27 vols., Rome, 1756-1807; Vol. 16, Pl. 9. Size of original: 16¼ × 24 inches] With the incomparable sensitivity which he manifested for the specific stylistic qualities of the great monuments of Roman, Greek, and Early Christian architecture, Piranesi here recreates the simple blocklike quality of the spaces of an Early Christian basilica. The arcades are not wide enough to let the space flow between nave and aisles; the roof trusses likewise are so narrowly spaced that their tie-beams appear to be part of a continuous plane forming the ceiling. Walls, pavement and roof, despite their perforations, thus act aesthetically like the sides of a box, bounding in straight planes the solid unbroken mass of the space they envelop: a huge monolithic void, solid and undisturbed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II THE MONASTERY CHURCH II. 1 DESCRIPTION INTRODUCTION THE Church of the Plan of St. Gall (figs. 82, 84, 93, and 99) is an aisled cruciform structure with an apse at either end, an eastern and western paradise, and two detached round towers on its entrance side. Its most remarkable feature, historically, apart from its length, is the fact that its layout is based on a system of squares that bears startling resemblance to the so-called square schematism of the German Romanesque. This system is here carried out with a logic and consistency unparalleled in any of the Carolingian churches actually constructed, with the sole exception, possibly, of the cathedral and monastery church that Archbishop Hildebold (d. 819) built at Cologne sometime after the year 800 (figs. 16-18).1 1 See above, pp. 27ff. The Church measures 300 feet from apse to apse.2 2 On the discrepancies between the Church as it was drawn and the form it would have attained had it been modified in light of its explanatory title, see above, pp. 77ff. Its nave and transept have the same width, 40 feet, and thus their area of intersection, the crossing, forms a square. The fore choir and two transept arms repeat the dimensions of the crossing square, and the dimensions of the nave are so arranged as to cover a surface area of exactly four-and-one-half times the size of the crossing square. The width of the aisles, 20 feet, is half the width of the nave (40 feet); the interstices between the columns which support the clerestory wall on either side of the nave are spaced at intervals of 20 feet on center. The most striking feature to a modern visitor, were he able to enter this church, would be the many screens and railings which divide the interior into separate areas for worship (figs. 82, 84, 93, and 99). In the time of Constantine the Great, the Christian house of worship had only one altar, and its nave and aisles were so arranged architecturally that the entering crowd could move from the entrances to the altar in a straight, continuous movement that paralleled the columnar rhythm of the arcades supporting its walls (fig. 81). No barriers blocked the path of those proceeding to the altar until they reached the chancel railing, which screened off the space for the officiating clergy. By contrast, the Church of the Plan of St. Gall is furnished with seventeen altars (nineteen, if we add the altars of its towers), but except for a narrow passage in each aisle by which the pilgrims gain access to the tomb of St. Gall in the crypt, only one-sixth of the entire surface area of the Church is open to laymen (fig. 82): a portion of the nave of the Church, 40 feet wide and 110 feet long, extending from the second pair of columns to halfway beyond the seventh pair. The western half of this space is reserved for the performance of baptismal rites; the eastern half for services held for pilgrims, and for the Monastery's serfs and workmen. All the remaining portions of the Church—transept, presbytery, the terminal bays of the nave, most of the aisles, and the two apses—are screened off for exclusive use by the monks and their clergy. II.1.1 APPROACH The official approach to the Church, which is also the only legitimate access to the Monastery grounds, is a road 25 feet wide and 145 feet long. This road is coaxial with the Church and intersects, to the west of it, the large tract of land that accommodates the houses for the monastic livestock and their keepers, and the houses for servants and knights who travel in the emperor's following (fig. 83). The road is identified by a distich written in capitalis rustica: OMNIBUS AD SCM TURBIS PATET HAEC UIA TEMPLUM QUO SUA UOTA FERANT UNDE HILARES REDEANT THIS IS THE ROAD OF ACCESS TO THE CHURCH IN WHICH ALL FOLK MAY WORSHIP THAT THEY MAY LEAVE REJOICING There must have been other entrances to the service yards for the passage of livestock, for hauling in the harvest and wine on wagons or carts, and for the delivery of tithes from outlying estates, but these passageways were not open to pilgrims. Since the Plan does not tell us anything about the outer wall enclosure, we do not know where such entrances might have been. As the yards that lie to the west of the Church are completely surrounded by fences, the Monastery may not have required an outer gate. II.1.2 ATRIUM The gate to the Monastery is a large semicircular atrium, which lies immediately west of the Church (fig. 84). This installation comes under the jurisdiction of the Porter (portarius) and the master of the paupers (procurator pauperum). It is provided with three porches, in which the visitors are received and screened for dispersion to their respective quarters. The first of these three porches faces west and carries the inscription: Adueniens aditum populus hic cunctus habebit Here all the arriving people will find their entry The other two, facing south and north, lie at the ends of the atrium. The one to the north gives access to the grounds of the House for Distinguished Guests and the Outer School. It is inscribed with a distich that reads: Exi &amp; hic hospes uel templi tecta subibit Discentis scolae pulchra iuuenta simul3 3 The first three lines of this verse, as has been noted above, are written by the hand of the second scribe, the last three by the hand of the main scribe. See pp. 13ff. At this point the guests will either go out or enter quietly under the roof of the church. Likewise the noble youth who attend the academic school. The southern porch opens onto the grounds of the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers and also serves as entryway for the Monastery's serfs and workmen: Tota monasterio famulantum hic turba subintret Here let the entire crowd of the servants enter the monastery quietly The lodgings of the porter and of the almoner are contiguous to these porches. That of the porter abuts the northern aisle of the Church, that of the almoner the southern.4 4 See II, p. 153. The principal body of the atrium consists of a covered semicircular gallery that gives access to the aisles of the Church. The outer perimeter of this gallery is formed by a solid wall; its inner perimeter consists of an open arcade with arches rising from square piers. A hexameter inscribed into the gallery in capitalis rustica states: HIC MURO TECTUM IMPOSITUM PATET ATQUE COLUMNIS HERE A ROOF EXTENDS, SUPPORTED BY A WALL AND BY COLUMNS A title entered in the interstices of the arcades that support the roof of the covered walk ascribes to them an inter-columniary distance of 10 feet: Has interque pedes denos moderare columnas Between these columns count ten feet The gallery encloses concentrically an open plot of land covered with grass, whose purpose is explained by another hexameter, again in capitalis rustica: HIC PARADISI?CUM SINE TECTO STERNITO CAP?UM5 5 "Paradisus," a word of Persian origin, denoting a royal park or enclosed pleasure garden, used in the Greek Old Testament in the sense of "green space" or "park" for the Garden of Eden, and subsequently, in a more supernatural sense, for the paradise of Hope, situated not on earth but in heaven. In architecture it is used as a name for the hallowed spaces, encircled by porticoes, in front of the entrance of temples and churches. "Fecit et atrium ante ecclesiam, quod nos Romana consuetudine Paradisum vocitamus." Leo of Ostia, 1115; for other sources, see Du Cange, Glossarium, s.v. "paradisus." For later uses of the term, see Parker, 1850, 338-39. HERE STRETCH OUT A PARKLIKE SPACE WITHOUT A ROOF II.1.3 TOWERS Two doors in the outer atrium wall, placed midway between the outer porch and the two inner porches give access to two detached circular towers. Their diameter is 30 feet and their closest point lies at a distance of 7½ feet from the outer atrium wall. Both towers are ascended by winding stairs, suggested graphically by spirals and verbally by an inscription in the northern tower (from the hand of the main scribe) which reads: "Ascent by a spiral staircase to survey the entire orbit [of the monastery] from above" (ascensus per c·/·ocleam ad uniuersa super inspicienda). A title in the southern tower (written by the same hand) simply states: "another one of the same kind" (alter similis). The northern tower has in its summit an altar dedicated to the archangel Michael (in summitate altare sci Michahelis archangeli), the southern tower, an altar dedicated to archangel Gabriel (in fastigio altare sci Gabrihelis archangeli). These last two titles are written by the hand of the second scribe in such a pale shade of ink that they are barely legible.6 6 I follow the reading suggested by Johannes Duft; cf. I. Müller, in Studien, 1962, 165; and Reinhardt, 1952, 10. CONNECTION WITH IRELAND? The purpose of the two detached towers of the Plan of St. Gall has been the subject of a considerable amount of controversy. J. R. Rahn suggested a connection with the round towers of Ireland (fig. 85).7 7 Rahn, 1876, 87. But it appears that no circular towers are known to have existed in Ireland early enough to have been copied on the Plan of St. Gall.8 8 Cf. Gantner, I, 1936, 39; Poeschel, 1961, 16; and idem, in Studien, 1962, 17. Moreover, there is nothing else in the architectural layout of the Plan that would suggest any special ties with Ireland; and the general trend of the monastic reform movement, to which the Plan owes its existence, was away from the Irish tradition rather than toward it. CALL TOWERS OR FUNERARY LIGHT TOWERS? Even more tenuous than the suggestion of an Irish origin for the towers appears to me a theory recently advanced by Hans Reinhardt,9 9 Reinhardt, 1952, 26-31. who sketches a developmental line leading to the towers of St. Gall from the triumphal columns of Rome through the intermediary forms of the Mohammedan minaret (fig. 86) and certain funerary light towers (fig. 87), especially well-attested in twelfth-century western France. Leaving entirely to one side the question of the very doubtful connection of all these disparate architectural entities, it must be stressed that there is nothing in the Plan itself that would suggest that the two towers of the Church were used either as call towers, from which the monks sang their daily vigils and announced the hours of prayer (in the sense in which this was done in the Mohammedan ritual), or as light towers on the top of which a lantern was lit at night in commemoration of the dead. The author of the Plan is very specific. The purpose of the towers, he tells us, is "to survey the entire orbit [of the monastery] from above" (ad uniuersa super inspicienda); this defines them as places of surveillance —surveillance in the sense of "watch over approaching danger." The use of the term uniuersa suggests that the protective function of the towers was meant to extend beyond the physical plant of the monastery; and the patronage of the archangels Michael and Gabriel tends to strengthen this view. Michael, through his defeat of Lucifer, became the embodiment of the forces of light prevailing over the powers of darkness; Gabriel was the announcer of the human incarnation of the Saviour. Both angels, through these accomplishments, became in a special sense the protectors and guardians of the Church. All over the Western world, St. Michael was venerated in sanctuaries built on high-lying ground, on mountains, in the upper stories of the western avant-corps of churches, or in the steeples of towers. From there he pits himself against the forces of darkness that rush against the House of the Lord from the west.10 10 On the widespread veneration of St. Michael in sanctuaries located on mountains or in the upper stories of towers, see Ostendorf, 1922, 44ff and 287ff; Vallery-Radot, 1929, 453-78; O. Gruber, 1936, 149-73; Lehmann Brockhaus, 1938, 69-70, note 85; Schmidt, 1956, 380; and Fuchs, 1957, 6 and 30. On coins and in medieval manuscript illuminations Rome and Jerusalem, the two terrestrial counterimages of the City of God, were represented by a gate flanked by two defending towers.11 11 Thümmler, 1958, col. 90 and Lotz, 1952, 67ff. In like manner, on the Plan of St. Gall, the Church is defended by its two protective towers against the evil that rushes against it. BELL TOWERS OR TOWERS OF DEFENSE AND SURVEILLANCE? It cannot be stressed with sufficient strength that the explanatory titles associated with these towers fail to make any reference to campana, signa, or tintinnabula; and for that reason they cannot be interpreted as bell towers. On purely historical grounds this would be a perfectly feasible assumption. Bells set in motion with ropes, to mark the various phases of the divine services or other festive events, are mentioned at various places in the History of the Franks of Gregory of Tours (d. 593/94). In the course of the seventh and eighth centuries the evidence in contemporary sources attesting their existence increases so markedly that it can safely be assumed that they existed elsewhere.12 82. PLAN OF ST. GALL. PLAN OF CHURCH Shaded areas distinguish parts of the Church accessible to monks, and to laymen. Approaching by the access road (A) cutting through the large service yard west of the Church, visiting pilgrims are received by the Porter in a square porch (B) lying before the semicircular atrium, and from there are directed through two more porches (C, D), the poor to the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers, the rich to the House for Distinguished Guests. Two passageways no more than 7½ feet wide channel entering laymen through the aisles of the Church, across the transept, to a U-shaped corridor crypt at the end of which they may kneel before the tomb of St. Gall (E). Two reserved areas in the nave allow them to hear sermons delivered from the ambo (F), attend services celebrated at the altar of the Savior at the Holy Cross (G), and participate in baptismal rites conducted at the altar of SS John the Evangelist and John the Baptist (H). * The pale red tint                 defines the area of the church proper. This, in its totality was the province of the monk. Part of it he willingly shared with laymen so that they also might be touched by mystery and deepened in faith. Those areas of the church where layman and pilgrim were welcome and to which their movements were restricted for enjoyment, contemplation, and prayer are indicated in a meandering vignetted black stipple: The pattern of circulation began at the Entry Porch, flowed along the aisles of the church, passed by shrines and nave columns all with carved capitals supporting arcades and walls above the arcades aglow with the color of painting. Then reaching the crossing square, the circulation descended by stairs beneath apse and high altar (dedicated to St. Mary and St. Gall) to the crypt passage where at point of climax, illuminated by candle light, immersed in vibrant shadow, could be seen the tomb of St. Gall. This was moving theater and impressive, even to the sophisticated viewer. In such a setting the Order of St. Benedict would gather momentum for centuries. SCALE OF PLAN: 3/10 ORIGINAL SIZE (1:192 × 0.3 = 1:640) 83. PLAN OF ST. GALL ACCESS ROAD TO CHURCH &amp; MONASTERY GROUNDS 12 For Tours see Otte, 1884, 9 and Mon. Germ. Hist., Script. Rer. Merov., I:1, 1885, 258; for the seventh and eighth century sources see Otte, op. cit., 12ff and von Sommerfeld, 1906, 198ff. Yet the fact remains that the explanatory titles of the towers of the Plan of St. Gall do not contain any suggestion that they were meant to house bells; and there is some doubt in my mind that any bells suspended in these towers could have successfully fulfilled their function. The use of these instruments implies an element of timing which requires that the brother charged with the task of ringing them be within sight or hearing of the officiating priest.13 13 The monastic consuetudines of the period abound with references to bells and tell us exactly at what point in the divine service they were struck. Bells of "small," "middling," and "large" size (signum pussillum, signum modicum, signum majus) are mentioned in the Consuetudines Cluniacenses antiquores, which reflected a considerably earlier tradition with which Benedict of Aniane was familiar. See Cons. mon., ed. Bruno Albers, II, 1905, 2 and 3. For other references to bells, see under the words campana, signum, tintinnabulum, cymbalum in the indices of Corp. cons. mon., 1963; Schlosser, 1896; and Cons. mon., I-V, 1900-12; as well as in Du Cange's Glossarium. A rectangular bell of Irish design and probably Irish provenience is on exhibit in the Stiftsbibliothek of St. Gall. It was used, according to tradition, by St. Columban and St. Gall in a cell which these two missionaries occupied from 610 to 612 in the vicinity of Bregenz (Gallenstein). The bell is of sheet iron. It is 33 cm. high, has a diameter at the bottom of 15 cm. × 23 cm. and at the top of 11 cm. × 17 cm. It was never suspended in a bell tower, but apparently held in the hand and struck on one of its outer surfaces with the aid of a club or rod. Before the introduction of cast bronze bells, hammered iron bells of this type were used not only in Ireland, but also on the Continent. Walahfrid Strabo tells us that they were called "signals" (signa) and used to announce the hours of the divine service (quibusdam pulsibus significantur horae). The "St. Gall-Bell of Bregenz" is dealt with by Duft, 1966, 425-36, where, incidentally, attention is drawn to the fact that the squarish design of modern Alpine cow bells is derived from that of the service bells used in the early Irish monasteries of the Alpine forelands. The spread of the form has an interesting etymological parallel in the propagation of the word with which this object is designated: the German word Glocke comes from Irish clogg through the intermediary stages of Medieval Latin clocca and Old High German glokka (Duft, op. cit., 431). Bell ringers stationed in the isolated towers of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall could have neither seen nor heard the priest.14 14 From a strictly practical point of view, a small towerlike superstructure over the transept would have provided a more suitable solution for placing bells to announce the various phases of the liturgical cycle than two isolated towers standing at a distance of over 300 feet from the high altar. In large metropolitan churches, as well as in smaller parish churches which were designed primarily for the worship of laymen, conditions may have been different. THE EIGHT-LOBED ROSETTE: A STELLAR AND APOTROPAIC SYMBOL One of the smaller unexplained motifs of the Plan of St. Gall is the eight-lobed rosette that decorates the area in the center of the two church towers which corresponds to the open shaft of its stairs. The same motif appears on the two poultry houses in connection with a circular "tower-like" projection.15 15 See II, 267ff. It has been interpreted in various ways, as "being of no significance,"16 16 Keller, 1844, 20. as "indicating the conical roof of the building, or its ornamental finial,"17 17 Willis, 1848, 99. and as representing "the decorative design in the shingles which cover the roof of the building."18 18 Stephani, II, 1903, 58. None of these explanations seems convincing. The motif, rather, belongs to an old and widespread family of stellar symbols, the origins of which reach back into antiquity. Eight- or six-lobed rosettes, as symbols of the stellar nature of God, are a common occurrence in Sumerian, Babylonian, Jewish, and Roman art (fig. 88). The motif was quickly absorbed into the Christian cult, as a reference to the celestial nature of the new god, and subsequently became so closely associated with the cross of Christ as to be practically interchangeable with it (figs. 89 and 90).19 19 Concerning the use of the rosette motif in Syrian, Coptic, and North African Early Christian art, see Mellinkoff, 1947; in Visigothic art, Puig i Cadafalch, 1961, 53ff; in Merovingian art, Benoit, 1959, 49-51; and in Anglo-Norman art, Keyser, 1927, passim. The symbol placed its bearers under the stellar protection of Christ, and through a vernacular vulgarization of its original meaning eventually assumed the role of a charm against lightning and fire, or against disease affecting the health of livestock. The symbol appears frequently in monastic medieval tithe barns (fig. 91),20 20 On one of the large bracing struts of the timber frame of the thirteenth-century Monastery Barn of Ter Doest, in Maritime Flanders, Belgium, there are seven six-lobed rosettes. For a brief account of this barn, see Horn and Born, 1965. and survives to this very day in the repertoire of decorative motifs, which are locally referred to as "hex-signs," on numerous barns in the state of Pennsylvania, in the United States of America (fig. 92).21 21 With regard to the so-called hex signs of the Pennsylvania Dutch barns, see Mahr, 1945, 1-32; Morrison, 1952, 545-46; and Sloane, 1954, 66ff. II.1.4 WESTERN APSE ALTAR OF ST. PETER The western apse (exedra) of the Church is dedicated to St. Peter. Its floor is raised above the level of the nave by two steps (gradus) and it is furnished with a wall bench which follows the apse in its entire circumference. A square in the center of the apse is designated as the altar of St. Peter by a hexameter: Hic Petrus eclae pastor sortitur honor? Here Peter, the shepherd of the Church, allots honor This location of the altar of St. Peter at the western end of the Church, in counterposition to that of St. Paul at the eastern end, is doubtlessly patterned after the churches of these two primary apostles in Rome, where the altar of St. 84. PLAN OF ST. GALL, ATRIUM, TOWERS, AND WESTERN PART OF CHURCH This layout, of consummate beauty and unique in its own period, has only one parallel in Early Christian architecture (fig. 161). The Church of the Plan is preceded by a semicircular atrium surrounding an open pratellum, which is in turn flanked by two imposing circular towers built for symbolic rather than functional purposes. There is no façade as in the great Early Christian prototype churches designed to receive huge metropolitan crowds. The Church of the Plan of St. Gall is constructed for monks and—inward-turned—faces the outside world with a counter apse housing the altar of St. Peter. Peter's faced west, while the altar of St. Paul's faced east.22 22 As correctly and strongly stressed by Poeschel, 1956, 135-36. See also Iso Müller, in Studien, 1962, 139; and Arens, 1938, 61, note 89. The importance of the cult of St. Peter and St. Paul and the close association with Rome that it suggests finds expression in the fact that their altars are installed in the apses, where they are second only to the high altar. They are smaller than the high altar but larger than any of the other altars, including the altar of the Holy Cross in the center of the nave of the Church. A further sign of distinction is that their function is expressed in the form of a verse rather than the simple word altare by which the altars in the transept and the nave are designated. Poeschel's suggestion that the squares in the two apses of the Church should be interpreted as "pulpits" or "lecterns" rather than as altars appears to me untenable, both in the light of their inscriptions23 23 Poeschel, loc. cit. On the eucharistic implications of the word honores, used in the inscriptions of both altars, see Father Iso Müller, op. cit., 137-38. Poeschel is disturbed by the fact that the squares in the apses of St. Peter and St. Paul are not inscribed with the word altare, as most of the other altars are. If they were meant to serve as lecterns or pulpits for special devotional functions, as Poeschel suggests, it should be equally disturbing that they are not inscribed with the word analogium or ambo, as are all the other pulpits or lecterns of the Plan of St. Gall (two easternmost bays of the nave and Refectory); see below, p. 136. There was no need to identify the altars of the two primary apostles with the word altare, as their purpose was already expressed in the more explicit form of verse. The fact that the two altars are not decorated with a cross does not militate against this interpretation. Five other altars in the Church (including the all-important high altar) lack this sign, as Poeschel himself has pointed out. Nor should it come as a surprise that the altars in the two apses are not enclosed by any chancel barriers. They stand in areas that are not easily accessible to the secular visitors of the Church. The eastern apse is entirely outside the reach of any layman, and the western apse was undoubtedly protected by a rail, like the choir in front of it. and in view of their location. The apse is the place par excellence for altars.24 24 Of scores of examples that could be cited, I refer only to the Abbey Church of St.-Riquier (altar of St. Richarius in the eastern apse), the Abbey Church of Fulda (altar of the Saviour), not to speak of the great Constantinian prototype church, Old St. Peter's (altar of St. Peter in the west apse); see Effman, 1912, fig. 8; Beumann and Grossmann, 1949, 45, figs. 3 and 4; and Toynbee and Ward-Perkins, 1953, 202, fig. 20, and 215, fig. 22. Moreover, the raised floor level, the semicircular wall bench for the worshiping monks, and the carefully segregated choir (chorus) in the two contiguous bays of the nave have distinct eucharistic implications and would be meaningless were they not connected liturgically with the rituals performed at an altar (see fig. 84). II.1.5 AISLES The apse with the altar of St. Peter would not have been readily accessible to visiting pilgrims and noblemen; on the contrary, those who entered the Church at the two extreme corners of the aisles found their progress blocked in the nave by the choir of St. Peter, and in each of the aisles by four altars, forcing them into a narrow passageway along the arcades, through which they could move eastward to gain access to the sanctuary in the crypt of the Church. The altars of the aisles are located at intervals of 40 feet and are carefully aligned with every second pair of nave columns. Each of these altars is surmounted by a cross, shown in horizontal projection. Each altar is enclosed by its own chancel barrier that extends laterally toward the walls of the church, thus dividing the floor space of the outer two-thirds of the aisles into separate stations for worship. The altars of the northern aisle, as we move west to east, are dedicated as follows: the first one, jointly to SS. Lucia and Cecilia (altar s?c? cie &amp; cecilie); the second, to the Holy Innocents (altare sco?r?r? innocent); the third, to St. Martin (altare sci martini); the fourth, to St. Stephen (altare s?c? stephani mar?). The dedications of the corresponding altars in the southern aisle are: the first one, jointly to SS. Agatha and Agnes (altare sctar agtae &amp; agnet);25 25 According to a new reading proposed by Bischoff (cf. Müller, in Studien, 1962, 158-59). Earlier authors interpreted this title as reading SS. Catherine and Agnes (altare sc?tar? catherine &amp; agnetis); cf. Reinhardt, 1952, 10. the second, to St. Sebastian (altare sci sebastiani); the third, to St. Mauritius (altare sci maricii); and the fourth, to St. Lawrence (altare sancti laurenci). The names of these saints are written in the barely legible pale-brown ink used by the second scribe. The choice for the patrocinium of these altars, if Father Iso Müller is correct,26 26 Müller, in Studien, 1962, 170ff. was influenced by the layout of the altars in the Abbey Church of St.-Riquier, and in certain cases, where parallels with St.-Riquier cannot be drawn, by the existence in the monastery of St. Gall of relics not available elsewhere. II.1.6 NAVE The nave (figs. 84, 93 and 99) is 40 feet wide and 180 feet long. Its clerestory rests on nine arcades, with columns spaced at intervals of 20 feet on center. In three places the nave is blocked in its entirety by cross partitions which make it impossible for anyone at any point within the nave to move in a straight line from the western apse to the transept. The first of these screens connects the second pair of columns; the second lies in line with the fifth pair; and the third, midway between the seventh and eighth pair. In addition, in three places, the nave is also railed off from the aisles: in the third arcade, the sixth, and the last one-and-a-half arcades. The spaces thus segregated isolate the areas reserved for the monks from those accessible to the laymen. CHOIR OF ST. PETER Between the two westernmost arcades of the nave an area 22½ feet wide and 32½ feet long is screened off to serve as a choir (chorus) for the monks who chant before the altar of St. Peter. The railing of this choir has a wide central opening toward the altar of St. Peter, and two narrow lateral passages at the opposite end. What such choir 85. MEDIEVAL ROUND TOWER, NORTHWEST CORNER OF CATHEDRAL VALE OF GLENDALOUGH, WICKLOW, IRELAND The Old Irish word for these towers, some of which rise to over 100 feet, is CLOIGTHEACH or "bell tower;" but the placement in most of them of entrances well above ground level suggests they were used as places of refuge during attack. The earliest date from about 900. screens looked like may be inferred from the surviving choir and altar railings of the churches of Santa Sabina and San Clemente in Rome, as well as from numerous fragments of other screens of this type in Greek, Syrian, and Palestinian churches. The arrangement is traditional. We are showing as a typical example a reconstruction of the presbytery of the Basilica of Thasos, Macedonia (fig. 94), which also displays the Early Christian prototype for the semicircular wall benches in the two apses of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall.27 27 After Orlandos, II, 1954, 528, fig. 493. For Santa Sabina in Rome see Deichmann, 1958, pl. 28; for San Clemente, Matt, 1950, pl. 99; for other Macedonian examples, Orlandos, II, 1954, 526-27, figs. 490-92. BAPTISMAL FONT AND ALTAR The space between the first and second cross-partitions of the nave serves as a baptistery. In the westernmost bay is the baptismal font of the Church, and in the bay next to it, an altar dedicated jointly to SS. John the Baptist and John the Evangelist (altare sc?? iohannis &amp; sc?? ioh? euangelistae). The baptismal font (fons) is marked by two concentric circles and the hexameter: Ecce renascentes susceptat x?p?s? alumnos See, it is here that Christ receives reborn disciples Francis Bond interpreted these two rings as representing "either a circular piscina or a circular font."28 28 Bond, 1908, 29. The first proposition in this alternative must, I think, be abandoned. Baptismal fonts constructed in the form of piscinae sunk below the level of the pavement were common in Early Christian times and during the period of conversion of the barbaric tribes, when the majority of the people to be baptized were adults. But in Carolingian times (with the notable exception of the conversion of the Saxons, as Bond himself points out),29 29 Ibid. the baptism of adults had become unusual. Babies,30 30 A capitulary issued by Charlemagne between 775 and 790 directed that all children be baptized during their first year of life. Although this law applied mainly to the newly conquered Saxon territories, it was not likely to have been issued had it not reflected a general custom. Capitulatio de Partibus Saxoniae, 775-790, chap. 19; ed. Boretius, Mon. Germ. Hist., Leg. II, Cap., I, 1883, 69: "Similiter placuit his decretis inserere, quod omnes infantes infra annum baptizantur." unable to stand upright, had to be dipped into the water by the officiating priest and this could be done successfully only if the water level were brought within reasonable range of the priest as he bent over to perform the ceremonial immersion of the child. The elevated tub-shaped water font was the logical answer to this need. A convention of bishops held at the banks of the Danube River in the summer of 796 reaffirmed an old ecclesiastical directive according to which baptismal rites could be held only at Pentecost and Easter, except in cases of extreme urgency.31 31 Conventus episcoporum ad ripas Danubii, 796; ed. Werminghoff, Mon. Germ. Hist., Conc., II, 1906-9, 173: "Duo tantummodo legitima tempora, in quibus sacramenta baptismatis . . . sunt celebranda, Pascha . . . et Pentecosten." This may explain the large dimensions of the font of the Plan of St. Gall, whose diameter runs over 6 feet. That same convention took it for granted that the baptismal rite should be performed "in a font, or some such vessel, in which one can be immersed thrice in the name of the Holy Trinity" (in fonte, vel tali vase, ubi in nomine sanctae trinitatis trina mersio fieri possit).32 32 Conventus ad Ripas Danubii, 796; ibid., 175. Baptismal fonts were in general made of stone, but a directive issued in 852 by Bishop Hincmar of Reims orders that "if a parish church cannot afford a baptismal font of stone, it must provide for other suitable substitutes,"33 33 Hincmari Rhemensis archiepiscopi opera omnia; Migne, Patr. Lat., col. 773: "Et qui fontes lapideos habere nequiverit, vas conveniens ad hoc solummodo baptizandi officium habeat." which can only refer to portable wooden tubs. A charming picture of a baptismal rite performed in such a temporary contrivance may be found in one of the marginal illuminations of the Luttrell Psalter (fig. 95).34 34 Luttrell Psalter, London, Brit. Mus., Add. Mus. 42130, fol. 97; see Millar, 1932, pl. 34. Circular fonts of stone exist in many places; like the font of the Plan of St. Gall, they usually are raised on a plinth. I show as typical examples (fig. 96 and 97) a highly decorated font in the church of Deerhurst, Gloucestershire, England, of pre-Conquest date,35 35 For the font of Deerhurst, see Bond, 1908, 128; and Gilbert, 1956, 6. and a larger cylindrical font of around 1100 now in the possession of Dr. Peter Ludwig, Aachen.36 36 Here reproduced by courtesy of Dr. Peter Ludwig, to whom I owe the following information: Height, 95-96 cm.; diameter, 97.5 cm. The walls of the font are slightly curved and slightly askew. A similar font, from Petershausen (Cochem) is now in Feldkirchen (Neuwied). See Kunstdenkmäler Rheinland-Pfalz, 647, fig. 489. In the Middle Ages the baptismal font usually stood in the northern aisle of the church close to the western entrance.37 37 See the article "Baptismal Font" in the Catholic Encyclopedia, II, 1907, 274-75. The arrangement on the Plan of St. Gall where the font is placed into the very axis of the church is unusual38 38 Although not unique; fonts are found in the same place, according to Pudelko, 1932, 15, in the churches of Halberstadt, Gernrode, and Magdeburg. and probably owes its existence to the desire to restrict the services for the laymen to the nave in order to keep the aisles clear for the passage of the pilgrims who wished to visit the tomb of St. Gall. ALTAR OF THE SAVIOR AT THE CROSS &amp; THE PLACE OF WORSHIP FOR LAYMEN The space between the second and third transverse partitions of the nave serves as the parish church for the monastery's serfs and tenants and as the place of worship for the pilgrims and visitors. It contains between the sixth pair of columns the altar of the Saviour at the Cross (altar sc? saluatoris ad crucem). This altar is surmounted by a large 86. TABRIZ, IRAN. RECONSTRUCTION AFTER PASCAL COSTE [after Saare, Denkmäler Persischer Baukunst, Berlin, 1901, 29, fig. 26] The masjed i Kebud or Blue Mosque was built by Jehan Shah of the Kira Kuyumli dynasty (1437-1467). The mosque, now in ruins, is of a type reaching far back to the early centuries of Mohammedism. cross shown in horizontal projection, and has ascribed to it the hexameter: Crux pia uita salus miseriq, redemptio mundi39 39 Willis (1848, 94) mistakenly read via instead of pia. Leclercq (in Cabrol-Leclercq, VI:1, 1924, col. 94) copied the error. Pious cross: life, health, and redemption of the wretched world The cross rises 10 feet above the altar, and has a spread of 7½ feet. Altars in honor of the Holy Cross existed in the abbey churches of Centula, Fulda, Corvey-on-the-Weser, St. Vaast at Arras, the Cathedral of Le Mans, and at many other places.40 40 For Centula, see Effmann, 1912, fig. 8; for Fulda, see Beumann and Grossmann, 1949, 45, figs. 3 and 4; for Corvey-on-the-Weser, Rave, 1957, 94, fig. 83; a comprehensive treatment of the subject may be found in the chapter "Heiligkreuzalter" in Braun, 1924, 401-406. As in the Church of the Plan of St. Gall, they were located in the axis of the church at a point lying midway between the eastern and western ends of the church. AMBO The last 1½ bays of the nave are again completely screened off by railings. In the center of this enclosure, which is accessible by two lateral passages from the west and a central passage from the east, there rises a circular pulpit (ambo) on a concentric plinth 10 feet in diameter, from which "is recited the lesson of evangelic peace" (hic euangelacae recitat' lectio pacis). The Plan does not tell us from what side the ambo was entered. But since it was from here that the abbot or visiting bishop addressed the crowd congregated around the altar of the Holy Cross, the lectern side of the ambo must have been at the west, the entrance side at the east. Pulpits of this kind were in use in Early Christian churches from the fourth century onward.41 41 For early documentary sources, see the article "Ambon" by Leclercq in Cabrol-Leclercq, I, 1907, cols. 1330-47; the article "Ambo" in Reallexikon der Deutschen Kunstgeschichte, I, 1937, cols. 627-35. They were of circular, ovoid, or polygonal shape. A typical example from the church of Hagia Sophia, in Salonica, now in the Museum of Constantinople, is shown in figure 98.42 42 After Orlandos, II, 1954, 546, fig. 511. For other examples, see ibid., 544-66, and the articles cited in the preceding notes. A remarkable medieval specimen is the ambo of Henry II in the Palace Chapel at Aachen (Doberen, 1957, 308-59). In our reconstruction of the ambo of the Plan of St. Gall, we have aimed at a solution that lies stylistically somewhere between the ambo of Hagia Sophia at Salonica and the ambo of Henry II at Aachen. LECTERNS FOR READING Further east of the ambo, yet within the same enclosure, are "two lecterns for reading" (analogia duo ad legend?), one to be used "at night" (in nocte), the other, by implication, in the daytime. They are built against the railing that separates the nave from the crossing and must have faced eastward toward the place where the monks congregated. The existence of these two lecterns suggests that the service books which they supported were so large that they could not be easily held in the hand. This holds true, practically without exception, for the Carolingian Bibles and Psalters.43 43 For typical cases see Koehler, I, 1930, pl. 42-52 (Grandval Bible) and pl. 69-89 (Vivian Bible); and Merton, 1923, pl. XXI-XXVI (Folchart Psalter) and XXVIII-XXXII (Psalterium aureum). II.1.7 TRANSEPT The transept (fig. 99) is separated from nave and aisles by screens that run across the entire width of the Church. It is also divided internally into separate compartments by means of longitudinal screens that separate the crossing from the transept arms, and within the latter there is a further separation of the areas reserved for the monks from the passages that take the pilgrims through the transept into the crypt. The monks and priests who seek access to the crossing and to the presbytery must cross these passages. The layout of the transept and the choir that adjoins it in the east is complex and, sometime after the Plan was drawn, someone—perhaps the author of the Plan himself— considered it desirable that the boundaries of the constituent spaces of this part of the Church be made more conspicuous. He put them into visual prominence by redrawing them in a dark brown ink, thus distinguishing the principal architectural partitions from the furnishings shown in the interior of these spaces. In consequence all the transept walls, as well as the boundary lines between the crossing and the transept arms, as well as the two lateral walls of the presbytery, were rendered twice, first in red, and subsequently in brown ink. THE CROSSING SQUARE AND ITS FURNISHINGS The crossing is the "choir for the psalmodists" (chorus psallentium). It is furnished with four "benches" (formulae). Schmidt's interpretation of formulae as lecterns (Pulte) appears to me untenable. In the ninth century only the directing monk held an antiphonary in his hands; and this was too small to require even one lectern,44 44 Schmidt, 1956, 372. That Carolingian antiphonaries were of small size was pointed out to me by my colleague Richard L. Crocker. Johannes Duft, in a personal note addressed to me on 21 July 1967, writes: "My knowledge of the antiphonaries of the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries fully confirms this view. They are small books, held in the hands of the monks who conducted the liturgical songs." let alone four of the size of the formulae on the Plan of St. Gall which are 10 feet long and at least 2½, probably 3¾, feet wide. Moreover, the scribe's term for "lectern" is not formula but analogium and in the three places where lecterns are shown on the Plan, they are rendered either as simple squares (the two lecterns by the rail that separates the crossing from the nave of the Church; see end of preceding paragraph) or as a square with a circle inscribed (the Reader's lectern in the Refectory; see below, p. 268f). Formula, a diminutive of forma44a 44a For sources and a more detailed discussion of this interesting term see III, Glossary, s.v. (used in the same sense) is the common medieval designation for "bench" or "choirstall" as well as for those wooden supports that are used for kneeling in prayer (prieDieu—kneeling chair—Betstuhl) or to be leaned upon in the act of inclination (hence also called inclinatoria) to preclude excessive physical strain during the long hours of religious devotion, a problem that had been of considerable concern to the fathers of early monasticism.44b 44b On early monastic attitudes concerning the need for alleviation of devotional strain (onus, labor) through diversity (diversitas) and physical relaxation (relevatio) with the goal of attaining spiritual delight and refreshment (delectatio), see the interesting study of Gindele, 1966, 321-26. In the choir stalls of later monastic churches (and to an even higher degree the large cathedral churches) both of these appurtenances are combined into a single piece of furniture, consisting of a wooden range of seats with panelled lean-to's in the back and a solid range of supports for kneeling and prayer in front.44c 44c For good examples see Viollet-le-Duc, Dictionnaire Raisonné, VIII (Paris, n.d.), 461ff, s.v. "Stalle"; Loose, 1931, passim and Ganz-Seeger, 1946, passim. The formulae in the crossing of the Church of the Plan may have been an early variant of this type of seat. In their simplest form, one might imagine them to have looked like the church bench from Alpirsbach (fig. 100) with supports for kneeling and bending either physically attached to them or placed separately in front of them. The reader may have observed that the formulae of the crossing are a little wider than the corresponding benches in the two transept arms (also called formulae). The latter have the standard width of 2½ feet used by the designer for benches wherever they appear on the Plan. The former look as though they were meant to be 3¾ feet wide (1½ standard modules). I think that this distinction is intentional, i.e., that the designer used this variation in size to emphasize the greater liturgical importance of the formulae of the crossing square.44d 44d See the remarks made above, p. 95, on the occasional use of a submodule of 1¼ feet by the designer of the Plan, besides the standard module of 2½ feet. In two essays published in 1965 and 1967/6844e 44e Gindele, 1965, 22-35 and idem 1967/68, 193-97. Father Corbinian Gindele expressed the view that the location of the formulae in the crossing square (all at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the Church) indicates that the entire choir of monks when seated faced the altar in an easterly direction (versus or contra altare) in compliance with a custom which he claims was common in Early Christian times, rather than facing each other transversely across the altar from two opposite rows of seats ranged longitudinally along the walls of the altar space, as became the rule in later Cluniac monasteries. This is incorrect visual exegesis. The four formulae in the crossing square when fully occupied could seat no more than four monks each, altogether sixteen (counting as normal requirement a sitting area 2½ feet square per person). The full contingent of monks attending 88. ALTAR OF MITHRAS. WIESBADEN, ALTERTUMSMUSEUM FROM THE MITHRAS SANCTUARY, HEDDERNHEIM [photo: Horn] The six- or eight-lobed rosette (a misnomer, since it is by origin a symbol of stellar, not chthonic forces) appears in Near Eastern imagery as an attribute of gods and royalty from the 3rd millennium onward. It became associated with Mithras after his cult was established in the Euphrates Valley. It spread westward into Rome as Rome increased its hold on Asia, finding a stronghold in the army among tradesmen and slaves, mainly Asiatics. Christian antagonism to Mithraism prevented the rosette from becoming one of Christ's personal attributes along with the halo, globe, and canopy (cf. figs. 102-103), all of which Christ inherited from pagan deities. Despite official antagonism, the rosette was nevertheless widely diffused in the Christian communities of Syria and North Africa and with fervor adopted by the Germanic invaders of Rome. 89. MORTUARY LANTERN Pers, deux-sevres, france [Archives photographiques d'art et d'histoire: Monuments historiques, Sept. 1890] "Lanterns of the Dead" are tall, hollow columns of stone, often of considerable height, with entrances at the bottom and small pavilions at the top, where the light of a lamp during the night signaled existence of a cemetery or seigneurial tomb. The specimen here shown is one of the finest of its kind. the daily services ranged between 100 and 110 (see below, p. 342). These could not under any circumstances have been accommodated by the four free-standing benches of the crossing square. The Plan shows with unequivocal clarity where the main body of monks was seated: on the long bench that runs along the walls of the presbytery and through the round of the apse, as well as on supplementary benches ranged along the walls of the two transept arms. If in the course of the development that led from Early Christian to medieval monasticism, the seats of the monks were shifted from an eastward-facing position to one in which the monks faced each other transversely from either side of the altar, this shift must have been undertaken before the Plan of St. Gall was drawn. The seating arrangement for the monks shown on the Plan of St. Gall, however, in fact follows a pattern that had already been firmly established for the bishop and the secular clergy in the days of p. 154 Constantine the Great (fig. 104) and in the course of the fifth and sixth centuries become standard for the great episcopal churches, both in the eastern and western part of the empire.44f 44f For more detail on this, see below under "Apse," pp. 143ff. The four free-standing benches in the crossing square must have had a function distinct from that of the wall benches in the presbytery, the apse and the transept arms. I am inclined to assume (accepting a suggestion made by my colleague, Richard L. Crocker) that they served as seats for the specially trained singers who chanted the more difficult sequences of the psalms in alternation with the regular monks. A magnificent twelfth-century example of the type of bench we might expect to have found in the crossing of the Church of the Plan is shown in figure 100.45 45 From the Church of Alpirsbach (Black Forest); destroyed during World War II; see Müller-Christensen, 1950, 11, figs. 2 and 3; and Falke, 1924, pl. 1. On the eastern side of the crossing, two flights of stairs of "seven steps" (septem gradus, similit) lead up into the fore choir. Halfway up these steps, against the crossing piers, there is, to the left, the "altar of St. Benedict" (altar? sc?? benedicti), to the right, the "altar of St. Columban" (altar? sc? col?bani). The presence of the altars of St. Benedict and St. Columban in such a prominent place is not surprising. They are the representatives of the two great monastic traditions, the Irish and the Benedictine, which shaped the history of the monastery of St. Gall.46 46 Cf. Poeschel, 1956, 138; and Müller, in Studien, 1962, 141-45. In the Abbey Church of St. Riquier, the altars of St. John and St. Martin were in exactly corresponding positions; see Effmann, 1912, fig. 8. SOUTHERN TRANSEPT ARM In the southern transept arm, against the east wall on a platform raised by two steps (gradus), is the "altar of St. Andrew" (alt? sc? andreae). It is a little larger than the altars in the aisles of the Church, but smaller than the altars of St. Paul and St. Peter in the apses. The three remaining walls of this transept arm are lined with benches providing sitting space for twenty monks. A freestanding bench (formula) in the center of the floor can accommodate five more monks. Like the corresponding benches in the crossing, this bench must have been reserved for the trained singers. The layout suggests that in such cases where professional celebrations required that the full choir of monks be split into smaller segments officiating simultaneously in different parts of the Church, each transept arm was so laid out as to be capable of serving as a liturgically autonomous station. The southern transept arm has entrances which make it possible for the monks to enter it directly from the Dormitory for night services (Matins) and at daybreak (Lauds), and from the northeastern corner of the Cloister for the day offices. A door in the east gives access to the Sacristy. From the Dormitory the southern transept arm could only be reached by a "night" stairway. The draftsman does not tell us anything about the course or the landing of this stairway, but stairways just like this exist in the corresponding places in the abbey churches of Fontenay (Côted'Or) and Noirlac (Cher), France, and in the Priory Church of Hexham (Northumberland), England (fig. 101).47 47 For Fontenay and Noirlac, see Aubert, I, 1947, 304, fig. 220, and 303, fig. 218; for Hexham, see Hodges, 1913; Cook, 1961, 66 and pl. VIII; Cook-Smith, 1960, fig. 39. The traces of others, not quite as well preserved, may be found in the abbeys of Tintern (Monmouthshire), Beaulieu (Hampshire), Hayles (Gloucestershire), and at St. Augustine's in Bristol.48 48 For Tintern Abbey, see Brakspear, 1936, 9 and plan; for Beaulieu Abbey, see Fowler, 1911, 71 and pl. XXVI, and VHC, Hampshire, IV, 1911, plan facing 652; for Hayles Abbey, see Brakspear, 1901, 126-35; for St. Augustine's in Bristol, see Cook, 1961, 66 and pl. IX. NORTHERN TRANSEPT ARM The layout of the northern transept arm is identical with that of its southern counterpart. Its altar is dedicated jointly to SS. Philip and James (alt? sc? philippi et iacobi). A door in the north wall communicates with the Abbot's House, another one in the east wall leads into the Scriptorium. II.1.8 PRESBYTERY HIGH ALTAR: ST. MARY AND ST. GALL Raised as it is by seven steps above the level of the transept, the presbytery with its high altar dominates the entire Church. The liturgical pre-eminence of this part of the building is emphasized by a hexameter in capitalis rustica: SC?A SUPER CRPT? SC??RUM STRUCTA NITEBUNT ABOVE THE CRYPT THE HOLY STRUCTURES OF THE SAINTS SHALL SHINE. The "holy structures" are the high altar of the Church, dedicated jointly to St. Mary and St. Gall (altare sc?? mariae &amp; sc? galli) and the tomb of the holy body (sacrophag? sc? 89.

The joint patrocinium of Mary and St. Gall has its explanation in the fact that Mary was the patron of the original oratory of St. Gall. The deeds of the Monastery disclose how in the course of the eighth century the name of St. Gall began to be associated with that of Mary with increasing frequency until it eventually replaced it entirely and became the local place name (coenobium sancti Galli, or sancti Galloni).49 49 Cf. Müller, in Studien, 1962, 134-36. The altar is raised on a plinth, a distinction not accorded any other altars in the Church. We must expect it to have been surmounted by a canopy. A capitulary issued by Charlemagne in 789 directs that altars should be surmounted by such superstructures (Ut super altaria teguria fiant vel laquearia).50 50 Duplex legationis edictum, May 23, 789, chap. 33; ed. Boretius, Mon. Germ. Hist., Leg. II, Cap., I, 1883, 64. Considering the vast number of altars with which churches were equipped during this period, it is possible that the law applied only to the high altar. An ancient symbol of the celestial dome and hence, by implication, of universal rulership, this motif had been transmitted from the Roman p. 154 gods (fig. 102.A)51 51 After Gnecchi, II, 1912, pl. 84, 5. to the Roman emperor, as he rose into the rank of the gods (fig. 102.B),52 52 After Mattingly, II, 1930, pl. 77, 9. and from the emperor to Christ as Christ acquired the status of a Roman state god. It was no lesser person than Constantine the Great who set a conspicuous precedent for this transmission of celestial prerogatives to the new God of Heaven when he adorned the high altar of the latter's prime apostle with a pedimented canopy richly revetted with silver and gold, in the Church of St. Peter's in Rome (fig. 104).53 53 For a reconstruction of Constantine's canopy, see Toynbee and Ward-Perkins, 1956, 202, fig. 20. WALL BENCHES Wall benches lined both sides of the fore choir and continued into the round of the apse. The monks faced each other vultus contra vultum from either side of the altar, except for those who sat in the curving parts of the apse, and faced the altar westward. The abbot presumably sat at the apex of the apse and had a counterpart in the choir master, who occupied a position of comparable centrality in the middle of the crossing square. The layout of the benches discloses that crossing and presbytery— despite their different levels—formed liturgically a unitary space; and a count of the sitting places available for the monks in the areas screened off for their exclusive use in the eastern parts of the Church suggests that when the entire community participated at a common service, even the benches in the transept arms were occupied by monks attending the service,53a 53a Cf. my remarks on the seating facilities in presbytery and transept made above, pp. 137ff. . On the north side "an upper entrance leads into the library above the crypt" (introitus in bibliothec? sup cript? superius). The qualifying adjective "upper" implies the existence of a "lower" entrance, which must have made the library accessible from the Scriptorium below it. The prototype for the raised platform of the presbytery and the apse of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall was the raised presbytery that Pope Gregory the Great had installed in Old St. Peter's in Rome between 594 and 604 (fig. 104) by lifting the pavement of the new choir 5 feet above the original floor of the church and establishing below this platform a crypt that incorporated directly beneath the new altar the old shrine of St. Peter, which before this alteration had been exposed to view.54 54 Ward-Perkins, op. cit., 215-20. TOMB OF ST. GALL AND ITS RELATION TO THE CRYPT There has been considerable discussion on whether the tomb of St. Gall should be interpreted as standing in the presbytery above, or in the crypt below it; and whether, if in the crypt, it should be thought of as standing behind or underneath the altar.55 55 For the latest discussion, see Reinhardt, 1952, 20, where the tomb is reconstructed standing directly beneath the altar. It should be remarked that on the Plan the tomb is entered on the east side of the altar, and that the plurality of "holy structures" referred to in the affixed hexameter as "shining above the crypt" should lead one to think that the sarcophagus stood in the upper sanctuary. Despite these facts, it has generally been assumed that the tomb of St. Gall was meant to stand in the crypt underneath the presbytery, and for good reason, since it was the desire to find appropriate protection for the relics, in the first place, that had led to the invention of crypts. The proper solution to this puzzle may have been found by Willis when he speculated, "It is not impossible that although the real sepulchre of the saint was in the confessionary or crypt below, a monument to his honour may have been erected above the altar."56 56 Willis, 1948, 96. I am returning to this point in greater detail below, pp. 169ff. That such a double-storied structure actually existed in St. Gall is suggested by two tales reported in the Miracles of St. Gall. One of these tales speaks of a cripple who was taken by his friends to the memoriam B. Galli and daily "laid close to the sepulcher in the crypt" (cottidie juxta sepulchrum in crypta collocatus). Another tale mentions "a lamp which burned nightly before the upper altar and tomb and which also threw some light through a small window upon the altar of the crypt" (lumen quod ante superius altare et tumbam ardebat per quandam fenestrum radios suos ad altare infra cryptam positum dirigebat).57 57 Willis, loc. cit. The Life and Miracles of St. Gall was written by an anonymous monk of St. Gall during the last third of the eighth century. At the request of Abbot Gozbert (816-837) this work was re-edited in 833-34 by Walahfrid Strabo, who incorporated into his edition a continuation of the account of the miracles which had been written by the Monk Gozbertus, a nephew of Abbot Gozbert. Best edition: Vita Galli confessoris triplex, ed. Bruno Krusch, Mon. Germ. Hist., Script. rer. merov., IV, Hannover, 1902, 229-337. The miracles to which Willis refers belong to the part that was written by the Monk Gozbertus. See "Vita Galli auctore Walahfrido," Liber II, chaps. 31 and 24, ed. Krusch, 1902, 331 and 328-29. Some further information concerning the topographical relation of tomb and altar at St. Gall can 93. PLAN OF ST. GALL. NAVE AND AISLES OF CHURCH In the axis of the nave, west to east: baptismal font, altar of SS John the Baptist and John the Evangelist, altar of the Saviour at the Holy Cross, ambo; and midway between the two latter, two crucial inscriptions designating the nave as 40 feet wide, and each aisle, 20 feet wide. In the north aisle, west to east: altars of SS Lucia and Cecilia, The Holy Innocents, SS Martin and Stephen. In the south aisle: SS Agatha and Agnes, St. Sebastian, SS Mauritius and Lawrence. be extracted from the Life of St. Gall. The author of this work informs us that on his death at Arbon, October 16, about the year 646, the body of the Saint was taken to his oratory at St. Gall and buried in a grave dug between the altar and the wall.58 58 "Sepulchrum deinceps inter aram et parietem peractum est, ac melodiis caelestibus resonantibus corpus terrae conditum." See "Vita Galli auctore Wettino," Liber II, chap. 32, ed. Krusch, 1902, 275. Forty years later, his sepulcher was violated by plunderers who mistook the coffin for a treasure chest, but Boso, Bishop of Constance, replaced the coffin "housing the relics of the sacred body, in a worthy sarcophagus between the altar and the wall, erecting over it a memorial structure congruent with the merits of the God-chosen."59 59 "His aliisque exortationibus finitis, sancti corporis globa in sarcofago digno inter aram et parietem sepulturae tradebatur, atque super illud memoria meritis electi Dei congruens aedificabatur." See "Vita Galli auctore Wettino," Liber II, chap. 36, ed. Krusch, 1902, 277. The chronicles of St. Gall report no further translation of the Saint, and from this fact, as Willis concluded correctly, it has to be inferred that the location of the tomb remained the same, even in Gozbert's church.60 60 Willis, 1848, 96. Nowhere in any contemporary allusions to the sepulcher of the Saint, is the tomb reported to stand underneath the altar. II.1.9 EASTERN APSE ALTAR OF ST. PAUL The eastern apse (exedra) houses the altar of St. Paul, which is designated with the hexameter: Hic pauli dignos magni celebramus honores Here we celebrate the honors worthy of the great St. Paul It has been argued that St. Paul was given this prominent position in the Church of St. Gall because he was the patron saint of an earlier church torn down in 830 to make room for Abbot Gozbert's new building. This contention has no base in fact. In the entire historical tradition of the Abbey of St. Gall there is no source that would attest the existence of a sanctuary dedicated to St. Paul.61 61 That a previous church was dedicated to St. Paul was first claimed by Keller, 1844, 9 and subsequently taken over by Braun, 1924, 389. The theory was refuted by Hecht in 1928, 14-15; Boeckelman, 1956, 137 and, Poeschel, 1961, 19. SYNTHRONON The apse has the full width of the fore choir and is furnished in its entire circumference with a wall bench that continues the course of the fore choir benches. Together, this range of benches offers sitting space for forty-eight monks and the abbot. Its curved portion in the apse is broader than the two straight arms in the presbytery. The latter are 2½ feet wide (1 standard module); whereas the former look as though they were meant to have a width of 3¾ feet (1½ standard modules). Again I think that this dimensional differentiation is deliberate and that the designer used it to stress the hierarchical prominence of that portion of the bench on which the abbot and the senior monks were seated, thus distinguishing it from the seats where monks of lesser status were placed westward in sequence of decreasing seniority. The designer had used the same device in stressing the greater liturgical significance of the benches for the specially trained singers (formulae) in the crossing square in relation to those located in the transept arms. To seat the highest dignitaries of the ecclesiastical community on a semicircular bench raised against the wall of the apse (synthronon) is not a monastic invention, but a transference to monastic ritual of a custom established in the secular church. In Palestine this arrangement is attested, as early as 314 A.D., for the basilica of Tyre (fig. 104), built by Bishop Paulinus (known through an unusually accurate and detailed description by Eusebius) and such later fourth-century buildings as the Constantinian Nativity Church in Bethlehem (333 A.D.), the basilica of Emmaus (first half of the fourth century), the cathedral of Gerasa (third quarter of the fourth century), and the Church of the Multiplication of the Bread at et-Tabgha (end of the fourth century). Toward the turn of the same century it also appears at the coast of Istria in the so-called Chiesetta at Grado and Santa Maria delle Grazie at Grado. By the middle of the fifth century the layout is standard in most Near-Eastern countries, and above all in Greece. Frequently the semicircular benches in the apse are prolonged by two straight arms reaching westward into the bema. Good examples of this arrangement are the basilica of Thasos (figs. 94 and 144) and the magnificent church of Corinth-Lechaion (fig. 161). The Constantinian basilicas of Rome do not appear to have been provided with this type of bench for Bishop and clergy—unless they were built in wood, leaving no traces for posterity—but toward the end of the sixth century a synthronon of impressive monumentality was set up by Pope Gregory the Great in the apse of the most venerable church of western Christendom, Old St. Peter's (fig. 103) forming a sight of inescapable impressiveness to every transalpine visitor of Rome, layman or clergyman, and inter alia the physical stage for Charlemagne's coronation on Christmas day of the year 800.61a 61a On the archaeology and history of the synthronon in Greece and the Near East see Soteriou, 1931, passim; Orlandos, 1952, 489ff; Hodinott, 1963, passim; Kraeling, 1938, passim, and Crowfoot, 1941, passim. For examples along the Adriatic coast see Egger, 1916, 29ff and 130 and Brusin-Zovatto, 1957, 419ff. All of this and much additional material is now conveniently compiled in Nussbaum's exhaustive study of 1965, with full bibliographical references to previous literature. On the reconstruction of the basilica of Tyre see Nussbaum, op. cit., 64-66 and the literature there cited; and for the description by Eusebius, on which this reconstruction is based: Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, ed. Lake, II, 1932, 426-27; ed. Williamson, 1965, 394. At what time precisely this seating arrangement was adopted by the monks is an unsolved historical problem. But it is not unreasonable to conjecture that its acceptance 94. THASOS, MACEDONIA Presbytery of the basilica, perspective reconstruction [after Orlandos, II, 1954, 528] in the monastic ritual was associated with the ascendancy (if not victory) of Benedictine monasticism over the more individualistic forms of Irish and Near-Eastern monachism. The earliest monastic example known to me is the synthronon of the royal abbey of St. Denis (fig. 167) consecrated in 775. Here the Abbot-father took his seat on a throne of bronze placed into the apex of the apse at the very spot where the bishop had his cathedra in episcopal churches. The seat, of Roman workmanship and known as "the throne of Dagobert" is still preserved, forming one of the treasures of the Cabinet des Médailles in Paris. Was it the close alliance between regnum and sacerdotium in the life and administration of the Abbey of St. Denis that gave the historical impetus for the transfer to the abbot of a liturgical prerogative formerly exclusively associated with episcopal churches? Is this another Carolingian innovation, foreshadowing the powerful role the monastery was to play as a supportive agency in the government of this great statesman and ruler? II.1.10 CRYPT OUTER CRYPT The crypt is composed of two parts: an outer corridor crypt, by which the visiting laymen gain access to the tomb of St. Gall, and an inner confessionary, reserved for the worship of the monks. The corridor crypt consists of two barrel-vaulted subterranean shafts (inuolutio arcuum) which run outside along the foundation walls of the fore choir and terminate in a transverse shaft a short distance west of the apse. The arched entrances to these shafts lie next to the eastern crossing piers. They are designated in the south, in cript? ingressus &amp;#x0288; egressus ("ingress into or egress from the crypt") and in the north, in cript? introitus &amp;#x0288; exitus ("entrance into or exit from the crypt") which suggests that although the tomb could be approached from two different sides, the pilgrims generally returned on the same side on which they had entered. There can be no doubt about the purpose of this outer crypt. It forms the continuation of two long passageways which lead the pilgrims in a straight line from the entrances in the west to the transverse shaft under the presbytery, bringing them right up to the tomb of St. Gall itself (fig. 82). INNER CRYPT On the other hand, it is equally clear that the inner crypt must have been used for the services the monks conducted before the tomb of St. Gall. Its entrance, between the two flights of stairs that lead from the crossing to the high altar, is in an area entirely set aside for the monks. It is designated with the title, "access to the confessio" (accessus ad confessionem). That such private oratories should be constructed "near the place where the sacred bodies rest, so that the brothers can pray in secrecy" (ut ubi corpora sanctorum requiescunt aliud oratorium habeatur, ubi fratres secrete possint orare), was ordered by Charlemagne in a capitulary issued in 789.62 62 Duplex legationis edictum, May 23, 789, chap. 7; ed. Boretius, Mon. Germ. Hist., Leg. II, Capit., I, 1883, 63. II.1.11 SACRISTY AND VESTRY In the corner between the fore choir and the southern transept arm, and directly attached to them, there is a double-storied structure, 40 feet square, which contains "below, the Sacristy, above, the repository for the church vestments" (subtus sacratorium, supra uesti? ec&amp;#x0288;ae repositio). The Plan gives the layout of the Sacristy. In the center a large square table for the sacred vessels (mensa sc?r? uasorum) is raised on a plinth. Benches and a chest or table are set against the walls, and the room is heated by a corner fireplace. The Plan does not disclose the location of any stairs connecting the Sacristy with the Vestry, but it is reasonable to assume that they were located above the arm of the corridor crypt that lies beneath the Sacristy.63 63 On the absence of stairs in general, see above, pp. 65ff. The custodianship of Sacristy and Vestry was the responsibility of the Sacrist (custos ecclesiae)64 64 For a more detailed definition of the Sacrist's charges, see below, p. 335. who also was in charge of the preparation of the host and the holy oil. This task was performed in a separate building, as the title indicates: the building where the holy bread is baked and where the oil is pressed (domus ad pparand? pan? scm? &amp; oleum exprimendum.); this building measures 22½ × 37½ feet and is connected to the Sacristy by a covered passageway that is bent twice at right angles. The room contains a press, a table, and an oven as well as benches all along the remaining parts of its walls. II.1.12 SCRIPTORIUM AND LIBRARY Hic sedeant sacrae scribentes famina legis, Nec non sanctorum dicta sacrata patrum; Hic interserere caveant sua frivola verbis, Frivola nec propter erret et ipsa manus, Correctosque sibi quaerant studiose libellos, Tramite quo recto penna volantis eat. Per cola distinguant proprios et commata sensus, Et punctos ponant ordine quosque suo Ne vel false legat, taceat vel forte repente Ante pios fratres lector in ecclesia. Est opus egregium sacros iam scribere libros, Nec mercede sua scriptor et ipse caret. Fodere quam vites melius est scribere libros, Ille suo ventri serviet, iste animae. Vel nova vel vetera poterit proferre magister Plurima, quisque legit dicta sacrata patrum. Here should the writers sit, transcribing sacred Law, Together with the inspired Fathers' gloss. Here let no empty words of writers' own creep in— Empty, as well, when hand or eye betray. By might and main they try for wholly perfect texts With flying pen along the straight-ruled line. Per cola et commata65 65 "Per cola et commata (by clauses and phrases)," a standard locution in every scriptorium, described St. Jerome's practice of dividing scriptural prose into rhetorical verses as assistance to a public reader: "But just as we are accustomed to copy Demosthenes and Cicero by clauses and phrases, even though they are composed in prose, not verse, so we, looking to the convenience of readers, have broken up our new translation by writing it in a new fashion." (St. Jerome, Preface to Isaiah, Patrologia Latina XXVIII, 771B; cf. 938-39. Consult Evaristo Arns, La technique du livre d'après St. Jérôme, Paris, 1953, pp. 114-15.) should make clear the sense When scribes insert right punctuation marks To prevent the lector, before reverend monks in church, From reading false, or stumblingly, or fast. Our greatest need these days is copying sacred books; Hence every scribe will thereby gain his meed. To copy books is better than to ditch the vines: The second serves the belly, but the first the mind. The master—whoe'er transmits the holy Fathers' words— Needs wealthy stores to bring forth new and old.66 66 "And He said unto them: Therefore every scribe instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like to a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure new things and old." (Matthew xiii, 52.) Metrical translation of Alcuin's Poem On the Scribes by Charles W. Jones.67 67 Also the author of notes 65 and 66. Alcuin's poem On the Scribes offers a metrical inscription intended to decorate the entrance of a monastic scriptorium, perhaps the scriptorium of the Monastery of St. Martin's at Tours.68 68 Alcuini Carmina, XCIV, ed.

DEERHURST, GLOUCESTERSHIRE, ENGLAND Priory church, Saxon baptismal font LAYOUT On the northern side of the Church of the Plan, in a position corresponding exactly to that of the Sacristy and Vestry, there is a double-storied structure of like design, which contains "below, the seats for the scribes, and above, the library" (infra sedes scribenti?, supra bibliotheca). From a purely functional point of view the location of these two important cultural facilities is ideal. Their situation at the northeast corner of the church, in the shadow cast by transept and choir, protected the scribes from the glare of the sun as it travelled through the southern and western portion of its trajectory and allowed them to work in the more diffused light made available by their east and north exposure. The Scriptorium is accessible by a door from the northern transept arm of the Church. The Library is reached from the presbytery by a stairway or passage designated the "upper entrance into the Library above the crypt" (introitus in bibliothec? sup cript? superius). This implies that there was another lower entrance, not shown on the Plan, presumably an internal stair connecting Library and Scriptorium directly. The Plan depicts the layout of the Scriptorium. This has in its center a large square table, identical in size and shape with that for the sacred vessels in the Sacristy and like the latter, it, too, is raised on a plinth. Along the north and east walls of the room, there are seven desks for writing, and seven windows69 69 Keller (1844, 20) mistakenly lists six windows. The error was inherited by all who copied him. placed to provide the scribes with adequate lighting. This, incidentally, is one of the only two instances where windows are marked on the Plan.70 70 The other case is the privy of the monks (see below, p. 259) where windows for light and ventilation are indicated on the east and west wall. Unquestionably they owe this distinction to the fact that they were of vital importance for the work performed in this room. The windows must have been glazed. Glass windows, although still a considerable luxury in Carolingian times, were indispensable in a monastic scriptorium. That they were actually in use in Carolingian times is attested in the chronicles of the Abbey of St. Wandrille (Fontanella) for the period of Abbot Ansegis (823-833) and by sources pertaining to the cathedral of Reims, for the time of Bishop Hincmar (845-882).71 71 For St. Wandrille see Schlosser, 1896, 289, No. 870 and the more recent edition of the Gesta Sanctorum Patrum Fontanellensium Coenobii, ed. Lohier, and Laporte, 1936, 105-106. For the Cathedral of Reims see Schlosser, op. cit., 250, No. 771. Also to be mentioned in this context is a passage in the Casus sancti Galli of Ekkehard IV, where we are told that Sindolf the Maligner, while eavesdropping on a conversation carried on in the scriptorium of St. Gall, pressed his ear at night "to the glass window where Tutilo was seated" (fenestrae vitreae cui Tutilo assederat).72 72 Ekkeharti (IV.) Casus sancti Galli, chap. 36; ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 133ff; ed. Helbling, 1958, 77ff. The tale, written around 1050, is almost certainly fictitious, but may in fact reflect the architectural conditions of the Carolingian scriptorium of St. Gall, which was rebuilt by Abbot Gozbert, when he reconstructed the monastery church between 830 and 837. One observes, not without surprise, that the scriptorium is not furnished with any facilities for heating. LOCATION The position of the sacristy "to the right of the apse" (a dextra absidae) and of the library in a corresponding place "to the left" (a sinistra eiusdem) is traditional. It existed, as George H. Forsyth has pointed out, as early as the fifth century, in the church which St. Paulinus had erected at Nola near Naples.73 73 Forsyth, 1953, 142, note 244; Goldschmidt, 1940, 45, 118. Forsyth also drew attention to the interesting fact that the double-storied side chambers of the kind found on the Plan of St. Gall were common in many Early Christian churches of the Near East. The most striking parallel is to be found in the church of St. John of Ephesus where this motif is combined with the centralized Latin-cross plan exactly as in the Church of the Plan of St. Gall.74 74 Forsyth, 1953, 150, note 268. ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION The Scriptorium and the Library were the intellectual nerve centers of the monastery. Without the cultural activities carried on in these spatially relatively modest facilities, western civilization would not be what it is today. A substantial portion of what is known to us of classical learning was transmitted in manuscripts copied in monastic scriptoria and rescued for posterity in the carefully protected bookcases (armaria) of monastic libraries (fig. 105). By the time the Plan of St. Gall was drawn these two institutions had already developed internally into a fairly complex organization. Their management was in the hands of an official who received his orders from the abbot. In pre-Carolingian times this was, in general, the choirmaster (cantor) whose leading role in the performance of the daily choral services made him a natural candidate for this position.75 75 See Roover, 1939, 600 and below, p. 335. Under the impetus of the Carolingian renaissance, scriptorium and library were placed in the care of a special official, the bibliothecarius or armarius (from armarium, the "press" or "wardrobe" in which the books were kept).76 76 In St. Gall this position was introduced under Abbot Grimoald (841-872). The first known holder of the title is Liuthard (858-886) who refers to himself as diaconus et bibliothecarius or monachus et bibliothecarius. He is followed by such men as Uto, Notker, Balbulus, and Waldram (end of ninth and turn from the ninth to the tenth century). See Bruckner, 1938, 33 and Roover, 1939, 615. This official became responsible for the maintenance and administration of an entire system of different collections of books: the main collection (kept in the central library), the liturgical collection, i.e., the books used in the divine services (often chained to their places of use in the church; otherwise, kept in the Sacristy), and several branch libraries: viz., a reference library of school books needed 98. AMBO, HAGIA SOFIA AT SALONIKA ISTANBUL ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM [redrawn from Orlandos, 11, 1954, fig. 11] for the training of the novices (by necessity kept in the Novitiate), another one needed for the teaching in the Outer School (by necessity kept in that location), and a third collection used for the daily readings of the monks, the lectio divina established as a primary monastic occupation by St. Benedict, for which each monk was allowed in the aggregate some four hours per day.77 77 Cf. below, pp. 339ff. READING COLLECTION The reading collection was of substantial size and must have been composed of at least as many books as there were monks in the monastery, since the Rule prescribes that each monk be handed a book at the beginning of Lent which as the year went by he was bound "to read it in consecutive order from cover to cover."78 78 Benedicti regula, chap. 48, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 114-19; ed. McCann, 1963, 110-13; ed. Steidle, 1952, 246-51: "In quibus diebus Quadragesimae accipiant omnes singulos codices de bibliotheca, quos per ordinem ex integro legant; qui codices in capite Quadragesimae dandi sunt." The selection and distribution of this material was one of the duties of the provost. A directive issued at the synod of 816 allowed him to augment the regular annual allotment at his discretion.79 79 Synodi primae decr. auth., chap. 18, ed. Semmler in Corp. Cons. Mon., I, 1963, 461: "Ut in Quadragesima libris de bibliotheca secundum prioris dispositionem acceptis, aliis nisi prior decreuerit expedire non accipiant." The titles of the books loaned out in this manner were entered in a check-out list (breve) to facilitate their return and assure control over the holdings.80 80 Cf. Semmler, 1963, 39, where reference is made to a surviving fragment of such a breve. Hildemar, in his commentary to the Rule, written around 845, provides a detailed, here abridged, description of this procedure: The librarian (bibliothecarius) with the aid of the brothers takes all the books to the chapter meeting. There they spread out a rug, upon which the books are placed. After the regular business of the chapter meeting has been concluded the librarian announces from the check-out list (breve) the titles of the books and the names of the monks to whom they had been lent in the preceding year. Thereupon each brother deposits his book on the rug. Then the provost, or anyone else to whom he may have delegated this task, collects each book, and as it is being returned, he probes the brother with questions whether he has diligently studied his assignment. If the response is satisfactory, he inquires of the brother which book he considers to be of use to him in the coming year and provides him with the desired book. However, if the abbot finds that a book is not suited for a brother who asked for it, he does not give it to him but hands him a more suitable one. If the interview establishes that the brother was derelict in his study, he is not given a new book, but asked to study the old one for another year. If the abbot finds that the brother has studied with diligence, but is nevertheless not capable of comprehending it, he gives him another one. After the brothers have left the chapter meeting, the abbot sees to it that all books that have been entered in the check-out list are accounted for, and if they are not on record, searches until they are found.81 81 Expositio Hildemari, chap. 48, ed.

The books disposed of in this manner were obviously not kept in the central library, but were in permanent circulation, each monk retaining his own copy, which he probably kept on a shelf or locker under or near his bed, together with the other modest supplies that the Rule allowed him.82 82 Cf. below, p. 250. MAIN LIBRARY In his Renaissance of the Twelfth Century Charles Homer Haskins made the remark that "when men spoke of a library in the Middle Ages they did not mean a special room, and still less a special building" but rather thought of a "book press" or wardrobe, as is suggested by the word armarium commonly used for libraries.83 83 Haskins, 1928, 71. I do not know whether this assessment is tenable for the later Middle Ages. It is certainly not what the framers of the Plan of St. Gall had in mind for a monastic library of the time of Charlemagne or Louis the Pious. The Plan provides for a central library of a surface area of 1600 square feet, located over a scriptorium of identical dimensions, the two together totaling 3200 square feet. We know at least of one other Carolingian library that was installed in a separate building: that of the monastery of St. Wandrille (Fontanella). It stood in the cloister yard in front of the Refectory, and opposite it, on the other side of the yard, was a twin building which served as charter house.84 84 Library and Charter House are listed in the Gesta Sanctorum Patrum Fontanellensis Coenobii amongst the buildings erected by Abbot Ansegis (822-833): "In medio autem porticus, quae ante dormitorium sita uidetur, domum cartarum constituit. Domum uero qua librorum copia conseruaretur quae Graece pyrigiscos dicitur ante refectorium collocauit" (Gesta Sanctorum Patrum., ed. Lohier and Laporte, 1936, 107). The text says nothing about the size of this building, but the cloister yard in which it stood must have been of spectacular dimensions, since the Dormitory and the Refectory, which formed two sides of the square, as is stated elsewhere in the same text, were each 208 feet long. For a visual reconstruction of the layout of the Carolingian monastery of St. Wandrille, see W. Horn, "The Architecture of the Abbey of Fontanella, From the Time of its Foundation by St. Wandrille (A.D. 649) to the Rebuilding of its Cloister by Abbot Ansegis (823-833)," Speculum (in press). In the monastery of St. Emmeran there must have been a special library, for it is said of Bishop Wolfgang (972-94) that he had it decorated with metrical inscriptions of his own composing.85 85 For St. Emmeran see Lehmann, 1957, 4-5. If Haskins infers from Lanfranc's description of the annual distribution of the daily reading matter that "all of the books of a monastery can be piled on a single rug" this cannot be taken as referring to the whole of the monastic library, but only to that portion of it that was checked out to the monks at the beginning of Lent.86 86 Haskins, loc. cit. Lanfranc's description of the distribution of books at Lent, is a slightly shortened version of Hildemar's account of ca. 845. It is given in the chapter Feria Secunda Post Dominicam Primam Quadragesimae. See Decreta Lanfranci, ed. and trans. by David Knowles, 1951, 19ff and Decreta Lanfranci, ed. Knowles, 1967, 19-20. In such monasteries as St. Riquier and Corbie, which housed as many as 350 to 400 monks, even this circulating portion of the general library holdings must have been of substantial bulk. WRITING POSTURE AND VARIOUS CLASSES OF SCRIBES All of these books were written by the monks themselves in the scriptorium. The scriptorium served not only as work room for copying scribes, it was also the monastery's chancellery, where letters, deeds, and documents were written. The scribes sat upon stools before tables or desks, the writing surface of which rose at a sharp angle so that the scribe wrote almost in a vertical plane. The book from which a new text was copied was held in a firm position by a reading frame. This is a posture quite distinct from that which was in use in ancient times, when the scribes wrote either standing (as seems to have been the rule in court procedure) or seated held their writing materials in their lap, as is shown in the illumination of prophet Ezra, on fol. 5r of the famous Codex Amiatinus (fig. 105), that was copied, early in the eighth century, in the monastery of Jarrow and Monkwearmouth in Northumbria from an illustration of the same subject in the sixth century manuscript of the Institutiones of Cassiodorus. The transition from this ancient custom of holding on one's lap the scroll or codex on which one was writing to the medieval custom of writing on a desk (fig. 106) was made in the course of the eighth century, as a recent study has disclosed. It has two probable causes: for one the growing popularity of large deluxe codices, which it was well nigh impossible to cover with writing without the use of some firm support to steady the hand of the scribe, and second, the fact that the craft of writing (in ancient times essentially in the hands of slaves), in the monastic scriptoria in the north had become the prerogative of an intellectual elite, whose high social standing called both for greater comfort and greater efficiency.87 87 On the introduction of writing desks, their sporadic appearance in Early Christian times, their general acceptance in the age of Charlemagne and the occasional retention of earlier forms, see the interesting chapter, "When did scribes begin to use writing desks?" in Metzger, 1968, 123-37. Medieval sources in referring to scribes distinguish between antiquarii, the experienced writers whose skills were reserved for the making of liturgical books; scriptores, the less trained but still reliable writers; rubricatores, writers who specialized in the insertion of decorative letters rendered in different colors, usually in connection with opening words; miniatores, the highly skilled scribes who embellished the manuscript with its pictorial illuminations; and last, but not least, the correctores, the proof 99. PLAN OF ST. GALL. TRANSEPT, PRESBYTERY, EASTERN APSE AND PARADISE From the crossing two flights of stairs, each of seven steps, lead to the Presbytery, leaving between them a passage to the CONFESSIO where monks can pray in privacy near the tomb of St. Gall. Presbytery and Crypt are one of two places on the Plan where different levels are shown in the same plane: above, the high altar dedicated to SS Mary and Gall; and below, a u-shaped corridor leading laymen to the tomb of St. Gall. In the two-storied spaces located between Presbytery and transept arms the draftsman delineates the plan of just one level. He identifies another level only by an inscription—his standard method of indicating a superincumbent level. readers. The latter were among the most experienced and most learned monks. The manuscripts of the Abbey of St. Gall as well as those of many other writing schools abound with marginal or interlinear annotations that testify to the care with which this work was done.88 88 On corrections and emendations in the manuscripts of the Abbey of St. Gall see Bruckner, 1938, 29ff. On the various types of scribes see Roover, 1939, 598ff. At Reichenau this task was performed by Reginbert (d. 847), librarian under four successive abbots—that same Reginbert who seems to have supervised the writing of the explanatory titles of the Plan of St. Gall.89 89 See above, pp. 13ff. At St. Gall this work was done by such famous teachers as Ratpert, Notker, and Tutilo. Purity and correctness of the sacred texts was a primary concern of the period (as Alcuin's poem attests) and of sufficient interest even to the emperor to be singled out as a matter of statewide importance in a capitulary issued in 789, or 805, in which it is stipulated that the copying of such sacred texts as the Gospels, the Psalter, and the Missal should only be entrusted to men of superior intellectual attainment (et si opus est evangelium, psalterium et missale scribere, perfectae aetatis homines scribant cum omni diligentia).90 90 Admonitio generalis, 23 March 789, chap. 72; ed. Boretius, in Mon. Germ. Hist., Leg. II, Capit., I, Hannover, 1883, 60. METHOD OF CATALOGING AND SHELVING BOOKS Once a manuscript was written and corrected, its title was entered in the catalogue that listed the monastery's holdings in books—not in alphabetical sequence, but according to subject matter, and probably in the same order in which the books were shelved in their wooden cases.91 91 See Bruckner, 1938, 35. A splendid example of this kind of furniture is shown in the illumination of Prophet Ezra on fol. 5R of the famous Codex Amiatinus (fig. 105).92 92 See Grabar-Nordenfalk, 1957, 119. Another one of practically identical design is depicted on the mosaic of St. Lawrence in the mausoleum of Galla Placidia (424-450).93 93 See Volbach, 1961, 119ff. The books, as these works disclose, lay on their sides, and did not stand. This is confirmed by the fact that their titles are, in general, entered lengthwise, not crosswise, on the back of the book.94 94 See Bruckner, loc. cit. To judge by the number of volumes listed in extant monastic catalogues, Carolingian libraries must have been equipped with a considerable number of such wooden "wardrobes" for the shelving of books. A catalogue compiled by Reginbert of Reichenau enumerates 415 manuscripts.95 95 Thompson, 1939, 75. The holdings of the library of St. Gall, according to a catalogue compiled at the time of Abbot Grimald (841-872), lists 400 volumes.96 96 Ibid., 84. Grimald himself had a private collection of 34 volumes that after his death went to the general library.97 97 Bruckner, 1938, 37. His follower, Hartmut (872883) collected for himself another 28 volumes. These, too, were bequeathed to the general library on his death.98 98 Ibid., 42. The longest title list found for any Carolingian monastery appears to be the list of the library of the monastery of Lorsch. It amounted to 590 titles.99 99 Thompson, 1939, 80. NUMBER OF SCRIBES &amp; COLLABORATION The number of monks who sat at work in the scriptorium must have varied greatly. The layout of the Scriptorium on the Plan of St. Gall would allow fourteen monks to write simultaneously, if we assume that each writing desk was manned by two scribes. Since there are ten feet of space between each window, two scribes could have worked in comfort at a single desk. But the total number of scribes at work each day in the Scriptorium could have been considerably increased if the scribes worked in shifts. A. Bruckner, on the basis of an actual count of the hands at work in individual manuscripts, has calculated that the monastery of St. Gall, between 750 and 770, employed some twenty-five scribes for copying manuscripts and around fifteen more for writing documents—a total of forty.100 100 Bruckner, 1938, 17. Under Abbot Sturmi (744-779) the same number, i.e., forty scribes, were constantly employed in the scriptorium of Fulda. See Thompson, 1939, 51. Under Abbot Waldo and shortly after him (770790) the number of scribes rose to about eighty;101 101 Bruckner, op. cit., 19. under Abbot Gozbert (816-836) to about a hundred.102 102 Ibid., 22ff. Some of these may have worked in carrels, in one of the cloister walks, as was customary in Tournai in the eleventh century103 103 Of Tournai it is written "if you had gone into the cloister you might in general have seen a dozen young monks sitting on chairs in perfect silence, writing at tables, carefully and skillfully constructed (ita ut si claustrum ingredereris, videres plerumque duo decim monachos juvenes sedentes in cathedris et super tabulas diligenter et artificiose compositas cum silentio scribentes)." See Wattenbach, 1896, 271-72. Whether claustrum in the passage quoted above can be interpreted as "cloister walk" rather than "claustral range of buildings" is subject to question: and this matter as well as the evidence cited by Roover in support of the assumption that in certain cloisters certain scribes performed their craft in the open cloister walk (Note 104) requires careful re-examination. and to be found later on in many other places.104 104 Roover, 1939, 596ff. A codex was rarely written entirely by a single hand. At the scriptorium of St. Martin's at Tours, in the first half of the eighth century, more than twenty scribes collaborated in a copy of Eugippius.105 105 Lesne, IV, 1938, 344. The texts of other manuscripts copied at that same school were written, variously, by five, seven, eight, or twelve different hands.106 106 Ibid., 344ff. Fourteen scribes listed by name in manuscripts of St. Martin appear in a register drawn up in 820.107 107 Ibid. ROMANESQUE CHURCH BENCH, MONASTERY OF ALPIRSBACH 100. 100.X FORMERLY STUTTGART, SCHLOSSMUSEUM (DESTROYED IN WW II.) After Falke, 1924, pl. 1 Although probably not antedating the thirteenth century, this medieval church bench with its simple carpentry embodies a type one would expect to have been in use centuries earlier. The drafter of the Plan referred to this type of bench as FORMULA (see above p. 137 and Glossary, III, s.v.). Four such benches, each with a seating capacity of not more than four people, would have been set up in the crossing of the Church probably for use by a specially trained choir singing in antiphon. HEXHAM, NORTHUMBERLAND, ENGLAND NIGHT STAIRS, PRIORY CHURCH Unquestionably one of the finest extant medieval night stairs, located in the southern transept arm, it leads directly from dormitory into church. In general such stairs provided the only connection between dormitory and cloister. In the 12th and 13th centuries, they were invariably made of stone; in earlier times perhaps of timber. Except for those in the Church, the author of the Plan of St. Gall omits stairs from it. 102.A GOD JANUS UNDER A CELESTIAL CANOPY Roman medal of A.D. 187, more than twice original size [after Gnecchi, II, 1912, pl. 84, fig. 5] 104.

In addition to all this, he placed in the middle the Holy of Holies—the altar—excluding the general public from this part too by surrounding it with wooden trellis-work wrought by the craftsmen with exquisite artistry, a marvellous sight for all who see it." 102.B EMPEROR DOMITIAN ENTHRONED UNDER CELESTIAL CANOPY Sestertius, nearly three times original size [after Mattingly, II, 1930, pl. 77, fig. 9] 103.

Rizzello [after Toynbee and Ward-Perkins, 1956, 215, fig. 22] DAILY WORK SPAN The daily work span of a medieval scribe, to judge by an anonymous writer of the tenth century, was six hours.108 108 "Arduous above all arts is that of the scribe: the work is difficult and it is also hard to bend necks and make furrow on parchments for six hours" (Madan, 1927, 42; Roover, 1939, 605). In Cluny, in the twelfth century, the scribes were exempted from certain choir prayers;109 109 See Schmitz, II, 1948, 66. but in the ninth century, according to Hildemar, a scribe was not allowed to complete a verse "once the bell for the divine service was rung, not even a letter which he had started, but must instantly set it aside unfinished."110 110 "Scriptor non debet pro verso complendo stare aut certe pro litera perficienda . . . sed statim imperfecta debet dimittere, sicuti illa sonus signi invenerit" (Expositio Hildemari; ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 458-59). The scribe's stopping in the middle of a letter, on the sound of the bell—as Charles W. Jones informs me—duplicates the act of brother Marcus of Scete in Pelagius' Verba Seniorum, XIV (Vitae Patrum, V). Transl. Helen Waddel, The Desert Fathers, London, 1936, 163. The stipulation appears in almost identical form in the Institutiones of Cassian and in a slightly different wording in the Regula magistri (for quotations and reference to sources see Nordenfalk, 1970, 99)." The same author lists as the indispensable tools of the scribe: the pen (penna), the quill (calamus), the stool (scamellum), the scraping knife (rasorium), the pumice stone (pumex), and the parchment (pergamena).111 111 Ibid., 139. In general, writing was a daytime activity but occasionally we hear of a monk being at this task before or after sunset, as in a marginal annotation to a ninth century copy of a text by Cassidorus, made in a monastery at Laon, which reads: "It is cold today. Naturally, Winter. The lamp gives bad light."112 112 Lindsay, Paleographia Latina, II, 1923, 24. From Ekkehart IV we learn that Ratpert, Notker, and Tutilo had permission from the abbot to convene at night in the scriptorium for collating and correcting texts.113 113 "Erat tribus illis inseparabilibus consuetudo, permisso quidem prioris, in intervallo laudum nocturno convenire in scriptorio colationesque tali horae aptissimas de scripturis facere" (Ekkeharti (IV.) Casus sancti Galli, chap. 36; ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 133-34; ed. Helbling, 1958, 77-78). But there were also those more joyous occasions in the spring or early summer when a monk would do his writing outdoors under the shade of a tree, as evidenced in a charming marginal gloss of an Irish manuscript of an eighth- or ninth-century Priscian in the Library of St. Gall (ms. 904), which reads: A hedge of trees surrounds me A blackbird's lay sings to me Above my lined booklet The trilling birds chant to me In a grey mantle from the top of bushes The cuckoo sings Verily—may the Lord shield me! Well do I write under the greenwood.114 114 An Anthology of Irish Literature, edited with an Introduction by David H. Greene, New York, 1954, p. 10, after a translation by Kuno Meyer. For the Old Irish version, see Thesaurus Paleohibernicus, A Collection of Old-Irish Glosses, Scholin Prose and Verse, edited by Whitley Stokes and John Strachan, vol. II, Cambridge, 1903, 290. The gloss was brought to my attention by Wendy Stein. A NOBLE OR BACKBREAKING TASK? The work in the scriptorium was conducted in silence and during the hours assigned for that purpose no monk could leave the scriptorium without permission of the abbot. Apart from the scribes themselves, only the abbot, the prior, the subprior, and the librarian had access to the scriptorium.115 115 Roover, 1939, 606. The writing of sacred texts was held in high esteem and in general considered a more noble task than such physical labors as working in the fields. This is expressed in unmistakable terms in Alcuin's poem about the scribes.116 116 Quoted above, p. 145. In Ireland where the art of calligraphy had risen to unprecedented heights the life of a scribe was held in such high regard that the penalty for killing a scribe was made as great as that for killing a bishop or abbot.117 117 Madan, 1927, 42; cf. Roover, 1939, 594. Yet there is no dearth of evidence that, Alcuin notwithstanding, writing was also bemoaned as an arduous physical task, as witnessed by such marginal annotations as: O quam gravis est scriptura: oculos gravat, renes frangit. simul et omnia membra contristat. Tria digita scribunt, totus corpus laborat.118 118 From a Visigothic legal manuscript of the eighth century, Mon. Germ. Hist., Legum, III, 589. Cf. Wattenbach, 1896, 283 and Roover, 1939, 607. For other touching exclamations on the strains of writing, see Wattenbach, loc. cit. and Lindsay, loc. cit. Writing is excessive drudgery. It crooks your back, dims your sight, twists your stomach and your sides. Three fingers write, but the whole body labors. II.1.13 EASTERN PARADISE Like the western apse of the Church, the eastern apse is enclosed by a paradise. This repeats the general dispositions of the western paradise, but is shorter in radius and lacks the latter's covered gallery. The inscription is rendered in capitalis rustica: HIC SINE DOMATIB; PARADISI PLANA PARANTUR HERE THE PLAINS OF A PARKLIKE SPACE EXTEND WITHOUT A ROOF The eastern paradise does not communicate with the interior of the Church. It is accessible by means of two triangular vestibules from the side of the Novitiate and the Infirmary, respectively. This suggests that it may have served as an outdoor space of recreation for the Novices and the ill. 105. CODEX AMIATINUS I, FOL. 5R. PROPHET EZRA WRITING FLORENCE, BIBLIOTHECA LAURENZIANA This illumination was copied at the beginning of the 8th century by a Northumbrian monk. The same subject was shown in a 6th-century manuscript (no longer preserved) of the Institutiones of Cassiodorus (ca. 490-585). Ezra, seated on a cushioned chair, legs crossed and feet on a stool, holds a large codex in which he writes in the ancient manner, i.e. without aid of a lectern. To his left stands a low table with writing utensils, in the background, a magnificent chest with five shelves on which books are stored horizontally. The perspective of chair, stool, table, and chest with open hinged doors is typical of late Antiquity. For a bookchest of identical design compare the detail from a mosaic of the mausoleum of Galla Placidia in Ravenna, dating from ca. 450. (See F. W. Diechmann, Frühchristliche Bauten und Mosaiken von Ravenna, Weisbaden, 1958, Pls. 5, 6; cf. above, p. 151.) 106. IVORY BOOK COVER. SCHOOL OF METZ, CA. 960-980 VIENNA, KUNSTHISTORISCHES MUSEUM, SAMMLUNG FÜR PLASTIK UND KUNSTGEWERBE, INV. NO. 8399 [by courtesy of Bildarchiv der Österreichischen Nationalbibliothek] The relief shows Pope Gregory the Great (ca. 540-604) writing the Vere dictum of which he is presumed author, inspired by the Dove of the Holy Spirit, into a lectern-supported codex. Beneath, three scribes write in the ancient manner, books on legs or held in arms. The cover is the work of a distinguished Ottonian ivory carver whose hand can be identified in other ivories. The classicism of the acanthus frame, as well as the entire figurative and architectural composition, suggests a late Antique model of high quality. (Also see Rhein und Mass, Kunst und Kultur, 800-1400, 1974, 180). 107. PLAN OF ST. GALL CHURCH AND CLAUSTRUM AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION The Plan opposite demonstrates how the Church and claustral buildings would have appeared had they been rendered with all of their wall thickness. On the Plan itself the walls of all buildings are rendered as simple lines (see above, pp. 57ff)—a procedure which even today an architect follows, if faced with designing a project of similar complexity drawn at a similar scale. (Even the Romans used this method in comparable cases; see above p. 58.) This mode of rendering presents no difficulties where buildings stand separately on their sites, because necessary space allowance for wall thickness is, in construction, available from outside and need not be subtracted from the proposed structure's interior. The author of the Plan was aware that where several buildings shared common walls (as in the case of Church and Cloister, or Church and lodgings built against it in the north), severe deficiencies of interior space might occur in construction unless special provisions were made for wall thickness from the very outset. For this reason he allotted to each aisle of the Church a width of 22½ feet although an explanatory title states explicitly that it should be 20 feet (see above, pp. 97ff). In rendering interiors on the Plan, the drafter insured against potential congestion by another precaution. Wherever normal dimensions of furniture could not be accurately expressed by the standard module 2½ feet, he invariably chose the larger, never the smaller module. He thus accumulated extra interior space in numerous small increments that eventually provided for the wall thickness not explicitly drawn. Because all these precautions were taken by a designer whose acuity in planning has been unjustly underrated for more than a century of modern scholarship, we encountered no difficulty, when preparing the Aachen model, in furnishing its builder with working drawings. He was able to build without distortion the buildings of the Plan including their full-scale wall thickness, at four times the surface area of the Plan. These working drawings are so true to the idea embodied in the Plan that with their aid, the entire monastery might actually be erected at the monumental scale intended by its originator, when supported by appropriate large-scale detailed construction drawings. Essentially the Plan of St. Gall depicts a ground-level plan. Consequently the bed layout of the Monks' Dormitory (which occupies the upper level) is shown in dotted line in the authors' interpretation, as explained by the inscription within the space designated Monks' Warming Room. It will be seen that the Warming Room had access on the south to the Monks' Laundry and Bathhouse, and on the west opened onto the east cloister walk. The Monks' Privy above, at Dormitory level, likewise renders the toilet layout in dotted line (see fig. 192, p. 244). Location of the stair access from ground floor Warming Room to Dormitory and Privy is not shown. II. 2 RECONSTRUCTION II.2.1 THE CHURCH AS DEFINED IN THE DRAWING MATERIAL AND WALL THICKNESS It is obvious that the Church of the Plan of St. Gall was meant to be a masonry structure (figs. 107-113). Semicircular apses, circular towers, spiral stairs, the columnar order of the arcades of the nave—which, because of the way they were spaced must have been surmounted by arches— the barrel-vaulted corridors of the crypt, the arched galleries of the abutting paradise—all these are features germane to stone construction. Although there is abundant evidence that in the ninth century a high percentage of the smaller transalpine parish churches were built of timber,1 1 See Horn, 1962, 263-78. it is equally clear that an abbey church, intended to serve as a model, could only have been constructed in stone. All the major Carolingian churches were built in stone. Some of the more hallowed parts of the Church, such as the crypt or the interior of the apse and the fore choir, may have been built in ashlar, but all the principal walls of the Church were unquestionably built in roughly coursed rubble. We have good parallels for both these techniques in the Palace Chapel at Aachen (798-805), the Abbey Church of Corvey-on-the-Weser (873-885), and the Church of Germigny-des-Prés (799-818), in all of which the external work was built in rubble, while most of the structural parts of the interior were constructed in dressed stones.2 2 For Aachen, see Buchkremer, 1947, and 1955, Schnitzler, 1950, Boeckelmann, 1957 and Kreusch, 1966, 463-533; for Corvey-on-the-Weser, see Effmann, 1929, Rave, 1957 and Busen, 1967; for Germigny-des-Prés, Hubert, 1930, 534-68, Hubert, 1938, 76-77, and Collection la nuit des temps, III, 1956, 55-59. Extensive archaeological excavations have been conducted under the pavement of the present cathedral of St. Gall in connection with the installation of a new heating system for the church and other internal renovations (Director: Dr. Hans-Rudolf Sennhauser, Zürich). As this study goes into print a full report on the findings of this work is not available (cf. II, 358-59). The reconstructions and hypotheses here submitted will not be substantially affected by these excavations, whether they tend to confirm or correct our views, since our objective is not the analysis of the church which Abbot Gozbert built with the aid of the Plan, but the reconstruction of the appearance of the church which is shown on the Plan. Other examples of Carolingian ashlar construction are found in the crypts of St.-Germain of Auxerre (841859) and Flavigny (864-878).3 3 For St.-Germain of Auxerre, see Louis, 1952; for Flavigny, Bordet and Galimard, 1906, Hubert, 1952, Nos. 85-87, and Lambert-Jouven, 1960. It is reasonable to assume that a church of the dimensions of that of the Plan of St. Gall rested on foundations about 5 feet wide. This is suggested by the dimensions of the bases of the nave columns, and by the dimensions of the supports which stand at the point where the aisle walls meet the walls of the transept. It is equally reasonable to assume that the full thickness of the foundation walls was not retained in the walls themselves. A thickness of 3¼ feet or 40 inches (one and one-half standard units) would appear to be a reasonable assumption for both the aisle walls and the clerestory walls. ELEVATION The elevation of the Church (figs. 108-113) must by necessity remain a matter of conjecture. We have calculated it on the assumption of certain minimal heights for consecutive parts of the Church, moving in additive progression from the lower to the upper portions of the building. The aggregate of the estimates thus obtained produces a fairly convincing picture. The arcaded walls of the cloister, the northern wing of which is built against the southern aisle of the Church, must have been at least 10 feet high to give head clearance to the monks who walked in this wing. The arched exits, in the center of each cloister walk, are shown on the Plan itself as being 7½ feet high. They must have had above them a small amount of masonry to carry the timbers of the roof which covered their walks. To this we have assigned a height of 2½ feet. The roof which covered the northern cloister walk— assuming that it rose at an angle of about 30 degrees— would have connected with the wall of the southern aisle of the Church at a height of 17½ feet above the ground. Beyond that point the aisle walls must have continued for at least another 12½ feet in order to give clearance for the windows (to which we have assigned an estimated height of 7½ feet). This would bring the top of the aisle walls to a height of 30 feet. The aisle walls of the Abbey Church of Fulda rose to a height of 8.75 m., which comes close to 30 Roman feet.4 4 For Fulda, see von Bezold, 1936, 13, fig. 4; Beumann and Grossmann, 1949, 17-56; and Groszmann, 1962, 344-70. The aisle walls of St. Gall cannot have been any lower than that, since the tie-beams that supported the aisle roofs had to clear the arches over the nave arcades. These beams could not have cleared the arches at a level lower than 30 feet, as will be shown presently. The columns of the arcades of the nave are spaced at intervals of 20 feet on center. The apex of the extrados of the arches that rose from these columns cannot have been any lower than 30 feet, without resulting in inordinately depressed arcade proportions. Above the extrados of these arches there must have been some 15 feet of clearance for the aisle roof, and above the level of the aisle roof another 15 feet of clearance for the clerestory wall and its windows. PLAN OF ST. GALL 108. CHURCH AND CLAUSTRUM, TRANSVERSE SECTION The sections and elevations, as well as the perspective view of the interior of the Church shown on the opposite and on subsequent pages are our attempt to show what the Church of the Plan would have looked like had it been built in full three-dimensional reality. There is nothing mysterious about our conjecture. The nave of the Church, as we are told by an unequivocal explanatory title, had a width of 40 feet, each of its aisles a width of 20. We have assigned to each component of the elevation of nave and Claustrum a comfortable height required by its function and in this manner arrived at a height of 30 feet for the aisle walls, and of 60 feet for the nave walls. This is in full harmony with the decimal thinking that controls the Plan in the planimetric sense, as our analysis of its scale and construction has shown (above, pp. 77ff). 109. CHURCH, LONGITUDINAL SECTION It is in longitudinal section that the pristine modular quality of the proportions of the Church (cf. fig. 173) finds its strongest expression. All measurements are related to the controlling module of the crossing, a 40-foot square. The columnar interstices (measured on centers) are exactly half that value. This condition is responsible for the magnificent width and height of the arcades—a concept fundamentally different from the low, narrow intercolumniation of the great Early Christian prototype churches from which the Church of the Plan is typologically derived (for good examples see figs. 81, 141, 170, 174, and 177). Although nave and transept were of equal width we cannot be certain that they also were of equal height. Yet even if the transept was lower, it is reasonable to assume that the crossing was disengaged, i.e. framed by boundary arches on all four sides. There are good contemporary parallels for either alternative (cf. fig. 15, a low transept with boundary arches of unequal height; and figs. 116 and 117, high transepts with boundary arches of equal height.) 110. PLAN OF ST. GALL. CHURCH INTERIOR. VIEW TOWARD EAST APSE AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION The Church of the Plan—its interior appearance here recreated by Ernest Born—was never built. Yet being conceived, it became a historical reality, and our reconstruction for that reason, if correct in its principal lines, is a significant contribution to the visual history of medieval architecture. The underlying compositional scheme (nave, two aisles and transept) is Early Christian. But none of the great metropolitan basilicas of the West had arcades so wide and high, or proportions so rationally coordinated with a spatial master value, by the alignment of the columnar interstices with the 40-foot module of the crossing square. Thus we would arrive at a height of 60 feet for the clerestory walls. The clerestory walls of the Abbey Church of Fulda were 21.10 m. high, which corresponds roughly to 60 Roman feet.5 5 Von Bezold, 1936, loc. cit. The relation of the width to the heights of the nave of the Church of the Plan would then be a ratio of 1:1½ (40:60 feet), which is in harmony with the ratio of 1:1½ obtained in calculating the corresponding proportions of the aisles (20:30 feet). From the floor to the ridge of its highest roof, the Church of the Plan would probably have measured 75 feet. Admittedly these calculations are schematic, yet they are based on constructional assumptions which are reasonable. COLUMNS The profiles of the bases, shafts, and capitals of the arcade columns in our reconstruction (figs. 108-110) of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall are based on the surviving Carolingian columns of the church of St. Justin in Höchst-on-the-Main6 6 For St. Justinus in Höchst-on-the-Main, see Scriba, 1930, sketches 1, 2, and 3; Stiehl, 1931; Meyer-Barkhausen, 1929/30, 12 and 1933, 69-90. dating from shortly after 834 (fig. 114) and on the surviving Carolingian columns of the Abbey Church of Corvey (873-885).7 7 Rave, 1957, passim. Had we known at the time our drawings were made of the recently excavated capitals from the church which Abbot Gozbert built in the monastery of St. Gall with the aid of the Plan (fig. 115), we might have used them as a model for the capitals of the Church of the Plan. The height of the shaft of the columns at Höchst amounted to about four times the height of its capitals, not counting the imposts. In our reconstruction of the columns of the Plan we have used about the same proportion. In Höchst the relation of width to height of the arcade opening is 1:1.7; in the Church of the Plan, it is 1:1.5. CROSSING The reconstruction of the crossing (figs. 108-112) has been a matter of some controversy and, in fact, permits different interpretations. Two basic questions present themselves immediately: first, was the crossing surmounted by a tower; and second, were the roofs of nave and transept of equal height? The first of these two questions must, I think, be answered in the negative. The second does not admit a clear-cut answer. Crossing towers have been assumed in Fiechter-Zollikofer's and Gruber's reconstructions of the Church of the Plan (figs. 277 and 282).8 8 Fiechter-Zollikofer, 1936; K. Gruber, 1937, and 1952, 25, fig. 15. Historically, this is a perfectly feasible solution. Square towers, rising from crossings produced by the interpenetration of two volumes of space of essentially equal height, existed in the Abbey Church of St.-Denis, constructed under Abbot Fulrad, 750-755;9 9 The tower of St.-Denis is mentioned in the Miracula Sancti Dyonisi, I, xv; see Mabillon, Acta, III:2, 348; see also Crosby, 1953, 12-18, and 53, fig. 14. in the basilica of Neustadt-on-the-Main after 768/6910 10 For Neustadt-on-the-Main, see Boeckelmann, 1951, 43-45; and idem, 1952, 109; idem, 1956, 58-62. (fig. 116); in the Abbey Church of St. Mary's on the island of Reichenau, consecrated by Bishop Haito in 81611 11 For St. Mary's at Reichenau, see Reisser, 1933, 163ff; and idem, 1935, 210ff; also Boeckelmann, 1952, 108. (fig. 117); and in the church of St. Martin at Angers, end of ninth century.12 12 For St. Martins at Angers, see Forsyth, 1953, fig. 186, a-e. But the Plan of St. Gall does not call for a tower. In any of the other buildings, wherever a structure was composed of two stories, the maker of the Plan indicated this by an explanatory title, defining the function of the lower story with a phrase that begins with the adverb infra, "below," and that of the upper story by a phrase that begins with the adverb supra, "above."13 13 This is the procedure chosen in the case of the Dormitory, the Refectory, the Cellar, the Abbot's House, and the Stable for Horses and Oxen; see below, figs. 208, 211, 225, 251; and II, fig. 474. Had he meant the crossing to be surmounted by a tower, he could have expressed his intention with a statement such as infra chorus, supra turris—"below, the choir; above, a tower." The fact that he did not do this suggests that a crossing tower was not intended. With regard to the respective heights of nave and transept, the traditional view has been that they were of equal height and that the crossing was framed by boundary arches on all four sides, rising from wall pilasters and from cruciform piers (figs. 107-110). It is in this manner that the crossing unit was interpreted by Friedrich Seesselberg (1897), Georg Dehio (1901), Wilhelm Effmann (1899 and 1912), Friedrich Ostendorf (1922), Joseph Hecht (1928), Ernst Gall (1930), and Edgar Lehman (1938).14 14 Seesselberg, 1897, 99, fig. 279; Dehio and von Bezold, I, 1901, 161-62 and Plates, I, pl. 42, fig. 2; Effman, 1899, 163, fig. 134, and 1912, 11, fig. 29; Ostendorf, 1922, 43, fig. 53; Hecht, I, 1928, pl. 4; Gall, 1930, pl. 1; E. Lehman, 1938, 17, note 2. It is also the view that underlies the graphical reconstructions of the Church, published by J. R. Rahn (1876), Joseph Hecht (1928), H. Fiechter-Zollikofer (1936), and Karl Gruber (1937 and 1952).15 15 Rahn, 1876, 71; Hecht, I, 1928, pl. 9; Fiechter-Zollikofer, 1936, 405; K. Gruber, 1952, 24-26. However, this explanation of the Plan was questioned by Hermann Beenken and by Samuel Guyer,16 16 Beenken, 1930, 213-15; Guyer, 1945, 73-104. who felt that to interpret the supports in the corners of the crossing of the Church as piers and pilasters was not permissible, because the symbol used for these members (a square with a circle inscribed) is identical with that which is used for the nave columns. Beenken's and Guyer's criticism is based on the arbitrary assumption that the square with the inscribed circle could only have had the exclusive meaning of "column." A more circumspect analysis of the use and distribution of this symbol discredits this view. In the Monks' Refectory, the House for Distinguished Guests, and the Abbot's House, the same sign is used to designate a cupboard (toregma). In the Monks' Refectory it is also used to designate a lectern (analogiu). In the room for the preparation of the holy bread and the holy oil it stands for "oil press," in the Monks' Privy, for "a table with a lantern" (lucerna), and in the hypocausts of the Monks' Warming Room, the Novitiate and the Infirmary, it stands for "chimney stack" (euaporatio fumi). It seems absurd to persist on a course of reasoning which is based on the supposition that the designer of the Plan of St. Gall was unaware of the distinction between a pier and a column because he used the same symbol for both of these structural members. To do so would be no less incongruous than to accuse him of having designed a clerestory wall whose arcades rested on cupboards, lecterns, oil presses, lantern-carrying tables, or chimney stacks.17 17 See below, pp. 268ff. It is obvious that in drawing the structural members of his church, the architect availed himself of a symbol whose meaning was not limited to "columns," but could be understood in the more general sense of "arch-support," leaving it to the builder of the Church to interpret this sign as its architectural context required, either as a freestanding column (as in the nave arcades) or as an engaged half column (wherever it is shown as being part of a wall), or as cruciform piers (as in the four corners of the crossing). In order to preclude any further misunderstandings I should like to pursue more closely the evidence furnished by the Plan itself. The Plan indicates clearly that the supports which stand in the western corners of the crossing must have been shaped in such a way as to receive the arches of the easternmost arcade on either side of the nave, as well as the arches of the openings which connect the aisles with the transept. Furthermore, they must have been able to receive on a higher level the springing of the triumphal arch. The existence of the triumphal arch cannot be proven on the basis of the linear layout of the Plan, but its presence is mandatory in a building of this size for obvious constructional reasons. The square symbols with the inscribed circles in the two eastern corners of the crossing postulate the existence in these places of engaged pilasters on columns, that make sense only if we assume that they served as footing for either a transverse arch, which separated the crossing from the fore choir, or two longitudinal arches thrown across the transept arms in prolongation of the nave walls. One of these two assumptions is obligatory, but the fact that only one of them can be established compellingly does not preclude the other. The Plan does not provide us with any evidence that would warrant dismissing the possibility that the Church was meant to have had an arch-framed crossing (fig. 110). As for the elevation of this crossing unit of the Church of the Plan, it is futile to speculate whether it belonged to the fully developed type with arches of equal height, which became a standard feature of western architecture at the period of the Romanesque, or whether it belonged to any PLAN OF ST. GALL 111.A CHURCH. NORTH ELEVATION 111.B CHURCH. SOUTH ELEVATION Because of the surrounding buildings, no one standing on the monastery grounds would have been able to entirely encompass these two magnificent views of the Church. They strikingly portray the antinomy and balance between directional thrust and inward-turning that characterizes Carolingian double-apsed churches of this type. One may feel perplexed by the aesthetic kinship of these two-apsed Carolingian churches—not so much by such unidirectional classics of Early Christian architecture as Old St. Peter's (fig. 141) or St. Paul's Outside the Walls (fig. 81) upon which their layout is based (cf. below, p. 187ff); but rather with the pagan imperial prototypes of these great palaeochristian transept churches, the Roman market halls, many of which had apses at each end; and most of which had attached to one broad side (as in the case of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall) an open, galleried court through which the building was entered laterally rather than on axis (basilica of Trajan, fig. 239; Severan basilica at Lepcis Magna, fig. 159; basilica of Silchester, fig. 202). The Church of the Plan of St. Gall is a sophisticated combination of both concepts. It is directional like the churches of the two prime apostles, because the transept and presbytery, in the heaping-up of their spatial masses, make it clear that the architecturally most prominent part of the church, and its liturgical focus, is its cruciform eastern end. This effect is emphasized in the interior, through the raising of the floor level of the Presbytery over the level of all of the other parts of the church; and on the exterior, through the attachment to the two transept arms, on either side of the Presbytery, of two double storied lean-to's, one containing Sacristy and Vestry (south side) the other Scriptorium and Library (north side). Yet this directionalism has no starting point, because the church has no façade. Instead it faces the outside world with a counter apse which binds its spatial energies inward, blocking access to the nave, and channeling visiting laymen in a semicircular movement around it to aesthetically insignificant secondary entrances in the aisles (cf. caption to fig. 82). Double apsed-churches (cf. below, pp. 199ff) were common in the palaeochristian architecture of North Africa, but rare in the Italian homeland. Recent studies have shown that they also were very common in Visigothic Spain (for a brief review see the article Hispania in Reallexikon zur Byzantinischen Kunst) which may have played a more important role in transmission of this motif to the Carolingian world than has hitherto been admitted or recognized. 112. PLAN OF ST. GALL. CHURCH SEEN FROM THE NORTH LOOKING SOUTH AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION This broadside view of the Church displays with great pictorial strength the magnificent grouping of its slender longitudinal masses, intercepted in the east by a monumental transept. The Church has no façade, but its entrance side has, instead, a counter apse encircled by a semicircular atrium through which visitors are channeled sidewards into the aisles of the building (cf. fig. 82). We have reconstructed the transept as being equal in height to the nave of the Church, although this dimension is not certain. The double-storied lean-to attached to the northern transept arm in the east contains the Scriptorium (on the ground floor) and the Library (above). The extended lean-to attached to the northern aisle of the Church in its entire length accommodates the Lodging for the Visiting Monks (next to the transept), the Lodging of the Master of the Outer School (in the middle, and Lodging of the Porter next to the entrance of the Church). In the monastery itself this view of the Church could never have been seen in totality because of the adjacent buildings whose ridge reached to the sill level of the nave windows. They are from left to right: the Abbot's House (co-axial with the transept), the Outer School (next to the Lodging of its Master) and the House for Distinguished Guests (next to the Lodging of the Porter). 113. PLAN OF ST. GALL. CHURCH SEEN FROM THE WEST LOOKING EAST AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION [after the model displayed at Aachen in 1965]. ELEVATION TAKEN ON SECTION X-X This is the only example of a Carolingian church with detached circular towers. The motif is unique and does not appear in later medieval architecture. Explanatory titles denote that its towers carried at the top of one the altar of Michael, of the other, the altar of Gabriel. There is no indication of the presence of bells, and, because of the distance from the high altar, their sound in any case could not have been coordinated with the liturgy. Gabriel and Michael are the celestial guardians representing forces of light against those of darkness and evil. The towers have no practical function, but symbolically might announce from afar to travellers (and at close range almost threateningly) that they approach a Fortress of God. 115.X REICHENAU-MITTELZELL HAITO'S CHURCH OF ST. MARY (806-816) This capital from the main arcades was re-used in a column ascribed to Witigowo (985-997). Its floral motifs, although distantly based on classical sources, represent in their simplicity and flatness of relief an early, rather than a high Carolingian tradition. One is reminded of developmental stages of the Godescale Gospels or the Genoels-Elderen diptych (Fig. 190.X). 114. HÖCHST-ON-THE-MAIN. ST. JUSTINIUS, CAPITAL, CA. 834 This superb piece of Carolingian architectural sculpture combines a Greco-Roman acanthus capital with a strigilated Byzantine impost, plus a refreshing touch of medieval abstraction. It embodies a synthesis of style, the historical ingredients of which are found in similar combinations in some of the most accomplished illuminations of the period, such as the portrait of St. Luke in the Ada Gospels (fig. 184.A) 115 ST. GALL CAPITAL. EXCAVATED BELOW THE PAVEMENT OF THE PRESENT CHURCH CAPITAL FROM GOZBERT'S ABBEY CHURCH (830-837) [after Sennhauser, "Zu den Ausgrabungen in der Kathedrale, der ehemaligen Klosterkirche von St. Gallen," Festschrift zum 70. Geburtstag von Architekt Hans Burkard, Gossau 1965, 109-116.] More classicizing in the detail of its design than the capital of Höchst, opposite, this one nevertheless seems to project a touch of weariness with the classical tradition, clearly lacking stylistic firmness and sophistication of the Höchst capital. The capital, presumably from the columnar order of the nave arcades of Gozbert's church, was re-used in the masonry of the foundations of the Gothic choir built by abbots Eglolf and Ulrich VIII, between 1439 and 1483 (II, p. 326). It was discovered by R. H. Sennhauser in 1964 when the south wall of the choir was breached to accommodate a modern heating duct. For other discoveries made during these operations, see preliminary report on Sennhauser's findings (II, 358-59). * Figure 115 shown above is reproduced from an original drawing executed in carbon pencil, size, 8.5 × 10 inches (215 × 25.5cm). The drawing is based on a document not adequate for direct photographic reproduction but possessing legibility features of sufficient clarity and definition of form and detail to permit a drawing to be developed with reasonable fidelity to the original artifact and satisfactory for the purpose here. of the precursor types, which Beenken designated with the term "abgeschnürte Vierung."18 18 Beenken, loc. cit., the discussion of the arch-framed crossing, in Carolingian architecture suffers somewhat from a skeptical over-reaction to Effmann's self-assurance in proposing a fully developed arch-framed crossing in his reconstructions of Centula and Corvey. As far as Centula is concerned, the situation is not very different from St. Gall. Beenken could not disprove Effmann's assumption of an arch-framed crossing; he could only point out that the crossing of Centula need not necessarily have belonged to the fully developed type suggested by Effmann. On the problem of the "abgeschnürte Vierung," cf. also Boeckelmann, 1954, 10113; and Grodecki, 1958, 45ff. It is true that a great many Carolingian churches had low transepts, but it is equally true that high transepts with arch-framed crossing units existed in St.-Denis, as early as 750-755; in Neustadt-on-the-Main, shortly after 768/69 (fig. 116); in the Abbey Church of St. Mary's in Reichenau, before 816 (fig. 117). The low transept may have been more common, but a square crossing produced by the interpenetration of two volumes of space of equal height, and framed by arches on all four sides, was entirely within the realm of possible solutions open to a Carolingian architect. Advanced and superior as he was in so many other respects, the designer of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall may also, in this instance, have anticipated a development which had as yet not found a widespread application in Carolingian architecture. In our reconstruction of the Church of the Plan (figs. 108-112) we have chosen to emphasize this possibility. Had we had more leisure and space, we would have supplemented this solution with an alternate drawing that showed the Church with a low transept. A reconstruction in which the Church is furnished with a low transept will be found in Emil Reisser's study of the Abbey of St. Mary's in Reichenau-Mittelzell.19 19 Reisser, 1960, 80ff and figs. 326 and 327. Reisser's reconstruction of the Church of the Plan (which was made before the publication of the color facsimile of the Plan in 1952 but published posthumously in 1960) has two anomalies which I fail to understand. Reisser reduces the arcades of the nave from 9 to 8; and he omits the transverse arm of the crank-shaped corridor crypt. CRYPT Crank-shaped corridor crypts consisting of two straight longitudinal arms connected in the east by a straight transverse arm, existed in St.-Germain of Auxerre (841-859; fig. 157)20 20 Louis, 1952, pl. 17. and in St.-Pierre at Flavigny (864-878; fig. 158).21 21 Lambert, 1960, 1-8. In both these churches the space between the surrounding arms of the corridor crypt was taken up by a hall crypt. The earlier students of the Plan of St. Gall overlooked the title which refers to an inner confessio (accessus ad confessionem) and, misled by this oversight, reconstructed the crypt incorrectly as a small rectangular chamber beneath the high altar, accessible only from the 116. NEUSTADT-AM-MAIN SAVIOR'S CHURCH, AFTER 768-769 [after Boeckelmann, 1954, 105, fig. 41a] In Neustadt, as well as in Reichenau-Mittelzell which had naves and transepts of equal width and height, the masonry of the Carolingian crossing arches survives in its original form and to full arch height. In the churches of St. Riquier (fig. 196) and Cologne (fig. 15), both of which had low transepts, the crossing arches were of unequal height. In Early Christian architecture arch-framed crossings occurred only in the highly specialized context of the quincunx church (see below, pp. 190ff and figs. 145-46, 148-49, and 152), and a small group of Near Eastern churches of minute dimensions, all with nave and transept of equal width—but never in any of the great metropolitan basilicas. The transfer of this motif to churches of basilican plan and its incipient use, in this new context, as a modular prime cell for the dimensional organization of the other component spaces of the church is one of the great innovations of the Age of Charlemagne. 117. REICHENAU-MITTELZELL. HAITO'S CHURCH OF SS MARY, PETER &amp; PAUL (816) ELEVATION [after Reisser, 1960, fig. 296] If its system of alternating supports was influenced by St. Demetrios in Thessalonica (see below, fig. 188), this church could not have been started until after Haito returned in 811 from Constantinople (on his way there he doubtless would have visited the famous sanctuary of St. Demetrios) "with artists and workmen." For sources see Erdmann, 1974a, 501; for elevation and modular system see figs. 134 and 171. east by a short axial passage (Seesselberg, Dehio, Effmann, and even Gall).22 22 Seesselberg, 1897, 99, fig. 279; Dehio and von Bezold, Plates I, pl. 42, fig. 2; Effmann, 1899, 163, fig. 134, and 1912, 11, fig. 20; Gall, 1930, pl. 1. As a correction of this error, Ostendorf23 23 Ostendorf, 1922, 43, fig. 53b. and Hecht24 24 Hecht, I, 1928, pl. 10b. offered two solutions: the former suggested a straight passage extending from the middle of the transverse shaft of the corridor crypt to the crossing (fig. 118); the latter, a small hall crypt around the tomb of the Saint, accessible both from east and west (fig. 119). Hecht was on the right track, in my opinion, in suggesting a hall crypt, but a hall crypt about 13 feet square is not commensurate with the generous proportions of the other parts of the Church. Had the designer intended a crypt either of the type suggested by Ostendorf, or of that suggested by Hecht, he could have expressed his intention easily by the addition of only a few more lines. The fact that he did not do this suggests that he had in mind a crypt that extended over the entire width of the fore choir and as far outward as the safety of its foundation walls permitted. That groin-vaulted hall crypts of these dimensions were fully within the technical competence of a Carolingian architect may be inferred from the vaulted ground stories of Carolingian westworks, a remarkable example of which survives in the Abbey of Corvey (fig. 120).25 25 Rave, 1957, figs. 61 and 65. The excavations of Joseph Vonderau at Fulda brought to light an aisled hall crypt of approximately 30 × 30 feet, which was built by Abbot Eigil between 820 and 822 under the east choir of Ratger's church (802-817).26 26 Vonderau, 1931, 49-58. It had nine groin vaults resting on six freestanding piers or columns and nine corresponding wall supports (fig. 122). The earliest surviving hall-crypt of this type, as far as I know, is the crypt of the Church of St. George in Oberzell on the island of Reichenau (fig. 121), built by Abbot Haito III between 890 and 896 in an oratory that had been founded by Bishop Haito (d. 823).27 27 Gall, 1956, 24-25 and pl. 10. By analogy with these parallels we have reconstructed the confessio of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall as a hall crypt having a surface area of 20 × 32½ feet, covered by 6 groin vaults, each 10½ feet square (fig. 123).28 28 These reconstructions were first displayed in the Council of Europe Exhibition "Karl der Grosse" held in Aachen in 1965, in connection with the showing of a model reconstruction of the buildings shown on the Plan of St. Gall (cf. above, p. 6). They were first published in Horn 1966, plate figures 8 and 9. The corridor crypt may have been covered either by a simple barrel vault, as in St.-Germain of Auxerre (fig. 157). or by a continuous series of groin vaults, as in Flavigny (fig. 158). Richard Krautheimer, in an exchange of letters devoted to this subject, questioned the tenability of my interpretation of the confessio of the Church of the Plan as an inner hall crypt and, as we failed to arrive at any agreement on this point, allowed me to discuss our variances of opinion in print. Krautheimer feels convinced that the tomb of St. Gall should be assumed to have had its place, not behind the altar (as shown on the Plan) but beneath it. This was its traditional place in Early Christian times from the fourth century onward, as is exemplified by such churches as St. Peter's, Santa Prassede, San Giorgio in Velabro, Santa Cecilia, and many others.29 29 For St. Peter's see Toynbee and Ward Perkins, 1956, 136ff (also below, pp. 196ff). For S. Prassede, S. Giorgio in Velabro, Santa Cecilia and others see Braun, I, 1924, 558. By analogy with these churches Krautheimer suggests the entrance designated accessus ad confessionem should not be interpreted as a gate giving access to a hall crypt, but as a window fenestella opening into a small rectangular chamber located in front or around the tomb of the Saint. Coming from a man whose knowledge about Early Christian and Early Medieval Architecture is matched by none, these views must be given the most careful consideration. They are bound to be shared by others and have, in fact, already been suggested by Hans Reinhardt in 1937 and 195230 30 Reinhardt, 1937, 237 and 1952, 18 and figs. on 21 and 22 (also above, p. 141, and below, pp. 180ff). , by René Louis in 1952, and by Louis Hertig in 1958.31 31 Louis, 1952, 64ff; Hertig, 1958, 179ff. In reviewing the evidence, I find that I cannot concur with these interpretations for a number of reasons: 1. Nowhere in any of the forty-odd buildings of the Plan or any of its other installations does the drafter of the scheme show anything as lying behind another object when he means it to lie beneath it. Wherever something was meant to be below or above something else this is indicated through an explanatory title beginning with the preposition infra or supra.32 32 Cf. above, p. 59. 2. In the churches of the monastery of St. Gall, from the seventh century onward, i.e., in the early Irish oratory as well as the churches which superseded it under Abbot Otmar (719-759) and Abbot Gozbert (830-836), the sarcophagus which enshrined the body of the Saint was de facto not below but behind the altar (inter aram et parietem). I have already had occasion to refer to this fact.33 33 In my description of the church above, p. 141. The same condition prevailed at St. Riquier (Centula) as is attested by a well-known passage in the Chronicle of Hariulf which reads: "The tomb [of St. Richarius] itself, however, is so placed that at the feet of this Saint his altar stands in an elevated place, and at his head stands the altar of the apostle St. Peter." (Sepultura vero ipsa ita posita est, ut a parte pedum ipsius sancti altare sit in loco editiori, a parte capitis sancti Petri Apostoli ara persistat.)34 34 Hariulf, Book II, chap. 7, ed. Lot, 1894, 54. 118. PLAN OF ST. GALL Crypt of Church, Ostendorf's interpretation [Ostendorf 1922, 43, fig. 279] This proposal provides a shaft too narrow to allow monks to pray in privacy near the saint's tomb, and furnishes insufficient separation from laymen, 119. PLAN OF ST. GALL Crypt of Church, Hecht's interpretation [Hecht, 1928, pl. 10b] Hecht is more generous in his provision of space around the tomb of St. Gall than is Ostendorf, yet he still allows for too indiscriminate an intermixture of monks and laymen. 120. CORVEY-ON-THE-WESER, GERMANY WESTWORK OF ABBEY CHURCH, GROUND FLOOR (873-885) While most Early Christian and Carolingian churches were timber roofed, the art of vaulting continued to be practised in crypts and westworks, where it was needed to carry the weight of the superincumbent work. Corvey and St. Riquier are magnificent examples of this tradition. In the 11th century the groin was freed from confinement underground or in the avant-corps and ascended into the principal body of the church, first to aisles (Jumièges, figs. 189.A-D), then to nave (Speyer, figs. 190.A-B). In the transfer of Carolingian modularity to the elevation of the church, and its marriage, at roof level, with the tradition of groin vaulting, medieval bay division enters its final and most accomplished phase. 3. To interpret accessus ("access") as fenestella ("window") is doing injustice to the Latinity of the churchman who framed the explanatory titles of the Plan. Accessus is "bodily admittance" (accedere means "to approach," "to step toward"). The concept fenestella implies the opposite, because a window, although granting visual access, is part of a wall or barrier that precludes a bodily approach. The clarity of the other explanatory titles of the Plan suggests that if the framer of these titles had wanted to designate the presence of a window in the wall between the two flights of stairs which lead from the crossing to the high altar he would have done so by choosing the proper and traditional term for this device.35 35 With regard to the use of the term fenestella for windows opening into a chamber sheltering the relics of a saint, see Braun, I, 1924, 561ff. In Walahfrid Strabo's account of the Miracles of St. Gall, there is mention of a fenestella opening into the confessio of Abbot Gozbert's church at St. Gall, but this window was in the pavement of the presbytery in front of the high altar and it allowed the light of a lamp suspended in front of that altar to "fall upon the altar of the crypt beneath it.36 36 For a full quotation of this passage see above, p. 141. 4. Finally, I must re-emphasize a point already amply stressed in my descriptive analysis of the Plan: The layout of the barriers in the two transept arms of the Church leaves no doubt that the crank-shaped circumambient crypt of the Church is reserved for the secular visitors of the tomb, the southern arm serving as access for the Pilgrims and Paupers, the northern arm for Distinguished Guests (fig. 82).37 37 See above, p. 130. The monks, too, needed access to the sarcophagus containing the relics of the Saint. I am drawing attention once more in this context to chapter 7 of a capitulary issued by Charlemagne in 789, which directs in the clearest and most unequivocal terms that such private oratories be constructed "near the place where the sacred body rests so that the brothers can pray in secrecy."38 38 See above, pp. 144ff. Monastic integrity and seclusion required that such an oratory be separate from those spaces through which the secular visitors gain access to the tomb. A simple fenestella, located at a distance of 17½ feet from the westernmost end of the tomb of St. Gall could not have performed this function and, in fact would have been meaningless. There was a need for devotional space in front of the tomb, sufficiently large to accommodate an altar and large enough to admit at least a modicum of worshipping monks. One might quarrel about the relative size of that space, but one should not question its existence. In discussions of this as well as of many other important features of the Plan of St. Gall, the innovative character of this ingenious monastery scheme has been consistently underrated. The spatial functional needs of a Carolingian monastery church differed vastly from those of their metropolitan Early Christian prototype churches and called for new solutions. We shall have more to say about this in the next chapter. WINDOWS The reconstruction of the windows offers no serious difficulties, as Carolingian windows survive in many places. We have fashioned the windows of the Church of the Plan after those of the basilica of Einhardt at Steinbach-in-the Odenwald (827), the design of which has been the subject of a special study by Walter Boeckelmann.39 39 Boeckelmann, 1957, 141-49. These windows are narrow at the outer wall surface; however, the jambs are strongly splayed toward the inside, with steeply slanting sills and arches. Splayed windows appear sporadically in Roman architecture,40 40 Ibid., 148, note 5. and toward the end of the sixth century (although not a typical feature even then), and they were apparently common enough to attract the notice of Gregory the Great (590-604), who expressed himself on their virtues: In splayed windows that portion through which the light enters is narrow but the inner jambs which receive the light are wide. In like manner, the minds of those who contemplate, although they perceive the true light only weakly, are broadened internally to ample fullness. . . . And as the windows are both open and protected, so the hearts of those who are receptive to the grace of God will be replenished, and yet will not permit the enemy to enter in haughtiness.41 41 Sancti Gregorii Magni Homiliarum in Ezechielem, Lib. II, Hom. 5, chap. 17 (Migne, Patr. Lat., LXXVI, 1849, col. 995): In fenestris obliquis pars illa per quam lumen intrat angusta est, sed pars interior quae lumen suscipit lata, quia mentes contemplantium quamvis aliquid tenuiter de vero lumine videant, in semetipsis tamen magna amplitudine dilatantur . . . Et patent itaque fenestrae, et munitae sunt, quia et aperta est in mentibus eorum gratia qua replenitur, et tamen ad se adversarium ingredi per superbiam non permittunt. Isidore of Seville (c. 570-636), too, makes mention of splayed windows and remarks that in his days these were often seen in buildings used for the storage of grain: Fenestrae sunt quibus pars exterior angusta et interior diffusa [est] quales in horreis videmus. (Isidori Hisp. Episc. Etymol. sive Orig., Book XV, chap. 7, 5; ed. Lindsay, 1911, written between 622 and 633). In times when glass was a rare and costly commodity, the splayed window offered the advantage of keeping the area of glass minimal, while admitting the maximum amount of light. ROOF There can be no doubt that the frame of the roof of the Church of St. Gall was meant to be constructed in timber. It took two more centuries in the development of western architecture before basilicas of major dimensions were vaulted in stone. Since no timbered Carolingian church roofs survive to guide us in our reconstruction, the details of the carpentry of the roof of the Church must remain a matter of conjecture. The earliest extant medieval church roofs date from the twelfth century. They consist of simple sequences of coupled rafters of uniform scantling rising 121. REICHENAU-OBERZELL. CHURCH OF ST. GEORGE (890-896). CRYPT This view shows the crypt as seen from its entry shaft. Of monumental simplicity and great structural beauty, the crypt is square in plan and coextensive with the square choir rising above it. It is covered by nine groin vaults supported in the center by four free-standing columns. from the ends of a tie-beam and made rigid by collar beams and an elaborate system of bracing struts. The cross section of the twelfth-century roofs of the churches of St.-Germain-des-Prés and St.-Pierre-de-Montmartre in Paris (figs. 124125) are typical examples.42 42 After Deneux, 1927, 50, figs. 70 and 71. Deneux believes that the roof of St.-Germain-des-Prés, as he has reconstructed it, dates from 1044. In volume 1 of the series Charpentes, published by the Ministère de l'éducation nationale, Direction de l'architecture, Centre de recherches sur les Monuments historiques, the same roof is ascribed to the twelfth century. Although perfectly feasible for churches of moderate dimensions, this roof design would not have been solid enough, in my opinion, to safely span the vast interstices between the clerestory walls of the larger Carolingian churches. The nave of the Abbey Church of Fulda, 802819 (fig. 138) had an inner width of 17m (calculated by Vonderau as corresponding to 60 Roman feet),43 43 Vonderau, 1924, 20. and thus was narrower than the nave of its Early Christian prototype, Old St. Peter's in Rome (fig. 141), by only a small margin (18.80m, listed by Volbach as corresponding to 61 feet, 8 inches).44 44 Volbach, 1961, 20. I am inclined to believe that the roof that covered the basilica of Fulda derived its design from the same source that inspired the entire building.45 45 On the dependence of Fulda and Old St. Peter's in Rome, see Krautheimer, 1942, 8ff and below, pp. 187ff. That the roof of Old St. Peter's was well known to Frankish architects may be inferred from two letters of Pope Hadrian I to Charlemagne (one written between 779 and 801; the other, between 781 and 786), in which the pontiff asks the emperor not only for the beams for the repair of the roof of St. Peter's but also for a magister to supervise the work— clear evidence of the high esteem Frankish carpenters and builders enjoyed in Rome in those days. The Pope asked for the services of no lesser man than Wilcharius, Bishop of Sens, to direct the restoration.46 46 Krautheimer, 1942, 24, drew attention to these conditions. The letter was published in Mon. Germ. Hist., Epist., III, 592ff and 609ff. Carlo Fontana made an engraving in 1694 of the roof trusses spanning the nave of Old St. Peter's (fig. 126); these he considered to be an authentic record of the original (Early Christian) roof of the church.47 47 On the roof of Old St. Peter's, see Fontana, 1694, 98-99, the source of our fig. 12; see Rondelet, III, 1862, and Plates, pl. 77, fig. 9; and Ostendorf, 1908, 77ff. The nave span of the Church of the Plan is only about one-half (40 feet) of that of Old St. Peter's, and therefore, would not have required a roof of such heavy design. In our reconstruction of the roof of the Church (figs. 108-110) we have been guided by a roof design which, it is believed, was a standard Early Christian type, and which, to judge by a description in Vitruvius' Fourth Book,48 48 Vitruvius, De Architectura, Book IV, chap. 2; ed. Krohn, 1912, 80. To William S. Anderson, at Berkeley, and Sterling Dow of Harvard, I am indebted for valuable advice in the translation of this chapter and the interpretation of its technical terms. must also have been standard for broad spans in Roman Imperial times. Vitruvius distinguishes between two roof types, one suited for "spaces of relatively small dimensions" (commoda spatia), the other for buildings involving "broader spans" (majora spatia). The former, according to his description, consisted of two simple rows of rafters converging at the top in a ridge beam and extending downward all the way out to the eaves of the building (columen et cantherii prominentes ad extremam subgrundationem); the latter was made up of a sequence of vertical trusses which supported the covering of the roof by means of purlins. Vitruvius lists the different parts that make up this frame and tells us that their names express their different functions (ea autem uti in nominationibus ita in re habet utilitates); "Under the roof, if the span is broader, there are tie-beams (transtra) and bracing struts (capreoli). . . . Above the principal rafters (cantherii) there are the common rafters (asseres) extending outward sufficiently to protect the walls with their overhang."49 49 "Sub tectis, si maiora spatia sunt, et transtra et capreoli . . . supra cantherios templa; deinde sub tegulas asseres ita prominentes, uti parietes proiecturis eorum tegantur" (Vitruvius, loc. cit.). This terminology is indeed highly descriptive and typical of the classical habit of defining the functions of inanimate objects by imagery borrowed from animate life. Cantherius (a beast of burden) is an appropriate term for the load-bearing action of the rafters; capreolus (a wild goat) expresses vivdly the butting action of the diagonal timbers locked in the center and at the bottom of the king post like the horns of two fighting goats; transtrum, derived from the preposition trans (across) is equally expressive of the purpose of the large crossbeam that forms the base of the truss. Vitruvius fails to furnish us with the name for the king post, which in this type of construction rises almost invariably from the center of the tie-beam to the ridge pole. The primary function of this post is not to support, as has been frequently thought, but to serve as a base of departure for the diagonal bracing struts which prop the rafters midway in their span, and thus prevent them from sagging inward under the load of the roof covering.50 50 In many historically known cases of this roof type, the king post does not even reach down to the tie beam, but stops a short distance from the upper surface of the tie beam. This happens to be the case in the trusses of the roof of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai, mentioned below. The early translators and commentators on Vitruvius have interpreted these descriptions of the two basic Roman roof types correctly; and such reconstructions based upon these interpretations as are found, for instance, in Barbaro's Italian translation of Vitruvius, published by Francesco Marcolini in 1556 (fig. 127)51 51 Vitruvius, 1556, 116. or in the 1827 edition of Vitruvius published with commentary by Joannes Polenus,52 52 Vitruvius, 1827, pl. XXIV, figs. iii and iv. cannot, in my opinion, be improved upon. The correctness of such interpretations has recently been confirmed by George H. Forsyth's extraordinary discovery of the original timbers of the roof of the sixth-century church of St. Catherine at Mount Sinai, which is the 122. FULDA. ABBEY CHURCH HALL CRYPT (817-819) [after Vonderau, 1949, 52, fig. 6] The monk Racholf, under Eigil's abbacy, built two crypts, one before the western, the other beneath the eastern apse of Ratger's church. Both were destroyed, the west crypt during construction of the 18th-century church and the east when two circular towers standing to its side collapsed in 1120-21. This apse was completely rebuilt (1123-1158) by Markward, presumably in its original form. Both crypts were dedicated by Bishop Heistulf of Mainz in 819. (For archaeological details see Vonderau, 1931, 49-61; for documentary sources the prose and metric Vita Eigilis, in Mon. Germ. Hist., Script. XV:1, 229, and ibid., Poetae Lat. 11, 108.) earliest surviving example of its kind.53 53 A detailed description of this roof by George H. Forsyth will be found in The Monastery of St. Catherine at Mount Sinai: The Church and Fortress of Justinian, ed. George H. Forsyth, Ihor Šev?enco, and Kurt Weitzmann (University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 1974). The roof is comprised of thirteen low-pitched and sturdy trusses connected longitudinally by means of purlins. Its sixth-century date is attested by a Justinian inscription in one of the tie beams as well as by radiocarbon tests. For a brief preliminary description and a photographic reproduction of the interior of the roof, see Forsyth, 1968, 1-19. But the design of others, of even earlier date—exhibiting the classical truss formed by tie-beam, rafters, and bracing struts54 54 See Butler, 1929, 199, figs. 201 and 204 (from which our figs. 20 and 27 are taken). The distance and disposition of these trusses can be judged by the position of the masonry corbels in the clerestory walls of many Syrian churches. When the trusses were placed at short intervals, the roof-covering of tiles and stones could be laid directly upon the purlins; when the distance was great, the covering was laid upon an outer set of rafters which rested on purlins, as in Vitruvius's broad-span roof. —is engraved into the masonry gables of the porches of certain Syrian churches of around 400 (figs. 128 and 129). In Italy this roof type survived unchanged throughout the Middle Ages. One of the finest extant examples is the magnificent fourteenth-century roof of the church of San Miniato al Monte in Florence.55 55 For San Miniato al Monte, see Salmi, 1926, pl. XII; and Paatz, IV, 1952, 225. In conformity with this well-attested Roman and Early Christian roof tradition, we have reconstructed the roof of the Church of the Plan as a trussed timber roof with purlins supporting an outer set of rafters (figs. 108-110). The proportions of the Church suggest that these trusses were placed at a distance of 20 feet from one another over the center of each nave column, or at intervals of 10 feet, if we assume intermediate trusses over the apex of each arcade midway between the columns. Our roof pitch is of course purely conjectural. Since the Church of the Plan lies stylistically midway between the Early Christian and the Romanesque, we have constructed it at an angle of 45 degrees—a pitch considerably more obtuse than that of the average Early Christian roof, yet substantially more acute than the average roof of the transalpine churches of the tenth and eleventh centuries. ROOF COVERING The customary material used for covering the roofs of Carolingian churches was tile or lead. The distinction is not always clear, as the term tegula (classical Latin for "ceramic tile") is used for both. However, it is probably safe to assume that when tegula is used without the qualifying adjective plumbea, it stands for tile. When Benedict of Aniane founded his first monastery at the banks of the stream of that name, he covered the building "not with red-gleaming tiles, but with thatch" (non tegulis rubentibus, sed stramine).56 56 Schlosser, 1896, 183, No. 573. Conversely, when he rebuilt the monastery in 772, "he covered the houses not with thatch, but with tiles" (non iam stramine domos, sed 123. PLAN OF ST. GALL CRYPT OF THE CHURCH AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION Whatever the precise shape of the space designated CONFESSIO it obviously could not have exceeded an area confined to the north and south by masonry of the Presbytery walls and to the west and east by walls separating CONFESSIO from crossing and from the transverse arm of the corridor crypt. It is also clear that the Crypt's two longitudinal arms would have come to lie outside the masonry of the Presbytery walls. To clear these walls they would each, in construction, be moved outward by 2½ feet; but the builder could have easily complied with this need, since the Crypt arms were underground and the space invaded by their outward displacement would not have diminished any adjacent structure. The CONFESSIO surely must have been covered with groin vaults because of the weight of the superincumbent Presbytery floor with its high altar and heavy loading from constant use. In the plan shown to the right Ernest Born has subdivided the 40-foot squares of crossing and Presbytery internally each into sixteen 10-foot squares and the latter again (in the areas occupied by the crypt) each into sixteen 2½-foot squares. Our reconstruction shows how easily and convincingly the masonry of an actual building can be developed within the framework of the grid that forms the conceptual basis of the Plan — masonry and foundation solid enough to carry the load of the superincumbent walls of the Church. The CONFESSIO is here interpreted as an inner hall crypt of roughly 20 by 30 feet with a ceiling formed by six groin vaults each covering the surface area of a 10-foot square (100 square feet). In the interpretation illustrated here the gray tint indicates walls of the church above in locations depicted on the original document, and the U-shaped crypt passage or corridor is presumed to be covered with a barrel vault. tegulis cooperuit).57 57 Ibid., 184, No. 574. From chapter 26 of the capitulary issued by Charlemagne at the synod of Frankfurt in 794, it appears that tile was then the customary cover for church roofs.58 58 Ibid., 11, No. 41; and Mon. Germ. Hist., Leg. II, Cap. I, ed. Alfred Boretius, 1883, 76, chap. 26: "Lignamen, et petras sive tegulas, qui in domus ecclesiarum fuerint." But before the century had come to a close, lead appears to have moved into the foreground. It was with tegulis plumbeis that Charlemagne covered the Palace Chapel at Aachen (consecrated in 805).59 59 Schlosser, 1896, 29, No. 112. The same material was used by Abbot Ansegis (807-833) to cover the church of St. Peter's at St. Wandrille,60 60 Ibid., 290, No. 870: "Ipsam namque turrim simulque obsidem tegulis plumbeis a novo cooperiri iussit." by Bishop Hincmar (845882) to cover the roof of the cathedral of Reims,61 61 Ibid., 250, No. 771: "Terti templi plumbeis cooperuit tabulis." and by Einhard to cover the roof of his church of SS. Peter and Marcellinus, at Seligenstadt (started in 827). The purchase of lead for the latter and the difficulties encountered in procuring it are discussed in an undated letter of Einhard's written to an unidentified abbot: I am speaking about the conversation we had when, meeting in the Palace, we talked about the roof of the blessed martyrs of Christ. Marcellinus and Peter, which I am now trying to build, although with great difficulty, and a purchase of lead for the price of 50 pounds was agreed between us. But although work at the basilica has not yet reached the point where I should be concerned with the necessity of building the roof, yet it always seems that we should hasten, because of the uncertain span of mortal life, to complete the good work we have begun, with God's help.62 62 Einhardi omnia opera; ed. Teulet, II, 1843, 82-85. After this paragraph was written, Bernard Bachrach brought to my attention an article by Hans van Werveke on the commerce of lead in the Middle Ages, where reference to other lead-covered churches may be found. See van Werveke, 1926. II.2.2 THE CHURCH AS MODIFIED IN THE LIGHT OF ITS CORRECTIVE TITLES To reconstruct what the Church of the Plan would have looked like had it been modified in the light of the corrective titles is an intriguing historical task and has produced a variety of different proposals. It is not surprising that no agreement has ever been reached in this matter. The attempt involves some delicate changes on which even Carolingian architects might not easily have come to terms with one another. GEORG DEHIO (1887) &amp; JOSEPH HECHT (1924) One of the distinctive and historically most fascinating features of the Church drawing is that it is constructed according to a system of squares (fig. 61), exhibiting a principle of spatial organization that became a guiding feature in certain schools of the Romanesque, two centuries later.63 63 For fuller information on this feature, see above, pp. 90ff and below, pp. 212ff. To reduce the Church to the requested length of 200 feet implies the abandonment of the square schematism; anyone who attempts to redraw the Church using the measurements listed in the explanatory titles has made this distressing discovery. Not wishing to totally relinquish this feature Georg Dehio, who belonged to a generation of architectural historians profoundly interested in the problem of modular geometricity in medieval architecture, retained the squares in the transept and in the fore choir. By diminishing the interstices of the arcades of the nave to the stipulated twelve feet, he then arrived at the compromise length of 218 feet (fig. 130).64 64 Dehio and von Bezold, Plate, vol. I, 1887, pl. 42, fig. 2 and Dehio, I, 1919, 25, fig. 37. Joseph Hecht, pursuing similar lines of thought, arrived at a length of 224 feet.65 65 J. Hecht, I, 1928, 27ff and pl. 8, fig. a. 124. PARIS.

ROME. ROOF OF OLD ST. PETER'S RECORDED IN 1694 IN CARLO FONTANA'S TEMPLUM VIATICANUM ET IPSIUS ORIGO. Detail of engraving same size as original [after FONTANA, 1694, 99] In publishing this design of what he refers to as "the trusses which sustained the roof over the nave of Old St. Peter's" (LE INCAUALLATURE, CHE SOSTUEUANO LI TETTI DELLA NAUE MAGGIORE . . . DEL ANTICA BASILICA VATICANA) Carlo Fontana (1634-1714), disciple and collaborator of Lorenzo Bernini and architect in charge of the Pontifical Office of Architects and Engineers, informs his readers that his engraving was made after an "accurate drawing" (UN GIUSTO DISEGNO) tendered him by an "informed person" (UNA PERSONA DILETTEUOLE); and that it was because of the extraordinary constructional "sophistication" (INTELLIGENZA) as well as the soundness of the timbers employed in these trusses that the roof of the Constantinian basilica survived intact for so many centuries—to the extent that when finally taken down, it was found to be in such good condition that its timbers could be reassembled to sustain the roof of the Palazzo Farnese. If timbers from the roof of Old St. Peter's were re-used in the Palazzo Farnese (1546-1589) they must have come from the western half of the nave dismantled by Bramante (1502) to make room for the construction of New St. Peter's. The eastern half of the nave (closed off from the construction site by a provisional wall under Paul III, 1534-1549) was demolished only in 1606 to make room for Carlo Maderna's westward elongation of New St. Peter's. The roof timbers of this portion were also re-used, this time for the Palazzo Borghese (1605-1621). The names of the component members of the truss shown in Fontana's engraving are enumerated on two scrolls which form part of the drawing. On these the tie beams are referred to as CORDE MAGGIORI (B), the collar beams as CORDE MINORI (C), the rafters as PARADOSSI (D), the center post suspended from the apex of the truss as traue pendente adVso di monaco (E). During the 12th to 13th centuries of its existence, the roof of the Constantinian basilica of Old St. Peter's was, not surprisingly, in need of numerous repairs. A complete account of them, including what in the sources is referred to as a "renovation" by Pope Benedict XII (fecit fieri de novo tecta huius Basilicae sub anno 1341) is given by Michele Cerrati in Tiberii Alpharini, "De Basilica Vaticana Antiquissima et Nova Structura" (STUDI E TESTI vol. 26 Rome, 1914, 13 note 2; brought to my attention by my colleague Loren Partridge). There is no compelling reason to presume that Benedict's renovation involved any basic changes in the roof's design. Fontana's rendering of the trusses of Old St. Peter's is in complete accord with that which Vitruvius recommends for broad spans, except that all of the principal members of the truss are doubled, and that the tie beams are fashioned in two pieces, joined midway by an overlapping scarf joint. Owing to the extraordinary width of the nave of Old St. Peter's (23.6 3m.), two-piece tie beams were necessary since it would have been hard to find trees of sufficient height to yield single timbers to span the whole space. Doubling all of the principal members was an extremely wise constructional feature—probably the primary contribution to the longevity of the Constantinian trusses—which evolved from the strategic function made of the TRAVE PENDENTE. The scheme is a laminative one; a kind of truss-sandwich is formed in which the structural components are assembled and joined in a function that yields, in effect, a "pair" of trusses, but which is really a single homogeneous creation of remarkable simplicity and purity of concept—revealing a mastery of static mechanics that transcends Vitruvius and commands admiration today. Yet the design does not seem to have found general acceptance. On the contrary, a medieval carpentry truss, when it is impressive, gains our attention rather by its quaintness, its intricacy of joinery and the complexity of its members. The construction is ingenious. Transmitting the entire roof load to the two outer ends of the tie beams, the principal rafters D-D are in compression and thus act as columns as well as beams. Column action augmented by the deflection of beam action is resisted by the horizontal strut C-C (collar beam) which functions in compression. These minor chords support the rafter pairs midway in their span, a construction that reduces the effective length of the rafters to approximately one-fourth the nave span. Strut C-C is supported at mid-point by the vertical member E-E (MONACO) which concurrently serves as a tension member to prevent sag in the great lower chords. The scarf joint of these tie beams, tabled, locked, and girdled by iron bands, prevents them from separating in the horizontal plane. In contemplating the brilliance and simplicity of the design, remember that the wall-to-wall span was above 84 feet—reflecting a state of theory of mechanics and knowledge of structure existing in the 4th century! 127. TWO BASIC ROMAN ROOF TYPES [after Vitruvius, Fourth Book on Architecture; interpreted by Barbaro in his translation of 1556] HANS REINHARDT (1937 and 1952) Hans Reinhardt, who tends to under-evaluate the square schematism of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall,66 66 See below, pp. 212ff. attempted to resolve these discrepancies by developing a drawing in which the Church was shown reduced to 200 feet. But to attain this goal he found himself compelled to reduce the fore choir and the space of the crypt beneath it to one-fourth of their original dimensions, and thus he arrived at a modified plan which appears to retain no spiritual kinship to the original concept of the drawing (fig. 131).67 67 Reinhardt, 1937, 237; and 1952, 18 and figures on 21 and 22. Reinhardt contracts the Church most severely where contraction hurts most: in the all-important area around the high altar and the tomb of St. Gall, where the entire body of the monks assembled daily for a total of four hours or more, in common chant and the celebration of the divine services. He placed the high altar against the very edge of the raised choir, where it drops vertically down to the floor level of the transept leaving no space for the officiating priest and his attendants (fig. 132). A step on the eastern side of the altar suggests that Reinhardt imagines the priest to stand behind the altar facing west. This not only is incompatible with what is known to have been a general custom in Carolingian liturgy,68 68 On altar orientation in Carolingian times, see Braun, I, 1924, 411ff. and Otto Nussbaum's exhaustive study on The Position of the Officiating Priest at the Christian Altar Prior to the Year 1000, which was not published when these lines were written. Nussbaum's analysis of the altarspace in Carolingian and Proto-Carolingian churches of Germany, France and Switzerland has proven without any shadow of doubt that from the end of the seventh century onward the officiating priest stood between the altar and the populace facing the altar eastward. This is the position in which he is shown on the ivory covers of the Drogo Sacramentary, in scenes where he celebrates the Mass or is engaged in other phases of the religious service. From a reading of the Frankish edition of the Ordo Romanus I, issued during the first half of the eighth century (as well as all later editions of this treatise) Nussbaum infers that when the service was performed by the bishop in person, the latter had to walk from his cathedra in the apex of the apse westward around and to the front of the altar where he celebrated the Mass with his back turned toward the worshipping crowd. (See Nussbaum, 1963, 305ff and summary of this chapter, 358-66). but also in open conflict with fourteen other altars in the Church of the Plan (figs. 84, 93 and 99). Their layout leaves no doubt that the officiating priest stood west of the altar, facing east; the 128. SYRIA, BATUTA CHAPEL. PORCH, SOUTH SIDE [courtesy Princeton University Archaeological Expedition to Syria] location of the altar barriers and the position of the crosses leaves no doubt on this score. One feels equally puzzled about Reinhardt's modification of the crypt. The drafter of the Plan provided the monastery with two crypts with different but complementary functions. One is an outer corridor crypt in the shape of a crank, which takes the pilgrims and the other secular visitors to the tomb of St. Gall. The other is an inner crypt which lies beneath the high altar and is reached from the crossing through a passage marked accessus ad confessionem, between the two flights of steps that lead up to the fore choir (fig. 99). Being accessible from an area 130. PLAN OF ST. GALL. CHURCH [after Dehio, 1887, pl. 42 and fig. 2] Dehio reconciles the conflict between the "corrective" titles of the plan of the Church and the manner in which it is drawn, by reducing the arcade spans to 12 feet. Leaving Transept and Presbytery untouched, he retains the full measure of space (and incidentally its square schematism in the liturgically most vital part of the Church, where monks assembled daily for no less than four hours of religious services. This solution is acceptable—even perfect—if one excludes the western apse, as Dehio seems to have done, from the 200-foot length prescribed for the Church. Dehio's church measures 218 feet from apex to apex of its apses. 131. PLAN OF ST. GALL. CHURCH [after Reinhardt, 1952, 20] Reinhardt proceeded by assuming that the 200-foot prescribed length of the Church must be understood to include both apses. He adopted Dehio's solution for the nave of the Church and accomplished a further reduction of the overall length to exactly 200 feet by eliminating the fore choir, moving the high altar into the apse, dispensing with the altar of St. Paul, placing the tomb of St. Gall beneath the altar, and the high altar itself, into a position where it had to be serviced from the east rather than the west as was customary in this period. 129. SYRIA. BRAD CONVENT. PEDIMENT OF PORCH [after Butler, 1929, 199, fig. 201] Had Forsyth not discovered the 6th-century roof of St. Catherine's on Mt. Sinai, Brad and Batuta (fig. 128) would be sole evidence for reconstructing the design of timbered roofs in Early Christian Syria. St. Catherine's roof is still functioning, in perfect condition. See The Monastery of St. Catherine at Mt. Sinai, 1973. reserved for the exclusive use of the monks, this can only have been a hall crypt providing the monks with prayer space around the tomb of St. Gall.69 69 On the layout of the crypt, see above, pp. 144ff and below, pp. 196ff. Reinhardt eliminates this confessio altogether and thus creates a spatial vacuum in one of the most spiritually vital spots of the Church. From a liturgical and functional point of view the removal of the fore choir is fatal. Moreover, it is devastating in its effect on the subsidiary spaces of the Sacristy and the Scriptorium, which are built against the fore choir and, like the latter, each cover a surface area of 40 × 40 feet. What does Reinhardt propose to do with them? To reduce them proportionately would render them unusable;70 70 As correctly observed by Walter Boeckelmann, 1956, 127: "Sakristei, Schreibstube und Bibliothek schrumpfen zu schmalen Kammern zusammen . . . der korrigierte Plan kann nicht mehr als exemplarisch gelten." to retain them as originally planned would amount to an aesthetic degradation of the apse which seems incompatible with its liturgical and architectural function. Reinhardt's proposal also seems unsuitable in general historical terms. The interposition of a separate spatial unit between apse and transept is one of the new and original features of Carolingian architecture. It appeared in Neustadt-on-the-Main shortly after 768-769 (figs. 116, 133); in the abbey church of St. Riquier (Centula) between 790799 (fig. 135); in the church of Vreden around 800 (fig. 136); in the cathedral of St. Mary and St. Peter of Cologne, prior to the death of its founder, Archbishop Hildebold, d. 819 (fig. 139); in St. Mary at Mittelzell on Reichenau, as rebuilt by Abbot Haito between 806 and 816 (fig. 134); and in the abbey church of Hersfeld, if Groszmann's reconstruction is correct, between 831 and 851.71 71 For Neustadt-on-Main, see Boeckelmann, 1951, 43-44 and 1956, 38ff and 58ff. For St. Riquier (Centula), see Gall, 1930 and E. Lehmann, 1938, 109. For Vreden see Winkelmann, 1953, 304-19. For the Carolingian church of Cologne, see Weyres, 1965, 384-423; and the literature quoted above on p. 26, note 4. For St. Mary in Mittelzell, see Reisser, 1960, and Christ, 1956. For Hersfeld, see Groszmann, 1955, 9, and Feldkeller, 1964, 1-19. The primary motivation for this new spatial entity was, as Thümmler has correctly pointed out, the desire to isolate and strengthen the importance of the high altar, at which the choral services were held, and to provide more space for the officiating clergy.72 72 Thümmler, 1960, col. 95. The increasing dimensions of the crypt, and the latter's division into an outer corridor crypt for the pilgrims and an inner confessionary for the monks, is directly related to this development. Both of these innovations were responses to pressing liturgical needs. ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF DEHIO'S INTERPRETATION It is easy to understand why Dehio was reluctant to undertake any changes in the eastern parts of the Church and took the step, for which he was subsequently so severely criticized, of making the Church a little larger (218 feet) than the stipulated 200 feet. However, there remains the question whether Dehio is really guilty of such a compromise. His reconstruction may in fact be based upon a more accurate interpretation of the title which prescribes the reduction. Dehio's critics interpret the propositional phrase AB ORIENTE AD OCCIDENT? to mean "From the apex of the eastern apse to the apex of the western apse." There is no assurance whatsoever that this is in fact what the title meant to convey. The first five letters of the phrase, AB ORI, are inscribed into the eastern apse, which means that this apse was a component part of the designated length. But the inscription does not run into the round of the western apse; it stops in the westernmost bay of the nave with the numeral .cc. Literally interpreted this would mean that the western apse was not meant to be included in the designated length of 200 feet. If it was not, then Dehio's reconstruction (fig. 130) would run only 8 feet 132. PLAN OF ST. GALL CRYPT &amp; ALTAR SPACE, Reinhardt's Interpretation [after Reinhardt, 1952, 20] Eliminating the fore choir and moving the high altar into the apse would have reduced space occupied by monks during divine services to less than half that foreseen in the Plan. In addition to incongruities described in fig. 131, this would have led to congestion of disastrous proportions in this most heavily used part of the Church. beyond the stipulated length (nine arcades of a span of 12 feet = 108 feet; crossing unit = 40 feet; fore choir = 40 feet; apse = 20 feet. Total = 208 feet)—close enough to be acceptable; and acceptable without any shadow of doubt, if the radius of the eastern apse were shortened from 20 feet to 12 feet.73 73 Throughout the entire width and length of the Plan the scribe takes the utmost care in placing his titles, so that they exactly correspond to the area which they describe. Amongst the total of 340 separate entries there is not a single one where this relationship would be ambiguous or susceptible to misinterpretation. It is imperative, in this context, to draw attention to the fact (entirely disregarded in previous discussions of this subject) that the reconstruction proposed by Georg Dehio appears to conform, indeed, with the manner in which Abbot Gozbert and his builders interpreted the Plan when they rebuilt the church in 830-836, as August Hardegger inferred from the measured architectural drawings made of the church by Pater Gabriel Hecht, in 1725/26, when much of the Carolingian fabric of the church was still identifiable.74 74 For more detail on this subject see our chapter "Rebuilding of the Monastery of St. Gall by Abbot Gozbert and his Successors," II, 319ff. The results of excavations of the remains of Gozbert's church under the pavement of the present church, conducted by H. R. Sennhauser, were not known to me when this chapter was written. From information personally received from Dr. Sennhauser, I infer that his findings confirm the main conjecture here advanced, viz. that the overall reduction in the length of the church was accomplished through a radical shortening of the nave, and not by diminishing the surface area of transept and choir. WOLFGANG SCHÖNE (1960) By far the most radical attempt to reconcile the drawing of the church of the Plan of St. Gall with that of its corrective explanatory titles was that which Wolfgang Schöne published in 1960.75 75 Schöne, 1960, 147-54. Thomas Puttfarken, in an article not available when this chapter was written (Puttfarken, 1968, 78-95) expressed similar views. My objections are the same as those here proffered against Schöne's interpretation. Both studies tend to give insufficient weight to the carefully argued views of previous students of the Plan (Arens, 1938; Boeckelman, 1956). Schöne not only shortened the church to the desired 200 feet, but applied the same reduction to all the other buildings of the Plan. However, in advancing this theory he either overlooked or disregarded the fact that the same proposition had already been discussed and convincingly 133. NEUSTADT-AM-MAIN SAVIOUR'S CHURCH (after 768/69). PLAN [after Boeckelmann, 1952, fig. 3] Although the early date of this church has recently been questioned (see Vorromanische Kirchenbauten, 1965, 233), with other Carolingian churches of similar plan (fig. 153.B) it demonstrates the liveliness of the concept of the square-divided Early Christian quincunx church (figs. 144-149) with tower-surmounted crossing and extended altar space. rejected twenty-two years earlier by Fritz Viktor Arens, who pointed out that if one were to redraw the Plan according to the measurements given for the length of the Church (i.e., 200 feet), the Cloister and all of the service structures of the Plan would be too small to perform their designated functions.76 76 Arens, 1938, 66-67; cf. above, p. 87. My own analysis of the scale used in designing the Plan confirmed this view. Were the Plan redrawn in this manner not only would the monks, including the abbot and the visiting noblemen (i.e., Monks' Dormitory, Abbot's House, and House for Distinguished Guests) no longer fit into their beds, but the Refectory of the Monks would be too small to seat the full contingent of monks, the horses would lack the required floor space to stand in their stables, and the workmen could not carry out their respective crafts and labors.77 77 See my analysis of the Dormitory, below, pp. 249ff; the Abbot's House, below, pp. 321ff; the House for Distinguished Guests, below, p. 155ff; and the Refectory, below, pp. 267ff. The most decisive counter argument, however, to Schöne's interpretation of the Plan is to be found in a statement made by a man who lived at the time when the Plan was drawn. In his commentary on the Rule of St. Benedict, written around 845 in the monastery of Civate, Hildemar, a monk from Corbie, declared that in his days "It was generally held that the cloister should be 100 feet square and no less because that would make it too small."78 78 Wolfgang Hafner has drawn attention to this fact in an interesting article in Studien, 1962, 177-92; see below, p. 246, for a more detailed discussion of this passage. Schöne reduces it to a little less than 67 × 67 feet. It is historically incongruous to assume that a scheme of paradigmatic 134. REICHENAU-MITTELZELL HAITO'S CHURCH (CONSECRATED 816) [after Reisser, 1960, fig. 285] Built by the "author" of the Plan of St. Gall, between 806-817 (but the nave perhaps not before 811), this church continues the tradition of St. Riquier with its extended altar space and tower-surmounted crossing. (Also see figs. 117 and 171 for comment on its alternating supports, and its underlying modular concepts.) significance should propose a cloister whose dimensions fall by one-third below what at the time was considered to be the lowest suitable limit. ADOLF REINLE (1963-64) The reconstruction of Adolf Reinle (fig. 137), because of his radically different interpretation of the axial explanatory title of the Church, occupies a position entirely apart from those of any of the previous students of the Plan. Translating the axial title of the Church "AB ORIENTE AD OCCIDENTE[M] PED .CC." in the sense of "THIS PLAN IS DRAWN AT THE SCALE OF 1:200," he felt himself under no compulsion to reduce the Church to a length of 200 feet, as so many others had tried to do. He rather endows it with its full length of 300 feet. However, in adjustment to the title which designates the intercolumnar interstices of the arcades of the nave to be 12 feet, Reinle consequently increased the number of arcades from nine to fifteen. Reinle draws support for this interpretation from the observation that arcades of a span of 20 feet (6.8 m.) are not known to have existed in any of the large colonnaded basilicas of the first millennium.79 79 Reinle, 1963/64, 95. This being as it is, he concludes "we must assume that the columnar order of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall is rendered in a schematic manner in logical explication of the system of squares which controls the Plan of the Church."80 80 Ibid. He categorically rejects 135. ST. RIQUIER (CENTULA) ANGILBERT'S ABBEY CHURCH (790-799) [after Achter, 1938, fig. 86] This is the first great Carolingian church built on a Latin cross plan, with extended choir and a monumental westwork. The church is so well described in an 11th-century chronicle that its general outlines can be reconstructed with fair certainty. Achter accounts for irregularities that reflect the Carolingian predecessor of the Gothic church. For her other views of this building see figs. 168 and 196. 136. VREDEN.

Winkelmann, 1953) or ca. 839 (H. Claussen). See Claussen-Winkelmann, "Archäologische Untersuchungen unter der Pfarrkirche zu Vreden (Vorbericht)," Westfalen XXXI, 1953, 304ff. 137. PLAN OF ST. GALL. CHURCH REINLE'S INTERPRETATION OF THE CHURCH OF THE PLAN AS MODIFIED BY ITS CORRECTIVE TITLES [after Reinle, 1962/3, 100] SCALE 1/64 INCH = ONE FOOT [1:768] any connection of this geometricity of the Plan of the Church with the square schematism of the Romanesque.81 81 Ibid. This is too simple a way, in my opinion, to explain a complex historical phenomenon. Columnar interstices of 20 feet, it is true, are not attested for the period in which the Plan was drawn. But this does not mean that such a solution was not within the grasp of an imaginative Carolingian architect. Our analysis of the scale and construction method used in designing the Plan82 82 See above, pp. 112ff. has shown that the author of this scheme proceeded with an acute awareness of the dimensional realities involved in whatever he drew. It is inconceivable, in my opinion, that an architect whose punctilious observance of spatial needs is reflected in the dimensioning of even the smallest detail throughout the entire width and length of the Plan, should have reverted to a radically different method of rendering when he drew the Church of the Monastery and should have spaced the columns at a distance of 20 feet when in fact he meant them to be placed at intervals of 12 feet. A consistent interpretation of the dimensional layout of the Plan permits no other conclusion than that the draftsman meant what he drew. Nor is there evidence to presume that the instruction to make the columnar interstices 12 feet wide stemmed from fears that arcades spanning 20 feet would be a constructional hazard. Our reconstruction (figs. 107-110) demonstrates this point clearly enough. The shortening of the arcade spans was simply an inevitable consequence of the reduction of the overall length of the Church from 300 to 200 feet. It dealt a deadly blow to the square schematism as applied to the nave of the Church— one of the draftsman's favorite and most original ideas— but it was the most reasonable way out of the dilemma caused by the overall reduction of the length of the Church. By reducing the spatial depth of each bay, the corrective title permitted the retention of the original number of altar stations, while at the same time it safeguarded the original concept in those parts of the Church where a reduction would have impaired the primary function of the sanctuary, the conduct of the sacred services in transept and choir.

II. 3 HISTORICAL EVALUATION II.3.1 SALIENT FEATURES OF THE CHURCH The salient features of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall are: its extraordinary length of 300 feet; its extended eastern altar space (fore choir); its elaborate system of crypts giving access to the relics of the patron saint without encroaching upon the space required by the monks; its disengaged crossing; its nineteen altars; its western counter apse; its two semicircular atria; its detached towers; and its square schematism. II.3.2 LENGTH OF THE CHURCH The Church of the Plan of St. Gall is chronologically not the first monastic church of this order of magnitude but probably the third or fourth. The earliest was the Abbey Church of Fulda, in the form which it obtained under Abbot Ratger between 802-817 (fig. 138). It had a clear inner length of 98.00 meters (321 modern English feet).1 1 For the Abbey Church of Fulda, see von Bezold, 1936, 13, fig. 4; Beumann and Grossman, 1949, 17-56; and Groszmann, 1962, 344-70. The second was probably, although not demonstrably so, the monastery church of St. Peter's and St. Mary's in Cologne (fig. 139), founded by Bishop Hildebold (d. 819), which measured 91.20 meters internally from apse to apse (300 Carolingian feet, calculated at 1 foot = 30.04cm.)2 2 The most recent discussion of the excavation of the Carolingian Church of Cologne is Weyres, 1966, 384-423. For the earlier treatment of this subject, see Doppelfeld, 1948, 1-12; 1948, 159-83; 1953, 137-40; 1954, 69-100; 1954, 46ff; 1958, 322-28; and Achter, 1964, 958-91. For a brief description of the church, see above, pp. 27ff. The third was the original church of the Plan of St. Gall, as rendered in figure 140 (prototype plan made in 817; copy for Abbot Gozbert between 820 and 830). The fourth, if Groszmann's analysis of this building is correct, was the Abbey Church of Hersfeld, built between 831 and 850. Together with its west-work, it measured 102.85 meters (339 modern English feet).3 3 For Hersfeld see Groszmann, 1955, 9ff and Feldkeller, 1964, 1-19. Abbot Ratger's church at Fulda (fig. 138) was a T-shaped basilica with a continuous transept. The particulars of its design leave no doubt that it was modeled after the Church of Old St. Peter's in Rome (fig. 141). Like that church, its clerestory walls were supported by two rows of columns which were surmounted not by arches, but by a straight entablature; also like St. Peter's, the ends of the transept arms were separated from the principal body of the transept hall. The ideological reasons for this emulation of the design and size of the great Early Christian proto-basilica of Rome during the reign of Emperor Charlemagne have been brilliantly analyzed by Richard Krautheimer.4 4 Krautheimer, 1942, 1-38. The design was an outgrowth of the general process of Romanization of the Frankish Church and the Frankish kingdom that started with the anointment of Pepin and his sons by Pope Stephen II in 753 and culminated in the coronation of Charlemagne as emperor on Christmas Eve of the year 800. 142. EPHESOS. FIRST CHURCH OF ST. JOHN (CA. 450) [after Keil, 1932, fig. 47] Built over the tomb of John, Bishop of Ephesos (traditionally identified as John the Apostle), this is the largest Early Christian church of Latin cross plan. It is not known whether the church was so planned, or if it acquired its form by aggregation of four basilicas built separately in successive stages against the martyrion of St. John. 143. BETHLEHEM. CHURCH OF THE NATIVITY (END, 5TH CENT.) [after REALLEXIKON ZUR BYZANTINISCHEN KUNST, I, 1966, cols. 603-604, fig. 2] The most accomplished Early Christian Latin cross church, long dated to the reign of Justinian, is perplexing for its numerous incipient medievalisms: a nave as wide as the transept and twice the width of each aisle, and, remarkably, a fore choir repeating the dimensions of the crossing unit—features wholly uncharacteristic for the mainstream of Early Christian architecture. As in Ephesos the eastward extension of the nave may have resulted from special circumstances, i.e., the desire to encompass in the new church the remains of an earlier sanctuary. 145. THASOS, MACEDONIA CRUCIFORM CHURCH, 6TH CENT. PLAN [redrawn after Orlandos, I, 1952, 193, fig. 157, 1] The intersection of nave and transept masses lends to these cruciform Early Christian churches an almost medieval appearance. But they are not designed to any modular concept (cf. p. 208ff). 144. THASOS, MACEDONIA CRUCIFORM CHURCH, 6TH CENT. PLAN [redrawn after Orlandos, 1, 1952, 189, fig. 155] The intersecting nave and transept established before the apse a square for both altar and benches. The latter, continuing in the apse to form a synthronon, became standard layout in monastic churches (cf. above p. 141 and fig. 94). The ties of the Abbey of Fulda with Rome had been especially strong. The missionary work of its founder, St. Boniface (680-754), was closely linked to the papal see. His successor, Abbot Sturmi (744-769), was an ardent student of the customs of Monte Cassino on which the customs of Fulda were based, and Fulda was the first German abbey to be placed under the direct jurisdiction of the Roman see.5 5 See Groszmann, 1962, 356; and on the mission of St. Boniface in a more general sense, see Schieffer, 1954 and Groszmann, 1956, 232-53. There is no doubt that the return to the design of the great western Roman basilicas of Constantine the Great and of Pope Sylvester was an expression of the renovation by Charlemagne of the universal Christian empire inaugurated by Constantine the Great. One might justly conclude that the propensity for colossal dimensions, embodied in the abbey Churches of Fulda, Cologne, and the Church of the Plan of St. Gall, was an integral part of this ideology; but to explain the dimensional boldness of these churches exclusively in such symbolic terms would be a gross historical simplification. There are other more functional and more specifically monastic reasons for the appearance in transalpine Europe of churches of unprecedented dimensions. One of them was the need to extend the altar space in order to accommodate, in addition to the officiating clergy, an entire community of monks celebrating the divine services jointly in an elaborate ritual involving chant and counter chant. Another reason was the transfer of baptismal rites from a separate subsidiary building to the basilica; in the Church of the Plan this function claims one third of the entire nave. A third reason was that the rapidly increasing veneration of saints resulted in a multiplication of altars, each requiring additional space. There also developed the desire to accommodate in a single oratory a variety of cults that in earlier monastic churches has been distributed over an entire family of buildings.6 6 On this point specifically see Lehmann, 1952/53, 131-44 and 1953, 261-62. But the dimensional enlargement of the church that these demands generated raised serious economic problems. Whatever the historical and functional incentives may have been for building churches of a magnitude of 300 feet and more, there still remained the question of whether a community of an average of 100 to 200 monks could afford to build and maintain such structures. Ratger, the Abbot of Fulda, thought so. But his monks, who paid for his ambition with their toil and sweat, were disturbed by his building program to the point of rebellion. In a formal petition presented to Charlemagne in 812, they pleaded that the construction of these "oversized and superfluous buildings" (aedificia immensa atque superflua) be brought to a halt or reduced to a normal pace, because it taxed the brothers beyond endurance, left no time for the lectio divina, and threatened to exhaust the monastery's economic resources.7 7 For an excellent recent analysis of these events see Semmler, 1958, 268-98. The best and most recent edition of the Supplex Libellus is that of Semmler in Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 319-27. The petitioners returned, defeated, to the 146. SALONA, DALMATIA CRUCIFORM CHURCH, 6TH CENT. EGGER'S RECONSTRUCTION [redrawn after Orlandos, I, 1952, fig. 4] This westernmost of cruciform churches of the Thasos type (figs. 144 and 145) is so similar in design to the latter, it could be said that "an attempted reconstruction of either church is applicable to the other" (Hodinott, 1963, 181). Of both, only foundations remain. 147. KORNELISMÜNSTER, Inden, Nordrhein-Westfalen ABBEY CHURCH OF THE SAVIOUR. PLAN [after Hugot, 1965, 411] Founded by Louis the Pious for Benedict of Aniane as a model monastery for thirty monks, according to good contemporary sources Kornelismünster was intended to be Louis's burial place. It was consecrated in 817, a few days before the second synod opened at Aachen. For a full bibliographical account see Vorromanische Kirchenbauten, 1966-71, 160ff. monastery: Charlemagne denied their petition. Hildebold, then arch-chaplain and one of the emperor's closest advisors, may have had a voice in the negative decision. By 817, however, the climate had changed. Louis the Pious was now emperor; sometime between 816 and 817 he received the same delegation with the same petition, which this time was received favorably. As a direct result of the petition, Ratger was deposed in favor of Eigil, leader of the dissenting monks of Fulda. When Eigil was installed as the new abbot in 817, he was admonished by Louis "to stop this superfluous work of erecting structures of inordinate size and to reduce the monastery's building program to normal proportions."8 8 A passage in the Vita Eigilis, to which Semmler, 1958, 289-90 and 297-98, has drawn attention: "Immensa vero aedificia, pater, et opera non necessaria, quibus familiae foris et intus fratrum congregatio fatigatur, exhinc penitus ad mensuram dimitte." (Vita Eigilis, chap. 10; ed. Waitz, Mon. Germ. Hist., Script., XV:1, 1887, 228). It appears that Louis made use of the words the monks themselves had spoken, the first time before Charlemagne and the second time before him. Overindulgence in costly building activities was not the only reason for Ratger's fall, and by itself might not have brought it about. He was also accused of violations of sanctioned monastic customs,9 9 Ratger was also accused of shortening the divine office, cancelling traditional religious feasts, shortening the time of probation for the novices or accepting novices for unsavory economic reasons, as well as violating the principle of corporate monastic ownership. See Semmler, op. cit., 294. but the incident shows that constructing a church 300 feet long was by no means an easy matter for a monastic polity and could have disturbing consequences not only for its economic stability but also for its spiritual health. The rebellion of the monks of Fulda against the building activities of their abbot is the strongest historical evidence to be offered in support of Boeckelmann's theory that the explanatory title which stipulates a length of 200 feet for the Church of the Plan is the expression of a programmatic retrenchment.10 10 Cf. above, pp. 81ff. This measure might have been directly related to the struggles of Fulda. II.3.3 EXTENDED EASTERN ALTAR SPACE (FORE CHOIR) When the fore choir was introduced between the transept and the eastern apse of the church, the T-shaped plan of the Early Christian basilica was transformed into a Latin-cross plan (crux capitata). The origin and dissemination of this feature forms one of the most fascinating chapters in the history of medieval architecture.11 11 Brilliantly reviewed by Forsyth, 1953, 149. Contrary to Georg Dehio's belief two generations ago, the Latin-cross plan is not a Carolingian invention. It came into use early in the fifth century12 12 Krautheimer, 1941, 414-17. as a fusion of the longitudinal basilica and the cruciform central plan of buildings traditionally associated with Christian martyria.13 13 On this fusion, see Forsyth, 1953, 146, and the literature cited there. The cruciform plan is well established in such buildings as the first church of St. John in Ephesus, built in the fourth to fifth century (fig. 142);14 14 On the first church of St. John in Ephesus, see Keil, 1932, cols. 67-69. the Nativity Church in Bethlehem, built by Justinian in the sixth century (fig. 143);15 15 Now ascribed to the second half of the fifth century. See Restle, in Reallexikon zur Byzantinische Kunst, I, 1966, cols. 599-612. the cruciform basilicas of Thasos in Macedonia (figs. 144 and 145)16 16 For Thasos, see Hoddinott, 1963, 180, fig. 89. and of Salona in Dalmatia (fig. 146).17 17 For Salona, see Hoddinott, 1963, 180; Orlandos I, 1952, 193. In Merovingian France the form appears as early as 577, when the Greek-cross plan church of Ste.-Croix-et-St.Vincent at Paris (completed by King Childebert in 558) CRUCIFORM NON-AISLED CHURCHES WITH DISENGAGED CROSSING 148.A TOMARZA, CAPPADOCIA. PLAN, 5TH-6TH CENT. 148.B HALVADERE, CAPPADOCIA. PLAN, 5TH-6TH CENT. 148.C PFALZEL, NEAR TRIER. PLAN, ABBEY CHURCH OF ADALA (BEFORE 715) The impetus to development of the Carolingian modular Latin cross plan by small cruciform churches such as Tomarza and Halvadere and their western derivatives or counterparts, such as Pfalzel, should not be overvalued. Yet, the undeniable ubiquity of these small buildings spread throughout the whole Christian world the concept of an arch-framed —and generally tower-surmounted—crossing created by the intersection at 90° of two volumes of space, each identical in height and width. Like that of the quincunx church, this building type had distinct modular implications, another feature making it attractive to the northern mind. 148.X. Sivri Hissar stands somewhat aside from the other Cappadocian churches. An aisle added to the northern flank of the nave perhaps served as a sepulchral chapel for St. Gregory of Nyssa (331-ca. 396) who owned large estates in this part of the world. was transformed into a Latin cross by the addition of aisles.18 18 See Graf, 1878, 68ff; and Forsyth, 1953, 149, note 266. The new form thus created was subsequently copied in several other Neustrian churches, most notably, perhaps, in the church of Corbie.19 19 If Graf and Effman are correct; see Graf, loc. cit., Effman, 1912, 146, and 1929, 113. Dehio was of the opinion that the Latin-cross plan owed its rise to practical considerations, namely the need for more choir space for the worshiping monks. Graf stressed the commemorative, funerary significance of the centralized cruciform development of the eastern end of the church. In a recent review of this controversy George H. Forsyth has pointed out that these two theories need not preclude each other and that a vast body of new material, made available since the time Dehio and Graf discussed these problems, tends in fact to corroborate both opinions.20 20 The question was argued between Dehio and Graf in a controversy that extended over a decade, starting with Graf's Opus francigenum in 1878, continued in Repertorium für Kunstwissenschaft, 1892, 1-18; 94-109, 306-31 and 445-71 (Graf); ibid., 1893, 217-29 (Dehio); 128-38 (Graf). Dehio also expressed himself on this issue in Dehio and von Bezold, I, 1892, 157-66. Effman, in his important study of the abbey church of St. Riquier (1912, 133-51) sided with Graf against Dehio. Forsyth reviewed the controversy in the incisive and penetrating footnote of his book on the Church of St. Martin at Angers, quoted above in note 18. In the historical evaluation of this important architectural motif, a sharp distinction must be made between its origin and occasional appearance in Early Christian times and its prevalence everywhere during the Carolingian period. Practical considerations must have played a decisive role in its adoption at the time of Charlemagne. The cult of relics, which had introduced into the church a multiplicity of altars, made it impossible for the service of the high altar to expand into the nave or the aisles of the church. Few monasteries had fewer than 100 monks, and some had as many as 300 or 400. Without the insertion of a fore choir 149.B 149.A GERASA (JERASH), Palestine CHURCH OF PROPHETS, APOSTLES &amp; MARTYRS [after Kraeling, 1938, pl. XLI and XLII] 150. MOUSMIEH, SYRIA PRAETORIUM (or TEMPLE?) ca. 180 [after DeVoguë, I, 1865, 46, fig. 11.] between transept and apse, there would have been insufficient space for the monks participating in the service. At the same time it cannot be denied that because of its association with the relics of the Patron Saint of the church, the high altar had acquired an intrinsically funerary significance—another historical incentive for the absorption in the basilican scheme of the cruciform arrangement of the centralized paleochristian martyria. Lastly, it is also quite clear that the Carolingian architects who struggled with the development of the Latin-cross plan could hardly have been blind to the exciting aesthetic implications of a fusion between the basilican and the central plan. Churches with extended altar space preceding the Plan of St. Gall, as I have already pointed out in my discussion of Reinhardt's reconstruction of the Church of the Plan,21 21 See above, pp. 180ff. of St. Gall are the Saviour's Church of Neustadt-on-the-Main, shortly after 768/69 (fig. 133); the abbey church of St. Riquier (Centula), between 790-99 (fig. 135); the Carolingian Cathedral of Cologne, between 800 and 819 (fig. 139); and the abbey church of St. Mary at Reichenau-Mittelzell (fig. 134), built by Abbot Haito between 806 and 816. Even the church of the model monastery of Inden, built by Emperor Louis the Pious between 815 and 816 for Benedict of Aniane and his chosen community of only thirty monks, had a rectangular space inserted between transept and apse (fig. 147).22 22 Hugot, 1965, 411. The innovative aesthetic significance of this motif lies not so much in the addition of the space as such, but in the modular alliance into which it enters with the crossing square, the transept arms, and by extension, although at a slower rate of development, with the square division of the nave of the church. II.3.4 DISENGAGED CROSSING The crossing of the Church of the Plan is completely separated at floor level from the contiguous spaces by rails and choir screens (fig. 99); and if it was meant to be framed by boundary arches at the top, as I believe it was (figs. 107-110),23 23 See above, pp. 190ff. the crossing would be the only place where a principal constituent part of the church was segregated from the rest of the latter's space by dividing arches reaching up to roof level. No other single architectural feature had such deep and far-reaching reverberations for the future. Like the fore choir, the disengaged crossing did not originate during the Middle Ages. Crossings framed by boundary arches, which separated the intersected area from the nave and the transept, occur in certain cruciform, non-basilican churches of Cappadocia, such as Tomarza, Halvadere (fig. 148.A-B) and Sivri Hissar, as early as the fifth and sixth centuries, as Samuel Guyer has pointed out.24 24 Guyer, 1950, 50ff; Ramsay and Bell, 1909, 209ff. That the type was known in Western Europe is attested by the Abbey Church of Adala in Pfalzel near Trier, before 715 (fig. 148.C).25 25 See Nagel, 1934, 88-89. There is a faint possibility that some VAGHARSHAPAT (ECHMIADZIN), Armenia 151.A 151.B CHURCH OF ST. GAYANÉ [after Arutiunan and Safrian, 1951, fig. 20] Erected by the Catholicos Ezra between 630 and 646. BANDE, Orense, south Galicia, Spain 151.Xa 151.Xd 151.Xb CHURCH OF SANTA COMBA (7th Cent.) A jewel of Visigothic architecture, small, built in cyclopic masonry, this church attests the early adoption of the Early Christian quincunx church by the Germanic conquerors of Spain, and their fascination with cellular space division and the concept of an arch-framed and tower-surmounted crossing that was to become a key feature of Carolingian architecture. 151.Xc rudimentary forms of the disengaged crossing (but not, so far as I can judge, a fully developed archetype) appear in certain Early Christian basilicas with tripartite transepts: in Greece, such as Basilicas A and B in Nikopolis, and the basilicas of Epidaurus, and Lokris. But it is well to reserve final judgment until such time as Guyer's schematic reconstruction of churches of this type with intersecting naves and transepts surmounted by crossing towers is corroborated by more tangible archaeological evidence than is offered in his own study.26 26 Ibid., 86ff. There is no compelling evidence, as far as I can judge, that the transept arms in the six or seven basilicas discussed by Guyer actually reached up to the height of the nave, and that the center bay was separated from the transept arms by arches as high as that which separated this area from the nave. Krautheimer (1941, 353-29) in his cautious analysis of this same group of churches expressed the opinion that the tripartite organization of the transept of these churches was developmentally obtained not by an internal subdivision of an originally continuous transept of equal height with the nave, but rather by the gradual interconnection of originally segregated spaces of different height through the gradual opening up of walls of one- or two-storied pastophoria, erected at the head of the aisles, toward the adjacent altar area of the nave. If Kraeling's and Egger's reconstructions of them are correct, the two finest examples of Early Christian churches with fully developed crossings are the churches of the Holy Apostles and Martyrs of Gerasa, 464-465 (fig. 149), and the cruciform church at Salona.27 27 For Gerasa, see Crowfoot, 1941, 130 and plan XLI; and Kraeling, 1938, pl. XLI and XLII; for Salona, see Orlandos, I, 1952, 193. Also related to this group is the sixth century church of Antalya (Adalia) on the south coast of Asia Minor; Krautheimer, 1965, 209, fig. 85. However, no less important for the development of the arch-framed crossing in medieval architecture may have been such Armenian central plan churches as St. Gayané at Vagharshapat (Echmiadzin), 630 (fig. 151) as well as a small but no longer tracable group of near-eastern quincunx churches, which one must postulate historically to have formed the connecting link between such semisacral cross-in-square buildings as the praetorium (or temple) in the Roman camp of Mousmieh, Syria, ca. A.D. 180 (fig. 150), an audience hall of like design outside of the walls of Rusafa, Syria, dating from about 560, the minute, yet arrestingly beautiful seventh-century church of Santa Comba de Bande, Spain (fig. 151.X) and the sophisticated Germigny-des-Prés built by Theodulf of Orleans, councillor and missus dominicus of Charlemagne, between 806-810 at his summer residence on the Loire, near the abbey of St. Benoit-sur-Loire (fig. 152). Yet the true Early Christian prototype for the Carolingian disengaged crossing may be found closer to home in the north basilica of Trier, which Gratian, having chosen 151.Y TRIER, GERMANY 154.A* NORTH BASILICA [isometric reconstruction, redrawn from Krautheimer, 1965, 61, fig. 23] In the conceptual interaction of quincunx and basilica a medieval style of architecture emerges. The north basilica lacks only the ordering principle of modularity for its full development. Product of two building campaigns (basilica, shortly after 325; quincunx, 380) the result in Trier is a composition of bold and unusual grouping of masses that must have strongly influenced development of the Carolingian Latin cross church with disengaged and tower-surmounted crossing. GERMIGNY-DES-PRÉS 152.A 152.B 152.C CHURCH OF THEODULF OF ORLEANS, 806-810 [plans after Viellard and Troiekouroff, 1965, 356, fig. 111] Small, yet of magnificently controlled proportions, the spaces of Germigny-des-Prés step in bold progression to the slender, steeply rising nave and transept, from whose intersection rises a tower of great elan. This church attests that the quincunx, even in the 9th century, had life enough to capture the imagination of a great Carolingian churchman. Theodulf was a Visigoth and his acquaintance with such churches as Santa Comba de Bande (fig. 151.X) may have influenced his choice. to reside in Trier, rebuilt in 380. In its final Early Christian form (fig. 151.Y) this building terminated in the east in what can only be called a grandiose variant of a quincunx church, consisting of a large, central, tower-surmounted bay surrounded by eight smaller two-storied spaces: four in the cross, four in the corners, the latter appearing externally, like towers. Much masonry of this structure survives today, incorporated in the fabric of the Romanesque church which superseded it in the eleventh century. But in Charlemagne's time it still stood there in its original form for all his subjects to see, located about seventy-five miles as the crow flies from the emperor's residence at Aachen.28 28 For Santa Comba de Bande see Schlunk, 1947, 285-89, and idem, "Die Kirche von S. Giâo bei Nazaré (Portugal)," Madrider Mitteilungen XII, 1971, 205-240. For St. Gayané at Vagharshapat see Arutiunian and Safrian, 1951, 41ff. The difficult and still mysterious problem of the transmission of the quincunx plan from its early near-eastern sources to Germigny-des-Prés is discussed by Krautheimer, 1965, 345ff. For Germigny-des-Prés, see Hubert, 1938, 76; Khatchatrian, 1954, 161-69; and Zodiaque, Cahier de l'Atelier du Coeur-Meurtry, Clarté-de-Saint Benoit, n.d., 40 and 42, from where figs. 61a and b are taken. Also to be taken into consideration in this context, in view of Theodulph's Spanish background, is the small but impressive church of San Pedro de Nave, Spain, which if it really dates before 711, as some maintain, would be one of the earliest western churches in which the disengaged crossing and the extended eastern altar space are associated with a distinctly basilican plan. (For San Pedro de Nave, see Schlunk, 1947, 288-99.) For the Early Christian basilica at Trier, see Krautheimer, 1965, 60-62, and Neue Ausgrabungen in Deutschland, 1958, 368-79, where all previous literature is quoted. * The insert plan, 154-A, p. 194, invites comparisons: The crypt of Santa Maria in Cosmedin could be contained under Bernini's baldacchino. Compare, too, 152.A with 154.A. As one surveys all of this material, it must be stressed again that sharp distinction must be made between the occasional appearance of these motifs in the relatively isolated topographical contexts of Armenia and Spain and their formal and systematic combination with the basilican scheme as attested by the sequence discussed in the preceding chapter: St. Denis, 750-755; Neustadt-on-the-Main, after 768/69 (figs. 116 and 133); Reichenau-Mittelzell, 806-816 (fig. 134); Cologne, 800-819 (fig. 139); in some respects even the church of St. Benedict of Aniane at Inden, 815-816 (fig. 147); and certainly, most decidedly and programmatically, the Church of the Plan of St. Gall, prototype plan: 816-817; copy: ca. 820 (figs. 55 and 99). The tripartite Early Christian transept may have helped bring about this fusion, but it had in itself none of the exciting aesthetic and constructional implications which made the disengaged crossing so important for the future. Again it is difficult, if not impossible, to say precisely what triggered the development of this particular solution. There can be no doubt that the increase in the number of altars affected the form of the crossing as much as it affected the fore choir. Nor should it be overlooked that the division of the congregation into choirs singing in antiphonal response called for a more distinct architectural recognition of the two constituent parts of this ritual. The Plan of St. Gall ROME. S. MARIA IN COSMEDIN. CRYPT PLAN 153.A 153.B [after Krautheimer, II, 1962, 299, fig. 235] A noncharacteristic antecedent of the medieval hall crypt, this one owes its unusual shape to its service as a repository for an entire collection of relics (Krautheimer, 1964, 171-75). 154.B* ROME. OLD ST. PETER'S. CRYPT PLAN [after Kirschbaum, 1959, 58, fig. 9] In the Constantinian basilica the funerary monument marking the place of Peter's execution stood in the chord of the apse, his altar in the transept before it. Gregory raised the presbytery floor and beneath it made Peter's monument accessible to pilgrims by a circular corridor crypt (the first of its kind), thus reserving the altar space for exclusive use of clergy. PLAN OF ST. GALL. FORE CHOIR AND ITS SYSTEM OF CRYPTS 155.A 155.B For our interpretation of how this delineation of the Presbytery and the Crypt of the Church of the Plan would have to be translated into a modern architectural drawing, with walls shown in their full thickness we are referring to fig. 123, p. 177. suggests that the fore choir and the apse became the station for the majority of the monks, while the antiphonal singing of the psalms by voices trained specifically for that purpose took place in the crossing. There was, no doubt, a liturgical need for spatial differentiation; the establishment of a "house for the counter song" (this is how I think we must interpret the term chorus psallentium) in the crossing of the Plan served the purpose of preventing the altar space from being crowded. Yet it would be foolish to presume that this need alone brought about the creation of a new architectural form. In constructional terms the disengaged crossing established in the most crucial area of the church a system of bracing arches which could serve as a sound architectural base for a superincumbent tower, and thus demonstrated that arches rising from relatively slender piers could carry substantial loads at impressive heights without weight-bearing walls beneath them. This idea, once conceived, prepared the way for the perforation of the nave walls and their conversion from weight-bearing sheets of masonry into a skeletal frame of structural members. Moreover, in separating the crossing from the rest of the church by framing arches, a space came into being which could be used as a unit of measurement for the modular articulation of the remaining spaces of the church. In the Church of the Plan of St. Gall this articulation is already far advanced. II.3.5 CRYPTS The combination of a circumambient corridor crypt with a vaulted inner hall crypt, as has been claimed in the preceding chapter, is a Carolingian innovation that owes its origin to the need for an area of devotional seclusion enabling the monks to pray in front of the tomb of their patron saint without intermingling with the secular visitors to the tomb.29 29 See above, pp. 144-45ff. Hall crypts and corridor crypts as separate entities are well known around 800, both north and south of the Alps. The former is relatively rare; the latter, very common. The most ancient Christian hall crypt known at this date is the small three-aisled crypt of the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin in Rome (fig. 153), built under Pope Adrian I (772-795).30 30 For Santa Maria in Cosmedin see Krautheimer, II:3, 1962, 298 ff. Its columns carry a straight entablature, surmounted by a flat ceiling made of large slabs of stone. The earliest known example of an annular corridor crypt, to the best of my knowledge, is the semicircular passage with which Pope Gregory the Great encircled the shrine of St. Peter's when he raised the platform of the Presbytery above the original pavement of the church sometime between 594 and 604 (fig. 154).31 31 For the crypt of St. Peter's see Toynbee and Ward-Perkins, 1956, 136ff. Corridor crypts were ideally suited to relieve conditions of crowding imposed by the increasing number of pilgrims and other visitors to the shrines of saints. They permitted the devout to come into close bodily contact with the tomb of the saint, while affording to it a central and well-protected position. The layout assured an easily controllable peripheral flow of movement for laymen, leaving the central area free to be utilized (as such areas subsequently were) for more restricted rites. The corridor crypt became an integral feature of Christian architecture on both sides of the Alps from the seventh century onward, as popular veneration of relics became widespread. Typical examples of corridor crypts in Rome are those of the churches of San Crisogono (built under Gregory III, 731-741); San Marco (built under Adrian I, 772-795); and San Stefano degli Abissini (built under Leo III, 795816).32 32 For the chronology of the semi-annular crypts of Rome, see Apollonj Ghetti, 1947, 271ff; for the crypts of Ravenna, see Mazzotti, 1955, 44-45. North of the Alps they are found in the Abbey Church of St. Emmeran at Regensburg (as early as ca. 740); in St. Lucius at Chur (mid-eighth century); in the Abbey Church of St.-Denis (consecrated in 775); in St.-Maurice of Agaune (end of the eighth century); in the Abbey Church of Werden (ca. 830); in the Abbey Church of Vreden (consecrated in 839) and the Carolingian cathedral of Hildesheim (consecrated in 872).33 33 For St. Emmeran at Regensburg, see Reallexikon zur Deutschen Kunstgeschichte, I, 1937, col. 428, fig. 24; for St. Lucius in Chur, Gantner, I, 1936, 47, fig. 3; for St.-Denis, Crosby, 1953, 11ff, and Formigé, 1960, 42, fig. 31 and 168, fig. 151; for St.-Maurice of Agaune, Blondel, 1957, 285, fig. 1; for Werden, Vreden and Hildesheim see Clausen, 1957, 120, 137 and 122, as well as Thümmler, 1960, cols. 98-100. In the ninth century north of the Alps, the annular corridor crypt was replaced with increasing frequency by a crank-shaped crypt, consisting of two straight longitudinal arms connected in the east by a straight transverse arm. The new form was unquestionably conditioned by the introduction of the fore choir, which made the circumambient crypt independent of the semicircular shape of the apse, thus opening up new possibilities in crypt design. The earliest occurrence of the crank-shaped corridor crypt is the Plan of St. Gall (fig. 155) and here, also for the first time, this type of crypt is found in combination with a central hall crypt. The designer of the Plan may very well have been the inventor of this scheme. Other examples soon followed: St. Philibert of Grandlieu, 847-853 (fig. 156);34 34 For St. Philibert de Grandlieu see de Lasteyrie, 1911, 45ff; Hubert, 1938, 59, fig. 44 and 1952, Nr. 82 (review of more recent literature).

The addition in 847-859 of a circumambient corridor crypt may well owe to influence of the Plan. The smaller plan shown at scale 1:600 is included to facilitate comparison with numerous other plans shown in Volumes I and II where the optimum scale for page size and illustration purpose is 1:600 CHURCH OF ST.-GERMAIN 157.A 157.B Auxerre, Yonne, France REDRAWN AFTER LAMBERT, 1960, 7, fig. 6 If the inner hall crypt with the coffin of St. Germain was accessible from the nave, as Hubert assumes (1970, 299, fig. 345), this crypt would have been, in essence, identical with that of the Plan. FLAVIGNY-SUR-OZERAIN, Côte d'Or, France 158.B 158.A CHURCH OF ST. PIERRE. CRYPT [after Lambert-Jouven, 1960, 27, fig. 25] The crypt, on level with the nave, was built in two stages. In final form it consisted of an inner aisled hall and apse, which enshrined the bodies of SS Prix and Reine. A crank-shaped corridor primarily used by pilgrims surrounded this hall and gave east access through a rectangular fore room to a hexagon built in honor of SS Peter and Paul. on January 6, 859 (fig. 157);35 35 For St. Germain d'Auxerre see Louis, 1952, 46ff. the Carolingian cathedral of Hildesheim, built by Bishop Altfrid between 851 and 87236 36 For Hildesheim see Claussen, 1957, 121-25, and Vorromanische Kirchenbauten, I, 1966, 116-117. and St. Pierre in Flavigny, 864-87837 37 For St. Pierre de Flavigny see Lambert-Jouven, 1960, 1-28 and the earlier literature there cited. (fig. 158). None of these crypts are identical in design, yet all of them have in common the existence, side by side, of a circumambient corridor crypt (crank-shaped or rounded) and a highly developed system of inner spaces differing in form and size from the small confessional chambers of the preceding centuries. In St. Philibert of Grandlieu (fig. 156) the inner crypt consisted of a barrel-vaulted transverse shaft—located at the base of the apse—that was intersected by three shorter longitudinal arms. East of this system there was a larger cross-shaped space accessible through an opening in the apex of the apse. At St. Germain of Auxerre (fig. 157) the hall crypt had the shape of a small basilica with longitudinal barrel vaults rising from straight entablatures supported by piers and columns. This space was entered from the east by a straight longitudinal arm and terminated toward the west in a polygonal apse which sheltered the tomb of St. Germain. The latter, if Louis' interpretation of the description of this crypt by Heiric is correct, was visible from the upper church by a fenestella.38 38 Louis bases his reconstruction of a fenestella on Heiric's De Miraculis Sancti Germani, ed. Duru, Bibliothèque historique de l'Yonne, 13, II (Paris, 1863). The massif of masonry by which this confessio is enclosed is 33 feet (10.00 m.) wide and 50 feet (15.30 m.) long, and thus covers a surface area of 1,650 feet. The clear inner space of the confessio totaled roughly 670 square feet.39 39 The open space of this confessio was considerably reduced in 863 when the council of monks of St. Germain d'Auxerre decided to transfer into the aisles of the crypt the bodies of the martyrs and bishops— heretofore in the upper church—so as to form a cortege of honor around St. Germain (see Lambert-Jouven, 1960, 40). This is only slightly less than the area of 787 square feet, assigned in our reconstruction to the confessio of the Plan of St. Gall. But the crypt of St. Germain is more elaborate in other respects: by the wealth of chapels attached to its outer corridor shafts, as well as by the sophisticated rotunda of St. Maximin at the extreme eastern end of the system joined to the corridor crypt by an aisled longitudinal arm two bays deep. The inner crypt of Flavigny (fig. 158) was of the same order of magnitude, perhaps larger, than that of St. Germain of Auxerre. The excavation conducted by Georges Jouven in 1960 revealed without any shadow of doubt that the confessio extended westward from the apse for the full length of the presbytery, with a clear inner width of 20 feet (6.00 m.) and an axial inner length of 34½ feet (10.5 m.).40 40 See the supplementary note on pages 27-28 of Lambert-Jouven, 1960 (where Jouven reviews the results of his excavation of April, 1960) and the plan of the crypt as clarified in the light of this excavation (ibid., p. 27, fig. 25). These call for modification of Jouven's earlier plans (ibid., figs. 14 and 17). Its vaults, which carried the floor of the entire presbytery, were supported by two rows of free-standing columns with corresponding pilasters in the long walls. Because of the unco-operative obstinacy of a private property owner only the southern half of the crypt could so far be excavated for its full length; but there is no reason whatsoever—as Jouven points out convincingly—that conditions in the unexcavated northern part of the crypt were not identical.41 41 I had an opportunity to study the remains of the Carolingian crypt of Flavigny at leisure, in the summer of 1960, and in the light of this experience cannot see how Jouven's excavation could be interpreted in any other manner. There is no doubt in my mind that the designer of the church of the Plan of St. Gall furnished the prototype for this combination of an inner hall crypt with a circumambient corridor crypt. An important link in the dissemination of this scheme may have been the crypt of the church of St. Remi in Reims, in which archbishop Hincmar, 159. LEPCIS MAGNA, Tripolitania BASILICA, SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS (146-211) [after Ward Perkins, 1965, 23, fig. 8] One of the finest of the large-aisled Roman market halls with apses at both ends—perhaps the most outstanding Severan period architectural monument. It borders on the south on a great colonnaded court. The layout is reminiscent of the Forum of Trajan, Rome (fig. 239). For a more modest version built in the transalpine provinces of Rome, see fig. 202. The influence this hall type may have exerted upon the Carolingian basilica with apse and counterapse, as well as on the concept of the medieval cloister, may be greatly underestimated. in 852, deposited the relics of St. Remi. Archaeologically this crypt is terra incognita, but the description "larger and more beautifully built" (maiori et pulchriori opere factum) in the Vita sancti Remigii42 42 Vita Remigii episcopi Remensis auctore Hincmaro, chap. 29, ed. Bruno Krusch, Mon. Germ. Hist., Scrip. rer. merov., III, Hannover, 1896 325-326. suggests, as Hilde Claussen has argued persuasively,43 43 Claussen, 1957, 128-29. a more elaborate type of Carolingian crypt. II.3.6 COUNTER APSE The counter apse is not a Carolingian invention. Basilicas with apses at either end of the nave were in use in Early Christian times,44 44 An excellent recent summary of the history of the counter apse will be found in Thümmler, 1960, col. 93. Of earlier literature to be consulted on this problem, see Dehio and von Bezold, I, 1892, 167ff; Effmann, 1912, 153ff; Braun, I 1924, 388ff; Arens, 1938, 61, n. 89; Doppelfeld, 1954, 50ff; Schmidt, 1956, 403ff. On Early Christian basilicas with apse and counter apse in Tunisia, see Lapeyre, 1940, 180-81; in Tripolitania see Romanelli, 1940, 246; in Spain see Durliat, 1966, 42 fig. 9, and Hubert, 1966, 42 fig. 9. Brief summaries on North African churches of the fifth and sixth centuries with apse and counter apse will be found in Ward Perkins, 1965, 62-63 (Lepcis Magna I, ibid., 22-34; Sabratha I, ibid. 7-19) and N. Duval, 1965, 472-78 (Sbeitla and Haïdra). Krautheimer, 1962, 22-23, in a discussion of Orléansville, disclaims the possibility of any influence of these North African churches on the medieval development: "But counter apses remain rare and contrary to older opinions, are not the immediate sources for those of medieval churches in Europe." On the basilica of Silchester, see J. G. Joyce, 1881, 344-65 and below, p. 256. On the basilica of Augst, see Reinle, 1965, 34 and below, p. 200. but appear to have been confined almost exclusively to the North African provinces of Rome, where 160. ST.-MAURICE-D'AGAUNE, Valais, Switzerland [after Blondel, 1948, 29, fig. 5] The plan renders the terminal form (end, 8th cent.) of a succession of basilicas erected in honor of St. Maurice and his companions in a monastery founded late in the 4th century under the crag where they suffered martyrdom. Three preceeding churches, built on the same site, were of smaller dimensions; each had only one apse. at least eleven, perhaps twelve, churches of this kind are known: two in Tripolitania (Lepcis Magna and Sabratha); three in Algeria (Matifou, Orléansville, and Tipasa); and six, perhaps seven, in Tunisia (Sbeitla, Haïdra, Henchir Chigarnia, Iunca, Thelepte, and less well-excavated Mididi and Henchir Goraat ez-Zid). The apse and counter apse arrangement of these churches owes its existence to a variety of reasons. At Lepcis Magna (fig. 159) and Sabratha it is clearly the heritage of a pre-existing judiciary basilica put to Christian use. Elsewhere, as at Orléansville, Matifou, Tipasa, Sbeitla and Haïdra, a square or semicircular counter apse was added to an earlier single apsed church to serve as a sepulchral martyrion for a saint, whose growing importance called for a second place of veneration within the church. In still other places, the counter apse owed its existence to the reorientation of an originally occidented church, when the eastward location of the altar space became mandatory in early Byzantine times. One cause does not exclude the other and in some churches the reorientation of the building coincided with the transformation of the original apse into a funerary chapel, while the new counter apse and the area immediately in front of it became the site for the new high altar (as in the church of Bishop Bellator at Sbeitla). Whether or not these North African churches had any influence on the medieval development is hard to say; but that much is sure, that when the counter apse was adopted in the north and became a traditional feature, it was in response to a sharply rising interest in the cult of relics calling for an augmentation of the number of stations needed for the veneration of saints. In purely aesthetic terms one cannot entirely preclude the possibility of influences from pagan Roman times, even at this late stage of the adoption of the theme. I am thinking of such double-apsed judiciary basilicas as those on the forum of the Romano-British city of Silchester (fig. 202) or the more recently excavated basilica of the Gallo-Roman city of Augst in Switzerland. Basilicas of this type must have been infinitely more numerous in the Roman provincial territories north of the Alps than would appear in present-day perspective and the remains of many of them may still have been visible in Carolingian times. Their power to influence the medieval development would doubtlessly have been enhanced by the fact that when the early Christian basilica entered into a symbiosis with the concept of a large galleried cloister court, attached to one of its long sides—as it became standard in Carolingian times—aesthetic emphasis shifted from the longitudinal directionalism of the early Christian basilica, to a broadside orientation that had been an essential trait of the judiciary basilica of pagan Rome in the first place. In the north the apse and counter apse motif was not employed with any consistency until the time of Charlemagne and its introduction coincided with a renaissance of the basilican design created for Rome by Constantine the Great. The fusion established a norm which continued into Ottonian times and lasted in Germany until the end of the Romanesque period. 161. CORINTH-LECHAION CHURCH OF ST. LEONIDAS [after Pallas, 1962, 142, fig. 142] The remains of this great church in the harbor suburb of Corinth, although preserved to no more than 2 feet above ground are, even in so ruinous a state, one of the most impressive sights in the entire Early Christian world, and an expression of the most accomplished architecture it could produce. The church dates from 450-460?; its atrium from 518-527. Including atrium and fore court, the full length of this basilica was 610 feet (186 m. or 600 Byzantine feet). The basilica itself (450 feet long) consists of a nave about 60 feet wide and two aisles, a tripartite transept and an apse. It is preceded by an exonarthex and a narthex, the latter projecting like a transept beyond the line of the aisle walls. Four heavy piers in the eastern transept suggest that its center bay was surmounted by a timber-roofed tower—a feature which curiously enough appears at the same time and thereafter in several Merovingian churches: St. Martin at Tours (ca. 450), St. Wandrille (647), and in the Carolingian church of St. Denis, if Crosby's analysis of its foundations (fig. 166.X) is correct. The layout of the liturgical furniture in the BEMA and the apse of St. Leonidas is very similar to that in the Church of the Plan of St. Gall, consisting of a semicircular bench (SYNTHRONON) in the apse and two lateral benches in the BEMA, allowing the monks to be seated on three sides around the altar space—an arrangement that lent itself with particular ease to monastic use. From the BEMA of St. Leonidas a raised pathway (SOLEA) lead to the AMBO, the pulpit from which the bishop or his representative addresses the congregation. To the best of my knowledge, the SOLEA has no counterpart in Carolingian architecture, but the AMBO is, on the Plan of St. Gall shown in a similar position west of the transept, in the axis of the nave of the church. 162. RAVENNA. CHURCH OF SAN VITALE [after Encyclopedia dell' Arte Antiqua IV, Rome, 1965, 630, fig. 730] San Vitale dates ca. 532-546. The two detached circular towers are entered from the narthex. They give access to the gallery of the church, an area reserved for women attending religious services. Despite their clearly functional role, even at this early period they may have had strong symbolic overtones as towers of the fortress of God. At what point in history they came to be used as bell towers is not easily ascertained (see above, pp. 129ff). Probably because of their failure to fill practical needs, the detached towers of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall had no consequence for later medieval planning. Single detached towers, associated with buildings of basilican plan may have been in use in the Exarchate of Ravenna as early as the 8th century and became a common mark of the Italian Romanesque and Gothic. North of the Alps, the preferred solution was to incorporate the towers in the body of the church—a process beginning with the invention of the Carolingian Westwork (cf. pp. 206-208) and culminating in the medieval twin tower façade. Even centrally planned buildings were affected by this change, as witness the Palace Chapel at Aachen with its towers set into an avant-corps with raised tribune from which the emperor attended divine services (for changing stylistic concepts see caption to Fig. 71.Z). The oldest transalpine example known to date is the basilica of St.-Maurice of Agaune, which dates from the end of the eighth century (fig. 160). Then follow in chronological order the abbey churches of Fulda, 802-819 (fig. 138); Paderborn, after 799; St. Willibrord in Echternach, at the beginning of the ninth century; the Carolingian cathedral of Cologne, traditionally ascribed to Archbishop Hildebold, who died in 819 (fig. 139); St Remi, at Reims, consecrated in 852; Auxerre Cathedral, 857-873; and the Abbey Church at Oberzell on Reichenau, ca. 890.45 45 I am following Thümmler's enumeration, loc. cit. For St. Maurice of Agaune, see Blondel, 1948, 9-57, and 1957, 283-92; for Fulda, see Beumann and Grossmann, 1949, 17-56; for Paderborn, Thümmler, 1957, 87ff; for Echternach, Meyers, 1951, 1ff; for Cologne, Doppelfeld, 1948, 1954, 1958; for Reims, Hubert, 1938, 30; for Auxerre, Louis, 1952; for Oberzell, Hecht, I, 1928, 132ff, Christ, 1956, and Gall, 1956. Excellent summaries of the state of knowledge concerning the German churches here cited will be found in Vorromanische Kirchenbauten, F. Oswald, L. Schaefer and H. R. Sennhauser, editors, 1966-1968, where these buildings are dealt with in alphabetical order. Liturgically, the counter apse provided a new sanctuary for the founding saint of the monastery, who had in many instances become more important in the ritual of the church than its patron saint. In Fulda (fig. 138), we learn from the Vita Eigilis the monumental west choir was added under Abbot Ratger (802-819) to the church of Abbot Baugulf (790/92-802) as a shrine to St. Boniface because of the heightened veneration for the relics of the founding saint.46 46 Beumann and Grossmann, 1949, 17-56; Groszmann, 1962, 344-70. Louis Blondel's excavations of the monastery of St.-Maurice of Agaune (fig. 160) have shown how a new church with a counter apse allowed the relics of saints previously venerated in separate buildings to be housed together in one church.47 47 Blondel, 1957, 291. In churches with west-works, the monumental western avant-corps of the church served the same purpose.48 48 St.-Riquier, to mention just one example, where the eastern apse contained the altars of St. Peter and St. Richarius; the westwork was added as a sanctuary for the Saviour. See Effman, 1912, 39ff. The western counter apse had the further advantage of establishing a close liturgical tie with Rome, as the creation of a sanctuary at the western end of the church was in imitation of Old St. Peter's in Rome (figs. 104, 141). Further, the adoption of this motif marked a decisive step in the breaking away of Carolingian architecture from the directional layout of the Early Christian basilica. Because it was built onto what had formerly served as the principal entrance to the church, the counter apse completely eliminated the concept of the traditional basilican facade. The nave had previously been a great congregational longhouse designed to channel the worshiping crowd toward the altar (fig. 81). With the introduction of the counter apse, the nave became rather a connecting spatial link between two terminal masses, both of which drew the worshiper's attention (figs. 55, 107, 109, 111, 112). The purpose of the nave was changed further by the railing-off 163. WERDEN CASKET (FRAGMENT). LONDON, VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM. [by courtesy of the Victoria and Albert Museum] A reliquary chest of carved ivory, the so-called Werden Casket, formerly believed to date to the beginning of the 5th century, was recently declared a Carolingian copy (Beckwith, 1958, 1-11). The detail here shows Mary and Anne in the Visitation scene, and to their side the city of Judah, represented by a building terminating in an apse and flanked by two detached circular towers. If the Early Christian model of this carving reflects actual building practice, the ivory would bear witness to the existence in Late Antiquity of detached circular towers flanking a church. So far, there appears to be no tangible archaeological evidence to confirm this conjecture except for the staircase towers of the church of San Vitale, Ravenna (fig. 162). 164. PLAN OF ST. GALL.

St. Michael For a descriptive analysis of the altars and their identifying titles, see pp. 129-44. The schema shown above does not include altars in the chapels of the Novitiate and Infirmary, whose patronage is not designated on the Plan (see fig. 247, p. 302 and p. 311). A total of twenty-one altars is shown on the Plan. On the number symbolism embedded in this figure and the distribution of altars within the church see fig. 80.X, p. 124. On the importance of the layout of the altars in reflecting and stimulating the emergence within the Church of a new principle of spatial division distinctly different from the spatial directionalism of Early Christian churches, see pp. 127-28 and caption to fig. 165. of its terminal bays for the exclusive use of the monks, leaving only the center of the nave accessible to laymen (figs. 82 and 110). This was the monastic Carolingian response to the large congregational halls of the age of Constantine. This architectural change reflects a liturgical one. The great basilican churches of Constantine had been designed for large crowds of worshipers, most of whom had only recently been converted to the new faith. By contrast, the Carolingian monastery church was designed for the worship of a small community of men who lived in seclusion. In the Early Christian basilica the body of officiating priests was relatively small, the size of the attending crowd, colossal. In the Carolingian monastery church, the number of worshiping monks was relatively large (an average of 100 to 150; 300 to 400 in unusual cases), that of the attending laymen not significantly larger. During the great religious festivals, and in particular the feast of the patron saint, the throng of pilgrims could rise to enormous numbers; but for the rest of the year the lay attendance in the church remained confined to the serfs who worked within the monastic enclosure (in general outnumbering the monks by not more than 30 per cent)49 49 On the relative numbers of monks and serfs see below, pp. 342ff. plus the tenants who lived in cottages or on farms immediately around the abbey. II.3.7 SEMICIRCULAR ATRIA The two semicircular atria of the Church of the Plan are a most unusual feature. The customary early Christian form was a fore court of square or rectangular plan, surrounded by colonnaded porticoes with a fountain or water basin in the center and porches in the galleries for entry and exit. These courts served varyingly as a preliminary place of assembly for the faithful, as refuge during inclement weather, as a burial ground, and often also as a gathering place for those who were as yet not formally admitted to the Christian community.50 50 For literary sources attesting these uses, see A. M. Schneider, "Atrium," Reallexikon für Antike und Christentum, I, 1950, cols. 888-889. The architectural prototypes of these early Christian atria (from Greek: ??????ν; i.e., "a place under the open sky")51 51 Nor from the Latin word ater ("black"), referring to the soot-covered walls in the courts of Roman houses, as some classical ethymologists suggest. See Isidore of Seville, Etymol., Lib. XV, iii; ed. Lindsay, 1911. were the galleried courts which the ancients interposed as a transitional zone between the profane world and their sacred buildings, in a multitude of aesthetic variations including the use of semicircles, as well as an exuberant combination of squares and semicircles, such as in the temples of Baalbek or the Forum of Emperor Trajan in Rome. If viewed against these lavish architectural orchestrations of Rome, the early Christian atrium signifies historically a retrenchment to the somber form of the square. Among hundreds of well-attested early Christian atria, there are only three, to my knowledge, that make use of the semicircle: 165. PLAN OF ST. GALL * AXONOMETRIC DRAWING In aligning altars and altar screens with every second nave column, the architect projected the modular order of the Church (fig. 61) into the layout of its liturgical furnishings. The interior is divided into a multitude of separate devotional stations, leaving only narrow passages in the aisles for the worshiper to move through the entire length of the Church (fig. 82). The emergence in Carolingian architecture of the ordering of space in recognizable, aesthetically modular form (cf. pp 217-23, below) has a striking parallel in the appear- ance in Hiberno-Saxon and Carolingian book illumination of a decorative scheme whereby the entire book is divided internally into clearly distinguishable parts and sub-parts— leading, in a crescendo of pictorial emphasis from letter to initial, initial to ornamented page, ornamented to figured page, and thus separating Gospel from Gospel, book from chapter, chapter from paragraph, and paragraph from sentence. On the emergence of comparable stylistic trends in Carolingian literature and music, see Crocker, Jones, and Horn in Viator VI, 1976. 166. RAVENNA. SAN GIOVANNI EVANGELISTA BUILT BETWEEN 424 AND 434 Plan with square grid superimposed [after Petrovi?, 1962, 43, fig. 2] Navenka Petrovi?'s interpretation of the proportions of the church of San Giovanni Evangelista in Ravenna is based upon a plan too small and sketchy to be susceptible to critical evaluation. One is disturbed to find that in some places the lines run along the outer, in others along the inner surfaces of the walls of the Church. In the case of the nave columns one observes with consternation that they are not even touched by the longitudinal lines of the grid. Petrovi? is probably correct when she concludes that the church of San Giovanni Evangelista is twice as long as it is wide, but the square grid from which she thinks these proportions are developed is meaningless, since the boundaries of the component squares of the grid are in no tangible relation to the nave columns or the blind arcading of the outer-wall surfaces. They are even less compatible with the dimensions of the porch, the apse, or the two rectangular spaces (DIAKONIKON and PROTHESIS) to the side of the apse. Similar, if not more blatant discrepancies between Petrovi?'s modular grids and the actual course of the masonry as well as the spacing of the nave columns exist in virtually all of the other dozen odd fifth and sixth century churches of Ravenna and the Northern Littoral of the Adriatic Sea with which she deals, although in many of these the length of the church appears to be indeed, the double of its width. The proportions of all of these churches should be re-examined with new plans made on the spot, and at a scale considerably (!) larger and draftsmanship more precise than those upon which the Petrovi? grids are based. a large fourth-century church at Damous-el-Karita, a suburb of ancient Carthage;52 52 So far only published in a very sketchy review by J. Vaultrian, 1932, 188ff and 1933, 118ff. See Krautheimer, 1965. the domed basilica of Meriamlik, in Silicia, Asia Minor, 471-94;53 53 For Meriamlik, see Herzfeld-Guyer, 1930, 46ff and Krautheimer, 1965, 177-78. and the recently excavated church of St. Leonidas at Lechaion, the harbor suburb of Corinth, whose atrium dates from 518527 (fig. 161).54 54 For St. Leonidas at Lechaion, see Krautheimer, 1965, 99-100 and the literature quoted there. The earliest semicircular atrium north of the Alps is the western atrium of Cologne Cathedral (period VI), which was added to the enlarged transept of the old Merovingian church (period V), as is now believed, after the accession of Hildebold to the episcopal see in 782 and before the coronation of Charlemagne in 80055 55 Weyres, 1965, 390ff and 409ff; cf. above, pp. 27ff. (fig. 139), and thus precedes the two circular atria of the Plan of St. Gall by over twenty years. It appears to me extremely doubtful that there is any connection between these semicircular Carolingian forecourts and those of the just-mentioned fourth- to sixth-century churches of North Africa, Asia Minor, and Greece; and I would be inclined to give stronger credence to a connection with the semicircular courts of the basilica of Emperor Trajan (fig. 239); their layout may have exerted the additional influence of stimulating the aesthetic acceptance in Carolingian churches of the motif of apse and counter apse. We have other reasons to think that the Forum of Trajan had some influence on the mind of the architect who invented the scheme of the Plan.56 56 See our remarks concerning the role the Forum of Emperor Trajan might have played in the formation of the layout of Novitiate and Infirmary, below, pp. 315ff. II.3.8 DETACHED TOWERS Detached circular masonry towers, like those found on the Plan of St. Gall, do not occur elsewhere in the ecclesiastical architecture north of the Alps.57 57 Groszmann, 1962, 354, considers the possibility that Ratger's church at Fulda (791-819) might have had two detached circular towers like St. Gall. But this is a purely hypothetical assumption. A single detached tower, of unknown shape, seems to have existed at Seligenstadt (built by Einhard between 831 and 840), as is suggested by a number of passages in Einhard's Translation and Miracles of the Holy Martyrs Peter and Marcellinus, in which we are told that in order to ring the bells, the bell-ringer had to leave the church. This passage is the only existing source, as far as I know, besides the Plan of St. Gall, that attests to the existence of detached towers in Carolingian architecture. See Einhardi translatio et miracula S. S. Martyrum Marcellini et Petri (written in 830); ed. Waitz, Mon. Germ. Hist., Script., XV:1, 1887, 254; pertinent passages are quoted by Sommerfeld, 1906, 205, note 33. For the church of Seligenstadt-on-the-Main, see Müller, 1936, 254-59; and Schuchert, 1938, 141-46. The builders of the North chose to incorporate the towers into the body of the church, and the preferred Carolingian solution was the Westwerk, which eventually developed into the two-tower facade. Detached towers were common enough, however, in the churches of the Exarchate of Ravenna. Giuseppe Galassi58 58 Galassi, 1928, 97ff and 591. dates some of these Ravenna churches in the eighth century: San Giovanni Evangelista, San Pier' Maggiore, and San Giovanni e Paolo. Others doubt that they are this early.59 59 For a recent discussion of the Ravenna towers, see Mazzotti, 1958, 85-93; for a bibliography on the individual buildings, Bovini, 1961, 20ff. Still, I am inclined to believe that the idea originated in Ravenna, where it remained a favorite motif throughout the Middle Ages. It has been generally overlooked in this context that the Church of San Vitale in Ravenna, consecrated in 547, has two impressive circular towers with spiral staircases, which, for all practical purposes, may be classified as detached towers (fig. 162).60 60 For San Vitale, see Verzone, 1942, 93-98, and the literature cited in Bovini, 1961, 41ff. Ravenna, and in particular the Church of San Vitale, were well known at the Court of Charlemagne, as the carefully documented history of the construction of the Palace Chapel at Aachen attests. Therefore, I think it very probable that the trend began with the towers of San Vitale. The Ravenna towers may, in turn, have been influenced by Asiatic or Syrian prototypes. Reinhardt61 61 Reinhardt, 1952, 29, after Cabrol-Leclercq, II:1, 1907, col. 576, fig. 1440. The two towers which Pope Stephen II and Pope Hadrian I added onto the basilica of Old St. Peter's in Rome, around the middle of the eighth century and shortly after 772, may have greatly stimulated the interest in towers in the Western world, but they were of different shape and therefore are not likely to have been a direct source for the Plan of St. Gall. With regard to these towers see Sommerfeld, 1906, 204. has drawn attention to a church with two detached circular towers on an ivory panel in the Victoria and Albert Museum (fig. 163), formerly considered to be of late antique date but recently declared a Carolingian pastiche.62 62 Beckwith, 1958, 1-11, where all previous literature is cited. Beckwith rejects all earlier attributions, on stylistic and other grounds. He declares the fragments of the Werden Casket a Carolingian copy of a late antique ivory, made in a workshop in the Rhine-Maas or Ruhr area in the first half of the ninth century. Another contributing source, as has been pointed 166.X ST.-DENIS, SEINE, FRANCE ABBEY CHURCH (Consecrated 24 Feb. 775) [redrawn from Crosby and Conant] The plan is based on Crosby's interpretation of the remains of the Early Carolingian church (Crosby, 1953, 68) as rendered and reproduced by Conant (1959, 292). The square grid, superimposed in red, is based on Formigé's analysis of the proportions of the church (Formigé, 1960). out in the preceding chapter, were the two defensive towers flanking city gates, shown on contemporary representations of the two sacred towns of Rome and Jerusalem (see above, p. 129). Why the author of the Plan of St. Gall gave preference to two detached towers over the more common Carolingian Westwerk remains an enigma. The westwork consisted of a multi-storied avant-corps on the entrance side of the church, in which two lateral staircase towers gave access to a raised tribune from which the emperor and his entourage could attend the divine services. This innovation—a tangible architectural expression, it appears, of the protectorate which the secular ruler exercised over the Church in NEUSTADT-AM-MAIN. SAVIOR'S CHURCH (768-769) WITH SQUARE GRID SUPERIMPOSED 167.A 167.B [after Boeckelmann, 1962, 11, fig. 3] The church was dedicated, according to a later tradition, on 19 August 793. But this date has recently been questioned (see Vorromanische Kirchenbauten, 1966, 233). For another view of the church, see fig. 116; for its Early Christian prototypes and the roles they may have played in stimulating medieval modularity, see figs. 144-151 and above, pp. 190ff. the empire of the Franks—made its first appearance, perhaps not accidentally, in the royal abbeys of Lorsch, 767-774 (figs. 200-201), and St. Riquier, 790-799 (figs. 168 and 196). The only preserved example besides the Palace Chapel at Aachen (fig. 71.Za) is the Abbey Church of Corvey-on-the-Weser (873-885), but others are known to have existed at Reims Cathedral (founded by Archbishop Ebbo, 816-835, and consecrated by his successor, Hincmar, in 862), in the cathedral of Halberstadt (consecrated in 859), Hildesheim (consecrated in 872), and Minden (consecrated in 952).63 63 The literature on the Westwerk has swelled to considerable proportions. See Fuchs, 1929, 1950, and 1957; Lotz, 1952; Gall, 1954; Stengel, 1956; Schmidt, 1956; and Groszmann, 1957 (an informative review discussing everything published prior to 1957). Thümmler expressed himself on the subject succinctly in 1958, col. 89ff. For accounts of individual churches with westwork in the German part of the Carolingian empire see Thümmler, 1957, 84-108 and Vorromanische Kirchenbauten, ed. Oswald et al., 1966ff (under the names of these churches). Although, on the Plan of St. Gall, the emperor and his following are given ample space in houses that the monastery had set aside for reception of visitors,64 64 See below, II, 155ff. in the church itself he was not granted a station of his own. Perhaps we are sensing here, once more, an expression of the touchiness of the reform movement with regard to the possibility of secular contamination of the House of God and its servants.65 65 On other expressions of this anxiety, see above, pp. 22ff and below pp. 280ff. The interpretations of the relation of Church (sacerdotium) and State (regnum) were still far from attaining any fixed or permanent form. Under Charlemagne, even such leading churchmen as Theodulf of Orleans and Alcuin did not hesitate to refer to the secular sovereign both as "king in power" and "pontifex in preaching"; and Charlemagne himself left no margin of doubt that it was the emperor who installed the bishops and reserved for himself the ultimate authority in the trial of prelates.66 66 On the relation of Church and State in conflicting contemporary thinking see the chapter "Theory and Countertheory" in Morrison, 1964, 26-36. Yet all throughout his reign and, with increasing strength, that of his sons, there was a clerical reaction that rejected temporal hegemony, proposed to erect the order of the church as a second government beside the temporal power, or even to arrogate complete subordination of the royal power to the jurisdictional apparatus of the clergy. The conviction of Louis the Pious that the emperor stood "in the service of God" (in Dei servitio) gave added impetus to this concept.67 67 Ibid., 41ff. This ambiguity was not solved in Carolingian times; and if it expressed itself in architecture, we cannot expect it to have led to uniformly acceptable solutions. II.3.9 PLURALITY OF ALTARS During the two centuries after the official recognition of the Christian faith, most churches had only one altar. When the need arose for additional altars, they were generally not installed in the church, but in separate oratories built to the side of the principal structure. The earliest evidence of multiple altars within the church itself dates from the sixth century. In the seventh and eighth, the trend increases. By the time of Charlemagne, the number of altars in some cases had risen to as many as thirty.68 68 On the plurality of altars and the increasing strength of the cult of the saints in the Franco-Carolingian era, see Braun, I, 1924, 368ff; and Bandmann, 1962, 371-411. The Church of the Plan with its seventeen altars (fig. 164) —nineteen if we add the altars in the towers—is not an 168. ST. RIQUIER (CENTULA). ABBEY CHURCH (790-799) WITH SQUARE GRID SUPERIMPOSED [as reconstructed by Achter, 1956, 146, fig. 7] Achter's reconstruction of the plan of the abbey church of St. Riquier appears to us to be superior to that of Effmann (1912) because it takes into account irregularities in the Gothic church that can only be explained on the assumption that they were conditioned by the layout of the preceding Carolingian church. It is a refinement, not a contradiction, of Effmann's views. For other aspects of the church see fig. 196. unusual case. Between 834 and 835 the Cathedral of Le Mans had fourteen altars; the cathedral of York (766-778), according to the testimony of Alcuin (d. 804), had thirty; the abbey of Centula, at the time of Abbot Angilbert (d. 814), had thirty; there were fourteen in the Church of St.-Riquier, three in the Church of St. Benedict, and thirteen in St. Mary's Church.69 69 Braun, I, 372-73. There are many reasons for this multiplication of altars: first, the increasing emphasis being placed on the saints and their relics during this period; second, the introduction into the liturgical ritual of solitary masses which were celebrated at auxiliary altars; third, the growing number of masses held in commemoration of the dead and for other special occasions; and finally—perhaps the most decisive cause—a papal ordinance that mass could be celebrated only once a day at the same altar.70 70 Ibid., 376; and Father Iso Müller, in Studien, 1962, 129ff. The installation of more altars tended to divide the space of the church into separate areas for worship. It fostered processionals, in which all the monks, separated into choirs, moved from altar to altar throughout the church, chanting the psalms in antiphon and praying.71 71 Hariulf gives us a vivid description of such processions as they were held in his days in the monastery of Centula. After leaving their seats in the choir, the monks moved in solemn procession through the crossing into the nave, to the altars of St. Stephen and St. Lawrence, which were built against the western crossing piers. There they parted into two separate choirs moving on opposite sides of the church in spiral formation, first to the altars in the two transept arms (St. Maurice and St. Quentin), then to the altars near the eastern crossing piers (St. Stephen and St. Lawrence), and finally, to the altar of the Saviour in the center of the nave, where they formed themselves again into a single procession and exited into the cloister. Other processions took the community of monks to the altars of the westwork and of the atrium, and into the churches of St. Mary and St. Benedict. On all the regular days the services were held before the high altar (St. Richarius), but on the feasts of the other saints they were celebrated at the altars in which their relics were placed, or "if there were several churches . . . in the churches which are consecrated to their veneration." Hariulf, "De circuitu orationum," Chronique de l'abbaye de St.-Riquier, ed. Lot, 1894, 305-306. The aesthetic implications of this new liturgical development are clearly marked in the Church of the Plan (fig. 140). An alignment of altars (or altars and other important liturgical appurtenances) in nave and aisles at each second pair of columns establishes transverse divisions on the floor of the Church, the rhythm of which can only be 169. FULDA. PLAN OF ABBEY CHURCH AS ATTAINED UNDER RATGER (802-817) [after Vorromanische Kirchenbauten, plate following p. 81] SQUARE GRID SUPERIMPOSED There is no doubt that the layout of Ratger's church at Fulda was based on that of Old St. Peter's in Rome (fig. 170, and text, p. 221) but the conceptual method, used in giving nave and transept the same width and using the area of intersection as a module for the proportions of all superordinate spaces, is fundamentally different. 170. ROME. OLD ST. PETER'S (AFTER 324 CA. 360) [Plan after Jongkees, 1966, pl. 1. Construction diagram superimposed by Ernest Born] The architect who planned St. Peter's used a constructional system as classical in concept as the modularity of Carolingian churches is medieval. He obtained the length of the longitudinal body of St. Peter's by elongating the sides of a square to a length equalling its diagonal. In the same manner the architect calculated the overall length of the church by using the diagonal of the rectangle thus constructed. The diagonal of any square does not relate in a ratio of integers to its sides. The metric expression of the diagonal of a square is 1.414, the square root of 2 (√2). The extension of a square into a rectangle by extending two of its sides to a length equalling its diagonal is a simple task that can be performed without recourse to calculation and with only the aid of a string. Spaces designed by aggregation of modules tend to produce such narrow elongated shapes as are exemplified in the churches of Fulda, Cologne, and the Plan of St. Gall. The trait distinguishes the Romanesque and Gothic architecture of Hildesheim, Jumièges, and Speyer. The extension into a rectangle of a square by means of its diagonal produces, by contrast, spaces of relatively squat proportions. The Romans made frequent use of √2 rectangle construction, resulting in the thoroughly un-medieval proportions of many Roman cities and military camps. No doubt strategical advantages of defending compact fortifications as compared with long, attenuated ones influenced, if not conditioned, Roman application of the √2 rectangle to site layout. But military considerations could hardly have been primary in constructing metropolitan churches. When they came to be built, the method perhaps had become habit; its simplicity was probably an important cause of its general adoption. [The linear values √1, √2, √3, √4, √5, etc. are derived by diagonals produced from a generating square of unity. Starting with the initial square, one unit by one unit, the nth square is formed after n2 steps. The procedure can go on to infinity. But after the √5 rectangle (the diagonal to the second square) linear or lateral expansion is simplest and most direct by compounds of the square. Hence square schematism. E. B.] 171. REICHENAU-MITTELZELL. HAITO'S CHURCH OF SS MARY, PETER, &amp; PAUL (CONSECRATED 816) The church is inordinately short for its period. Reisser (1960, fig. 285) held the opinion that Haito intended to extend the church westward to twice its present length, so that its façade would have been in line with the façade of Pirmin's church. This would explain the shift from square modules (30′ × 30′) used in the eastern part of the church and oblong ones used in the nave (24′ × 30′). For more detail see fig. 117 Horn and Born, 1974, 453; IDEM, 1975, 372-74; and Erdmann and Zettlar, 1974, 481ff. compared to that which was established two centuries later on the clerestory level through the introduction of diaphragm arches. This is the beginning of the principle of rhythmic alternation. It starts with the alignment of altars and columns (Plan of St. Gall), finds structural expression in the nave walls with the introduction of supports of rhythmically varying strength (Gernrode and Hildesheim), gathers vertical momentum with the addition of slender shafts and arches that carry the rhythm up into the heights of the clerestory (Speyer I), and enters into its final phase as arches are thrown across the nave from alternate sets of piers (Jumièges, Cérizy-la-Forêt). II.3.10 SQUARE SCHEMATISM "Square schematism" is a principle of medieval church design by which the constituent spaces of the church are calculated as multiples of a basic spatial unit, usually that of the crossing square. The origin and evolution of this concept is still one of the great mysteries of medieval architectural history. The Church of the Plan of St. Gall represents a crucial stage in the conceptual development of this principle. The importance of this fact has been blurred because no consensus of opinion had been obtained, in previous inquiries, with regard to even the simple question of whether or not the design of the Church of the Plan had, in fact, been developed within a system of squares; let alone the infinitely more complex problem of the historical roots and the deeper cultural significance of this fascinating principle of articulating space. I, for one, am convinced that these questions cannot be solved from within the field of architectural history. The modular mode of thinking that underlies this schematism is a general cultural phenomenon that manifests itself in other spheres of life. On the following pages I shall try to isolate some of the converging historical currents that merge in this concept. PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF THE GRID OF SQUARES On the Plan of St. Gall the square and the grid of squares are used in two different ways: as a method of mensuration, and as an aesthetic principle. In the first instance the square grid offered a convenient method of dividing a given area internally by defining it as a multiple or fraction of certain modular master units (2½-foot square, 40-foot square, 160foot square).72 72 Cf. above, pp. 77ff. In the other case, the square grid was used as an active principle of architectural composition. It is this latter type alone with which we are now concerned. Reinhardt categorically denied its presence on the Plan of St. Gall.73 73 Reinhardt, 1937, 269: "A première vue, déjà, on reconnait que, dans le dessin, le choeur ne forme pas un quadrilatère a côtés égaux, mais qu'il est nettement barlong. De même, on constatera, a l'aide d'un compas, que les croisillons, à leur tour, n'attaignent pas le carré parfait." On the basis of these observations Reinhardt, 1952, 25, goes so far as to question the entire schematism of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall: "Es is bereits die Rede davon gewesen, dass in neuerer Zeit dem Klosterplan von St. Gallen eine in die Zukunft weisende Bedeutung zugemessen wurde, insofern in seinem Kirchengrundriss bereits die Quadratur massgeblich gewesen sei sowie sie erst zweihundert Jahre später in den deutschen Bauten des 11. Jahrhunderts ausgebildet wurde. Es is oben gezeigt worden dass dies jedenfalls für den Plan von St. Gallen nicht zutrifft." Even Edgar Lehmann, in his excellent book Der frühe deutsche Kirchenbau, shares this erroneous view (Lehmann, 1938, 137). Similar views were expressed in 1945 by Samuel Guyer,74 74 Guyer, 1945, 98 and 100. but convincingly challenged in 1952 by Albert Knoepfli75 75 Knoepfli, 1952, 193-236, and 1961, 213ff. in a drawing which shows a grid of 10-foot squares superimposed upon the Plan of the Church.76 76 Knoepfli, 1952, 207, fig. H. My own analysis of the scale and construction methods used in 172. COLOGNE. CAROLINGIAN CATHEDRAL OF SS PETER AND MARY Like Fulda (fig. 169) and doubtlessly under the same influence, i.e., of Old St. Peter's in Rome (fig. 170), the transept is located in the west. As in Fulda and in the other Carolingian churches discussed here, the use of modules imparts to the layout of the spaces an aesthetic character wholly different from the squat corporeality of their Early Christian prototypes. designing the Plan corroborated this view.77 77 See Horn, 1966, 302 ff, and above, p. 86, fig. 61. In view of the visual evidence submitted by Knoepfli, as well as my own analysis of the system of squares shown in figures 61 and 173, I do not see how the validity of this contention could ever again be questioned. MEDITERRANEAN OR NORTHERN ROOTS: A DIVISION OF MINDS Because of its geographical distribution primarily in the territory of the Franks, Saxons, and Normans, Georg Dehio considered the square schematism to be essentially a "Germanic" contribution.78 78 On the question of "square schematism," see Adamy, 1887, 180ff; Dehio and von Bezold, I, 1892, 161ff.; Effman, I, 1899, 161ff; idem., 1912, 133ff; Gall, 1930, 16ff. Samuel Guyer,79 79 Guyer, 1945, 73ff; and idem., 1950, 116ff and 133ff. in a complete reversal of this contention declared this "geometrical clarity" to be a mark "of the Mediterranean way of thinking," and "one that had its roots in classical antiquity."80 80 Guyer, 1949, 98-99. The square schematism of the Plan of St. Gall, he maintained, was not one of the new and creative contributions to medieval architecture that it had been assumed to be, but "transmits to the West in a rather muddled manner the thought of the qualitatively superior art" of the Early Christian period.81 81 Ibid. These statements are of questionable historical validity— and the argument does not gain in power when one finds it supported by such sweeping generalities as "A civilization in process of just awakening from the darkness of an a-historical past" and "as yet suspended in a state of unstable hovering between unconsciousness and awakeness" could not possibly have produced aesthetic concepts "of such distinct and clear rationality. . . . The period of Charlemagne had never the significance ascribed to it so fervently in recent times. . . . In the time of Emperor Charlemagne the thoughts of Late Antiquity and Early 173. PLAN OF ST. GALL. PLAN OF MONASTERY CHURCH SHOWN AT SCALE 1:600 The Church of the Plan of St. Gall is chronologically the last of a triad of Carolingian transept basilicas of monumental dimensions owing their size to the tide of spiritual and cultural exhilaration that seized the Frankish clergy in the wake of Charlemagne's coronation as emperor, on Christmas Eve of the year 800, in the basilica of Old St. Peter's in Rome. Unlike Cologne (fig. 172) and Fulda (fig. 169) which were occidented in imitation of Old St. Peter's, (fig. 170) the Church of the Plan was oriented. Like Cologne and Fulda, on the other hand, and in contrast to St. Peter's, the Church of the Plan was constructed on a square grid, in the most elaborate and most consistent application of it, since it encompassed, in addition to the Church itself, the entire claustral complex and in fact the entire monastery site (figs. 62 and 63). 174. ROME. SANTA MARIA MAGGIORE (432-440) LOOKING NORTH AND SOMEWHAT EAST TO THE APSE Despite its coffered Renaissance ceiling (added in 1500, substituting for the original open-timbered roof) this view of Santa Maria Maggiore conveys persuasively the stylistic quality of the great Early Christian basilicas composed of huge, block-shaped, and internally undivided voids. The concept differs fundamentally from that of the square-divided Carolingian churches of Neustadt, St. Riquier, Fulda, Reichenau-Mittelzell, Cologne, and that of the Plan of St. Gall (figs. 167-69; 171-73), as well as from the bay-divided and arch-framed spaces of the Romanesque and Gothic (Hildesheim, Speyer, Jumièges; figs. 188-90), the cellular composition of which has primary roots in the Carolingian modular reorganization of the Early Christian scheme. For another magnificent view of the interior of a great Early Christian basilica see fig. 81, St. Paul's Outside the Walls, Rome. 175. FEDDERSEN-WIERDE, BREMERHAVEN, GERMANY 175: AISLED HOUSE OF A CHIEFTAIN, WARF-LAYER 11B, 1ST-2ND CENT. (authors' reconstruction) 176: PLAN (after Haarnagel, 1956, pl. 3) The house belongs to the second settlement horizon of an artificially raised dwelling mound (Warf) which was occupied, on successively higher levels, from the 1st to the 4th centuries. The house was 28.5 × 7.5m on an east-west axis. The living portion with hearth and the section for livestock were, respectively, 9m and 16m long. An entrance in the middle of the eastern end wall was primarily used by cattle. (Also see figs. 315-316, II, 58.) Christianity were taken over in a manner so superficial as to be incapable of taking any deep root or of being developed any further."82 82 Guyer, 1950, 116-17. Guyer is over-reacting to a cultural prejudice that has been ruthlessly expressed by some of the proponents of the opposite view. I propose that we confine ourselves to specific issues rather than argue the case in such global terms. INCREASING PROPENSITY FOR MODULAR SPACE DIVISION IN PRE-CAROLINGIAN AND CAROLINGIAN ARCHITECTURE NORTH OF THE ALPS The emergence of the square schematism in medieval architecture depended on two crucial innovations in the interrelation of the component spaces of the basilican church: 1. The nave and the transept of the church had to be given the same width, and 2. The width of the aisles had to be fixed to one-half the width of the nave. Without the first, the crossing could not form a square; without the second, the modular division of the nave could not be carried into the aisles. Both of these features occurred separately in Early Christian times, but they were not integrated then into a programmatic architectural system. An example of a church with nave and transept of equal width is the Justinian basilica of the Nativity at Bethlehem (if Hans Christ's interpretation of its plan is correct).83 83 Christ, 1935, 305 and pl. 2, figs. 4-5. In several Christian churches of Ravenna—all without transepts—the width of the aisles is fixed at one half, or approximately one half, the width of the nave. Yet as we survey Early Christian church architecture as a whole, we must conclude that its truly distinguishing feature is not the presence, but rather the absence of any fixed proportions. Nevenka Petrovi?84 84 Petrovi?, 1962, 40-71. has made an illuminating study of the proportions in churches of Ravenna and the adjacent littoral of the Adriatic sea. In attempting to demonstrate that these churches were laid out according to a system of squares, as she set out to do, she has de facto illustrated the fundamental difference between the layout of these later Early Christian churches and the system of squares employed in medieval architecture. The salient feature of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall and its Ottonian and Romanesque successors is that the squares control the spacing of the arcades and therefore express the modular layout of the plan in the elevation of the columns. The divisions of Petrovi?'s grids (fig. 166), by contrast, have no relation whatsoever to the position of the arcade columns. True, in some of the proto-medieval churches of Ravenna, the length and width of the church exist in a state of DIAGRAM: TWO MODES OF SPACE COMPOSITION 177.A 177.B 177.C 177.D The Early Christian concept of building in large, internally undivided blocks of space (A) differs fundamentally from bay-divided vernacular (B), and bay-divided Romanesque and Gothic church construction (C, D). 178.

IV, fol. 2v [by courtesy of the Trustees of the British Museum] Stages of layout modular interdependency, but since this module does not control the spacing of the columns, it is aesthetically of no consequence. I tend to agree with George Dehio that the square schematism is essentially a "Germanic" contribution to Western architecture for two reasons: first, because it is found primarily in regions of relatively strong Germanic concentration,85 85 Dehio and von Bezold, I, 1892, 161; and Dehio, I, 1930, 77 and 82/83. and second, because it is in these areas also that we may detect its developmental antecedents. An early medieval church exhibiting an incipient tendency toward the use of the square as a module was Fulrad's church of St. Denis, begun after 754 and consecrated in 775 (fig. 167).86 86 Formigé, 1960, 51 and 57. Formigé's interpretation of the layout of the transept of Fulrad's church differs from that of Crosby, but the differences and their rationale are nowhere discussed as far as I can determine. (Cf. Crosby, 1966, 7 Figs., 1 and 6, note 4.) There appears to be no disagreement with regard to the layout of the nave of the church. Its basic layout, if Formigé's interpretation is correct, was developed within a grid of 6-foot squares which, in contrast to San Giovanni Evangelista at Ravenna (fig. 166), determined not only the overall dimensions of nave and transept, but also the interstices of its arcades. The transept was seven 6-foot units wide, and thirteen long; the nave was five units wide and fifteen long. The distance from center to center of arcade columns was two units, and in the middle part of the transept two cruciform piers establish a square of five by five units. As yet we cannot speak of square schematism, because the dimensions of the crossing square are not mirrored anywhere else in the building, and in particular not in the intercolumniation of the arcades. A church that comes closer to this ideal is the Saviour's Church of Neustadt-on-the-Main, after 768/69 (fig. 167). The plan of this church together with other cruciform churches of similar design built in early medieval times, such as Pfalzel near Trier, and Metlach (both before 713), may have formed a connecting link between square-divided Carolingian basilicas of the ninth century and certain cruciform churches of the fourth and fifth centuries, typical examples of which are shown in fig. 144-146 and 148-149. A grandiose variant of this church type, built as early as 380 by Emperor Gratian in his residential city of Trier, rose in territory that later was part of the very core of the Frankish kingdom—for every Carolingian to see! (Its masonry survives to this day, incorporated in the fabric of the Romanesque church that superseded it.) This is the only pre-medieval church type where nave and transept are of equal width, their intersecting bodies forming a square—and one might indeed regard the fully developed square schematism of the Carolingian period as a transference to churches of basilican plan of a principle already experimented with in pre-medieval times in the highly specialized context of these Early Christian cross-in-square 180.

Jones and Richard E. Crocker deal with emergence of similar concepts in literary and musical composition of the Carolingian period. For Neustadt-on-the-Main and Metlach see Boeckelmann, 1952, 109ff and Boeckelmann, 1956. For Pfalzel see Vorromanische Kirchenbauten, ed. Oswald et al., 1966-1967, 259. For Trier see Krautheimer, 1965, 61, fig. 23. The first Carolingian church to mark the developmentally significant moment of the adoption of the square schematism in a building of unequivocally basilican design was the abbey church of Centula, 790-799, if Irmingard Achter's reconstruction of this building is correct (fig. 170).88 88 Achter, 1956, 133-54. Because of the scarcity of archaeological data available on this important building, such an assumption can neither be fully accepted nor convincingly rejected. For the same reason it is impossible to ascertain whether the interstices of the nave arcades were aligned with these modules. Modular adjustment between width and length of the component spaces is clearly visible, however, in the abbey church of Fulda (802-817).89 89 For a fuller discussion of Fulda in relation to St. Peter's and the historical position of Haito's church at Reichenau-Mittelzell in the development of modular concepts of organizing space see Horn and Born, 1975. Its nave, measured from the base of its western to that of its eastern apse, was exactly four times its width (fig. 169). The dimensions of the transept were identical with those of the nave. In the vast body of literature devoted to Fulda—whose authors never weary of citing the dependence of its design on that of Old St. Peter's—this crucial aesthetic novelty has never been pointed out, much less set into proper historical perspective. We know nothing about the intercolumniation of Fulda. On the other hand, it is not possible to interpret Old St. Peter's as having been developed within a grid of identical squares—neither each volume by itself, nor any volume in relation to a neighboring unit or to the whole of the building mass. The architect who planned St. Peter's employed instead a constructional system as classical in concept as the modularity of the Carolingian churches shown in figs. 144ff is medieval (see Born's analysis, fig. 170). He calculated the length of the longitudinal body of the church by making use of the diagonal of a square with a side equal to the width of the church, and developed the overall length of the church in the same manner, with the aid of the diagonal of the rectangle obtained by the preceding method. This configuration, known as a √2 rectangle, is irrational, since the diagonal of a square is not in any integral relationship to its sides (1: √2 = 1:1.414) and therefore cannot be defined as an aggregation of an integral modular value. Hildebold's church of Cologne (ca. 800-819) was composed wholly of equal squares: three in the transept, four in the nave, one in the fore choir (fig. 172). If the elevation of its nave walls was identical with that of the church dedicated in 870, the piers of the arcades that carried the clerestory walls would not have been in alignment with this system. The abbey church of Reichenau-Mittelzell, built by Haito (806-816) is also developed within a modular grid of squares, but the grid is irregular, and its existence, for that reason, has been questioned. In evaluating this problem it is important to distinguish the existence or nonexistence of the concept of squares at Reichenau from the regularity or perfection of its execution. The irregularity, in the angular deviation of the walls from the grid (especially noticeable in the eastern part of the church) is caused by special topographical conditions. But no doubt can be entertained that the concept exists. The shape of the fore choir and of the two transept arms are almost a mirror image of the shape of the crossing square, but the squares of the nave are slightly oblong. Yet the principle of divisions is clearly there, and the boundary between the two oblongs of the nave is marked by piers, whose design differs from the columns standing midway between them. In this feature St. Mary's Church at Reichenau goes a step beyond even the Church of the Plan of St. Gall, which has no such alternation in its main supports. In Hildebold's church of Cologne (fig. 172) the system of squares finds clear expression in the west transept and in the eastern fore choir, both of which are formed of squares of identical size: three in the transept, one in the fore choir. The nave is composed of four squares of like dimensions. We know nothing about its elevation. If it was identical with that of the church that was dedicated in 870, the piers of the arcades which carry the clerestory walls would not have been in alignment with the system of squares. In the Church of the Plan of St. Gall the square schematism attains its purest Carolingian form of expression (fig. 173). The basic unit is the 40-foot module of the crossing square. The transept is formed of three such squares, the fore choir of one, the nave of four and one-half; and the dimensions of the crossing square are echoed even in the Library and Vestiary. In St. Gall, moreover, the interstices of the columns are in rhythmical alignment with the squares. It is incomprehensible to me how this fact should ever have been questioned. What the designer of this church had in mind were arcades cutting deep into the masonry of the nave walls (fig. 110) with their supports so spaced as to give bodily expression to the sequence of squares on which the Plan was based. This schematism is a conscious and willed aesthetic principle. It is a fundamentally different concept from that which produced the low, narrowly spaced columnar orders of the Early Christian basilicas of Rome (figs. 141 and 174). Contrary to what Guyer, Reinhardt, and Reinle believe, it is an ingenious anticipation of the square schematism of the Romanesque. What are the historical preconditions of this propensity for modular organization of space? Some clearly are functional. 181.

IV, fol. 138r [by courtesy of the Trustees of the British Museum] Diagram illustrating use of square grid in constructing the layout for the opposite illustration Others may have to be traced to vernacular architecture. For still others we shall have to reach, beyond the boundaries of architectural history, into the field of book illumination, where strong expression of modular modes of thinking can be observed over a century before they assert themselves in church building. Yet others, and perhaps the most important of all, may have to be sought in deeper and more general cultural levels. NEW LITURGICAL NEEDS CONTRIBUTING TO MODULAR SPACE DIVISION I have already drawn attention to a number of contributing factors that tended to facilitate this development in a functional sense: the need for an extension of the altar space, leading to the interposition of a new spatial unit between transept and apse; the framing of the crossing by means of arches, creating a square division in the transept, that would lend itself to being extended to the nave; and most of all, perhaps, the multiplication of altars, demanding a subdivision of the spaces of nave and aisles into a sequence of devotional stations (figs. 164 and 165). We add to this a feature (which Irmingard Achter stressed in her discussion of the Carolingian Abbey Church of Centula): circular towers such as the towers which surmounted the crossing and the westwork of this church require as base a square-shaped underpinning. All of these innovations contributed to the development of a modular scheme, but none of them alone (and perhaps, not even all together), might have led to the creation of the modular space division of the medieval church as a binding architectural principle. There are other forces to be taken into account. MODULAR SPACE DIVISION: AN INTRINSIC FEATURE OF PREHISTORIC, PROTOHISTORIC, AND MEDIEVAL WOOD CONSTRUCTION In an article dealing with the origins of the medieval bay system,90 90 Horn, 1958, 18. I have pointed out that modular design has been from the remotest periods an intrinsic feature of northern wood construction. The stability of the timbered Germanic house required that its roof-supporting posts be joined together at the top: lengthwise by means of plates, and crosswise by means of tie beams. This divides the space of the house into a modular sequence of timber-framed bays (figs. 175 and 176). Recent excavations have made it clear that this construction type came into existence around 1200 B.C., and for the next two thousand years it served as an all-purpose house in the Germanic territories of Holland, Germany, England, and Scandinavia as well as in all those areas of Central and Western Europe that were primarily settled by Germanic peoples.91 91 For a brief review of this material, prehistoric and medieval, see Horn, 1958, 2-16, and II, 23-77. In timber this concept is old; in stone it is new. In timber it develops as a logical construction method from the natural properties of the Canon Tables (183.A) The Ada Gospels is the first great highlight of the classicizing phase of illumination of the so-called Court School. It consists of an earlier part (fols. 6-38) containing the canon tables (fols. 6v-11v) which combine the decorative tradition of the Hiberno-Saxon school (figs. 178-182) with a tendency to treat the arcades of the tables in a more architectural manner. Size of leaves of the manuscript in the present cropped state is 36 × 24.5cm. Figures 183.A and 183.B are reduced about 12.5 percent. Originally the leaves were larger. The later part of the Ada Gospels consists of the remainder of the text, and portraits of the four evangelists (fols. 15v, 59v, 85v, 127v), one of which is illustrated in fig. 184 (see overleaf). 183.C ADA GOSPELS (EARLY 9TH CENT.) DIAGRAM SHOWING USE OF SQUARE GRID IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CANON TABLES SHOWN IN 183.A AND 183.B (see overleaf) TRIER, Municipal Library, MS. XXII, fol. 6v material. In masonry it is an intrusive feature, imposed upon the material as a willed aesthetic principle—and therefore ushers in a conflict between style and building material which, in its ultimate phase, the Gothic, led to a complete denial of the natural properties of stone. I have suggested that the modular arrangement of space, which begins in Carolingian Church architecture, gathers increasing strength in the Ottonian period and reaches its peak of expression in the Romanesque and Gothic (fig. 177), has one of its roots in the fact that these churches were constructed by men in whose collective memory "to build" had been synonymous with building in modular sequences of space. The validity and importance of this explanation cannot be appreciated until it is understood that the determining factor in analyzing the origins of square schematism is not that it is based on the shape of the square, but that it establishes a system of binding modular relationships. In distinguishing between the système des carrés of the Romanesque and the système des barlongs of the Gothic, we have lost sight of the fact that both of these systems are members of the same family. Whether the module is square or rectangular is determined by secondary conditions, sometimes functional, sometimes constructional, sometimes stylistic, and on occasion, even by purely arbitrary reasons. The house of the Germanic chieftain of the first and second centuries A.D., which is shown in figures 175-176, employs both the square and the rectangular module, the former in the living area, identifiable by the hearth; the latter, in the section of the house where the cattle are stabled, identifiable by the manure mats.92 92 For a detailed account of this house, see II, 58f (figs. 315-16). Here the shape of the module is conditioned by strictly functional considerations: the roof-supporting trusses are spaced at intervals of 6 to 7 feet, just as much space as is needed to stable two head of cattle. In the living section of the house, on the other hand, the trusses are set further apart to give greater freedom of movement. The distinction is very old and can be observed in Bronze Age houses of the same construction type, dating from around 1200 B.C., recently excavated by Waterbolk in Elp, Holland.93 93 See below, II, 71 and fig. 323. In the Carolingian monastery churches discussed in the preceding pages, the square is the more reasonable form to be adopted—at least in the liturgically most important areas—the choir and the transept— which lend themselves to square division with notable ease. In the nave, this was more difficult to obtain, since here the square division conflicted with the narrow intercolumniation inherited from the Early Christian prototype churches. It required a strong personality to move the columns apart to the novel and daring distance of 20 feet, as was done in the Church of the Plan, and thus to express the module in the bodily sequence on the columns. The designer of the Church of Cologne may have struggled with similar ideas (fig. 172), but abandoned the scheme in actual construction (figs. 15-16). 183.B 183.D ADA GOSPELS DIAGRAM SHOWING USE OF SQUARE GRID TRIER, Municipal Library, MS. XXII, fol. 8v MODULAR AREA DIVISION: AN INTRINSIC FEATURE IN THE LAYOUT AND DESIGN OF ILLUMINATED PAGES IN HIBERNO-SAXON AND CAROLINGIAN MANUSCRIPTS The modular bay division that governed the construction of the Germanic house from the first millennium B.C. onward was not the only source for the appearance of modular relationships in Carolingian church architecture. It may, in fact, take second place when weighed against another influence, which reflects an attitude of mind more than a constructional necessity. An organization based on modules is one of the distinguishing features of the layout of the illuminated pages of Hiberno-Saxon and Carolingian manuscripts. Figures 179.A and 179.B show how the artist of the Lindisfarne Gospels set out to decorate the large cruciform page that forms the frontispiece (fol. 2v) to this remarkable book (fig. 178).94 94 Millar, 1923, pl. I; Codex Lindisfarniensis, 1956, fol. 2v. As my analysis is based on photographic reproductions, the validity of these observations must be checked against the original. The principal motif is a square-headed cross framed by a narrow band and decorated internally with a key pattern. In the field between the arms of the cross and the outer frame of the page, there are four panels with step patterns, two square ones on the top, two of oblong shape at the bottom. The background is filled with an intricate design of interlace. The page is framed by a strip of interlaced birds, held in by narrow bands which terminate at each of the four corners in an ornamental knot. An analysis of the construction method used in setting out the design of this page shows that all the basic divisions are multiples of the width of the framing bands. The basic values are 5 · 6 · 7 · 12 (fig. 179.A). The squares of the cross measure 12 · 12; the panels in the fields above and beneath the arms of the cross are 10 · 10 and 10 · 25. I feel certain that a system of linear coordinates, such as is shown in figures 179.A and B, was laid out on the page, by means of either lines or prickings before the artist entered the decorative details. In certain places where the design was very intricate, such as the panels above and under the arms of the cross with their complicated step patterns (fig. 180.A), the illuminator actually drew out the lines with the point of a fine stylus. This is visible on the opposite side of the sheet (fol. 2r) as a grid of delicately protruding ridges (fig. 180.B).95 95 This fact has been observed and pointed out by Millar, 1923, 20-21. The grid is clearly visible in the facsimile edition (Codex Lindisfarniensis, 1956, fol. 2r) from which figure 180.B is taken. I have shown in figures 180.C and D how this system was worked out. First, the illuminator divided the square internally into sixteen subordinate squares by the method of continuous halving. Then he divided each subordinate square into nine base squares through internal tri-section. This furnished him with all the desired linear co-ordinates for the lozenge, cross, and step patterns with which these squares are decorated (fig. 180.A). The same or similar 184.A St. Luke The Ada Gospel portraits of the four evangelists framed by arcades (fols. 15v, 59v, 85v, 127v) depend stylistically on a Late Antique manuscript tradition combining the sculptural corporeality of Roman figure style with touches of Byzantine mannerism. Revived in the art of the Frankish illuminators of the Court School, this tradition merged with the northern concept of organization of space. This first encounter of the two traditions is not reflected in the portrayal of the Ada evangelists, but visibly controls the layout of the surface in which their images are placed. Later, in a synthesis of southern corporeality and northern abstraction that parallels the same development in architecture, these concepts will produce a figure style that, despite strong dependance on classical prototypes, is distinctly medieval (see fig. 185). 184.B ADA GOSPELS (EARLY 9TH CENT.) DIAGRAM SHOWING USE OF SQUARE GRID IN CONSTRUCTION OF ARCH FRAMING TRIER. Municipal Library. MS XXII, fol. 59v methods were used in all other ornamental pages of the manuscript, and also in the layout of the canon tables (fol. 10r-fol. 17r). Figures 182.A, B, and C give an analysis of the design of the great cruciform page on fol. 138v that precedes the Gospel of St. Luke (fig. 181).96 96 Millar, 1923, pl. XXX; Codex Lindisfarniensis, 1956, fol. 138v. This page has as its main motif a cross with T-shaped arms, filled in with a background of interlaced patterns; the spaces around the cross are filled with an animal interlace. The entire decoration of this page is laid out on a system of squares, each side of which is four times the width of the framing band. The page measures thirteen units across and seventeen units up and down. The transverse axis of the cross is laid out in the sequence: 4 · 12 · 4 · 12 · 4 · 12 · 4 the vertical axis in the sequence: 4 · 4 · 4 · 12 · 4 · 12 · 4 · 12 · 4 · 4 · 4 The protruding knots at the corners and in the prolongation of the two intersecting axes of the page are inscribed into a marginal area seven units wide. These principles of modular book design so typical of Hiberno-Saxon art were inherited by the continental Carolingian illuminators. Figures 183.C and D are a design analysis of two of the canon tables of the Ada Gospels, fol. 6v and fol. 8v (figs. 183.A and B).97 97 My analysis is based on the photographs published by Janitschek in 1889. I have had an opportunity to check my observations against the original in Trier and found that my drawings were not reliable in every detail, but not to the extent of invalidating the basic tenets of the theory proposed here. The layout of these tables varies. Some have four arcades, others have three. As in the Lindisfarne Gospels all the internal subdivisions of these pages are calculated as multiples of the width of the framing bands. In both tables the design is suspended in a square grid composed of 4 × 4 base units. On fol. 6v (figs. 183.A and C) the bases of the columns and their interstices are calculated in the sequence: 14 · 2 · 14 · 2 · 14 · 2 · 14 · 2 · 14 the column shafts and their interstices in the sequence: 4 · 12 · 4 · 12 · 4 · 12 · 4 · 12 · 4 The columns are inscribed into a grid of 16 × 19 squares, the arches into a 9 × 19-square grid. The canon arch on fol. 8v (figs. 183.B and D) has only three columns. It is based on the same grid pattern. The bases of the columns are calculated in the sequence: 16 · 4 · 16 · 4 · 16 · 4 · 16 the column shafts and their interstices in the sequence: 4 · 16 · 4 · 16 · 4 · 16 · 4 Figures 184.A and B show that the same method of construction is used in the layout of the arch which frames the figure of St. Mark on fol. 59v of the Ada Gospels.

The Gospel book was presented to Speyer between 1043 and 1046 by Henry III (1038-1056) who (folio 3v) is portrayed with Agnes, his consort, in the act of transmitting the manuscript to Mary, patron saint of the cathedral. Both illuminations are high points in the synthesis of a figurative style rooted in Antiquity, with a medieval propensity for planimetric order and linear simplicity pervading both figurative and geometric components of each picture (rectangle, lozenge, circles, semicircles). Byzantinizing mannerisms (cf. fig. 184) are dropped; the figures have acquired the magnificent blocklike stance that characterizes much of the contemporary sculpture. unit is a square, three times the width of the framing bands. The columnar section is a square, 20 × 20 units; the arch section, an oblong of 9 × 20 units. The square grid affects the layout of the page, but not the design of the figure of the Evangelist. This latter is clearly patterned after a Byzantine model. The conflict between the corporeal emphasis of the classical design, and the tendency of the northern medieval illuminator to subject the borrowed image to linearism and geometricity provoked a developmental dialectic in which the ability to absorb classical influences with increasing strength, in successive stages, is preconditioned by a partial rejection and successful transformation of those absorbed in a preceding phase. In the period of the Romanesque, as a consequence of this dialectic, solutions are obtained in which southern corporeality and northern abstraction enter into a state of balance (fig. 185). In like manner in the field of architecture, southern masonry tradition fuses with northern frame construction in a marriage in which the two component traditions are matched with consummate perfection (fig. 186). The square schematism is the primary organizing agent in this development. It helps to disassemble the large corporeal spaces of the Early Christian basilica, and to arrange its parts in modular sequences that could be vaulted. It determines the take-off points for the rising shafts and arches that were needed to carry the vaults. MODULAR AREA DIVISION: AN INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLE AFFECTING THE CONCEPTUAL ORGANIZATION IN THE RELATIONSHIP OF CHURCH AND STATE It has become a commonplace of historical reference to speak of the "anthropomorphic" character of Greco-Roman and Late Antique art and of the "corporeal" quality of their figurative and spatial composition; and it has been stressed time and again that this quality grows out of a way of thinking that interprets man and his metaphysical environment "in the image of man," a concept so embedded that even Christianity could not rout it. We have not yet found any way of describing or explaining adequately the way of thinking that impelled the medieval illuminators to submit the classical prototypes to relentless abstraction and caused the medieval architects to break up and reassemble their spaces in controlled volumetrical sequences.98 98 I have dealt with a typical expression of this conflict between classical corporeality and medieval abstraction in my article on the Baptistery of Florence; see Horn, 1938, 126ff. Until we have, we shall not be able to understand fully the meaning of such a phenomenon as the square schematism of medieval art or, for that matter, any other schematisms conceptually related to it. Square schematism is an intellectual principle by which formerly existent, yet isolated or only loosely connected parts are brought into an ordered modular relationship. It is a principle of intellectual alignment that strikes far beyond the reality of architecture or book illumination into the realm of literary and musical composition—as Charles W. Jones and Richard D. Crocker have shown in recent studies98a 98a See the articles mentioned above in note 67. —reflect a cultural attitude that may have had a 186. SPEYER CATHEDRAL (1082-1106) [after Dehio, GESCHICHTE DER DEUTSCHEN KUNST, 4th ed., I, 1930, plate vol., figure 63] About 1030, Emperor Konrad II (1029-1039) began to replace the Merovingian cathedral with a new building (Speyer I) whose crypt (dedicated in 1041) became a sepulchral sanctuary for the imperial house. The nave walls of this structure were articulated by a continuous sequence of engaged shafts rising from the floor to the head of the walls. The roof was timbered. The aisles by contrast were covered with shaft-supported and arch-framed groin vaults. During the reign of Emperor Henry IV (1056-1106, or more precisely from about 1082-1106), the design of the aisles was transferred to the nave by the superimposition upon each alternate tier of a second and heavier shaft, and their connection lengthwise and crosswise by means of arches capable of carrying vaults. The view shown above represents the cathedral in the form it had attained at this point (Speyer II). direct effect upon even the organization of the relationships of Church and State, where similar tendencies can be observed at about the same time. An illuminative reflection of this mode of thinking is to be found in Walahfrid Strabo's Libellus de Exordiis, written between 840 and 842. Here secular rulership and ecclesiastical government are brought into a system of modular relationships in which each of the two respective hierarchies is formed by a series of parallel offices: Just as the Roman emperors are said to have been the monarchs of the whole world, so the pontiff of the see of Rome, filling the place of the Apostle Peter, is at the very head of all the church. We may compare archbishops to kings, metropolitans to dukes. What the counts and prefects perform in the secular world, the bishops do in the church. Just as there are praetors or comites palatii who hear the cases of secular men, so there are the men whom the Franks call the highest chaplains who preside over the cases of clerics. The lesser chaplains are just like those whom we call in Gallic fashion the lord's vassals (vassos dominicos).99 99 Translation quoted after Odegaard, 1945, 20-21. For the original text see Walafridi Strabonis libellus de exordiis et incrementis quarundam in observationibus ecclesiasticis rebus, ed. Krause, in Mon. Germ. Hist., Legum II, Capit. II:2, 515-16; "Sicut augusti Romanorum totius orbis monarchiam tenuisse feruntur, ita summus pontifex in sede Romana vicem beati Petri gerens totius ecclesiae apice sublimatur . . . Deinde archiepiscopos . . . regibus conferamus; metropolitanos autem ducibus comparemus . . . Quod comites vel praefecti in seculo, hoc episcopi ceteri in ecclesia explent . . .

Dicti sunt autem primitus cappellani a cappa beati Martini, quam reges Francorum ob adiutorium victoriae in proeliis solebant secum habere, quam ferentes et custodientes cum ceteris sanctorum reliquiis clerici cappellani coeperunt vocari." Like the "disengaged crossing" or the "extended altar square" many of the component parts of this system are old. But the manner in which they were drawn together into a system of homologous parts presaged a development which, two to three centuries later, led to the accomplished and intensely sophisticated metaphysical visions of scholastics. They envisioned the universe as a triad of structurally related hierarchies (fig. 187)—each being an identical image of the other as well as of the system as a whole—that possessed identical subdivisions into triads of ranks, and in each of these triads each subordinate rank corresponded in substance to its equivalent part in every other triad.100 100 The diagram shown in fig. 187 is based on Berthold Vallentin's analysis of William's Liber de Universo, in Gustav Schmoller, Grundrisse und Bausteine zur Staats-und zur Geschichtslehre (Berlin, 1908, 41-120). It was first published in Horn, 1958, 19, fig. 42. SETBACK AND RE-EMERGENCE On the preceding pages I have shown that the square schematism appeared in western architecture neither as 187. WILLIAM OF AUVERGNE. LIBER DE UNIVERSO (1230-1236) HIERARCHIES OF HEAVEN, STATE AND CHURCH [Author's diagrammatic interpretation] Components of this concept are Early Christian; their integration into an all-embracing metaphysical scheme is medieval. Similarities in the institutional organization of Church and State were apparent in the 4th century after the Church began to model its administrative structure after that of the State. Carolingian awareness of this fact is attested by the passage of Walahfrid Strabo quoted above, p. 231. Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite (5th-6th cent.) speculated that the celestial hierarchies of angels and the orders of the Church were parallel. This concept became a central theme of Carolingian theology after a manuscript of Dionysius (presented to Pepin I by Pope Paul in 758) had been translated into Latin by Hilduin of St. Denis. (For more detail see Glossary, s.v. Hierarchy.) HILDESHEIM. ST. MICHAEL'S CHURCH (1010-1033) 188.B 188.A Alternating piers and columns at modular intervals is a leitmotif of Ottonian architecture, but has sporadic Carolingian antecedents in Reichenau-Mittelzell (figs. 117, 134, 171), Werden (Vorromanische Kirchenbauten, 1966-71, 372ff), and the basilica of Solnhofen (see V. Milojcic, Ausgrabungen in Deutschland, II, Mainz, 1975, 278-312). abruptly and nor with as few historical preconditions as was formerly thought. This raises the question: why, once conceived, did it so suddenly disappear, not to re-emerge until almost two centuries later? The answer to this, I think, is relatively simple. The square schematism, in the highly sophisticated and accomplished form, which it attained in the layout of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall, was born within the conceptual framework of a building that had an overall length of no less than 300 feet and for that reason could readily be divided internally into a sequence of 40-foot squares. When in the revisionary textual titles of the Plan it was suggested that the church be reduced to a length of 200 feet and that the columnar interstices be shortened from 20 to 12 feet,101 101 See above, pp. 77-104. the modular order of the original layout was demolished. There is no evidence to suggest that this reduction in size was conditioned by structural or aesthetic considerations. The change occurred as has been shown,102 102 See above, pp. 187-189. at more or less the same time—and probably for the same reasons for which—the abbot of Fulda was deposed for overtaxing the spiritual and economic resources of his monastery with the construction of a church considered by his monks as being outrageously large. In this historical climate the dimensions of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall, as laid down in the drawing, could no longer be considered prototypal. The JUMIÈGES, ABBEY CHURCH (1040-1067) 189.B The red overprinting supplied by the authors on Lanfry's fine drawing indicates where certain scars in the original masonry give evidence of a structural feature now vanished. This is by some interpreted as a simple engaged column rising from floor to clerestory wall-head level, by others as the seat of abutment masonry of diaphragm arches. The controversy requires thorough re-examination through a masonry study made from scaffolds giving access to full height of nave wall. As long as such a study is lacking, and until a structural engineering analysis is made, Ernest Born and I prefer to keep the controversy alive, Born favoring the former and I the latter interpretation. W.H. 189.A SEINE-INFÉRIEURE, FRANCE Masonry scars in its clerestory walls (189.C, 189.D) prove that the nave of this Early Romanesque church was spanned by diaphragm arches rising from engaged columnar shafts attached to every second pier of the nave (begun not before 1052). The square schematism and system of alternating supports of Jumièges clearly derive from Ottonian architecture (fig. 188). Columnar shafts introducing modular division into the nave walls first appeared in the cathedrals of Orléans (990) and Tours (ca. 990-1002) and gained a hold in Germany, after the principle had been established in Speyer I (1030-1061). Jumièges goes further than Speyer through use of diaphragm arches that carry modular division of nave walls transversely across the space. Diaphragm arches had previously been used in the abbey church of Nivelles (1000-1046) and the cathedral of Trier (1016-1047). After Jumièges (1052-1067) they are found in other Norman churches: St. Vigor-de-Bayeux (ca. 1060), Cérizy-la-Foret (ca. 1080), St. Gervaise-de-Falaise (ca. 1100-1123), and St. Georges-de-Boscherville (after 1114). They become fashionable even in distant Italy: San Pier Scheraggio in Florence (ca. 1050-1086), Lomello (1060?) and the magnificent San Miniato in Florence (ca. 1070-ca. 1150). In all these churches the diaphragm arches were placed at intervals too large to allow vaulting between them. This step, the last in development of the medieval bay system, was made in Speyer II (fig. 190). 189.C SOUTH WALL OF NAVE Southwest view (toward the Seine and the quarry site for the stones of Jumièges, showing clerestory windows. Originally the nave of the church was covered by an open timber roof, which in 1688-92 was concealed under a vaulted wooden ceiling supported by sculptured brackets and foliated capitals inserted on sill level of the clerestory windows. On this occasion scars were left in clerestory walls through the removal of some feature, which some believe to have been a diaphragm arch (Pfitzer, Michon, Horn) and others a simple engaged column (Martin Du Gard, Lanfry, Born). 189.D DETAIL A close view shows one of the masonry scars left on the inner face of the clerestory walls when the original feature for which it formed a seating was removed, to make room for a vaulted 17th-century ceiling. It is the narrowness and shallowness of these scars, as well as the height and thinness of the clerestory walls, that induced earlier scholars to discard the assumption of diaphragm arches. Against this view it can be argued that for roughly two-thirds of their total height, the nave walls are externally buttressed by the gallery vaults of the church; and that along the lines where the scars occur, the clerestory is externally reinforced by engoged buttresses rising from the galleries to clerestory wall-head level. For a good summary of the controversy, see Michon-Du Gard, 1927. 47-54. SPEYER CATHEDRAL (1082-1106) 190.B 190.A [redrawn by Ernest Born after plans by Dehio, Geschichte der Deutschen Kunst, 3rd ed., plate vol. I, figs. 68-69; Kubach and Haas, 1972, pl. 9; and Conant, 1959, 75, fig. 22] The great conceptual leap from Early to High Romanesque architecture was made by introducing continuous sequences of arch-framed vaults springing from shafts that reached from floor to head of clerestory walls. Modularity, now embodied in an armature of architectural members pervading and framing space in all directions, thus acquired its fully medieval form. The Ottonian "box-space" was transformed into the bay-divided medieval space. The Gothic changed the vocabulary, but not the fundamental concept of space. A basilica of magnificent longitudinal sweep and breathtaking verticality (70m. long, over 30m. high), Speyer was the first full embodiment of this principle of composing churches in continuous sequences of clearly definable modular units of space. grandiose scale of the original concept had received a shattering blow in the neo-asceticism of the monastic reform movement, and, in consequence, was abandoned. The political chaos that followed the reign of Louis the Pious offered no opportunities for a return to the earlier concepts. Their renascence had to await the political and economic consolidation that was brought about in Germany by the house of the Saxon kings, and in France by the rising power and importance of the dukes of Normandy that peaked in the conquest of England. The steps that lead to the re-emergence of square schematism in Ottonian and Norman architecture are well known and need not be reiterated. They are marked by such highlights of medieval architecture as St. Michael's Church at Hildesheim, 1010-1033 (fig. 188); the Abbey Church of Jumièges, 1040-1061 (fig. 189); and the second stage of the imperial cathedral of Speyer, ca. 1080-1106 (figs. 186 and 190). St. Michael's at Hildesheim had a total length of 230 feet and was internally composed of a sequence of seven modules 30 feet square plus an apse with a radius of 20 feet (fig. 188).103 103 For further details on this see Beseler-Roggenkamp, 1954, 129ff. One could not wilfully construct a more convincing mirror-image of the modular square division of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall (figs. 61 and 173). I do not know of the existence of any accurate measurement studies of the Abbey Church of Jumièges (10401067). But from the plans of Martin du Gard104 104 Martin du Gard, 1909, pl. II; Michon and Martin du Gard, 1927. and of Lanfry105 105 Lanfry, 1954, pl. IV. one gains the impression that it might have been based on a modular sequence of 35-foot squares, four of those composing the nave, one the crossing, one the fore choir, and one half the apse, for a total of six and one-half squares. Whether or not the renascence of these modular concepts at Hildesheim and Jumièges has any direct connection with the Plan of St. Gall is impossible to say. The discussion of this subject has suffered from the fact that until very recently the square schematism even of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall had been questioned.106 106 See above, pp. 212ff. Yet the similarities can hardly be overlooked. As in the Church of the Plan of St. Gall (fig. 61), so in Hildesheim and in Jumièges the general dimensions of the principal spaces were calculated as multiples of the crossing square. In both of these churches this modular division was aesthetically underscored by a rhythmical alternation of light supports with heavy supports, the latter marking the corners of the module, the former rising in the interstices between them. The system has two isolated Carolingian precursors in the abbey churches of Werden (dedicated 804)107 107 On the church of Ludgerus in Werden see Effmann, 1899, 131ff. and Reichenau-Mittelzell (consecrated in 816)108 108 On Reichenau-Mittelzell see Reisser, 1960, 36ff and fig. 289. but becomes a governing principle of style only in the Ottonian period, starting with the abbey church of Gernrode (961-965)109 109 On the abbey church of Gernrode see Grodecki, 1958, 24 and the literature cited ibid., 40 note 19. and leading from there in successive steps of refinement through the magnificent series Hildesheim110 110 On St. Michael's in Hildesheim see Beseler-Roggenkamp, 1954. —Jumièges—Speyer. A feature of primary developmental implications—completely overlooked in all authoritative studies on the Abbey Church of Jumièges—were the great diaphragm arches that spanned the nave crosswise, rising from shafts attached to every alternate pier.111 111 It is hard for me to understand that this fact should have been so consistently overlooked in the entire authoritative literature on the Abbey Church of Jumièges (Ruprich-Robert, 1889; Martin du Gard, 1909; Lanfry, 1954; Michon alone dissenting in 1927). The evidence of the once existing transverse arches is deeply engraved into the masonry of the two clerestory walls and unmistakable. Even the latest discussion of the church (Vallery-Radot, 1969, 132ff and Musset, 1972, 113-19) entirely disregards the problem of diaphragm arches, although a foolproof case for their existence had already been made in a study by C. Pfitzner published in 1933 (Pfitzner, 1933, 161). Aesthetically this is a first attempt to visually connect the alternating support articulation of the nave walls with the aid of a bold transverse member reaching full width across the space of the nave as well as full height into the roof of the structure. The diaphragm arch has been variously derived from Roman,112 112 Torres-Balbas, 1960, 26. Syrian,113 113 Ruprich-Robert, I, 1884, 53. Mohammedan,114 114 Puig i Cadafalch, III, 1918, 511. and Italian115 115 Krautheimer, 1942, 22. sources; but its prototype is much closer at hand; in the masonry arches that frame the area of intersection in churches with nave and transept of equal height, and establish in the transepts of these churches a modular cross division of space that precedes that of the nave by centuries (Church of the Plan of St. Gall, 816-17; Hildebold's Cathedral of Cologne, after 800 and before 819; and perhaps even the abbey church of St. Riquier, 790-799).116 116 For Hildebold's cathedral at Cologne see above, pp. 27ff; for the abbey church of St. Riquier, above, pp. 169, 209, and 221. The ultimate prototype of the diaphragm arch is, of course, the triumphal arch of the Early Christian basilica117 117 "I suggest that the triumphal arch of the Early Christian basilica and Carolingian church was the prototype for the diaphragm arches in the nave proper. A diaphragm arch is, after all, only a triumphal arch which has migrated to the nave of the church. Why go to Syria for a prototype when one exists only a few feet away?" (Roger Cushing Aiken in a graduate seminar report presented at Berkeley in the Spring Quarter of 1970). The surprising thing about this observation is that it does not seem to have been made before. and the testing ground for its migration from the transept into the longitudinal body of the church are the aisles, where precocious modular cross division by means of transverse arches appear as early as the beginning of the ninth century (Werden-on-the-Ruhr, dedicated by Bishop Ludger in 804 and Reichenau-Mittelzell, consecrated by Bishop Haito in 816). The transept of the Cathedral of Speyer looks as though it might have been conceived as a triad of 50-foot squares.118 118 I am not aware of the existence of any reliable measurement studies concerning the Cathedral of Speyer, and am only making a speculation. For recent analysis of the masonry and construction sequence of Speyer see the articles of Kubach, Christ and Bornheim in Festschrift, "900 Jahre Kaiserdom zu Speyer," ed. Ludwig Stamer, Speyer, 1961, and also the comprehensive treatment of Speyer by Kubach and Haas in Die Kunstdenkmäler von Rheinland-Pfalz, 3 vols., Berlin and Munich, 1972; and Kubach, Der Dom zu Speyer, Darmstadt, 1972. The spacing of the piers in the original building (Speyer I, constructed between 1030 and 1061) did not perpetuate these dimensions; and when the nave, between 1080 and 1106 (Speyer II) was covered by groin vaults, mounted on arches rising from shafts attached to every alternate pier, this resulted in a sequence of oblongs rather than squares. This variance in modular shape and size is an impurity of minor importance; the epochal historical advance achieved in Speyer was that the modular division of the ground floor was here, for the first time, embodied in an all-pervasive system of shafts and arches that divided the space lengthwise and crosswise as well as in its entire height into a modular sequence of clearly definable cells or bays. Once this point was reached, the walls between the rising shafts and arches could be perforated—and were in fact transformed progressively into that intensely skeletal armature of shafts and arches that led to the formation of the Gothic. The self-contained and divisive vaults that covered the bays of Romanesque and Gothic churches—firmly set off against each other by their strong relief of framing arches and ribs—were bound to strengthen the modular organization of the spaces they covered. Yet they cannot by any stretch of imagination be interpreted as a technical precondition of that concept. Modular area division—as has been made abundantly clear by the examples here cited— preceded modular vault construction by centuries and reached far beyond the realm of architecture into the layout of the decorative pages of Christian service books. It has its roots in a cultural frame of mind, not in technical conditions. 190.X GENOELS-ELDEREN DIPTYCH 190.Y Shown same size as original BRUSSELS. MUSÉES ROYAUX D'ART ET D'HISTOIRE [by courtesy of the Musées Royaux] The monumentality of architecture in concept, execution, and fabric may tend to overwhelm the scale of, and make distant, those objects that men once handled and used in their daily pursuits. Tools, books, jewelry, harness trappings, weapons, liturgical objects—with few exceptions they are gone from us. The survivors, many of them precious then, as now, lie in museums, remote from the purposes of their makers and rendered exotic by their scarcity. Thus, the integration in spirit of such intimate objects with monuments of architecture is somewhat difficult to achieve. The many handicrafts that provided embellishment to daily life in a monastic community such as was proposed by the Plan of St. Gall, has been but lightly touched upon in this study. That works of art and adornment were important to the community is undisputed. The Plan has accommodations for making weapons and associated equipment, saddlery and presumably other harness tack, and goldsmithing. Silversmiths, lapidaries, and enamellers may have worked with armourer and swordsmith. These crafts were housed with other facilities for more ordinary work, in a pair of buildings in the southwestern tract of the presumed site. Lay artisans were intended to reside in the community, as is evidenced by comprehensive housing provided in the Plan. Crafts that enhanced the praise of God by ornamentation of books, vestments, and liturgical objects to assist in worship, were proper activities for monks. Most notable were manuscript copying and illumination, and ivory carving was likely among them. It is not referred to specifically on the Plan of St. Gall, probably because its execution did not require special facilities such as forges, smelters, and a welter of noisy tools. The work of the ivory carver, silent and delicate, often closely connected with all aspects of bookmaking, could be done in a scriptorium, in company with scribes and illuminators. The illustrated book cover is closely related to illuminations of the Godescalc Gospels (781-783), earliest of the Court School manuscripts. It has the same flatness of relief, the same delicate linearity, clearly distinguishing it from the softly rounded forms and classicizing drapery style of the later ivories of this school. The model must have been an Early Christian ivory of Coptic or Syrian origin and representing a style widely diffused in Merovingian Europe. The front cover of the diptych shows Christ standing on the asp and basilisk, flanked by two angels. The back cover displays the Annunciation (upper register) and Visitation (lower register). Both covers are pieced from several ivory plaques of different sizes. The work is perforated and may have been mounted on a foil of gold leaf. The eyes are inlaid lapis; interlace and step-patterns of the frames are clearly influenced by insular art and stand in strong contrast to the perspective illusionism of the two scenes.

MONKS' CLOISTER, THE CHURCH AND ADJACENT BUILDINGS When St. Cuthbert built himself a hermitage on Farne Island, where he spent the last eleven years of his life in solitary retreat, he surrounded his living space "with a wall higher than a man standing upright," and further increased its relative height "by cutting away the living rock so that the pious inhabitant could see nothing except the sky from his dwelling, thus restraining both the lust of the eyes and the thoughts and lifting the whole bent of his mind to higher things" (Bede, ed. Colgrave, 1940, 214-17). The Plan of St. Gall achieves a like effect for an entire community in the sophisticated layout of the cloister with its egress and ingress governed by a body of rigid laws, the open inner court being the monks' only access to nature and sun—a controlled and ordered island of nature with judiciously selected and carefully tended plants: PARADISUS CLAUSTRALIS. END OF PART II</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III THE CLOISTERS AND THE ABBOT'S HOUSE III. 1 THE CLOISTER OF THE MONKS (III.1.1) LAYOUT IN proposing that a monastery should "be so arranged that all necessary things, such as water, mill, garden, and various crafts may be within the enclosure,"1 1 Benedicti regula, chap. 66; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 156; ed. McCann, 1952, 152-53; ed. Steidle, 1952, 320. St. Benedict made the monastery economically independent of the secular world. The administration of the self-sufficient estates which emerged from this concept, however, brought into the monastic community a host of seculars, whose very presence threatened to subvert the monastic ideal of seclusion from the world and its preoccupations. As the monastery came structurally to resemble a large manorial estate, monastic integrity demanded the creation of an inner enclosure that would isolate the brothers from the serfs and the laymen and, at the same time, make it possible for the latter to live as close to the brothers as their tasks required. Creating a cloister answered this problem. It established a monastery within the monastery. Moreover in meeting the complex needs of monastic living, it created an architectural scheme that added to the glorious history of the colonnaded classical court a new, and perhaps its most accomplished, embodiment. The cloister is the monastic enclosure which serves as living, eating, working, and sleeping quarters for the monks (figs. 191, 192, 193).2 2 It is clearly defined as such by Hildemar of Corbie (845-850): "Notandum est quia talis debet esse claustra monasterii, ubi monachus ea quae necessaria sunt valeat exercere, id est consuere, lectioni vacare et rel., et ubi custodia possit esse." (Hildemari Expositio regulae; ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 613). In its fully developed form it consists of a large square yard attached to the southern flank of the church, entirely surrounded by a covered walk, and enclosed on the three other sides by a solid range of large (usually double-storied) structures laid out so as to form a solid architectural enclosure. This ensemble of buildings comprises, in addition to the dormitory and refectory of the monks, a warming room, a cellar, a larder, a storeroom for the monks' clothing, and various smaller dependencies, such as a privy, a bath and wash house, a kitchen, and a bake and brew house. Except for the times when he worked the fields or helped to reap the harvest, or those rare occasions when he was away on journeys, the entire life of the monk was spent in this enclosure. The origin of the layout of this well-ordered and symmetrical architectural scheme is as yet not clarified, since many of the intermediary forms of its development are missing.3 3 A comprehensive treatment of the architectural remains of Early Christian monasteries in the Near East does not exist. For summary reviews see Bernheimer, 1939, 660ff, and Sowers, 1951, 128-86; for a discussion of individual buildings: Voguë, 1865-1277, passim; Butler, 1929, passim, and Tchalenko, I, 1953, 145-82. Since this chapter was written, I have dealt with the question of the origins of the medieval cloister more extensively in three articles (see Bibliography, Horn 1973, 1974 and below, p. 245 n7). It has been connected with the peristyle court of the Greek house, the colonnaded atrium of the Roman house, the monumental galleried atria of the large Early Christian churches, and certain semi-galleried courts attached to the flanks of Syrian churches. In one way or another, all these forms may have shared in its formation. It is obvious that the concept of an open galleried court with living units around it, is a Mediterranean one. The ubiquitous character of this motif in the Greek and Roman world needs no further comment. It is equally clear that the concept of double-storied masonry structures, exhibited in the primary claustral structures (Dormitory, Refectory, and Cellar) has its roots in Rome, and not in the vernacular architectural tradition of the Franks. The consummate order and symmetry characterizing the claustral scheme was, in its ultimate form, classical and had little to do with the scattered layout of the contemporary northern manor. But after full allowance is made for these classical influences, it is equally clear that nothing quite like the layout of a medieval cloister existed in antiquity. The medieval cloister differs from the Hellenistic peristyle and the colonnaded Roman atrium in that it is not a court enclosed by a dwelling, but rather an aggregate of edifices, so arranged as to form a solid architectural frame around a court. From the atria of the large Early Christian basilicas, to which it is related in design and in size, it differs in function. The Early Christian atrium was a large formal plaza for the reception of the worshiping crowd; it was never meant to form the nucleus of a cadre of dwellings. In Syria here and there we find monastic courts attached to the flanks of the church—and these courts may indeed be one of the germinal prototype forms of the medieval claustrum—but unlike the later medieval cloister, in Syrian monasteries the open courts were in general not enclosed by buildings on all four sides. Often these courts were not even square, but L-shaped, or of irregular, and undefinable shape, with vast openings between the houses of the monks giving free access to other segments of the monastery grounds. There are, nonetheless, two notable exceptions: the convent of SS. Sergios and Bacchos at Umm-is-Surab and the convent of Id-Dêr, both in Southern Syria. In the former (fig. 193) the monas- p. 146 tery church (489 A.D.) had attached to its northern flank a symmetrical range of residential buildings with a paved court in the middle "colonnaded on all sides in two stories and completely surrounded by rooms, large and small, in one or two stories, about twenty in all, forming an ideal monastic establishment."4 4 On Umm-is-Surab, see Butler, 1929, 85; on Id-Dêr, ibid., 85-86. In the latter (fig. 194) also of fifth century date, the church had in front of it a great open atrium, with colonnaded apartments in two stories symmetrically ranged around three sides of the court, plus a connecting colonnaded porch along the facade of the church. Although there is no tangible archaeological evidence to support such a conjecture, it is entirely possible that together with the more common open plan of the Syrian cloister, the closed and highly symmetrical schemes of Umm-is-Surab and of Id-Dêr may also have found their way into Western Europe. If they did, however, these schemes would have found themselves in oppressive competition with the infinitely more common lavra system adopted by the monks of Lerins, and diffused throughout the entire pre-Carolingian West by the Irish mission which professed to the same ideals of anchoritic withdrawal and individualistic piety. To combat, repress, and eventually wholly supersede this powerful tradition depended on the rejection of the scattered and semi-hermitic forms of living of the Irish monks in favor of the highly controlled and ordered form of communal living prescribed by St. Benedict. The evolution of this concept required first and above all that the formerly scattered houses of the monks be brought together into an ordered architectural system, which in turn could be merged with the concept of the colonnaded classical court. The creation of a tightly closed monastic range of buildings, however, was only a part of the total need. The same ordering genius that led to the invention of an inner enclosure for the monks was also to be applied to the layout for the cloisters of the novices and the sick, as well as to the problem of meaningful interrelation of these three nuclear monastic blocks with the other indispensable monastic installations: facilities for the reception of visitors, houses and workshops for the craftsman and serfs, and houses for the monastic livestock and their keepers. It is possible that the ultimate crystallization of this scheme does not antedate the reign of Charlemagne. Its adoption depended on the abolishment, through binding acts of legislation, of the mixed forms of monastic living that prevailed in pre-Carolingian times, and their replacement by the single, exclusive and universally binding rule of St. Benedict. This striving toward uniformity of custom had been from the outset a prime objective of the ecclesiastical policy of Charlemagne. It became again, under Louis the Pious an overriding goal of the monastic movement, as evidenced in the legislation issued at the two synods held at Aachen in 816 and 817. To presume, however, that the "Plan of an ideal City for Monks" that emerged from these efforts was a product wholly of the Carolingian reform movement may be stretching the point. The individual elements and many of their combinations are of a considerably earlier date, but the consummate order of the scheme, its binding perfection that was to affect the entire future course of monastic planning may have been dependent on the codification of certain details in the relation of monks to serfs, which was not undertaken prior to the two synods of Aachen.5 5 See in particular my remarks on the transfer of houses for the workmen and craftsmen from an extramural to an intramural location as directed in chap. 5 of the first synod, and Bishop Haito's commentary thereto; above, p. 23. The novelty of this concept is thrown into full relief when it is compared to the monastic settlements which the Irish holy men established during the sixth and seventh centuries in relatively inaccessible and often hostile places of Ireland and western England. III.1.2 THE "SCATTERED" PLAN OF THE EARLY IRISH MONASTERIES These early Irish monasteries were usually set up in a circular or ovoid enclosure surrounded by a wall of stone or earth with a ditch outside—not very different in appearance from the old Iron Age ring forts (the so-called cashels) many of which in fact appear to have been taken over by the Irish missionaries and converted into monastery sites.6 6 On Irish monasticism and early monastic settlements see Leask, I, 1955, 5ff and Paor, 1958, 49ff. Within such an enclosure there was a church, in general of very modest dimensions, and loosely scattered around it, without any fixed architectural order, the beehive huts for the monks, as a rule inhabited by two, occasionally by more—as well as a place for eating, a guest house, a kitchen, and a school. When the community outgrew the size of its original church, rather than replacing it by a new and larger one, the monks added another church and yet another one if further growth demanded it. Since the majority of these buildings were constructed in timber, they have left no visual record whatsoever; and if it were not for the fact that on the isolated and wind-swept islands off the west coast of Ireland trees and thatch were not available, the monks thereby being forced to build in stone, we would live in total ignorance of the layout of these early monastery sites. The best preserved among these stone-built monasteries is the cashel of Inishmurray Island, off the Sligo coast (fig. 195). It consisted of an egg-shaped enclosure measuring internally about 175 feet in length and 135 feet in breadth, The enclosure was formed by a dry-built masonry wall that varied at its base in thickness from 7 to 15 feet and rose to a height of well over 13 feet. It shelters the remains of three rectangular oratories of modest size, a circular school house and two beehive huts. To complete the original appearance of this settlement, one would have to add to the reconstruction shown in figure 195 a few more dwellings for monks as well as buildings indispensable for community use, such as a refectory and a kitchen, which have left no trace on the site. Monasteries of this type—or to be more precise, their timbered equivalents—must have been a common sight in sixth- and seventh-century Ireland and England as well as at all of those places on the continent where Irish missionaries established new monastic communities. It must have been that same type of settlement with monastic dwellings loosely dispersed around an oratory that St. Columban and St. Gall had founded at the upper end of Lake Constance and that sprang up in the wilderness of the upper Steinbach river, where after Columban's departure for Italy, St. Gall had formed a cell that in the centuries to follow was to become one of the greatest Carolingian monasteries. Irish monasticism, like that of the Egyptian and Syrian monks of the desert after which it was modelled, was based upon the concept of individual self-discipline of holy men living either as hermits or in loosely connected groups. The architectural layout of the Irish monastery mirrors this fact as clearly as the ordered architectural enclosure of the Benedictine monastery reflects the highly organized community life established by the Rule of St. Benedict. III.1.3 FIRST APPEARANCE OF THE SQUARE CLOISTER Precisely at what time it became customary that the cloister yard should assume the form of a galleried square, attached on one side to the flank of the church and on the 192. PLAN OF ST. GALL. PRINCIPAL CLAUSTRAL STRUCTURES &amp; THE MONKS' CLOISTER Cutaway Perspective. Authors' Interpretation Three double-storied masonry buildings solidly enclosing an open yard are attached to the southern flank of the Church, and are connected at ground level by the covered arcaded walks of the cloister. The east structure contains the Warming Room, below, and the Monks' Dormitory, above. From its southern gable wall an exit leads to the Monks' Privy on the upper level, and at ground level another leads to their Laundry and Bathhouse. The south structure contains on ground level the Monks' Refectory and above it their Vestiary. From its western gable wall an exit leads to the Monks' Kitchen at ground level. The west structure contains on ground level the cellar, and above it, the Larder. On the Plan itself (fig. 191), although the Dormitory layout is actually drawn on ground level, an inscription makes clear that it is to be located in the second story. The Plan does not show any stairs between floors. We make no attempt here to correct this shortcoming by supplying features to which the designer himself chose to make no committment. By suppressing stairs he not only was able to keep his design uncluttered, but also emphasized that wherever, in the process of construction, stairs were to be installed they should be located so as not to interfere with arrangements which he considered to be of more vital concern: Dormitory bed layout, Refectory bench and table layout, Cellar barrel layout—all worked out with great care, in full consideration of the number of monks to be served by these respective structures, and the volume of wine and beer to be stored (see below: Dormitory, pp. 250, 342; Refectory, p. 286 and Fig. 211; Cellar, pp. 296-303). Not disregard, but rather a choice between details of primary and secondary importance, induced the designer to suppress stairs. In so choosing he arrived with depth of technical insight and wise restraint at a solution, at once ingeniously simple and equally sophisticated, to the special task facing him: namely, assembling on a single drafted plan all essential information needed to construct the forty-odd buildings of which a paradigmatic monastery of his period was to be composed. other three sides enclosed by a continuous range of buildings, is impossible to say in view of our almost total ignorance about the layout of transalpine monasteries in the critical period of transition from the Irish to the Roman Benedictine rule.7 7 Since this chapter was written, I have dealt with the question of the first appearance of the square or U-shaped cloister in the article, "On the Origins of the Medieval Cloister," Gesta XII (1973), 13-52. The conclusions offered state that despite the sporadic appearance of four-cornered cloisters in certain Early Christian monasteries of Syria (Umm-is-Surab, Id-Dêr), the U-shaped cloister with its galleried porches and its monastic houses ranged peripherally around them is an invention of the Age of Charlemagne. Its development was dependent, for one, on the rejection of the semi-eremitic forms of living of the Irish monks in favor of the highly controlled and ordered forms of communal living prescribed by St. Benedict. The U-shaped form also answered the necessity of separating the monks' living quarters from those of the monastery's serfs and workmen, who entered an economic symbiosis when the monastery acquired the structure of a vast manorial estate in the new agricultural society that arose north of the Alps (Horn, op. cit., 47-48). The cloister of the famous Abbey of St. Riquier, built under Abbot Angilbert from 790-799 (figs. 196-197),8 8 See Effman, 1912, 1ff, 9ff, and Durand, 1911, 137ff. had the shape of an obtuse triangle which shows that even late in the eighth century the square had as yet not been established as an obligatory form. Its dimensions likewise are far from conforming to any recognizable standards; for the longer side of this triangle had the extraordinary length of 984 feet, the two shorter ones of 705 feet and 525 feet.9 9 See Durand, loc. cit. An early transalpine case of a square-shaped cloister, by contrast, is the early Carolingian monastery of Lorsch p. 252 (figs. 198-199), built by Bishop Chrodegang, its first abbot, between 760-774.10 10 See Behn, 1934, 17-20. The buildings of this settlement, as its excavator Friedrich Behn points out, were not a new creation but a conversion to monastic use of the villa of a Frankish nobleman, laid out in the tradition of the Roman villa rustica. Its galleried court formed a square of approximately 70 × 75 feet, and hence was considerably larger than the atrium of the average Roman villa rustica. Contrary to later monastic preference the church was located along the southern side of the court, presumably for special topographical reasons, namely because on this side the monastery bordered on an ancient Roman road. The east side and the west side of the square were taken up by two oblong buildings, corresponding to the later dormitory and cellar. The north side, as in most of the Roman prototype villas, was only closed in by the galleried porch that formed the northern cloister walk. That a Frankish farmhouse, built in the Roman tradition, could be converted into a Benedictine monastery without substantial alterations bears witness to the close conceptual relationship of the Carolingian cloister plan with that of the Roman villa rustica. The countryside of the former Roman provinces of Germany and Gaul abounded with such buildings and many of these may still have been in use during the early Carolingian period. When the monastery of Lorsch was rebuilt on higher ground on a neighboring site between 784 and 804 (figs. p. 254 200-201), the new cloister yard was attached to the p. 255 southern flank of the new church, and masonry buildings were placed peripherally around the three remaining sides of the yard. This is the form that was chosen by the author of the layout of the paradigmatic monastery shown on the Plan of St. Gall. Richbold's monastery of Lorsch shares with the layout of the latter another important feature. Its cloister measures 100 by 100 Carolingian feet (34 m. by 34 m.), proportions which in the ninth century appear to have acquired an almost canonical value. As we are talking about the conceptual relationship between the layout of a square-shaped monastic cloister range with a galleried court and that of the Roman villa rustica, we must not lose sight of another possibility heretofore overlooked, namely, the likelihood of an influence from the ruins of judiciary Roman basilicas. Many of these had attached to one of their long sides a galleried court of considerable size completely surrounded by shops. A double-apsed basilica of this type was excavated around 1880 by J. G. Joyce, in the Romano-British city of Silchester (fig. 202), and another one more recently in the Gallo-Roman city of Augst, in Switzerland.11 11 On Silchester, see J. G. Joyce, 1881, 344-65, and above, p. 200. On the basilica of Augst, see Reinle, 1965, 34 and above, p. 200. The type must have been very common in the transalpine provinces of Rome, and their remains may still have been visible in many parts of the empire at the time of Charlemagne. III.1.4 CLOISTER YARD The Cloister Yard is attached to the southern flank of the Church (fig. 203). It consists of an open inner court surrounded on all sides by galleried porches, through which the monks must pass in order to move from one of their three principal claustral structures to another. The claustral range connects with the Church, on ground floor level, through a door in the southern transept and, on the level of the Dormitory, through a night stair used primarily in connection with the services held at night or at dawn. The official "exit and entry" (exitus and introitus) to the Cloister is the so-called Parlour, a narrow and somewhat elongated room, located between the Church and the Cellar. Permission to enter this room for conversation with visiting friends or relatives, or to pass beyond the barrier of its carefully controlled passages into the outer monastery grounds or into the secular world can only be granted by the abbot, and only for the specific needs, such as labour in the workshops, garden and fields, or the rare occurrence of a journey to another monastery conducted in the common interest of the abbey. In all other respects the cloister of the monks is hermetically sealed off from the world around it by the continuous UMM-IS-SURAB, SOUTHERN SYRIA 193.C 193.B CONVENT OF SS. SERGIOS AND BACCHOS (489) [after Butler, 1929, 47, fig. 45] The only extant Early Christian example of a monastery with claustral layout similar to that which became standard in the Carolingian period: a four-cornered open court surrounded by galleried porches and a continuous enclosure of apartments—the whole attached to one flank of the church. Both apartments and cloister walks are of two stories, and beneath the open court lies a coextensive cistern with transverse arches carrying the pavement of the court. The cloister is entered through a vestibule in the center of its east range. Another in the middle of its south range connects with the church. The relatively small apart- ments suggest that the monks slept in groups of ten or twenty rather than in a common dormitory, as was the case in Carolingian times. 193.A bulk of masonry formed by the Church and the three principal claustral ranges. DIMENSIONS In his commentary to the Rule of St. Benedict, written in Civate between 845 and 850, Hildemar of Corbie remarks that the cloister of a monastery should be "large enough so that the monks can attend to all of their chores without finding cause for murmur, yet not so grand as to invite them to spend their time in gossip" (Nec debet esse ista parva, ut cum aliquid vult operari monachus, occasionem invenerit murmurandi propter parvitatem, nec ita debet esse ampla, ut ibi occasionem possit invenire fabulandi cum aliquo).12 12 Expositio Hildemari; ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 613. And in a subsequent paragraph he adds the important piece of information that in his day, "It is generally held that a cloister should be 100 feet square, and not less, because that would make it too small; however if you should wish to make it larger this is permissible" (Dicunt multi, quia claustra monasterii centum pedes debent habere in omni parte, minus non, quia parva est; si autem velis plus, potest fieri).13 13 Ibid., 183. The cloister yard of St. Gall complies with this rule (figs. 69 and 203). It measures 100 feet p. 100 from west to east, and 102½ feet from south to north. It p. 257 contains in its center an open space 75 feet square, and all around it a galleried walk. THE PUZZLE OF THE SAVIN PLANT The yard, which was perhaps covered with grass, is intersected by four paths (quattuor semitae p transuersum claustri) that emerge from the middle of each cloister walk and terminate in a square enclosure decorated in the center with a circle, designated sauina, and four branch-like symbols extending from the circle outward into the corners of the square. Savina or savin are common names for Juniperus sabina, a low, spreading shrub or small tree of Mediterranean origin that was introduced in Germany and France in pre-Carolingian times and from there its horticultural use was extended to England.14 14 In German Sevenbaum, Sebenbaum, Sadebaum; in Anglo-Saxon safine; in Old French savine (see Kluge, 1957, 696). See Fischer-Benzon 1894, 80; Sörrensen in Studien, 1962, 197. Willis' interpretation of savina as "tub, either for water or for plants" (Willis, 1848, 100) is untenable. The mistake was inherited by Leclercq (Cabrol-Leclercq, 1924, col. 98) and others. A profusely illustrated Byzantine copy of the famous Herbal of Dioscurides displays a delicate drawing of this tree (fig. 204).15 15 Vienna, National Library, Ms. Med. Gr. 1, fol. 84r. The manuscript, written and illustrated in 512, is now available in a precious fascimile edition. See Dioskurides, Complete fascimile edition, I, 1966, fol. 84r. The leaves of this plant p. 258 are poisonous and today, for that reason, the savin appears to be barred from public parks.16 16 Thus according to Fischer-Benzon, loc. cit. and Sörrensen, loc. cit. yet without further reference. My colleague Lincoln Constance informs me that all junipers have some medicinal properties, particularly of a diuretic nature, that, with injudicious use, could be poisonous, but finds nothing in the botanical literature available to him to indicate that Juniperus sabina is poisonous enough to warrant its exclusion from horticultural planting. Junipers would be poisonous only upon ingestion, not upon contact, and they are far from enticing to human nibblers. Yet in the Middle Ages, as well as in classical Roman times it was used for a variety of medical cures. Dioscurides, writing in the first century A.D., informs us that applied as a poultice the leaves of the savin tree stop spreading ulcers and soothe boils, mixed with honey they cause carbuncles to break; drunk with wine they draw out the blood by urine and draw off the foetus.17 17 For the Greek text see Pedani Dioscoridis Anazarbei De materia medica libri quinque, cap. 104, ed. Curtius Spregel. Leipzig, 1829, 104-105. The full passage, as translated by my colleague W. Kendrick Pritchett reads as follows: "On savin (brathu). Brathu, some call it barathron, others baryton, still others baron. The Romans call it Herba sabina. There are two kinds of it. The one is like to the cypress in its leaves, but more prickly and of more oppressive smell, pungent, fiery. The tree is stunted and is diffused rather into breadth. Some use the leaves as a perfume. The other kind is like to the tamarisk in its leaves. The leaves of both stop spreading ulcers and soothe boils when applied as a poultice. Likewise, they remove blackness and uncleanness when applied as with honey, and they cause carbuncles to break. Drunk with wine they draw out the blood through the urine, and draw off the foetus. They do the same whether by being applied or by being burnt for fumigation. They are mixed also with calorific unguents, especially the must (new wine)." For less comprehensible translations into English and German made in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries see The Greek Herbal of Dioscurides, ed. Goodyer 1655, 54-56 and Kräuterbuch, ed. Danzius-Uffenbach, 1610, 47. More recent sources attest their use as a cure against the spread of intestinal worms, primarily for cattle, a purpose to which this herb is applied even today by the peasants of Southern and Central Germany.18 18 Fischer-Benzon, loc. cit.; Sörrensen, loc. cit. The savin is one of the plants prescribed in the Capitulare de villis as obligatory for the gardens of Carolingian crown estates.19 19 Capitulare de villis, chap. 37, ed. Gareis, 1895, 63. For more details on this source see below, pp. 33ff. It is also mentioned in the Brevium exempla amongst the plants grown in the royal fisc of Treola.20 20 Brevium exempla, chap. 37, ed. Boretius, 1883, 256. For more details on this source, see below, pp. 36ff. In ID-DÊR, MONASTERY, SOUTHERN SYRIA, 5TH CENT. 194.B 194.A [after Butler, 1929, 88, fig. 91] "The most dignified, and most symmetrically planned of the monastic institutions of Syria" (Butler, 1929, 85-85) now lies in ruins, deserted. It consisted of an aisled basilican church attached to the east side of a great open atrium, enclosed by apartments of two stories, all opening upon pillared porticos likewise of two stories. The layout is unique for its period and place, an adaptation to monastic use of the atria of the great metropolitan churches of Rome. The same influence produced in Carolingian times similar and equally atypical solutions (Fulda, fig. 169, and Kornelismünster, fig. 147). both of these sources, it should be noted, it is listed among the herbs, not with the trees. Sörrensen describes the species as a shrub-like plant of jagged growth, in general not growing higher than 3-10 feet, never forming a straight stem, but always growing crooked and bent. He wonders why a plant so entirely lacking in tallness, fullness, and beauty should occupy such a central position in the life of the monks.21 21 Sörrensen, op. cit., 198. I had occasion to study the savin in the summer of 1968 while on vacation on the Island of Ibiza in Spain, where it grows profusely, and was fascinated to observe that on this island it attains a considerably wider range of shapes and sizes than one would gather from Sörrensen's description. At the edge of the windswept coastal cliffs, the plant hugs the ground and retains a prostrate mushroom-shaped form attaining a diameter of up to 15 feet but 195. INISHMURRY, SLIGO, SOUTHERN IRELAND MONASTIC CASHEL FOUNDED BY ST. MOLAISE, EARLY 6TH CENT. [after Leask, I, 1955, 12, fig. 1] The monastery, surrounded by a 13-foot stone wall, is internally divided into four separate enclosures. The largest contains two churches, a large one with ANTAE, Teampull na b Fhear (Men's Church) and the smaller, more primitive Teach Molaise (St. Molaise's Chapel). A third, Teampull na Teine (Church of the Fire) stands in the northwest enclosure; next to it are the schoolhouse, a dry stone beehive hut, and a smaller hut of the same type. In the southern enclosure lie remains of a third very large beehive hut. Reconstruction shows only buildings sufficiently preserved to leave tangible evidence of their original appearance. The number of dwellings must have been considerably larger, though evidence for them has vanished. rarely exceeding a central height of three or four feet (fig. 205). In more sheltered places 200 to 300 yards inland, it rises to tree height of 17 feet, with two or three stems of relatively straight growth emerging from a common trunk, but usually hidden by the spreading branches completely covered with short imbricated leaves (fig. 206). This variety can be of a full and well-shaped form—somewhat like the juniper trees on the high desert plateau that borders on the east slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Yet another variety, often rising to similar height has boldly contorted trunks fully exposed, to a height of 6 to 8 feet, and above that level branching out into a crown that resembles that of an umbrella pine (fig. 207). I feel as much at a loss as Sörrensen did, in explaining why the savin should occupy such a central place in the planting program of the Plan of St. Gall. The fact that it is an evergreen must certainly have been an important consideration; its medicinal benefits unquestionably another, and not least, perhaps, the fact that its leaves were used in the making of spiced wine. And one also wonders whether its aromatic substance may have been a component of the materials used in making incense. In contrast to Sörrensen, I would not consider its size or shape to have been a deterrent factor. One of the most precious features of the cloister yard, the only place where the monks had daily access to nature, was its exposure to the sun. To have it planted with trees of clearly limited height had its advantages. The architect who designed the Plan of St. Gall appears to have been aware of the botanical characteristics of the savin. He defines it visually as a prostrate plant with straight branches spreading out from the center to the four corners of the planting square, their short set boughs being set in the manner of herring bones. The whole is of a design that is quite distinct from the erect curvilinear symbol used for tall trees in the Monks' Cemetery (fig. 17). p. 30 As in the latter one might interpret this design to stand for either a single tree or to designate a cluster of trees. The planting bed, 17½ × 17½ feet square, is large enough to accommodate a tall tree in the center, with four lower, more prostrate plants around it spreading out into the corners. THE GALLERIED PORCHES The arches (arcus) of the four covered walks which surround the cloister garth are shown in vertical projection. They consist of a central opening 10 feet wide and 7½ feet high, and a group of four arches, each 5 feet wide and 5 feet high, on either side of this passage, which unquestionably rested on a low basement wall. The north walk of the Cloister which runs along the southern aisle of the Church (porticus ante eclam) is broader than the other three. From the inscription we know that this walk performed the function of the later chapter house, and for that purpose is provided with two long benches, both on the Church and on the cloister side, where the monks could face each other in two single files; Hic pia consilium pertract &amp; turba salubre ("Here let the pious group hold their wholesome deliberations").22 22 The inscriptions on the three other walks explain the function of the lower stories of the buildings to which they are attached, and shall be dealt with in conjunction with the latter. It was here that a monk could confess his sins and ask for forgiveness, that the overseers (circatores) would announce transgressions of any sort committed by the brothers, that one monk could accuse another, and that punishment was pronounced and enforced, including such corporal chastisement as flogging. It was here also where much of the temporal business of the abbey was transacted, where charters were sealed, where novices were admitted, and where the dead and departed were commemorated. In subsequent centuries these activities were transferred to a special chapter house. In Carolingian times, it seems, this step had not yet been undertaken. The claims advanced by Georg Hager and Joseph Neuwirth that separate chapter houses existed in the Abbey of Jumièges as early as the seventh century and at Reichenau in 780 are untenable. It is based, in the case of Jumièges on an improper textual exegesis of a good hagiographical source (Life of St. Philibert, d. 750), and in the case of Reichenau, on a twelfth-century forgery of a deed alleged to have been written in 780.23 23 See Georg Hager, 1901, col. 98 and Joseph Neuwirth, 1884, 52ff. For a detailed discussion of their views and the sources on which they are based see Carolyn Marino Malone, "Monastic Planning after the Plan of St. Gall: Tradition and Change." Master's Thesis, University of California at Berkeley, 1968, 27-38, and II, 315ff. An arrangement very similar to that shown on the Plan of St. Gall existed in the Abbey of St.-Wandrille (Fontanella). An account written by a contemporary of Abbot Ansegis (d. 833) tells us that the latter "was buried outside the church of St. Peter, and to the north of it, in the porticus wherein the brethren are accustomed to hold their meetings" (tumulatus extra basilicam s. Petri ad aquilonalem plagam, in porticu, in qua fratres conventum celebrare soliti sunt ac consultis Deo dignis aures accomodare).24 24 Schlosser, 1896, 292, No. 872; and Gesta SS. Patr. Font. Coen., ed. Lohier-Laporte, 1936, 124. This same porticus, as George Forsyth has pointed out,25 25 Forsyth, 1952, 143, note 247. is mentioned earlier in the chronicle as built by Ansegis himself to be a place "where the brethren should gather together to seek insight on all subjects, to listen daily to the reading of the Holy Writ, and to consider any proposed action" (propter quod in ea consilium de qualibet re perquirentes convenire fratres soliti sint; ibi namque in pulpito lectio cotidie divina recitatur, ibi quicquid regularis auctoritas agendum suadet, deliberatur).26 26 Schlosser, 1896, No. 870 and Gesta, ed. Lohier and Laporte, 107. With regard to the interpretation of this passage, see Schlosser, 1889, 31-32. Forsyth (loc. cit.) in his interesting analysis of the passage has interpreted the term porticus as "chapter house." A more appropriate translation, in my opinion, would be "cloister wing." It is in this sense that it is used in a later portion of the same passage of the Gesta abbatum Fontanellensium loc. cit.: "Item ante dormitorium, refectorium et domum illam quam maiorem nominavimus, porticus honestas cum diuersis pogiis aedificari iussit." On the Plan of St. Gall the term porticus is never used for the principal space of a building or for an independent structure, but always for a subordinate unit, such as the aisles of the Church, the galleried wings of the various Cloister yards, and the galleried porches of the Abbot's House. III.1.5 DORMITORY AND WARMING ROOM On the Plan of St. Gall the building that contains the Dormitory of the Monks bounds the cloister to the east and lies in direct axial prolongation of the transept of the church (fig. 208). It is a double-storied structure, 40 feet wide and 85 feet long. The ground floor serves as the warming room, the upper floor is the dormitory (subtus calefactoria dom', supra dormitorium). A hexameter inscribed into the adjacent cloister walk informs us that this building can be heated: Porticus ante domun st&amp; haec fornace calentem. Let this porch stand before the hall which is heated by a furnace. The plan of this building comprises elements of both the lower and the upper story. The seventy-seven beds of the monks (lecti, similt) as well as the doors that open from this building to the transept of the church, to the cloister, and to the monks' privy are obviously related to the dormitory. The "exit from the warming room" (egressus de pisale), which leads to the monks' bath house, on the other hand, and the large "firing chamber" (caminus ad calefaciend?) as well as the "smoke stack" (euaporatio fumi) which are attached to the eastern wall of the building, relate to the calefactory on the ground floor. Dormitory HOW THE MONKS ARE TO SLEEP How the monks are to sleep is set forth in chapters 22 and 55 of the Rules of St. Benedict. According to these, each monk must have his separate bed, assigned to him in accordance with the date of his conversion. If possible, all of the brethren should sleep in one room; but if their number does not allow this, in groups of ten and twenty, with seniors to supervise them. The young monks may not sleep in a group among themselves, but interspersed with their elders. A light must burn in the dormitory throughout the night and the monks must sleep "clothed and girt with girdles or cords," so that they can rise without delay when the signal calls them to the work of God. They must not sleep "with their knives at their sides lest they hurt themselves." "When they rise for the work of God," St. Benedict advises, "let them gently encourage one another, on account 196. ST. RIQUIER (CENTULA) ANGILBERT'S CHURCH AND CLOISTER (790-799) [after Effman, 1912, fig. 1] The original manuscript of Hariulf's Chronicon Centulense, written before 1088, (ed. Lot, 1894) perished in fire in 1719. It contained Hariulf's drawing of the Carolingian abbey church and cloister still in their original condition. His drawing is known through two copies. The earliest and most authentic (above) was made in 1612 and published in Petau's De Nithardo Caroli magni nepote, Paris, 1913. Our knowledge of the exterior of the Carolingian church is derived from it. The interior layout was reconstructed independently, with virtually the same results, by Georges Durand (1911) and Wilhelm Effmann (1912) through analysis of the description of religious services and liturgical processions in Hariulf's chronicle. The best plan, because it takes into account irregularities in the Gothic church reflecting conditions of its Carolingian predecessor, is that of Irmingard Achter, 1956 (figs. 135 and 168). of the excuses to which the sleepy are addicted."27 27 Singuli per singula lecta dormiant; lectisternia pro modo conuersationis secundum dispensationem abbae suae accipiant. Si potest fieri, omnes in uno loco dormiant; sin autem multitudo non sinit, deni aut uiceni cum senioribus, qui super eos solliciti sint, pausent. Candela iugiter in eadem cella ardeat usque mane. Uestiti dormiant et cincti cingulis aut funibus, ut cultellos suos ad latus suum non habeant, dum dormiunt, ne forte per somnum uulnerent dormientem . . . Adulescentiores fratres iuxta se non habeant lectos, sed permixti cum senioribus. Surgentes uero ad opus Dei inuicem se moderare cohortentur propter somnulentorum excusationes. Benedicti regula, chap. 22; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 77-78; ed. McCann, 1952, 70-71; ed. Steidle, 1952, 200-201. In waking each other, as Hildemar informs us in more detail, "the wise and older monk will arouse the brother who sleeps next to him . . . but no junior monk should ever arouse another junior, because of the temptation this may offer for sin (propter occasionem peccati); rather one or two seniors, after having lit a candle, will walk through the dormitory to wake the sleepy brothers; yet, in performing this duty will never touch the brother but only a board of his bed or something similar."28 28 Expositio Hildemari; ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 335-36. For bedding they are allowed: a mattress (matta), a blanket (sagum), a coverlet (lena), and a pillow (capitale). The possession of any personal property other than that which is issued to all of the brothers29 29 See below under "Vestiary." The synod of 817 added to the standard equipment which the monks could keep near their beds, a specified supply of soap and unction; Synodi secundae decr. auth. chap. 38; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 480. is severely prohibited, and in order to guard against infractions of this regulation the beds are frequently inspected by the abbot.30 30 Benedicti regula, chap. 55; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 130; ed. McCann, 1952, 126-27; ed. Steidle, 1952, 269. We must assume that the beds were provided with some locker or storage space, in which the monks could keep the duplicate set of clothing which the Rule permitted them "to allow for a change at night and for the washing of these garments."31 31 Benedicti regula, chap. 55; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 129; ed. McCann, 1952, 124-25; ed. Steidle, 1952, 269. During the hours which are set aside for sleeping, whether in the day or at night, silence is vigorously enforced in the dormitory;32 32 Consuetudines Corbeienses; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 417: "Quando uero dormiendi tempus fuerit siue in die siue in nocte silentium funditus in ore, ita in incessu, ut nullus iniuriam patiatur, summa cautela esse debet." but on certain specified periods of the daily cycle, such as when the monks return from their chapter readings, they may engage in conversation, in groups of two or three or more.33 33 Ibid., 416-17: "Quando loqui licet, quia locutio semper ibi seruanda est siue duo seu tres seu aetiam plures sicuti fieri solet quando de capitulo surgunt coniungantur." Even during the midday rest in the summer, conversation is permitted, provided that it does not "injure the peace of those who sit and read in bed." Should there be any need for sustained talk, the monks must go outside (i.e., to the cloister walk) and conduct their business there.34 34 Ibid., 417: "Quod si aliquis etiam ad legendum in lectulo suo resederit, nequaquam alterum sibi ibidem ad colloquium coniungat, sed si necessitatem loquendi diutius habuerint, exeant foras et ibi loquantur." LAYOUT OF THE BEDS The layout of the beds in the Monks' Dormitory is complex and ingenious. We have already discussed the manner in which it was designed in our analysis of the scale and construction methods used in designing the Plan.35 35 See above, p. 80, fig. 60, and p. 89. The number 77 is not likely to be an accident.36 36 See above, p. 123. Yet I have been able to find only one instance where the number of monks was confined to this figure.37 37 The Abbey of Lobbes, around 850, numbered seventy-seven monks; see below, p. 343. The Monk's Dormitory, like the two other principal buildings of the cloister, the Refectory and the Cellar, has no internal architectural wall partitions whatsoever, and for that reason must be thought of as a unitary space, open from end to end. This should not be interpreted to mean, however, that the beds were in full and open view of everyone throughout the entire length and width of the building. They must have been separated from one another by wooden panels sufficiently high and long to protect the monks from interfering with one another. The Custom of Subiaco stipulates "that there be wooden partitions between bed and bed, so that the brothers may not see each other when they rest or read in their beds, and overhead they must be covered [with canopies] because of the dust and the cold." The same custom also requires "that these 197. ST. RIQUIER (CENTULA). PLAN WITH ABBEY CHURCH &amp; CLOISTER [after Durand, 1911, 241, fig. 5] This 19th-century cadastral plan of the city of St. Riquier shows the Gothic abbey church (1) and superimposed in the area to the south the course of the covered walks that once enclosed its triangular cloister, with the church of St. Benedict (2) in one, and the church of St. Mary (3) in the other corner. This layout, first suggested by Jean Hubert (1957, 293-309, Pl. 1.C), and again in Hubert, Porcher, and Volbach (1970, 297, fig. 341), on the basis of a documentary study, was confirmed by excavations of Honoré Bernard (Karl der Grosse, III, 1965, 370). 199. LORSCH FIRST MONASTERY OF CHRODEGANG (760-774) AXONOMETRIC RECONSTRUCTION [after Behn, 1949, pl. 1] 198. LORSCH FIRST MONASTERY OF CHRODEGANG (760-774) PLAN [after Selzer, 1955, 14] Lorsch is the earliest medieval monastery with a square cloister attached to one flank of the church. But a layout of similar shape may already have existed in Pirmin's abbey of Reichenau-Mittelzell, built between 724 and 750, if Erdmann's reconstruction of its claustral compound is correct (Erdmann, 1974, 499, fig. TA 4). For Lorsch see Behn and Selzer, and a more recent summary by Schaefer in Vorromanische Kirchenbauten, 1966-68, 179-82. spaces be so arranged, as to be provided with a window admitting daylight for reading and writing as well as a small table and a chair and whatever else is necessary for that purpose."38 38 Sit tamen inter lectum et lectum intersticium tabularum, quod prohibeat mutuam visionem fratrum in lectis jacencium vel legencium; sintque desuper cooperti propter pulveres et frigus. Loca eciam sic sint ordinata, ut quilibet habeat fenestram pro lumine diei ad legendum et scribendum et mensulam ibidem collacatam atque sedem et hujusmodi que necessaria sunt pro talibus. (Conseutudines Sublacenses, chap. 3, ed. Albers. Cons. Mon., II, 1905, 125-26.) The Custom of Subiaco is a relatively late source39 39 The oldest preserved manuscripts of the Consuetudines Sublacenes (St. Gall Stiftsbibliothek, Cod. Lat. 928 and 932) date from around 1436. See Albers, 1902, 201ff. and already reflects a relaxation of the Rule of St. Benedict in favor of greater privacy—a development in the further course of which the dormitory ended up by being subdivided internally into a sequence of individual cubicles ranged along the walls of the building, with a passage left in the middle, each cubicle forming a separate enclosure fitted, besides the bed, with a chair and a desk beneath a window. This arrangement, so well known from the dorter of Durham Cathedral (built by Bishop Skirlaw in 13981404)40 40 On the dorter of Durham, see VHC, Durham, 1928, 130. was clearly not in the mind of the churchmen who ruled on the details of the layout of the Monks' Dormitory on the Plan of St. Gall. Yet even here we might be justified in counting on at least a rudimentary system of partition walls between the beds—if not for moral protection, for purely practical reasons: since the brothers were permitted to read in bed during their afternoon rest period, they were in need of at least a headboard against which to lean. FEARS OF THE VIGILANT ABBOT The eternal fear of the vigilant abbot was, of course, the pollution of monastic life by what St. Benedict designated with his distinctive discretion simply as impropriety (improbitas),41 41 Benedicti regula, chap. 2 and 23; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 24, 79; ed. McCann, 1952, 20-22, 72-73; ed. Steidle, 1952, 82-83, 200-201. but to which others before and after him referred with less restraint as "that habit which is contrary to nature" (usus qui est contra naturam) perpetrated by men, who oblivious of their own sex turn nature into iniquity "by committing shameless acts with other men (masculi in masculos turpitudinem operantes),42 42 St. Paul, Epistola ad Romanes, I, 26-27. or "that most wicked crime . . . detestable to God" (istud scelus valde nefandissimum . . . quae valde detestabile est Deo).43 43 Expositio Hildemari, ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 332-34. The crime was common enough to come to the attention of Charlemagne, who dealt with it in a vigorous act of public legislation, incorporated in a general capitulary for his Missi issued in 802.44 44 "For a most pernicious rumor has come to our ears that many in our monasteries have already been detected in fornication and in abomination and uncleanness. It especially saddens and disturbs us that it can be said, without a great mistake, that some of the monks are understood to be sodomites, so that whereas the greatest hope of salvation to All Christians is believed to arise from the life and chastity of the monks, damage has been incurred instead. Therefore, we also ask and urge that henceforth all shall most earnestly strive with all diligence to preserve themselves from these evils, so that never again such a report shall be brought to our ears. And let this be known to all, that we in no way dare to consent to those evils in any other place in our whole kingdom; so much the less, indeed, in the persons of those whom we desire to be examples of chastity and moral purity. Certainly, if any such report shall have come to our ears in the future, we shall inflict such a penalty, not only on the guilty but also on those who have consented to such deeds, that no Christian who shall have heard of it will ever dare in the future to perpetrate such acts." (Here quoted after translations and Reprints, VI, Laws of Charles the Great, ed. D. C. Monro, n.d., 21. For the original text see Capitulare Missorum Generale, AD 802, Mon. Germ. Hist., Legum II, Capit. I, 1883, 94.) The monk Hildemar, writing in 845, devoted several pages to this precarious subject and discussed in detail the precautions an abbot must take to guard against this danger. The abbot, he tells us, must watch not only over the boys and adolescents, but also over those who enter the monastery at a more advanced age. To each group of ten boys there must be assigned three or four seniors, or masters, so that no one among them is ever without supervision. After the late evening service, Compline, "the boys must leave the choir, and their masters, with a light in hand, will take them to every altar of the oratory to pray a little, one master walking in front, one in the middle, and the third behind" (unus magister ante, alter magister vadat in medio, et tertius magister retro); "then whoever wants to go to the privy, should go perform the necessities of nature with a light, and their master with them" (cum lumine et magister eorum cum illis).45 45 Expositio Hildemari, ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 333. If a boy finds himself compelled to respond to this call during the night, "he must waken his master, who will light a lamp and take him to the privy, and with the light burning, bring him back to bed."46 46 Ibid., 334. Even the dreamlife of the monks and its sexual connotations are subject to supervision. Depending on the varying degree of sleep or consciousness, the employment of the senses of touch and vision, or the extent of deliberate procrastination, the offense must be atoned for by the recitation of psalms, five, ten, or fifteen respectively, and if the indulgence was committed with no restraint, by the reading of the entire psalter.47 47 Ibid., 336. ABSENCE OF STAIRS The author of the Plan of St. Gall did not consider it a matter of vital importance to express himself in great detail about the stairs which connected the Dormitory with the Church, the cloister, and the privy. He made it absolutely clear, however, where such connections should be established. There is no doubt that the door that leads from the Dormitory to the southern transept arm of the Church must have opened onto a flight of stairs by which the monks descended into the Church for their nocturnal services. A direct ascent to the dormitory a parte ecclesiae in the Abbey of St. Gall is mentioned in Ekkehart's Casus sancti Galli.48 48 Ekkeharti (IV.) Casus sancti Galli, chap. 91; ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 322ff; ed. Helbling, 1958, 164ff. Cf. II, 327. Flights of night stairs of precisely this type survive in an excellent state of preservation in the transepts of the Cistercian abbey churches of Fontenay and Silvacane, both from about 1150, and the Benedictine abbey church of Hexham (fig. 101), from about 1200-1225.49 49 For night stairs in general see Aubert, I, 1957, 304-305. For Fontenay, see Ségogne-Maillé, 1946, fig. 5; for Silvacane: Pontus, 1966, 38; for Hexham: Cook, 1961, pl. VII and Cook-Smith, 1960, pl. 39. A night stair survives in the north transept of Tintern Abbey. Others in varying degrees of preservation are found in many other medieval churches (Beaulieu Abbey; St. Augustine, Bristol; Hayles Abbey, and others). The remains of the earliest medieval flight of dormitory night stairs known to me are those which have been excavated by Otto Doppelfeld in the northern transept arm of Cologne Cathedral. They are virtually coeval with the Plan of St. Gall. See Weyres, 1965, 395ff and 417, fig. 5. The area in the middle of the Dormitory left unobstructed by beds might have been meant to serve as landing for an inner stair connecting Dormitory with Warming Room. This same stair could also have been used for daytime access from ground level to Privy, which to judge by numerous later parallels must have been level with the Dormitory. Warming room METHOD OF HEATING The heating system of the Monks' Warming Room raises interesting historical and technological questions. It consists, as already pointed out, of an external firing chamber (caminus ad calefaciend?) that transmits its heat to the building through heat ducts (not shown on the Plan), the necessary draft for which is generated by an external smoke stack (euaporatio fumi). Identical heating units appear in two other places on the Plan, the "warming room" (pisale) of the Novitiate and the "warming room" (pisale) of the Infirmary.50 50 See below, pp. 311ff (Novitiate) and 313 (Infirmary). Keller's51 51 Keller, 1844, 21. attempt to interpret these devices as simple fireplaces is untenable and was convincingly repudiated by Willis.52 52 Willis, 1848, 100. They are clearly descendants of the Roman hypocaust system. The existence of such heating systems in the Middle Ages is well attested both by literary and archeological sources. A hypocausterium almost contemporary with those of the Plan of St. Gall was built by Abbot Ewerardus at the monastery of Freckenhorst.53 53 Nec ab incoepto destitit donec in circuitu oratorii refectorium hiemale et aestivale, hypocaustorium, cellarium, domum areatum, coquinam, granarium et dormitorum, et omnia necessaria habitacula aedificavit." (Vita S. Thiadildis abbatissae Freckenhorsti; see Schlosser, 1896, 86, No. 283). For previous discussions of the hypocausts of St. Gall see Keller, 1844, 21; Willis, 1848, 91; Stephani II, 1903, 77-83; Oelmann, 1923/24, 216.

ISOMETRIC RECONSTRUCTION [after Selzer, 1965, 148] The abbey grounds, of irregular ovoid shape, were surrounded by a masonry wall. Entering the monastery from the west the visitor stepped into a large rectangular atrium where he had to pass through what can only be called the Carolingian equivalent of a Roman triumphal arch accommodating over its passages a small royal hall (a jewel of Carolingian architecture, built 768-774, the earliest wholly preserved building of post-Roman times on German soil). At the end of this atrium the visitor faced two massive towers flanking a gate that gave access to a second, considerably smaller atrium lying before the monumental westwork of the church of St. Nazarius, an aisled basilica with low transept and probably a rectangular choir, built between 767-774, and enlarged eastward in 876 by a crypt for royalty. The component building masses of this architectural complex rose in dramatic ascent on successively higher levels of the gently rising slope of a natural sand dune; the west gate at the bottom, the choir of the church at the top, the late Carolingian crypt eight meters below the level of the church on the steeply descending east slope of the dune. The walls of the monastery enclosed an area of roughly 25,000 square meters. Forming a veritable VIA SACRA, from gate to altar the route of passage was nearly 260m. long.

At the same time, all the claustral ranges were rebuilt on the foundations of their Carolingian predecessors. (For remains of the latter see Vorromanische Kirchenbauten, 1966, 180). Henry I of Saxony, tells us much about the details of construction of such a hypocausterium. There, beneath a hall constructed between 920 and 930, C. H. Seebach unearthed a hypocaust in an excellent state of preservation.54 54 Seebach, 1941, 256-73. The remains of the channels and a freestanding chimney of the hypocaust which heated the calefactory and the scriptorium of the Abbey of Reichenau, built at the time of Abbot Haito (806-823), were excavated by Emil Reisser in the immediate vicinity of the nothern transept arm of the Church of St. Mary's at Mittelzell (see Reisser, 1960, 38ff). For other medieval calefactories with hypocausts, see the article "Calefactorium" by Konrad Hecht in Otto Schmidt, Reallexikon zur Deutschen Kunstgeschichte, III, 1954, cols. 308-12; and Fusch, 1910. Its heating plant (fig. 209) consisted of a subterranean firing chamber beneath the floor of the hall, which was reached by an outside passageway. A system of radiant ducts channeled the heated air from the firing chamber into a circular flue which lay directly under the pavement of the hall and was provided, at regular intervals, with tubular vents through which the warmth ascended into the hall above. Another large flue ran from this main duct to the western gable wall where it emptied into a smoke stack. This flue showed heavy traces of blackening, which suggests that the hot air outlets into the hall could be closed by stone lids during the initial firing stages, when the volume of smoke and obnoxious gas was heaviest, leaving the chimney as the only outlet. Seebach believes that the hypocaust system of St. Gall was identical with that of Werla. However, the two systems are not alike in every detail. The Werla firing chamber lay beneath the hall; the firing chambers of St. Gall are external attachments. They must have been subterranean, of course, for otherwise the heated air could not rise into the hall above, but the general principle of construction was doubtlessly the same, and the occurrence of this type on the Plan of St. Gall is clear testimony that 202. SILCHESTER, HAMPSHIRE, ENGLAND, ROMAN BASILICA AND FORUM PLAN (after Joyce, 1887, pl. 16) A provincial variant of a distinguished lineage of Roman market halls, Silchester is related to the basilicas of Trajan in Rome (fig. 239) and Septimius Severus in Lepcis Magna (fig. 159). To students considering history as a chronological progression, the similarity of layout of these Roman market halls with that of the Carolingian CLAUSTRUM is perplexing. Yet such a conceptual leap into the classical past may be even more easily understood than the Carolingian revival of the Constantinian transept basilica. To study the layout of the latter, Frankish churchmen had to travel to Rome, but they could see surviving or ruinous examples of the Roman market hall in their homeland. Basilicas of the Silchester type existed in the Roman city of Augst in Switzerland (Reinle, 1965, 34) and in Worms, Germany. The latter was well known to builders of the Merovingian cathedral of Worms (Fuhrer zu vor-und frühgeschichtlichen Denkmälern, XIII, 1969, 36). 203. PLAN OF ST. GALL. CLOISTER YARD Although in plan displaying striking similarities with the great galleried courts of the Roman market halls (cf. figs. 202, 239) the four-cornered medieval cloister shows marked differences in elevation (cf. fig. 192). The Roman basilican courts are vast areas for open-air assembly and the conduct of business, surrounded by relatively small offices and shops of modest height (fig. 202). The open yard of a medieval cloister, by contrast is small in relation to the buildings by which it is enclosed. The latter rise high and are surmounted by steep-pitched roofs. Internally, although composed of two levels, they form open halls extending the entire length of the building. The galleried porches are the only connecting links between these huge structures, none of which possess interconnecting doors or entrances. The tint block on the opposite page shows the above cloister (100 feet square) at the scale of the Silchester basilica (1:600). 204. DIOSCURIDES. MATERIA MEDICA Vienna, National Library, CODEX VINDOBONENSIS, fol. 48v SAVIN PLANT (JUNIPERUS SABINA) [by courtesy of the National Library of Vienna] Pedanios Dioscurides of Anazarbos, a physician of Greek descent who served in the army of Nero, wrote his Materia Medica around 50 A.D. It details the properties of about 600 medicinal plants and describes animal products of dietetic and medicinal value. The writing of Dioscurides was well known and widely read in the Middle Ages and served as a standard text for learning in all medical schools. The illustration shown above is from a richly (in places even brilliantly and very realistically) illuminated copy of this treatise executed by a Byzantine artist in 512, and now available in a magnificent facsimile edition. hypocausts with a complete system of heat-distributing air ducts, and a chimney stack for draft and evacuation of obnoxious gas were, at the time of Louis the Pious, a standard system used in the construction of monastic warming rooms. Whether or not the heat produced by this system could also be conducted into the Dormitory above remains a moot question. PURPOSE The primary function of the calefactory, we learn from Adalhard, was to give the monks an opportunity to warm themselves in wintertime in the intervals between the divine services,55 55 Consuetudines Corbeienses; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 416: "Si autem hyemps fuerit et calefatiendi necessitas ingruerit, prout ei qui praeest uisum fuerit siue ante seu post peractum officium aliquod interuallum fiat, quando se calefacere possint." See Jones, III, 123. to hang up their clothes for drying,56 56 Ibid., 418: "Et si forte quaedam ad eandem domum spetialiter pertinent ut est de pannis infusis qui suspenduntur," and translated, III, 123. and to meet at certain hours for conversation.57 57 Ibid., 418: "Cum . . . tam colloquendi quam coniugendi tempus licitum aduenerit," and translated, III, 123. This was also the place, he cannot resist adding, "where the monks on occasion succumb to drowsiness and neglect their reading because of the pleasant warmth."58 58 Ibid., 418: "Et somnolentis et propter caloris suauitatem minus adtente legentibus," and translated, III, 123. It is possible, as Hafner has pointed out,59 59 Hafner, in Studien, 1962, 180-82. that the calefactory was also used as a general work room, where the monks did their sewing and mending, or other domestic chores, when the weather was not mild enough to permit them to do this in the cloister. The calefactory may also, during the winter or on days of inclement weather, have been the place for the weekly washing of the feet of the monks.60 60 See below, p. 307. According to the Usus ordinis Cistercensis the calefactory is the place "where the brothers warm themselves, grease their boots, and are bled; where the cantor and the scribes mix ink and dry their parchment, and where the sacrist fetches light and glowing cinders." See Migne, Patr. Lat., CLXVI, cols. 1387B, 1447A-C, 1466D, 1497C; and Mettler, 1909, 151. To provide the wood for the hypocaust was the responsibility of the chamberlain.61 61 "Ligna recipiet camerarius conventus et de illis procurabit ignemcopiosum fratribus" (see under "camerarius" in Du Cange, Glossarium). RECONSTRUCTION The reconstruction of the building containing the Calefactory and the Dormitory poses no major problems (figs. 108 and 111.B). Although no Carolingian dormitory of significance is preserved, as far as I know, we are fairly well informed about the materials used in their construction by contemporary chronicles. The dormitory of Fontanella (St.-Wandrille), completely reconstructed under Abbot Ansegis (823-833), is a good example. The Gesta Abbatum Fontanellensium62 62 Gesta Abbatum Fontanellensium, chap. 17; ed. Loewenfeld, Script. rer. Germ., XX, 1886. tells us that its "walls were built in well-dressed stone with joints or mortar made of lime and sand" and that it received its light through "glass windows." Apart from the walls the entire structure was built with wood from the heart of oak, and roofed by tiles held in place with iron nails.63 63 Gesta SS. Patr. Font. Coen., chap. 13(5), ed. Lohier and Laporte, 1936, 104-105: "Dormitorium fratrum . . . cuius muri de calce fortissimo ac uiscoso arenaque rufa et fossili lapideque tofoso ac probato constructi sunt . . . continentur in ipsa domo desuper fenestrae uitreae, cunctaque eius fabrica, excepta maceria de materie quercuum durabilium condita est, tegulaeque ipsius uniuersae clauis ferreis desuper affixae." See Schlosser, 1889, 30-31; Schlosser, 1896, 289, and Gesta abbatum Fontanellensium, chap. 17; ed. Loewenfeld, Script. rer. Germ, XX, 1886, 54. The layout of this dormitory differed distinctly from the one shown on the Plan of St. Gall, but like the dormitory of St.-Wandrille, the building that houses the Dormitory on the Plan of St. Gall was a masonry structure. This can be inferred from the fact that the cloister walk with its arched openings attached to it was unquestionably built in masonry. With its span of 40 feet from wall to wall, this building required a roof structure comparable to that of the adjacent church. In the latter the tie beams of the roof must have crossed the nave in a single span; in the dormitory—with its live load of seventy-seven monks on the top floor—the girders that supported the joists of the dormitory floor are likely to have found additional support in one or two rows of free-standing posts.64 64 The same conditions apply to the building which contains the Monks' Refectory and Vestiary, and the building which contains their Cellar and Larder.

III.1.6 MONKS' PRIVY LAYOUT From the southern gable wall of the dormitory an exit opens into an L-shaped passageway that leads into the Monks' Privy. This building is 30 feet wide and 40 feet long. Along its southern wall it is furnished with a bench containing nine toilet seats (sedilia) that are slightly larger than the seats in the other privies, and, unlike them, not set directly against the wall but parallel to it at a small distance. A square support in the north-eastern corner of the room serves as a stand for a light (lucerna) which, Hildemar postulates in his commentary to the Rule of St. Benedict,65 65 Expositio Hildemari, ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 331: Intelligitur autem, ut non solum ardeat candela in dormitorio, verum etiam in exitu, quia ubi et ubi non possunt seniores adolescentiores custodire, nisi fuerit, sicut dixi, candela ad exitum. was a necessity. Short strokes intersecting the walls at suitable distances designate that the privy should be furnished with window slits for daylight and ventilation.66 66 The only other instance where windows are indicated on the Plan of St. Gall is the Scriptorium, in both cases for compelling functional reasons, see above, p. 147. Not easy to identify in the absence of any explanatory titles are three oblong areas in front of the three remaining walls. Keller interpreted them as tables.67 67 Keller, 1840, 21. Later 208. PLAN OF ST. GALL. MONKS' DORMITORY AND WARMING ROOM, WITH PRIVY, BATHHOUSE, AND LAUNDRY The Dormitory forms the second story of a building 40 feet wide and 85 feet long (see fig. 192). It is furnished with seventy-seven beds that one must assume were separated by wooden partitions as well as equipped with head and foot boards, and a modicum of locker space for storing extra clothing. It is not clear whether the Dormitory could be heated, but its location above the Warming Room suggests the possibility that on cold days heat from the lower chambers might rise into the upper through ducts in the walls or adjustable openings in the floor. St. Benedict ruled (see above, p. 249) that the brothers "if possible should sleep in one room." This directive is probably the primary historical impetus for construction of such large sleeping halls. The earliest structure of this type appears to be the dormitory of the Abbey of Jumièges, ca. 650. (See the reconstruction of the layout of this monastery by Horn, 1973, 35, fig. 35. For procedure followed by the maker of the Plan in developing the layout of beds within a grid of 2½-foot squares, see above, p. 89. The term DORMITORIUM is not classical and does not appear in general use before the 8th century; see III, Glossary, s.v.) students of the Plan, sufficiently puzzled by their purpose, ignored them entirely. That they were meant to be tables seems to me precluded by their dimensions alone (5 × 10 feet and 5 × 17½ feet), not to mention the fact that tables are not a traditional part of the furnishings of a privy. From a purely functional point of view one would expect to find, besides the toilet seats, one or two areas serving as urinals, a stand with pitchers filled with water or some other means of providing water for washing the hands, and perhaps a bin for the storage of straw. A STRANGE VISIT AT NIGHT: ITS SANITARY, MORAL, AND ARCHITECTURAL IMPLICATIONS That straw was used for sanitary purposes in the Middle Ages may be inferred from a story in Ekkehart's History of the Monastery of St. Gall, which is of interest in more than this particular respect. It tells us how the monks of St. Gall foiled an attempt of Ruodman, the reform abbot of the neighboring monastery of Reichenau (972-986)68 68 Willis, 1848, 101; Leclercq in Cabrol-Leclercq, 1924, col. 98; Reinhardt, 1952, 11. to convict them of laxity in monastic discipline. Having failed in previous and more conventional attempts to prove corruption in the monastery of St. Gall, he took an extraordinary course of action, which the chronicler describes with painstaking accuracy: the abbot mounted his horse, rode to St. Gall, and entered the monks' cloister, unrecognized, in the depth of night, searching like a thief for evidence that might support his accusations (equite ascenso sanctum Gallum noctu invadens claustrum clandestinus introiit, ut siquid reatui proximum invenire posset furtive perspiceret). Frustrated by finding no incriminating evidence, he decided upon the even more unusual expedient of installing himself as a quiet observer on one of the seats in the monks' privy. Since this occurred in the monastery in which he himself had been raised, he was familiar with the layout of the buildings, and the writer describes with great precision the steps which the abbot had to take in order to reach his goal: from the cloister yard where his inquisition started he went into the church, climbed up to the dormitory, and from there gained access to the privy (e parte aecclesiae dormitorium ascendit secessumque fratrum pedetemptivus ascendit et occulte resedit). As he passed through the dormitory his presence was discovered by an alert monk from St. Gall, who instantly woke his fellow brothers, took them in procession to the privy and placed a shining lantern (lucerna) in front of the abbot, together with a handful of straw (stramina)—a derisive gesture, obviously, through which he invited the distinguished visitor to terminate his ritual so that he could be properly received by his angry hosts.69 69 Ekkeharti (IV.) Casus sancti Galli, chap. 91, ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 332ff and ed. Helbling, 1958, 164ff. For the dates of the abbacy of Ruodman and his role in the monastic reform movement of his period, see Helbling, 1958, 105, note 605, and the literature cited there. This story helps to clarify a number of points about the Plan. First of all the fact that the relative location of PFALZ WERLA, GERMANY 209.A 209.D 209.B 209.C HYPOCAUST OF A FORTIFIED HALL OF HENRY I OF SAXONY BUILT 920-930 [after Seebach, 1941] A.

LIBER CHRONICARUM (NUREMBERG, 1493), fol. cv The subject is Seneca bleeding to death in his bath. For another medieval example of a wooden bathtub, see fig. 238. cloister, church, dormitory, and privy in the monastery of St. Gall was identical with that shown on the Plan. Secondly, that the monks' privy could not be reached directly from the cloister yard, but only through the monks' dormitory.70 70 Keller, 1840, 21; Willis, 1848, 101; Leclercq, 1924, col. 98; and Reinhardt, 1952, 11, erroneously assumed that the passage to the Monks' Privy emerged from the Monks' Warming Room. If this had been the intent of the draftsman, he would have made it clear in the explanatory title which designates the function of this passage, as he did in the case of the other passage, which leads from the Warming Room to the Monks' Laundry and Bathhouse (egressus de pisale). And lastly, that the monks' privy was level with the dormitory, and hence probably formed the upper story of a building that had a cesspool or a trench flushed with running water on its ground floor. This is the classical medieval arrangement, attested by numerous examples, both on the continent and in England, about which more will be said in a later chapter.71 71 See II, 300ff, on sanitary facilities. Since it is the arrangement of the monastery of St. Gall, built with the aid of the Plan, it is probably also the arrangement that the designer of the Plan had in mind. In analogy with all of these conditions, therefore, I would interpret the detached position of the toilet seats in the Monks' Privy of the Plan, in conjunction with the line drawn in front of them and the line that defines the wall behind them, as the means by which the draftsmen indicated that the seats were suspended axially over a cesspool or water-flushed channel below it. The space behind the seats might be the logical place for straw to be stored. TIMES SET FORMALLY ASIDE FOR THE USE OF THE PRIVY Because of the rigid time schedule of the monks, their number, and the many hours which they had to spend collectively in the church celebrating the divine services, the use of the privy, too, was subject to the need for timing. The Rule of St. Benedict prescribes that from Easter to the first of November "the hour of rising be so arranged that there be a short interval after Matins, in which the brothers may go out for the necessities of nature, to be followed at once by Lauds, which should be said at dawn."72 72 A pascha autem usque ad supradictas nobembres sic temperetur hora ut uigiliarum agenda paruissimo interuallo, quo fratres ad necessaria naturae exeant, mox matutini, qui incipiente luce agendi sunt, subsequantur. Benedicti regula, chap. 8; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 53; ed. McCann, 1952, 48-49; ed. Steidle, 1952, 145. Other consuetudinaries provide for similar opportunities between the hours of rising and Matins73 73 In primis, nocturnis horis, cum ad opus diuinum de lectulo surrexerit frater, primum signum sibi sanctae crucis imprimat . . .

Statuta Murbacensia, chap. 25, ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 449. In Centula with its 390 monks (three choirs of 130 monks, all worshiping simultaneously) the problem of timing was solved by a directive of Angilbert, which prescribed that "after the services had been fulfilled in a seemly fashion, the third part of each choir should go out of the church and fulfill their corporeal necessities."75 75 Quibus decenter expletis uniuscuisque chori pars tertia ecclesiam exeat, et corporeis necessitatibus vel aliis utilitatibus ad tempus inserviat.

III.1.7 MONKS' LAUNDRY AND BATHHOUSE CONCEPT OF CLEANLINESS &amp; DIRECTIVES CONCERNING THE USE OF BATHS The custom of taking baths, in view of the traditional monastic repugnance toward the sensuality with which this practice had been associated in Greco-Roman times, was always a somewhat controversial issue in the life of the monks. St. Anthony rejected the use of baths entirely. His biographer Athanasius reports that "he never washed his body with water to cleanse it from filth nor his feet, and even abstained from putting them in water except from necessity."76 76 Athanasius, Life of St. Anthony, see Jones in Medieval Literature in Translation, 1950, 23: and for the Greek and Latin versions Migne, Patr. Greca, XXVI, 1857, cols. 911 and 912. Aversion to bodily cleanliness was not confined to eastern monks. Charles W. Jones draws my attention to a passage in Bede's Life of St. Cuthbert, where it is said that St. Cuthbert removed his shoes only once a year, namely for the ritual of the foot-washing on Maundy Thursday (Bede, Vita s. Cuthberti, prosaica, chap. XVIII, ed. Colgrave, 1940, 219). St. Benedict, with the tolerance that characterizes 211. PLAN OF ST. GALL. REFECTORY, VESTIARY AND KITCHEN SAME SIZE AS ORIGINAL (1:192) The Refectory is a huge hall occupying the ground floor of a two-storied building, 40 feet wide* * nominal measure and 100 feet long. The Abbot sat at the head of a U-shaped table in the center of the eastern gable wall. To his side and westward, on tables and benches set up in the axis and along the walls of the building, brothers were seated in order of seniority. The layout and the dimensions of these pieces of furniture reflect the most subtle combination of functional and spiritual considerations. Except for the center table in the western half of the building (where the youngest members of the community sat on both sides of the table) all other tables and benches are so arranged that brothers sit only on the outer side, leaving the inner free for servers to place and remove tableware. Total seating capacity of the hall is 120 (allowing a sitting area of 2½ square feet per person) thus making it possible for the entire community to take a meal in one sitting. An analysis of the dimensions of the tables and benches discloses that even in the details of their design careful consideration is given to the use of sacred numbers (cf. above, pp. 118ff). Total length of the Abbot's table: 70 feet; headpiece: 4 feet; each of its longitudinal arms: 30 feet, allowing 12 brothers to be seated on each of these. Total length of the wall benches in the eastern half of the Refectory: 40 feet. Total seating capacity, 120, reflects the combinations 10 × 12 or 3 × 40. Whether eating halls accommodating such large numbers are a monastic invention or have secular precedents is a difficult question. Romans ate their meals reclining on couches; the lower classes and the soldiers presumably ate sitting erect. My colleague J. K. Anderson informs me that no archaeological evidence suggests that soldiers of the Roman army ate in large mess halls, and the linguistic connotations of CONTUBERNIUM (a "hut-" or "tent-companionship" of ten men) tends to stress deliberate fostering of intimacy among small groups of soldiers. It thus seems that the medieval refectory may have been a monastic invention in response to demands for communal living introduced first by St. Pachomius (see Glossary, s.v. Refectory) and made mandatory by St. Benedict. 211.X* * the original drawing in carbon pencil measures 20.25 × 30.50 inches (51.5 × 77.5 cm) PLAN OF ST. GALL. REFECTORY. INTERIOR VIEW LOOKING EASTWARD AUTHORS' RECONSTRUCTION The entrance to the Refectory from the south cloister walk, left middle ground, centers on the north wall directly opposite the reader's pulpit, which centers on the south wall. Beneath the pulpit stands the table for visiting monks. The abbot's table centers on the east wall, a commanding position from which he surveys the community of which he is the ruler, ever mindful of his office and the trast reposing in him as abbot, father, in accordance with the admonition of St. Benedict, founder of the Order (page 330). Here with twelve brothers on his right and twelve on his left, the abbot, with the rest of the community at tables ranged around the rooms, eats in silence. As the mortal body partakes of earthly food, the reader from his pulpit brings spiritual sustenance of sacred writings, articulated in a voice that is heard throughout the great space. The Refectory is illustrated with masonry-built walls (for historical evidence, see page 258). To reconstruct a space of that size as stone-vaulted in the Carolingian period would be anachronistic. The illustration shows a wood-structured ceiling. We interpret the measure of the Refectory on the facsimile Plan to be 40 feet wide (16 standard modules). With allowance made for wall thickness, it would have been unlikely to exeed about 37½ feet internal measure, or 15 standard modules—no mean span, yet quite feasible to bridge by a timbered ceiling. The length, east to west, articulates with the cloister east-west dimension, 100 feet. Allowing for wall thickness, it is taken as 95 feet, or 38 standard modules, which conveniently resolves to seven bays: a center bay of 5 modules, with three bays of 5½ modules on each side of the center bay. Thus six bays of 5½ modules plus one bay of 5 modules (= 95 feet) is the basis for our reconstruction of the interior perspective. Considering that the girder and beam system carried the monks' Vestiary on the upper level, we include curved timber struts supported on monolithic masonry corbels deeply embedded in the long side walls. This scheme gives an unsupported center span of about 17 feet, with two side spans, each less than to feet, spans of such modest length as to be commonplace and to offer no structural problems. Seven windows in the south wall, one in each bay, give abundant direct sunlight throughout the year. On the north wall the six windows that open on the cloister shelter are somewhat less effective than those on the south. A system of wood girders, beams, parlins, supporting a plank wood floor, invites the use of painting, particularly on the planks, purlins, and beams. Color thus used has amazing power to bring brightness and lift to a ceiling. With dark evenings and dark mornings of a northern winter, painted color was a simple, but effective, mode to gain light and cheer. All this, conjectural for a building never constructed, is an interpretation. E. B. his judgment, permitted the use of baths "to the sick, as often as may be expedient," but prescribes that "to the healthy and especially to the young" this privilege "be granted seldom" (Ualnearum usus infirmis, quotiens expedit, offeratur, sanis autem et maxime iubenibus tardius concedatur).77 77 Benedicti regula, chap. 36; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 96; ed. McCann, 1952, 90-91; ed. Steidle, 1952, 229. During the preliminary negotiations of the first synod of Aachen there was a strong movement to revert to the ascetic precepts of the early desert monks, which culminated in a proposal "to interdict the use of baths entirely, except when imposed by sickness" (usus balnei interdictus omnino est excepto quibus necessitas infirmitatis insistit).78 78 Statuta Murbacensia, chap. 21; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 447, 10. The categorical interdiction of baths proposed at the synod of 816 was unquestionably a legislative resurgence of the spirit of fanatic asceticism to which St. Benedict of Aniane had succumbed during the first two-and-a-half years of his monachate (774-777) under the impact of the great Egyptian desert monks. During this time, which, as his biographer Ardo tells us, he spent in the Abbey of St. Seine near Dijon, his disregard for hygiene was so great that "he never indulged his body in the use of baths" (Balnearum usus per idem tempus suo corpore numquam indulsit) allowing "quantities of lice to flourish on his squalid skin, they being pastured upon those limbs wasted by fasting (Quapropter copia pediculorum in squalenti surgebat cute, a quibus ieiuniis adtenuata depascebantur membra.") Ardonis Vita Benedicti Abbatis Anianensis et Indensis, chap. 2, ed. Waitz, Mon. Germ. Hist., Script, XV, 1887, 202. Judging from Bishop Haito's reaction, this proposal could not have enjoyed great popularity. Refusing to implement it for his own monasteries, he urges, in expectation of a clarification in future directives, that "in the meantime bathtubs be made in abundance under the supervision of the prior and of the cellarer, in which the brothers may bathe, individually, and not together, as necessity commands, and having previously received benediction, giving relief to themselves in turn and allowing no access to others" (interim uero fiant cupae balneariae abundanter prepositi et cellerarii ordinatione factae in quibus se fratres singillatim et non communiter cum necessitas exposcit benedictione ante percepta lauare possint inuicem sibi solatia prebentibus sine accessu extraneorum).79 79 Op. cit., p. 447. In its final promulgation the synod of 816 struck a compromise by permitting the use of baths at Christmas and on Easter, reiterating the stipulation that the bath must be taken singly (Ut balneis generaliter tantum in Natiuitate et in Pascha Domini ueruntamen separatim utantur),80 80 Synodi primae decr. auth., chap. 7; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 459. and in the synod of the subsequent year the matter was given a new degree of flexibility by a directive that submitted the taking of baths "to the discretion of the prior" (Ut opus balnearum in arbitrio prioris consistat).81 81 Synodi secundae decr. auth., chap. 10; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon. I, 1963, 475. A further boost to personal cleanliness and hygiene was given, at that same synod, by the stipulation that the provost provide the brothers with soap and ointment and see to it that they keep these items near their beds together with the other things they need.82 82 Synodi secundae decr. auth., chap. 36, op. cit., 480: "Ut datam a priore saponis et uncturae mensuram et reliqua quae sibi sunt necessaria ad suos habeant lectos." The monk Hildemar considers the use of baths at Christmas and Easter sufficient and militates against the introduction by certain abbots of a third bath during the beginning of the feast of Pentecost. He suggests, that the monks who are engaged in heavy and soiling work might be allowed to bathe more frequently and reemphasizes that all baths must be taken singly in a wooden tub (tina) capable of accommodating one person only. No monk, in taking his bath, should ever be in full sight of any other monk, or should ever be seen in the nude on this as well as any other occasion. Hildemar categorically rules out the use of "bathtubs made of stone, in which three or two or even four might bathe simultaneously" (petrinum balneum, ubi tres vel duo aut etiam quattuor balneari possint) and leaves no margin of doubt about the reason for this precaution; since the sharing of baths in such tubs will give occasion to "that most detestable crime" (in quo loco illius sceleris nefandissimi occasio potest esse) to which a monk must never succumb. "It would be of little help," so 212. CATALONIA. MONASTERY OF POBLET READER'S PULPIT IN REFECTORY (12TH CENT.) [after Enlart, II, 1904, fig. 13] A stair built in to the thickness of the wall leads to a niche lit by a window, with floor corbelled inward. Its protective wooden railing and the reader's lectern have disappeared. 213. WINCHESTER PSALTER (PSALTER OF HENRY OF BLOIS, 1129-1171) BRITISH MUSEUM (Cotton Nero C IV, fol. 17v) [by courtesy of the Trustees of the British Museum] Detail of an illumination which represents on the upper half of the page (not shown) the Wedding at Cana at the moment the company is seated, when the Virgin announces to Christ the lack of wine. The lower register (here shown) depicts the servants and butler of Architriclinus drawing the water which Christ will presently transform into wine, from a well (to the right) in pitchers taken from a tall cupboard; these are carried up a tall staircase running diagonally across the picture, to the upper story on which the feast takes place. The cupboard is gabled like the specimens from Germany shown in figs. 214 and 215. It is roughly 10 feet high and internally divided into three compartments by horizontal shelves. The manuscript is a superb product of the Winchester School, executed in the scriptorium of the Old Minster or Priory of St. Swithin's presumably between 1150-1160, and was probably made for Henry of Blois, brother of King Stephen, and Bishop of Winchester (1129-1171), who held the great Abbey of Glastonbury in plurality with the See of Winchester. Rich in narrative pictures taken from both Old and New Testaments, the manuscript combines mannerisms of the Winchester School, so brilliantly exhibited in the famous Winchester Bible, with a grotesque realism in which evil men are represented, as in scenes of the Betrayal and Flagellation. Hildemar contends in borrowing a phrase coined by St. Gregory, "to fortify an entire town, and yet leave a passage open through which the enemy may enter."83 83 Expositio Hildemari; ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 408. NUMBER, LOCATIONS &amp; LAYOUT OF FACILITIES FOR BATHING &amp; WASHING The Plan of St. Gall shows facilities for baths in four different locations. It provides for a bathhouse for the sick,84 84 See below, p. 315. a bathhouse for the novices,85 85 See below, p. 315. a bathhouse for the abbot,86 86 See below, p. 321. and a bathhouse for the monks. The bathhouse for the monks, or rather the "bathhouse and laundry for the monks" (balneatori? &amp; lauandi locus), since both these facilities were combined in the same structure, lies in the corner between the dormitory and the refectory. It is a rectangular structure measuring 22½ × 32½ feet, which is accessible from the calefactory of the monks by a covered passageway (egressus de pisale); it is divided internally into two rooms of approximately equal size, a laundry, which is provided with a fireplace, and a bathhouse with two tubs for bathing. Both rooms are entirely surrounded with wall benches, and the round arch over the door that connects the laundry with the bathing room suggests that the building was a masonry structure. Figure 210 is a reproduction of a woodcut in Schedel's Liber chronicarum,87 87 Schedel, Liber chronicarum (Nuremberg, 1493), fol. CV. depicting Seneca bleeding himself to death, which furnishes us with a convincing portrait of the kind of tub (cupa balneariatina) we could expect to find in this building. This example could be amplified by scores of others. These tubs may have been used for the washing of clothes as well as for bathing. Chapter 4 of the synod of 816 rules that the monks should do their own laundry,88 88 Synodi primae decr. auth., chap. 4; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 458. but the aged and sick, who were incapable of attending to this chore, could be relieved by others.89 89 Statuta Murbacensia, chap. 5; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 443-44. It is possible that a special entrance in the passageway that connects the laundry with the warming room owes its existence to this eventuality, since it would make the monks' laundry accessible to novices or serfs performing this labor for the weak and the aged. That the Laundry should be directly connected with the Warming Room makes sense, since the latter, as we have learned from Adalhard, was the place where the monks hung up their clothes for drying. But the washing room may also have been connected with the Dormitory. The layout of the beds provides for an exit directly over the egressus de pisale. III.1.8 REFECTORY AND VESTIARY The south side of the cloister is bounded by a building of two stories which on the ground floor contains the Monks' Refectory, and on the upper level their Vestiary (Infra refectorium supra uestiarium). A hexameter in the adjacent cloister walk refers to the Refectory with the words: Haec domus adsistit cunctis qua porgitur aesca This hall, where the food is laid out, has a place for everyone ROYAL BANQUET MICHAEL WOHLGEMUT, SCHATZBEHALTER, 1491, fol. 86 [after Fridolin, Schatzbehalter, ed. 1962] The Schrein und Schatzbehalter der wahren Reichtümer des Heils und der ewigen Seligkeit is a richly illustrated book for laymen, published in Nuremberg in 1491. Seventy-five of its woodcuts were made by Michael Wohlgemut, eleven by Hans Pleydenwurff. 215. AUSTRIA. BURG KREUZSTEIN. CUPBOARD, 14TH CENT. (1.32 × 0.70 × 0.42m) 216. HALBERSTADT, GERMANY. OUR LADY'S CHURCH ROMANESQUE CUPBOARD (2.35 × 0.83 × 0.85m) [both examples after August, 1950, 25] The walls of this type of cupboard—widely diffused in the Romanesque period and presumably of very old style—are formed of solid oak boards held together by iron bands also serving as hinges for the doors (usually two, one above the other, and a third in the gable). Refectory TABLES AND BENCHES The Plan provides us with a complete and detailed account of the furnishings of this hall (fig. 211). It shows in the center of the eastern, or upper, half of the hall the "table of the abbot" (mensa abbatis), a -shaped table with two arms 30 feet long, and a connecting head piece 10 feet long. Two longitudinal benches (scammum, aliud) range along the arms of the table. The center is left free for easy access by the servers. The abbot's table has a total length of 70 feet and can seat twelve persons on each of its long arms and four at its head, if we allow 2½ feet per person. Parallel to the abbot's table, on either side of the hall, are two L-shaped tables, each having a total length of 40 feet, providing space for sixteen persons per table. These tables are served by a single continuous wall bench which ranges around the circumference of the entire eastern half of the hall (sedes in circuitu) and also serves the abbot's table. The combined seating capacity of the upper portion of the hall is sixty: twenty-eight at the abbot's table, sixteen at the southern wall table, and sixteen at the northern wall table. The seating arrangement in the western or lower half of the hall is different. It consists of a straight center table (mensa) with benches on either side (sedile, aliud) 27½ feet long, permitting sitting space for twenty-two persons, and two L-shaped wall tables along the southern and northern walls of the hall, identical with the corresponding tables in the upper end of the hall, each seating nineteen persons. The total seating space at the lower end of the hall, despite the different layout, is the same as that in the upper half, viz., twenty-two at the center table, nineteen at the southern wall table, and nineteen at the northern wall table, equaling sixty. The grand total for the entire hall is 120, not counting the table for the visiting monks (ad sedend? c? hospitibus), which provides six additional seats, corresponding exactly to the number of beds available in the lodging for the visiting monks.90 90 See II, 140ff. The table for the visiting monks stands in front of the reader's pulpit. READER'S PULPIT The reader's pulpit (analogium) is marked by a square with a circle inside and appears to be raised on a platform. In later times the reader's pulpit generally consisted of a semicircular balcony with lectern corbelled out from the wall and accessible by a stairway built into the wall. A good example is the reader's pulpit in the refectory of the Cistercian monastery of Poblet, Catalonia (fig. 212).91 91 After Enlart, II, 1904, 35, fig. 13. In even better states of preservation are the pulpits of the refectories of the priory of St.-Martin-des-Champs at Paris,92 92 See Lenoir, II, 1856, 342, No. 492. the cathedral of Chester (Cheshire),93 93 Cook, 1961, pl. XV. and the Abbey of Beaulieu (Hampshire).94 94 Ibid., pl. XVI. Traces of others are found in many ruined abbeys, such as Tintern and Fountains.95 95 Brakspear, 1936. The pulpit of the Refectory of the Plan of St. Gall, however, is square, not semicircular or polygonal like the later examples. Moreover, the layout of the wall 217. PLAN OF ST. GALL.

Völckers' reconstruction is handsome, but incompatible with the inscription FORNAX SUPER ARCUS, "a stove supported by arches." Square stoves on arches with firing chambers and cooking wells must have been common in Antiquity as well as in the Middle Ages, as figs. 218-221 show. benches which run around the perimeter of the hall does not allow access to a stairway built into the wall itself. I am inclined to think that the pulpit was reached by an open stairway. The reader's pulpit faces the entrance to the Refectory, which lies in the middle of the southern cloister walk. The symbol used for this entrance differs from that of any other door on the Plan. It suggests a double door arrangement with entrance and exit separated by a median wall partition, such as are used as standard passageways even today in countless churches, in England as well as on the continent. CUPBOARDS The only other piece of furniture found in the Refectory of the Plan of St. Gall is a double square referred to as toregma. Square symbols designated by this term are found in two other places on the Plan, in each case within a dining area, in the Abbot's House, and in the House for Distinguished Guests (figs. 251 and 396). Keller interpreted these p. 310 symbols variously as "a large cupboard, probably for p. II.146 storing vessels" (Refectory),96 96 Keller, 1844, 22. "a vessel for washing hands" (Abbot's House),97 97 Ibid., 25. and "chairs or cushioned seats" (House for Distinguished Guests).98 98 Ibid., 26. Willis interpreted them as "presses,"99 99 Willis, 1848, 102, 107. Stephani as "cupboards,"100 100 Stephani, II, 190. and Lesne as "waterfountains."101 101 Lesne, VI, 1943, 46. The confusion stems from the spelling of the term toregma (plural, toregmata) which is otherwise unattested, and must be equated with the common word toreuma, which denotes either embossed metal objects (including statuary) or turned wooden objects, or the products in general of the woodworkers' craft (again extending to statuary). Du Cange under the word tornarius, i.e., "turner," states that a tornarius or tornator made toreumata. Since most of the plates and bowls from which the monks ate and in which their food was served were wrought on the turner's lath,102 102 Niermeyer (Med. Lat. lex. min., fasc. 11, 1964, 1032) glosses toreuma as "couch," "curtain" and "cupboard" with sources for all of these meanings. "Curtain" I find a little puzzling. But "couch" makes perfect sense, since the majority of the component parts of such a piece of furniture (like that of the church bench, shown above p. 152, fig. 100) were made of pieces of wood turned on the lathe. The author cited as source for "cupboard" is Ruodlieb, a writer who had "more than a casual knowledge of Greek", and the passage, in his courtly eleventh century novel, referred to by Niermeyer is of impeccable non-ambiguity: Mensa sublata properat sustollere uasa Ne mingat catta catulusque coinquinet illa, sedulus ac lauit, post in toreuma reponit. which Zeydel translates: "When the table had been removed, he hurries to clear away the dishes, lest the cat urinate on them or the dog soil them. With care he washes them and then puts them in the closet." (Ruodlieb, VI, 45-48, ed. Zeydel, 1959, 82-85; on Ruodlieb's proficiency in Greek, ibid., 23.) To "be turned" or serve as a container for objects produced on the turner's lathe appears to be the common denominator for the majority of the multiple meanings of the term toreuma. But the term was subjected to considerable strain by its medieval users. Charles Jones draws my attention to a passage in Einsiedeln Ms. 172, saec. X, a Commentary on Donatus (ed. Hermann Hagen in Keil, Grammatici Latini, VIII, 1870 (1961), 239, but repunctuated), wherein everything after balteus puerilis is a marginal addition: "τ????ω Graece torno, inde toreuma dicitur tornatura uel balteus puerilis—siue id quod eicitur de tornatura uel bullae quae in stillicidio apparent plauiali tempore. (Ad quorum similitudine calceoli fiebant nobilium puerorum, per quod designabatur quod, quamdiu his utebantur, alterius consilio indigebant; nam β???? Graece consilium, inde β????τ?? consiliarius.) Aliter hami loricarum ita uocantur." Jones translates: "τ????ω in Greek means `torno.' From this toreuma comes to mean `turner's ware' [uide Irminonis polypt. i, 34], or `a boy's belt' [balteus comes also to mean `palisade' (Niermeyer)]—or whatever is derived from turner's ware, or little balls (bullae) such as the hail that appears in a downpour during the rainy season. (They fabricate the sabots of noble boys out of bulbous discs shaped like that; and as long as the boys wear that kind of sabot, it shows that they still need supervision of someone else, for β???? in Greek means `counselling,' hence β????τ?? means `counsellor.') Elsewhere, the studs on breastplates are called toreuma." I am inclined to think that toregma or toregmata relates to the bowls and vessels used 219. GEORGIUS AGRICOLA. DE RE METALLICA, LIBRI XII, BOOK X, BASEL, 1556 SEPARATION OF GOLD AND SILVER WITH AQUA VALENS [after H. C. and L. H. Hoover, trans., London, 1912, 446] Agricola's woodcut portrays a furnace of the same construction type as the stove in the Monks' Kitchen, except in size. It is described in the text: "The furnace is built of bricks, rectangular, two feet long and wide and as many feet high and a half besides. It is covered with iron plates . . . which have in the center a round hole and on each side of the center hole two small round air holes. The lower part of the furnace, in order to hold the burning charcoal, has iron plates at the height of a palm . . . In the middle of the front there is the mouth, made for the purpose of putting fire into the furnace; this mouth is half a foot high and wide, and rounded at the top, and under it is the draught opening." Georgius Agricola (baptised Georg Bauer, 1494-1555) was a German expert in mining methods and metallurgical processes who wrote the first systematic treatise on these subjects. His informative and richly illustrated De re metallica, published in Basel in 1556, remained until the 18th century the authoritative handbook on mining. It owed its spectacular success to the author's broad knowledge of classical learning, acute power of empirical observation, and thorough acquaintance with technical installations used in the operation of mines. in eating and, by extension, to the piece of furniture in which this ware was stored. A twelfth-century manuscript in the British Museum, the Psalter of Henry of Blois, gives us a good idea how such a piece of furniture may have looked (fig. 213),103 103 See Wormald, 1973, 21-22. and a handsome woodcut by Michael Wohlgemut in the Schatzbehalter of Nuremberg (1491) shows such a cupboard in its setting, on a page that depicts a royal banquet (fig. 214).104 104 See Schiedlausky, 1956, 13 and Fridolin, 1962. A beautiful Tyrolian cupboard of the same variety, dating from the thirteenth or fourteenth century, exists in Burg Kreuzenstein (fig. 215).105 105 Falke, 1924, pl. 27a; and Schmitz, 1957, 31. Others, no less impressive, dating from the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries, may be found in Our Lady's Church in Halberstadt (fig. 216),106 106 Augst, 1950, 25. the Church of Schulpforta,107 107 Kohlhausen, 1955, 142, fig. 121; and Falk, 1924, pl. 26a. and the Museum of Wernigerode,108 108 Kohlhausen, 1955, 141, fig. 120; and Schmitz, 1957, 59. the Cathedral of Halberstadt,109 109 Falke, 1924, pl. 26b. and the Museum of Lübeck.110 110 Ibid., pl. 26c.

LACK OF FACILITIES FOR HEATING As one analyzes the layout of the Monks' Refectory one is struck by the observation that this large hall has no facilities for heating. It is provided neither with a hypocaust, nor with the kind of open fireplace that forms the central source of warmth in the guest and service buildings, nor with any corner fireplaces such as are provided to warm the bedrooms of the higher ranking officials of the monastery, and those of the distinguished guests.112 112 A full account of the heating devices used in the various installations shown on the Plan of St. Gall can be found in II, 117ff. It is impossible to look upon this omission as an oversight. The Refectory obviously was not meant to be heated. The only source of warmth available to this hall was the body heat of the people who assembled there during the meal hours which in the cold of the transalpine winters must often have been passed in an uncomfortable chill. This willful rejection of physical comfort surely can only be interpreted as a retention in ceonobitic medieval monachism of the ascetic attitudes of 220. MESOPOTAMIA. PALACE OF MARI BEGINNING OF 2ND MILLENNIUM B.C. [after Parrot, 1958, fig. 21] Five kitchen stoves forming a single range constructed of unfired bricks, with cooking wells and firing chambers all still containing charcoal, were found when this kitchen was excavated in 1935-1938. The entire range was so well preserved that it could have been put into operation without repair. 221. POMPEII. HOUSE OF THE VETII [after Mau, 1908, 274] This hearth is in essence merely a large square base, on the top of which meals are cooked with the aid of charcoal braziers. A rim around the edges of the cooking surface prevents cinders or ashes from falling on the floor. The hole at the bottom of the hearth is for storing of firing materials. But a hearth of identical construction with a corresponding opening serving as firing chamber is represented on a 2nd-century Roman relief at Igel near Trier (see Singer et al, II, 1956, 119, fig. 89). the early desert monks to whom eating was an irrelevant, even contemptible activity, gluttony no less than a venal sin. Again it was St. Benedict who reinstituted the meal as a normal function of life. One eats in order to live. Yet in furnishing the body with what is needed for its sustenance, one should not take more than is required for that purpose. Under no circumstances should one allow the meal or the refectory to become a preoccupation of the mind or the senses, or allow oneself to indulge in any form of excess. St. Benedict expresses himself in unequivocal terms on this point: "Above all things, gluttony must be avoided" (remota prae omnibus crapula).113 113 Benedicti regula, chap. 39; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 100; ed. McCann 1952, 94-95; ed. Steidle, 1952, 235. Rendering the refectory chilly and uncomfortable would reduce the temptation to linger over one's food unduly, and would prevent in large measure untoward enjoyment of what was served. To impose silence on those who congregated at the table, and direct their attention to the lessons of the Reader, were further means to forestall any unwarranted engrossment with the physical pleasures of eating. LAYOUT OF TABLES AND BENCHES IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE By contrast to this conspicuous disregard for comfortable standards in heating, the physical layout of the tables and benches in the Monks' Refectory is sophisticated and most carefully planned. The designing architect must not only have had accurate instructions concerning the number of people the Refectory was to accommodate in a single sitting, but also must have been fully aware of the precise needs in linear length of the tables and benches required to meet this condition.114 114 Cf. our remarks on the architect's awareness of precise scale relationships, see above, pp. 77ff. He solved his problem, as we have seen, by placing two tables in the center, and four along the walls of the room. The details of this concept pose fascinating, if unanswerable historical questions, into a discussion of which I enter in full awareness of its highly tentative and speculative nature. The desert monks thought so little of eating (or so much of its dangers!)115 115 Abbot Prior; see Steidle's commentary on this subject in Steidle, 1952, 235-36. that many of them preferred to ingest their food while standing or walking around. Of Father Sisoës it is said that he frequently did not know whether or not he had already taken his meal.116 116 Steidle, loc. cit. Tables on which to spread one's food, or chairs to sit upon while taking a meal, were incompatible with this concept and even the comfort offered by a simple stone or the crude stump of a tree, in this mode of thinking, was looked upon as a source of sensuous self indulgence. But when St. Pachomius took the epochal step of renouncing his hermitic past and founding, in a desolate place called Tabenissi, on the river Nile the first systematically organized community for monks, he furnished this monastery with a refectory where the monks took their meals seated at tables. They had to do this in rigid silence, their heads covered by their cowls, so that their eyes would only see the bowls from which they ate, and could not stray aside to look at any of the other monks. Yet no one was forced to come to the table and St. Pachomius, in fact considered it to be a higher form of religious attainment if a monk chose to dispense with the regular food either through fasting or relying on only the slimmest diet of bread, water, and salt which his superior, upon request, could allow him to take to his cell.117 117 On the refectory and the rules which govern eating in the Pachomian monasteries, see Grützmacher, 1896, 120-21; paragraph 5 of Jerome's preface to his translation of the Rule of St. Pachomius (Boon, 1932, 7) and chaps. 29-36 of the Rule (Boon, 1932, 20-22). For the occurrence of the terms mensa and sedere, see index of Boon's edition. The earliest monastic Refectory table known to me, if Sawyer's date of this building is correct (ca. A.D. 350), is that of the communal eating hall of the Coptic monastery Dair Baramus. See Sawyer, 1930, 324-25 and Pl. VIII, facing 321. While many may have chosen these individual forms of dietary ascetism as the more desirable path in their search for salvation, in a community whose population reached at its peak the staggering figure of 2,500 monks, the number of those who attended the common meal must still have been sufficiently large to call for a substantial and carefully planned arrangement of tables and benches. The only other sphere of life where men in comparable numbers assembled for a common meal must have been the eating halls of permanent Roman military camps, with the layout of which St. Pachomius must have been well acquainted from the days when he served in the Roman army.118 118 On the table and table customs in ancient Rome see the article mensa in Pauly-Wissowa's Real-Encyclopädie, VI:1, 1931, cols. 937-948. But little, if anything, seems to be known about the seating arrangement in the mess halls of Roman military camps (see fig. 211). It is MARMOUTIER, INDRE-ET-LOIRE, FRANCE. KITCHEN 222.A 222.B PLAN [after Viollet-le-Duc, Dictionnaire Raisonné, IV, 1858, 462 and 463] Like the Kitchen shown in fig. 223, this one is a masterpiece of functional construction. A natural fire hazard, this type of kitchen (whether monastic or secular) is invariably built as a separate entity a short distance from the eating hall, precisely as shown on the Plan of St. Gall (fig. 122). From the 12th century onward they were generally built in masonry, often in the shape of an inverted funnel and ventilated by a multitude of chimneys. The kitchen of Marmoutier has an external diameter of roughly 12m. It had five hearths installed in five niches, each with one central (A) and two lateral (B) chimneys. Three further chimneys emerge from the shell higher up in the vault, which terminates in a large central chimney (K) forming the top of the building. The stereotomy in structures of this type is almost beyond belief, and in an exterior view appears to defy gravity. Six arches of the Marmoutier interior support six squinches which, in turn, support a second set of six squinches. On these, the inverted masonry funnel rides magically on a circle of incredible shear stress. in this ambient, I presume—the same ambient to which monachism also probably owed the concept of its wall enclosure,119 119 On the walls enclosing the Pachomian monasteries of Egypt, see above, p. 71; on other architectural and organizational features, below p. 327 n2. —that we may have to look for the ultimate source for both the layout of the Pachomian refectory and its Roman prototypes and Carolingian derivatives. When monachism spread to the north, however, the monastic refectory may have been exposed to another secular influence, namely the large and festive banqueting halls that played such an important role in the life of the Germanic kings and chieftains. In the traditional Germanic FONTEVRAULT, MAINE-ET-LOIRE, FRANCE 223.A 223.B ABBEY KITCHEN [after Viollet-le-Duc, Dictionnaire Raisonné, IV, 1858, 468 and 470] A structure of unsurpassed sophistication, compared to which the Marmoutier kitchen (fig. 222) seems almost simplistic. The basic elements are the same: five niches with hearths for cooking. In Marmoutier these niches were contained within the shell of a structure presenting an externally smooth and continuous surface all the way to its top. At Fontevrault the niches sally outward, making the disposition of the inner spaces visible in the form of the outer shell. Buttresses are raised along lines where the niches meet, to receive the thrust of the vault that covers the center space. The latter consists of a daringly steep pyramid. It is composed of two octagonal cloister vaults, one superimposed upon the other, the transition from the square of the arch-framed center space being made by squinches with holes for smoke emission. The chimneys are pencil-shaped and terminate in lanterns. Structurally this building is an ingenious transposition to a centrally planned space of principles developed by the architects of the great Gothic cathedrals. eating hall—about which we are well informed by descriptions such as that of Hall Heorot in the Beowulf poem120 120 On Hall Heorot in the Beowulf poem see Heyne, 1864 and Pfeilstücker, 1936. (eighth century; but reflecting a tradition that reaches considerably farther back) and the realistic accounts of banquets in the Nordic sagas (ninth to twelfth centuries)121 121 On the arrangement of the tables and benches in the banqueting halls of North Germanic chieftains of the Saga period, see II, 23 on the setting up of special tables and benches in the nave of the hall, ibid., II, 24. —the retainers sat at tables and benches ranged along the walls of the house throughout the entire length of the building. The host sat on a high seat in the middle of one of the two aisles of the hall, his guest of honor on a corresponding seat in the middle of the opposite aisle. A cross bench at the inner end of the room was taken up by women. The fire burned in the middle of the center floor, from which the food and the drinks were served. Only on very rare occasions, i.e., when the number of guests was so large that not all of them could be accommodated in the aisles of the house, was the center floor taken up by an additional row of tables and benches.122 122 A typical example is the wedding banquet in Flugumyr discussed II, 81. On such occasions the physical layout of the Germanic banqueting hall, indeed, bore close resemblance to that found in monastic refectories, although there still remained an important difference: in the monastic refectories, the highest ranking person, the abbot, sat on the cross bench at the upper or eastern end of the hall; the entrance was in the middle of the long wall facing the cloister. This arrangement is more closely related to that of the later feudal halls (especially well known in England) where the lord dined on an elevated platform (dais) in the uppermost bay of the building, at a table placed crosswise to the long tables, while his retainers sat at tables ranging lengthwise down the aisles of the hall.123 123 On the layout of tables and benches in medieval feudal halls see II, figs. 339 and 346D; Horn, 1958, 9. The location of the table for the abbot, "the representative of Christ in the monastery,"124 124 Benedicti regula, chap. 2; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 19; ed. McCann 1952, 17; ed. Steidle, 1952, 79. Cf. below, p. 323. at the eastern head of the refectory unquestionably has its origins in the Christian ritual, which in turn was deeply influenced by the ceremonial of the Roman imperial court. The latter was also the ultimate source of the exalted position of the table of the medieval feudal lord, to whom I presume, this concept was transmitted by their royal overlords, after they assumed the successorship of the emperors of Rome. NUMBER AND HOURS OF MEALS OF THE MONKS The number and hours of the meals of the monks are regulated in Chapter 41 of the Rules of St. Benedict.125 125 Benedicti regula, chap. 41; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 102-104; ed. McCann, 1952, 98-99; ed. Steidle, 1952, 238-39. The schedule set forth there is, as Dom David Knowles has put it, "so foreign to anything in modern life, even among religious orders . . . that it is difficult, when reconstructing it in the imagination, to appreciate where its physical handicaps lay and where use had become second nature.126 126 Knowles, 1950, 449, whom I am following closely, at times verbatim, in the following paragraphs. During the winter, beginning with the thirteenth of September and ending with Ash Wednesday, the monks were allowed a single full meal per day which was eaten about two o'clock in the afternoon. The same schedule prevailed for the time of Lent, but in this period the meal was served after Vespers, i.e., about half past five or six. During the summer months, and on all Sundays and Feast Days, the monks ate two meals, one at midday, the other about six o'clock in the evening. This schedule made allowance for a rest after the midday meal. The most perplexing aspect of this schedule of meals, in the eyes of a modern observer, "is the assignment of the first meal to a time never less than ten, and throughout the winter of about twelve hours after rising."127 127 Ibid. The change from a winter schedule of one meal to a summer schedule of two, providing for a midday rest, is of course the product of the Mediterranean climate, in which monachism originated. There "the heat of the summer makes a siesta after the midday meal all but a physical necessity."128 128 Ibid. North of the Alps this routine was senseless, yet the force of tradition was so strong that it remained unmodified by any difference of climate or latitude throughout the entire Middle Ages. THE MONKS' DIET St. Benedict prescribes that every meal of the monks "should have two cooked dishes, on account of individual infirmities, so that he who perchance cannot eat of the one, may make his meal of the other . . . and if any fruit or young vegetables are available, let a third be added. (Sufficere credimus ad refectionem cotidianam tam sextae quam nonae omnibus mensis cocta duo pulmentaria propter diuersorum infirmitatibus, ut forte, qui ex illo non potuerit edere, ex alio reficiatur . . . et si fuerit, unde poma aut nascentia leguminum, addatur et tertium).129 129 Benedicti regula, chap. 39; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 99-100; ed. McCann, 1952, 94-97; ed. Steidle, 1952, 234-35. Hildemar, in commenting on this chapter, points out that in contrast to the biblical tradition where the term pulmentum is used for a considerably broader range of dishes (including meals made of venison), it is applied by St. Benedict exclusively to cooked dishes made "of vegetables, of cheese and eggs, and of flour" (de oleribus, de caseo et ovis et de farina). He adds to this that if the term is used without the qualifying adjective coctum it refers to uncooked dishes, "in which something is added to bread to make it better eating such as cheese, the leaves of leek [greens in general?] or egg, or other similar things" (quidquid pani adijicitur, ut melius ipse panis comedatur, sicuti est caseum et folia porrorum et ovum et CHICHESTER, SUSSEX, ENGLAND. KITCHEN, BISHOP'S PALACE 224.A 224.B 224.C RECORDED BY THE AUTHORS, 1960 With its simple square form and timbered roof, the kitchen of the bishop's palace at Chichester reflects the tradition of the Monks' Kitchen of the Plan of St. Gall (fig. 211) more closely than the elaborate structures of Fontevrault and Marmoutier (figs. 222-223), with their sophisticated masonry skills in arching and vaulting that one would scarcely expect to antedate the Romanesque and Gothic periods. The roof frame of Chichester, despite its primitive appearance, is nevertheless a highly evolved form of early English hammerbeam construction that apparently did not emerge before the end of the 13th century, and which became very fashionable shortly thereafter. It is formed of four trusses springing from trussed brackets suspended in the masonry walls, and was surmounted at its apex by an open lantern, now concealed by a modern ceiling added early in the 20th century. Certain constructional similarities of the scantling of the bishop's palace with that of St. Mary's Hospital in Chichester (figs. 341-343) suggest a late 13th- or early 14th-century date. cetera his similia). Each monk was allowed a pound of bread per day—St. Benedict calls it a "weighed pound" (panis libra una propensa), i.e., a quantity of bread whose mass was controlled by weighing it on the scales rather than by the estimate of the baker or servers.130 130 The term propensa is controversial. For a more detailed discussion see II, 255ff. On days on which two meals were served, one third of this allowance of bread was to be put aside for the evening meal. "Except the sick who are very weak, let all abstain entirely from the flesh of four-footed animals" (Carnium uero quadripedum omnimodo ab omnibus abstineatur comestio praeter omnino deuiles egrotos). St. Benedict states his views about the inadmissibility of meat from quadrupeds clearly enough, but frustrates his modern readers by not giving any reasons for this injunction. His ninth-century commentator Hildemar fortunately comes to aid in this matter: "It is on account of its pleasurable taste, not because of the number of feet that monks are known to abstain from the meat of four-footed animals" (et ideo propter suavitatem gustus, non propter numerum pedem abstinentes et poenitentes a carnibus abstinere noscuntur) . . . "For the desires of the flesh are more easily aroused where greater delight and pleasure is encountered in the food (eo quod stimuli carnis magis solent insurgere ubi major dulcedo et major suavitas gustus in cibum percipitur). He points to the example set by Christ and by the apostles, as well as by leading monastic authorities "of none of whom we read in scripture or in Church history that they ate any meat other than fish"; and concludes his argument with a quotation from the fifth book of the institutae patrum, where it is said that "the food of the monks must be such as to contribute to the sustenance of life, but not such as to arouse the desires of flesh and to subminister to vice" (ut ille cibus debeat esse monachorum, qui sustentationem tribuat vitae, non ille, qui occasionem concupiscentiis et vitiis subministrat).131 131 Expositio Hildemari, ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 441-42, commenting on chapter 39 of the Rule of St. Benedict, Hanslik, McCann and Steidle, loc. cit. The consumption of fowl was a controversial matter on which St. Benedict had failed to express himself. This was interpreted by many to mean that he condoned it. The reform movement of Benedict of Aniane attempted to eliminate the uncertainties that arose from this lack of specific legislation, but the directives issued at Aachen contradict, even annul, each other. The synod of 816 barred the consumption of poultry, except in case of sickness (Ut uolatilia intus forisue nisi pro infirmitate nullo tempore comedant).132 132 Synodi primae decr. auth., chap. 6; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 458. The council of 817 admitted it for the great feasts of Christmas and Easter for a period of eight days each (Ut uolatilia in Natiuitate Domini et Pascha tantum octo diebus si fuerit unde aut qui uoluerit comedant).133 133 Synodi secundae decr. auth., chap. 43; ed. Semmler, ibid., 481. A later capitulary reduced this span to four days.134 134 Verhulst and Semmler, 1963, 54. Scruples and doubts about the justifiability of this legislation continued to persist, as witnessed by Hildemar, who writes "the meat of fowl has an even more enticing flavor than that of four-footed animals, as the learned men point out, and as is confirmed by practice, in that kings and princes in their festive gatherings insist that because of its sweeter and more delightful flavor, after the meat from quadrupeds, the meat of fowl be served" (plus dulces carnes habere volatilia, quam quadrupedia, sicut doctores dicunt et usus comprobat in eo, quod reges et principes propter majorem dulcitudinem et suavitatem gustus post carnes quadrupedum in suis conviviis carnes volatilium praecipiunt sibi praeparari). Expositio Hildemari, ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 441. A second controversial issue taken up at Aachen concerned the question whether St. Benedict, in barring the flesh of quadrupeds from the monks' table, also eliminated the use of fats extracted from these creatures. Since his own monastery, Monte Cassino, lay in one of the richest olive-producing regions of Italy, it is probable, as Semmler has pointed out,135 135 Semmler, 1963, 52. that this question did not even enter his mind. North of the Alps, where olive oil was not available in sufficient quantity to satisfy the needs of the monks' kitchen, animal fats became a basic necessity.136 136 Ibid. Benedict of Aniane, after initially barring its use in the kitchen of his own monastery, eventually felt himself constrained to rescind this order.137 137 See "Vita Benedicti abbatis Anianensis," chap. 21; ed. Waitz, Mon. Germ. Hist., Script. XV:1, 1887, 209. The synod of 816 adopted this more moderate view and formally permitted the use of animal fats for cooking, except on Fridays, the twenty days before Christmas, and the period between Sunday Quinquagesima and the feast of Easter.138 138 Synodi primae decr. auth., chap. 20; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 462-63. This custom was universally adopted, with the exception of Adalhard of Corbie, who retained the position that fat from quadrupeds was meat and therefore subject to St. Benedict's injunction.139 139 Cf. Semmler, 1963, and notes to chap. 20 of the decreta authentica of the first synod, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 463. The Rule permitted each monk a hemina of wine per day, and the synod of 816 expanded this allowance, so when wine was not available in sufficient quantity, it could be replaced by twice its measure in beer.140 140 For more details on this, see below, pp. 296ff. The diet of the monk thus consisted of bread, a variety of dishes made of pulse, fresh vegetables and fruit when in season, a good measure of wine or beer, poultry at certain periods of the year, every variety of fish, and of course the entire gamut of dairy and poultry products such as milk, cheeses, and eggs. The Consuetudines Sublacenses contains a paragraph from which we may learn what, at the time of its writing, was considered a typical monastic menu: But today in the monastery of Subiaco this custom is followed: when there are two meals a day, namely on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, at the midday meal a course (ferculum) of chickpeas (de ciceribus) and of earth products (tellerinis) as well as a custard (subtestum) of eggs, cheese, and milk, and also fruits which are in season are put on the table. And on the same days, for the evening meal, a fried dish (una frictura) of eggs, or two fresh eggs prepared some 225. PLAN OF ST. GALL. CELLAR AND LARDER SAME SIZE AS ORIGINAL (1:192) The monastery's supply of wine and beer is stored on the ground floor of a building 40 by 87½ feet, the upper story of which serves as Larder. The Cellar accommodates five large and nine small barrels, with a storage capacity so calculated as to insure that each member of a community of approximately 300 men, could be issued one HEMINA of wine per day. The cultural history of wine and its containers is fascinating. The prehistoric homeland of the grapevine (VITIS VINIFERA) were the wooded regions extending from the Caucasus to the mountains of Thrace. At the beginning of historic times viticulture was already so widely diffused in the Near East as to make it impossible to ascribe its inception to any particular country (Lutz, 1922, 1ff). In pre-dynastic Egypt vineyards were planted to produce as a royal luxury funerary wines for its rulers. The liquid was stored in earthenware jars smeared inside with resin or bitumen for better preservation and also to improve its taste. These jars, almost identical in shape with those later used by the Greeks and Romans (fig. 226), had pointed bottoms and either rested in the ground or were set into wooden stands or stone rings. To store larger quantities, the Hittites and the Romans increased the jar size to impressive dimensions (figs. 227-228). Certain Greek authors were convinced that the culture of vines came to Greece from Asia Minor, together with Dionysios, a deity of Asiatic descent. The grapevine may first have been introduced to the Romans by the Etruscans who came to Italy from Central Anatolia around 900 B.C. (Forbes, 1956, 128). Greek colonists, after founding Marseille around 600 B.C., imported wine into the territory of the Celts, who made a major contribution to viticulture through invention of the wooden barrel (figs. 229-234). Propagated by the Gallic Celts, and by the Romans after the conquest of Gaul, viticulture penetrated north along the Rhône and the Saöne Rivers and through the Belfort Gap into the Moselle and Rhine valleys (Forbes, 1956, LOC. CIT.). The use of wine in the sacraments, as well as the solemn homage paid it by Christ himself, conferred upon wine a prestige that in the Middle Ages led to an extraordinary proliferation of vine growing north of the Alps. St. Benedict's allowance of one HEMINA of wine per day lent impetus and authority to the planting of vineyards and production of wine in monastic life. On the layout of the Cellar by modular grid, see fig. 70, p. 102; on the storage capacity of the Cellar and wine consumption, see fig. 235, p. 186 other way with a bit of cheese. On different days different courses should be prepared, for example, a course of beans (fabae) or peas (pisellae) or cabbages (caulae) and so forth and afterward fresh cheese with leftovers (recocta) or fishes with fruits in season. For dinner a cooked course with cheese and fruits. . . .141 141 Consuetadines Sublacenses, chap. 36; ed. Albers, in Cons. mon. II, 1905, 201-3. Apples, or any other fruit that is eaten raw, were divided equally among the brothers by the cellarer and laid out on the tables before the monks were seated.142 142 Memoriale Qualiter, chap. 4; ed. Morgand, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 257. Outside the regular mealtime the eating of fruit or any other sort of fresh vegetables was forbidden.143 143 Synodi primae decr. auth., chap. 8; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 459. MONKS' BEHAVIOR DURING THE MEAL The monks' behavior at mealtime is described in a compilation of monastic customs which was written toward the end of the eighth century, and appears to have been held in such esteem by Benedict of Aniane that he proposed to promulgate it by attaching it to the capitulary of 817.144 144 Memoriale Qualiter; ed. Morgand, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 177282; see chap. 5, De Refectione, ibid., 254-58. As the hour of the meal approaches, upon completion of the divine service, the monks wait in the choir, softly singing psalms. At the first sound of the bell, they walk to the refectory in order and, after having washed their hands, salute the cross with their faces turned east. When the bell rings again they kneel, say a verse, and recite the Lord's Prayer. Then the prior blesses the monks, the brothers take their seats at the table, each at his proper place, and thereafter they remain in complete silence. The boys are not seated separately, but are intermixed with their elders, two at each table.145 145 Expositio Hildemari; ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 427; see Hafner in Studien, 1962, 182. In Corbie the boys took their meals standing opposite their teachers.146 146 Expositio Hildemari, loc. cit. "If anyone does not arrive before the verse, so that all may say the verse and the prayers together and all at the same time go to the table . . . he shall be corrected once and a second time for this. If he still do not amend, he shall not be allowed to share the common meal; but let him be separated from the company of the brethren and take his meal alone, and be deprived of his allowance of wine, until he do penance and amend."147 147 Benedicti regula, chap. 43; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 108-110; ed. McCann, 1952, 103-5; ed. Steidle, 1952, 242-43. The food is served from the kitchen, beginning at the lower end of the refectory, near the kitchen, where the most recently admitted monks are seated and ending with the abbot at the upper, eastern end of the hall. When the bell rings a third time, the abbot blesses the bread and breaks it, and the brothers, after blessing each other in turn, begin to partake of their food. The lector ascends the pulpit and commences his reading. When the time comes to serve the wine, the cellarer motions to the server, and immediately upon this signal the junior brothers rise from their seats and fill the cups for the monks.148 148 According to the Capitula in Auuam directa (806-822), chap. 7 (ed. Frank, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 335) this task was performed by "8 to 10 monks." In carrying out this task they lower their heads, first to the Cross, then to the abbot, and finally in a circle to all of the brothers, whereafter they return to their seats. If there is anything the brothers need as they eat and drink they must supply it to one another, so that no one shall have to ask for anything. Should need arise, nevertheless, that something must be requested, it must be done by a sign rather than by speech.149 149 Benedicti regula, chap. 38; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 98-99; ed. McCann, 1952, 92-95; ed. Steidle, 1952, 233-34. When all the food is eaten, the reader stops his recitation, the brothers say a verse, rise from the table—the left-hand choir first, the right-hand choir next, and the abbot last—singing the fiftieth psalm. They enter the church in this manner, "bow to the Gloria," say the Lord's Prayer, and then proceed to the chapter "silently, as befits the time."150 150 Memoriale Qualiter; loc. cit. THE READER The reader is appointed for the entire week and enters upon his office on Sunday, after having received the blessing of his brothers in the preceding service. Before he ascends the pulpit he is given some bread and wine, and he takes his full meal only after the monks have eaten, together with the servers and kitcheners.151 151 Benedicti regula, chap. 38; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 99; ed. McCann, 1952, 94-95; ed. Steidle, 1952, 234. A chapter of the first synod of Aachen amplifies this tradition by stipulating that he should not receive anything else beyond what is granted to him by the Rule.152 152 Synodi primae decr. auth., chap. 27; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 465. The lector's reading is supervised by the corrector, who sits beside him on the pulpit. If need be, the latter rises, looks into the book and corrects the Reader "gently" (leniter).153 153 Expositio Hildemari; ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 426; see Hafner, in Studien, 1962, 182. THE SERVERS The Rule prescribes that no one be excused from service in the kitchen and in the refectory unless he be engaged in some more important task or is prevented by sickness. However, if the community is large, the cellarer may be relieved from this duty altogether.154 154 Benedicti regula, chap. 35, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 92-95; ed. McCann, 1952, 86-89; ed. Steidle, 1952, 226-28. In entering upon their weekly duty on Sundays, immediately after Lauds, the incoming servers, together with those whom they relieve, 226.

ROMAN DOLIUM The largest extant Roman DOLIUM, displayed on the podium of the Maison Carrée in Nîmes, near the Cella entrance. The height of the person standing to the right is 74 inches, ca. 1.88m. (photo: Horn). prostrate themselves before the brothers in the church and ask for their prayers. An hour before the meal, all are given, over and above their regular allowance, a drink and some bread, "in order that at the meal time they may serve their brethren without murmuring and undue hardship."155 155 Benedicti regula, loc. cit. The servers set the tables, bring in the food and take away what is left. In cleaning the tables after the meal they brush the crumbs into a canister with a broom made for that purpose.156 156 Consuetudines Sublacenses, chap. 25; ed. Albers, Cons. mon., II, 1905, 166. As they serve the food they must see to it that those who eat are not in want of any food or drink, that the brothers are not given less than the abbot, the juniors not less than the seniors, except for the boys who receive a smaller portion.157 157 Letter addressed to Abbot Haito of Reichenau by two of his monks after the synod of 817; see Capitula in Auuam directa, chap. 7; ed. Frank, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 335. If they distribute more or less than is right, or perform their tasks noisily, or if they neglect, lose, spill, or break something, or create damage in any other way, they must immediately ask for indulgence by throwing themselves on the ground before the prior, holding in their hand that which they have damaged, and telling what has happened.158 158 Capitula in Auuam directa, loc. cit.; and Memoriale Qualiter, chap. 4; ed. Morgand, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 245. After the monks have eaten, the servers take their own meal "not at one table but each in his proper place," and while they eat "the same texts that were recited to the others, will be recited to them."159 159 Synodi primae decr. auth., chap. 26; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 465. At the end of their weekly term the outgoing servers wash the towels the brethren use for drying their hands and restore the vessels to the cellarer "clean and sound." Then the cellarer delivers them to the monk whom he has placed in charge of the incoming servers "in order that he may know what he is giving out and what receiving back."160 160 Benedicti regula, loc. cit. Then together the outgoing and the incoming servers wash the feet of the whole community.161 161 For a detailed description of this, see Consuetudines Sublacenses, chap. 23, ed. Albers, Cons. mon., II, 1905, 164. WHO IS ADMITTED BESIDE THE MONKS The question of who was to be admitted to the refectory was never settled to everybody's satisfaction. In order to protect the life of the monks from being contaminated by association with visitors from the outside world, St. Benedict provided the abbot with his own kitchen, "so that the brethren may not be disturbed when guests— who are never lacking in a monastery—arrive at irregular hours."162 162 Benedicti regula, chap. 53; ed.

This rule had always been a source of annoyance to reform-eager souls, and the resulting uncertainties are reflected in conflicting legislation. Chapter 14 of the synod of 817 rules "that layman should not be conducted into the refectory for the sake of eating and drinking" (Ut laici in refectorium causa manducandi uel bibendi non ducantur),163 163 Synodi secundae decr. auth., chap. 14; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 476. but a directive which appears to have been issued not before 818-819 eased this directive by admitting ecclesiastics of superior rank, and noblemen.164 164 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 260; and Semmler, 1960, 350ff. Some abbots, such as Adalhard of Corbie, went even further by making this privilege available to paupers and secular canons of lower ranks.165 165 Verhulst and Semmler, loc. cit. Other monasteries retained the more restrictive customs of earlier periods, as is suggested by a passage in Ekkehard's Casus sancti Galli, which reads: The monastery of St. Gall, as I come to speak about this place, has always been held in such high veneration from the oldest memory of our fathers, that no one, not even the most powerful canon or 227.X BO&amp;#x01e6;AZKÖY, ANKARA, TURKEY, TEMPLE 1 This large pithos lies in the ground of a storeroom of the great Hittite temple built between 1275 and 1220 B.C. by the kings Hattusli III and Tudhalya IV [photo: Horn] 228.

Casus sancti Galli, chap. 136; ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 431-32; ed. Helbling, 1958, 226-27. Infractions of this rule are carefully recorded by Ekkehard, such as the time when King Conrad I surprised the monks of St. Gall, on December 26 of the year 911, by entering the refectory in the company of two bishops, with the word "With us you shall have to share your meal whether you wish or not!" and at the same time instructing Abbot Salomon not to join the party in the refectory but to preside over the table of the king's retainers in the House for Distinguished Guests—a complete reversal of the roles of abbot and emperor. The entry of laymen into the refectory could be legalized, however, by the act of confraternization, often performed on such occasions, and on the day after Conrad's first unauthorized entry into the refectory at St. Gall he petitioned to be voted in confraternity by the monks. This was granted him, and at the noon meal of the same day he again shared their company, during which the monks were treated to delicacies not permitted on their regular diet. "No one complained that this or that was contrary to custom," concludes Ekkehard's account of this unusual event, "although nothing like this had ever been heard or seen before, or even experienced by a monk in this house."167 167 Ibid., chap. 14; ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 54-58; ed. Helbling, 1958, 42-45. Vestiary Above the refectory there is a room of equal size for the storage of the monks' clothing. It must have been accessible by an external stairway from the southern cloister walk, but the Plan is not explicit on this point. As the draftsman chose to instruct us about the layout of the Refectory, we learn nothing about the arrangement of the Vestiary above it. We may imagine that it was equipped with chests, cupboards, and racks for storage of garments and blankets. 231. ROME.

ROMAN RELIEF [after Pignorius, De Servis, 1656, 226] Discovered in 1601, the panel shows the cellar of a Roman wine merchant of the Germanic provinces of Rome, with wine barrels being rolled into position and stored on a ledge. WHAT CLOTHES THE MONKS ARE TO WEAR In a chapter dealing with the quantities and the kinds of clothing that the monks should wear, St. Benedict enumerates what he considers necessary under ordinary conditions and advocates a certain amount of flexibility, "for in cold districts they will need more clothing, and in warm districts less."168 168 Benedicti regula, chap. 55; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 127-31; ed. McCann, 1952, 124-26; ed. Steidle, 1952, 268-73. The synod of 816 paid great attention to this question, and in a chapter of substantial length defined the standard issue of clothing for each monk as follows: Two shirts (camisias), two tunics (tunicas) two cowls (cucullas), and two copes (cappas), to each of which might be added a third one if necessity requires. Further: Four shoes (pedules), two pairs of hose (femoralia), one frock (roccum), one fur garment down to the heels (pelliciam usque ad talos), two head coverings (fasciolas)—two more of the same in case of a journey—one pair of summer gloves, in vulgar language called uuantos (manicas quas uulgo uuantos appellamus in aestate), one pair of winter gloves made of sheep skin (muffulas ueruicinas), two pairs of day shoes (cal- 232.

Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 462. This directive was generally accepted, as Semmler has pointed out (1963, 52). Another chapter rules that the clothing must be "of middling quality, neither too mean, nor too costly" (nec multum pretiosa sed mediocria),170 170 Synodi primae decr. auth., chap. 19; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 461. and Bishop Haito, in his commentary to the preliminary acts of the first synod specifically rules against "vestments made of goat fur or hemmed with silk" (capernina uestimenta seu sirico circum- suta).171 171 Statuta Murbacensia, chap. 14; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 446. A directive against luxury in the clothing of monks had been issued as early as 789 by Charlemagne; see Semmler, 1963, 52. The abbot wears the same clothes as the regular monks.172 172 Synodi primae decr. auth., chap. 23; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 464. The abbot must see to it that all of the issued garments fit their wearers properly, and that the monks return their old clothes as they receive new garments, so that they can be stored in the Vestiary for distribution to the poor.173 173 "Benedicti regula, loc. cit. A letter dispatched by Abbot Dietmar (778-797) of Monte Cassino to Count Dietrich informs us that this exchange of clothing occurred—appropriately enough—on the day of the feast of St. Martin (November 11) on which the monks presented themselves in the Vestiary, in solemn procession, singing psalms and carrying lamps. There, during the recitation of the Gospel passage, "Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor 233. GALLO-ROMAN STONE RELIEF, LANGERS, FRANCE. MUSÉE SAINT-DIDIER [Photo after plaster cast in the Musée des Antiquités Nationales, Chateau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye] A huge wine barrel, being transported on a four-wheeled cart drawn by two mules, shows the same concave curvature at the ends as the TUNNAE MINORES in the Cellar of the Plan of St. Gall (fig. 225). Judging by the size of the mules drawing the cart, as well as by the height of the body of its driver, this barrel must have been roughly of the same size as the TUNNAE. yet for your body, what we shall put on" (Matthew 6:25) the brothers were issued their new clothing.174 174 Theodomari epistola ad Theodoricum, 19; ed. Winandy and Hallinger, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 133-34. Also kept in the Vestiary, in compliance with a stipulation made in chapter 58 of the Rule of St. Benedict, are the clothes which a prospective monk wore when he first arrived at the monastery, and of which he was stripped before the altar during his formal and solemn reception into the community. They were held in readiness "should he ever listen to the persuasions of the devil and decide to leave the monastery (which God forbid)."175 175 Benedicti regula, chap. 58; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 137-38; ed. McCann, 1952, 133; ed. Stidle, 1952, 279. III.1.9 MONKS' KITCHEN LAYOUT AND FURNISHINGS From the western gable wall of the refectory an arched door leads into the "exit to the kitchen" (egressus ad coquinam). This passage is not straight, but broken, to baffle the kitchen noise—a courtesy to the hebdomadarius reading in the refectory. It had the additional advantage of removing the working area of the kitchen from the sight of the dining monks while the dishes were being carried in and out, and perhaps also to serve as a barrier for the kitchen odors. It is wide enough (44 inches) to permit two persons to pass each other. The kitchen forms a square approximately 30 × 30 feet,176 176 The dimensions of the kitchen, like those of the cellar (see below, p. 292) cannot be established with full accuracy, as both buildings lie close to a seam in the parchment which the draftsman wanted to avoid, thus slightly altering the original dimensions. which appears to be the norm for the period (fig. 211). The monks' kitchen of the Abbey of Cluny, described p. 263 in the Consuetudines Farfenses measured 30 × 25 feet, and the kitchen for the guests of the same monastery had the same dimensions.177 177 Consuetudines Farfenses, fol. 79; ed. Albers, Cons. mon., I, 1900, 137. On the nature of this source see II, 333. In the center of the kitchen a space almost 10 feet square is taken up by a large "hearth on arches" (fornax super arcus) with four circular openings for cooking. Around the stove are four work tables, and in each corner of the building is a large circular container. These are either tubs for washing the vegetables and dishes or additional cauldrons for heating water. A continuous range of wall benches, or work tables, runs around the entire periphery. DESIGN OF COOKING RANGE Völcker's reconstruction of a kitchen stove as an open fireplace surmounted by an arched canopy with a pyramidal smoke shaft overhead (fig. 217) is untenable.178 178 Völckers, 1949, 27. The stove p. 269 234. BAYEUX TAPESTRY (1073-1083). LADING OF WILLIAM'S SHIPS BAYEUX, CALVADOS, FRANCE. MUSÉE DE LA REINE MATHILDE The episode is the embarkation of the Conqueror's army, after the construction of his invasion fleet in or near Dives-sur-Mer, a Norman boat-building center some fourteen miles east of Caen. The scene is of supplies and arms being taken down to the ships and, in the detail shown above, a cart with a great barrel of wine is portrayed, as well as a shipment of helmets and lances that are being drawn to the beach by horsemen. The barrel is of the same shape, and appears to approximate the length of the TUNNAE MINORES in the Monks' Cellar (Fig. 225). Behind the cart walk two soldiers (not shown here), one carrying a huge animal skin and the other a small barrel; each a vessel for wine. The inscription above the cart translates: THESE MEN CARRY ARMS TO THE SHIPS, AND HERE THEY PULL A CART WITH WINE AND ARMS. The tapestry, a long stretch of bleached linen embroidered in colored wools (l. 231 feet, h. 20 inches, or 70.34 × 0.50 m.) was almost certainly commissioned by William's half-brother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, and Earl of Kent after 1067; he may have made a gift of it to Queen Mathilde. It is a tendentious apologia of William's conquest of England justified in terms of feudal promise, perjury, and retribution. Its style and the English spelling of place names disclose that it was made in England. For more detail see Gibbs-Smith, 1973, 4. PLAN OF ST. GALL: MONKS' CELLAR COMPARATIVE DIAGRAMS 235.A For the small barrels, with an average diameter of about 4.4 feet* * Respectively about five feet and ten feet at the greatest diameter. and an average length of about 11.5 feet, as scaled from the Plan, the volume per barrel computes to about 175 cubic feet or about 4960 liters, rounded off at 5000 liters. For the large barrels, with an average diameter of about 9.6 feet* * Respectively about five feet and ten feet at the greatest diameter. and an average length of about 14.5 feet, as scaled from the Plan, the volume per barrel computes to about 1060 cubic feet or about 30,000 liters. The contents of one large barrel could be drained into, and exactly fill, six of the nine small barrels. It is interesting that for a monastery population of 300, consuming one hemina of 0.2736 liters per day for 365 days, the total annual consumption computes at 29,920 liters, rounded off at 30,000 liters, identical with the contents of one large barrel. 235.B Cellar practice requires draining the entire content of one large barrel into smaller containers at the same time, since small daily withdrawals from a large barrel would shortly cause acetification of its remaining content. The six small barrels would contain wine used during the year, each small barrel holding two months' supply, a period that would not cause serious deterioration of the contents. If the vintage of any one year were held to mature for two subsequent years, three large barrels would have been required of the five shown on the Plan. The supply of wine to constantly top up these three, to offset considerable loss by evaporation, could be provided by the three remaining small barrels, after six of them had been filled by one large barrel. This would leave two large barrels for extra wine or beer storage. 235.C If the wine allowance per person were doubled, it must be assumed that the wine would be allowed to mature for only one year after the initial vintage year. Four large barrels would be required, since two barrels a year would be consumed instead of one per year (as in 235.B). Two large barrels would be drained off during the year with six small barrels filled every six months. This would leave two small barrels to supply losses by evaporation, and one large and one small barrel for beer storage. CONCLUSION The maximum capacity of the cellar of the Plan of St. Gall appears to have been 0.54 liters, or two heminae of wine per day per person with not more than one year of maturing after the year of vintage, since two years of maturation would have required six large barrels. The scheme shown in 235.C (requiring four barrels for a production cycle) leaves two barrels for beer, or one barrel for beer and one for a special reserve of wine. The analysis given here, certainly conjectural, fits together with an ease and flexibility not reconcilable with the notion that the drawing on the Plan of the barrels was a draftsman's whimsical symbol for "Here is the cellar." See pages 292 through 305 for discussion of the cellar. E.B. of the Kitchen of the Plan of St. Gall was supported, not surmounted, by arches, as its explanatory title discloses in unmistakable terms (fornax super arcus). Square arch-supported stoves for cooking or firing are pictured on fifteenth- and sixteenth-century woodcuts, such as the "Kitchen with Cook and Maid" in the Kuchemaistrey, published in Augsburg in 1507 (fig. 218),179 179 After Schiedlausky, 1956, 22. or the "Alchemist's Workshop" in Cajus Agricola's De re metallica, published in Basel in 1556 (fig. 219).180 180 After Schmithals and Klemm, 1958, 21. The arches that support the cooking range release sufficient space beneath for the storage of wood and kindling. The heat is produced in firing chambers built into the body of the stove. Cooking ranges of this type were in use in Mediterranean countries at very early times. Figure 220181 181 After Parrot, 1958, fig. 21. reproduces a sketch of a kitchen stove in the palace of Mari, Mesopotamia (excavated in 1935-38), from the beginning of the second millennium B.C. It was built of unbaked bricks and consisted of five firing holes and five cooking units set up in a single range. A square hearth on arches stood in the kitchen of the House of the Vettii in Pompeii, but does not appear to have been furnished with any firing chambers (fig. 221).182 182 After Mau, 1908, 274. In Roman family life much of the cooking could of course be done on top of the stove over open charcoal fires; in a monastic kitchen, which had to serve 120 monks each session, this method would have been impracticable. ARCHITECTURAL SHELL In reconstructing the architectural shell of this interesting building we have a wide range of choices. One thinks immediately, of course, of those masterpieces of functional construction—the medieval kitchens of Marmoutier (fig. 222), Fontevrault (fig. 223), and Glastonbury, or the kitchen of the palace of Saumur, the chimneys of which can be spotted on the charming September picture of the Très Riches Heures de Jean de France.183 183 With regard to the kitchens of Marmoutier and Fontevrault, see Viollet-le-Duc, Dictionnaire, under "cuisine." For Glastonbury, see Willis, 1886, and Bond, 1925; for the kitchen of the castle of Saumur, see Durrieu, 1904, pl. IX, facing 150. These are the buildings Gruber had in mind when he reconstructed the Monks' Kitchen of the Plan of St. Gall as a masonry structure with p. II. 21 a large pyramidal roof (fig. 282).184 184 Gruber, 1952, 25, fig. 15. On the opposite end of our range of choices there are such simple wooden sheds as the one shown in the picture of the bakehouse of the p. II. 135 Behaim Codex in Kraków (fig. 387).185 185 Winkler, 1941, pl. 4. The Kitchen of the Plan of St. Gall may have belonged to the latter type. A third and perhaps more likely possibility is that its walls were built in masonry but its roof framed in timber. An interesting example of this variant survives in the kitchen of the Bishop's Palace at Chichester (Sussex; fig. 224),186 186 With regard to the kitchen of the Bishop's Palace at Chichester, see Hannah, 1909, 3; VHC, Sussex III, 1935, 148; Wood, 1935, 390; Emmery, 1958, 195. The picture of the interior of the kitchen, shown in fig. 224, is from a painting made around 1850 by George Barry. The upper part of the roof was closed in with a ceiling in 1929. an early example of hammer beam construction, dating probably from the beginning of the fourteenth century.187 187 A date in the early fourteenth century is suggested by the fact that the braces that support the hammer beams of the kitchen of the Bishop's Palace at Chichester have certain similarities with the timbers that brace the frame of St. Mary's Hospital in Chichester (end of the thirteenth century). For St. Mary's Hospital, see Dollman, 1885, pl. 21 and 22; idem, II, 1863, pl. 26 and 27; VHC, Sussex, III, 1907, 100-102; Ostendorf, 1908, 100; Powell, 1955; Arch. Journ., XCII, 1935, 394, fig. 2 (plan). KITCHEN UTENSILS A complete account of the equipment and utensils "that should never be wanting" in a monastic kitchen is given in the Customary of Cluny, written by the German monk Ulrich in the last quarter of the eleventh century.188 188 Udalrici Cluniacensis monachi Cluniacenses consuetudines, Book II, chap. 36; Migne, Patr. Lat., 149, cols. 729-30. We could not ask for a more authentic interpretation of the accoutrements in the Kitchen of the Plan of St. Gall: Three cauldrons (caldaria): one for cooking the beans (fabas); the other for cooking the vegetables (olera); and the third on an iron tripod (cum tripode ferrea) for heating water, should it be needed for the washing of clothes. Four additional basins (cuppae): one to keep the half-cooked beans; the second with running water (in qua cadit aquaeductus) for cleaning the vegetables before they are put into the cooking cauldron; the third for washing the plates (scutellae); and the fourth for heating the water that is needed for washing the feet of the monks (mandatum) and for shaving (ad rasuram). Further, four ladles (cochlearia): one for the beans; one for vegetables; the third, a little smaller, for skimming the fat (ad saginam exprimendam); and a fourth, made of iron, to cover the cinders of the stove. Lastly, a pair of tongs (forceps) to reduce or quench the fire. In addition: four pairs of protective sleeves (manicae), to prevent the shirts of the monks from being soiled by the ever present soot of the kitchen; two special gloves (palmariae), to shield the hands of the monks against the heat of the cooking vessels as they are removed from the fire and tipped; three towels (manutergiola), to be replaced each Thursday, with which the kitcheners clean their hands; a knife to cut the lard (cultrum ad lardum) and a whetstone for sharpening it (cotis ad acuendum); a skillet (patella) for heating water and for melting lard, and a smaller one, with tiny holes in the bottom, to strain the fat (in fundo minutatim perforata ut ipse adeps coletur). Also: a salt box (pyxis in qua sal recondatur); a chest (scrinium) to store odds and ends (minora); a bucket (urna) for drawing water; two brushes (scopae) for scrubbing the cauldrons after cooking; two ends of wire netting (retis abcisiones) to clean both cauldrons and plates; two tables, one for stacking the plates (scutellas) 236. PLAN OF ST. GALL. NOVITIATE AND INFIRMARY WITH KITCHENS &amp; BATHHOUSES SHOWN ½ ORIGINAL SIZE (1:384) Right: the Novitiate; left: the Infirmary, each a smaller replica of the Cloister of the Monks. These facilities flank a double-apsed church, internally divided by a median transverse wall into two separate chapels: one for the Novices (facing east), the other for the ill (facing west). The layout is more Roman in spirit than any other building on the Plan, and is without antecedent in either Early Christian or early medieval architecture. It has its roots instead in Roman imperial audience halls (fig. 240) and luxurious Roman villas (figs. 241-242). after they have been rinsed immediately following the meal, the other for stacking them for the subsequent day after being thoroughly cleaned. Lastly: two seats (sedilia), called benches (banci) in vulgar Latin; a four-legged stand of moderate height (cella quadripoda et submissa) on which the basin with the vegetables is placed before they are put into the cooking cauldron; a large stone, perhaps even a millstone, upon which any of the cauldrons may be put when beans or vegetables are served; another one to serve as a stand for the basin in which the plates are washed between meals. There is a bellows to blow the fire (follis ad sufflandum ignem) and a fan woven of pliant twigs to air it (flabellum vimineum ad ventilandum); a pole (contus) to carry cauldrons, another one to reduce the fire (ad ignis dimotionem); a trough (canalis) for water, for the frequent washing of hands; two swinging cranes of triangular shape (trigoni), each made of three beams so joined together at irregular angles (de tribus lignis licet imparibus angulis facti) that they may be turned like doors in this and in that direction. To this frame, chains are attached to carry the cauldrons which, suspended in this manner, may be filled with water at the aqueduct (prope aquaeductum) and then moved without strain to the fire. Among other things, Ulrich also tells us that the fire in the kitchen is never allowed to die out, but is carefully covered in the evening, so that on the coming morning it is found alive.189 189 Ibid., col. 728. RULES GOVERNING WORK IN THE KITCHEN The management of the kitchen, like that of the refectory, comes under the jurisdiction of the cellarer, whom Adalhard warns about getting so immersed in the detail of chores that can be handled by others, that he may not keep himself free for the important task of directing and supervising 237. PLAN OF ST. GALL. KITCHEN &amp; BATHHOUSE OF NOVITIATE AND INFIRMARY* * The illustration, figure 237, shows the facility for Novices. The Infirmary facility is identical but of opposite hand, i.e. flopped plan. AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION Because of their different diets and remoteness from the Monks' Kitchen and Bathhouse, the planner provided the ill with a kitchen-bath building adjacent to the infirmary, and a similar kitchen-bath building for the novices symmetrically located on the south. The Plan, in this part, reveals remarkable responsiveness to administration, practical convenience, and professional care. The walls could have been of masonry where we show timber construction. the entire operation.190 190 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 5; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 384, and Jones, III, Appendix II, 109. The labor in the kitchen is done by the monks themselves, who are assigned to this task in weekly shifts. Talk is permitted only when the fulfillment of a chore makes speech inevitable. For the rest of the time all work is done with the brothers continually singing psalms.191 191 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 5; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 385: "But to keep these matters from slipping from anyone's mind, because of some earlier code, we herewith briefly formulate the three principles underlying all these statements: that is, either keep quiet if the matters are not essential, or say what is necessary, or else chant psalms" and Jones, III, Appendix II, 110. Laymen and serfs are not permitted in the kitchen. Adalhard of Corbie is very emphatic on this point and orders that if laymen assist in the task of preparing and cleaning the food, "some window, niche, or opening outside of the kitchen should be set up as a place where the brothers may pick up the food to be prepared or carry the food to be washed."192 192 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 5; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 386-87. "If there are vegetables to be cleaned or dressed for cooking, or fish to be gutted or scaled, or beans of different sorts to be washed or prepared," he adds, "the laymen must fully and honestly perform these tasks outside the kitchen as many times as is necessary, and in places assigned for the purpose. They must use great care to place or stack the food in a spot where the brothers can conveniently pick it up. . . . If this procedure is followed, the laymen will not have to come in to the brothers, nor will the brothers have to go out to them."193 193 Ibid. 238.

The Chirurgia of Rogerius Salernitanus (1108-1170) is a work marking the beginning of the medieval renascence of ancient surgical learning and practice. From Roger's time to the end of the Middle Ages, it served as the authoritative text for surgery both north and south of the Alps. Roger was a student of Greek and Arabic sources, and as a practicing surgeon, a man of vast experience and great originality of judgement. The Church prohibited the clergy from practicing surgery, and not until the 18th century was surgery accepted as an autonomous discipline in European universities. 239. ROME. TRAJAN'S BASILICA AND FORUM (DEDICATED 313). PLAN [after Enciclopedia dell'Arte Antica, VI, 1965, 838, fig. 951] Platner termed this complex the "last, largest and most magnificent of the imperial fora built by Trajan . . . probably the most impressive and magnificent group of buildings in Rome." In final form it had five parts: the forum proper; the basilica Ulpia; the column of Trajan; two halls housing the library; and the great temple of Trajan erected by Hadrian after Trajan's death in A.D. 116. The site dimensions are 185 × 310 m. The forum itself consists of a rectangular court, with colonnades on three sides and two semicircular exedrae facing each other across the court in the middle of its two long sides. The court is entered through a central gate in a convex wall contiguous to the forum of Augustus. The basilica Ulpia lies at the eastern end of this court, its axis at right angles to that of the forum. It is rectangular in plan, five-aisled, with an apse at each of its two narrow ends, and three monumental portals on the long side facing the forum. Two doors in the opposite wall give access to the small, open court that accommodates in its center the famous column of Trajan, whose pedestal served as a sepulchral chamber for the emperor's ashes and whose shaft displays reliefs arranged in a spiral band, representing the principal events of Trajan's campaign in Dacia (A.D. 101-106). The rest of the court is taken up by two halls housing the library, one for Greek, the other for Latin manuscripts. In the east the forum terminates in a monumental hemicycle, in the axis of which Hodrian erected the great temple honoring Trajan and his wife Plotina. The ruins of the temple of Trajan were eventually covered by almost two millennia of rubble. But during the Carolingian period its buildings, although damaged, were probably sufficiently well preserved to convey an accurate image of their original appearance and composition. The real disintegration occurred in the later Middle Ages and Renaissance, when Rome began to grow again and the ruins of the ancient city were quarried by everyone needing building materials. The culmination of interest in this great expanse of magnificence and splendor is the Column of Trajan, A.D. 114. Of special interest, set above the doorway to the sepulchral chamber in the base of the shaft, is a single stone about nine feet wide and a little less than four feet high. On this stone is to be seen a dedicatory inscription, carved and composed in six lines of lettering created and executed in a manner never surpassed and rarely equalled. Here, one finds exemplified "a monumental writing such as the world has not seen since" (David Diringer). Roman capital letters, capitales quadratoe, attained the level of their highest perfection in the first and second centuries A.D. Roman letters of this excellence (on the tomb of a great emperor, flanked on each side by a library for manuscripts) became symbols that helped shape learning and education in the renaissance of Charlemagne. The Roman letter prevails today. The display type used in this book, designed by Eric Gill, himself a cutter of letters in stone, is directly related to the Roman model cut in stone. E.B. 240.A TRIER. AULA OF IMPERIAL PALACE PLAN (4th century) The aula, whose axis runs from south to north is 67 × 30 × 27.5m. It was preceded by a monumental narthex and terminates in the north in a large apse, which contained the emperor's throne. The entire floor of the hall (nearly 1700 sq. m.) was underpinned by a hypocaust system with tubes in the long walls carrying heat to a height of 8m. The aula was flanked on either side by a narrow colonnaded court. While the precise layout of these courts became known only through recent excavations, it is possible that in Charlemagne's time they were still intact. They might therefore have exerted a direct influence on the creation of concepts embodied in the layout of the Novitiate and Infirmary of the Plan of St. Gall. III.1.30 CELLAR AND LARDER The Cellar and Larder is contiguous to the western cloister walk, whose inscription refers to these facilities (fig. 225) with the hexameter: Huic porticui potus quoq·cella coher &amp; To this porch is attached the cellar in which the drinks are stored The building is 87½ feet long and, like the Dormitory and the Refectory, was probably meant to be 40 feet wide. The line that defines its southern long wall is disturbed in its course, probably because the draftsman wanted to avoid the stitches of the seam that runs along the line where this wall should be, had it been placed in its proper position. Because of the overlapping margins of the two joining sheets, the parchment is so thick along this line that it would have been impossible for the scribe who traced the copy, even under the most favorable light conditions, to recognize the details of the prototype plan. Cellar LAYOUT, DESIGN, AND DIMENSIONS OF CASKS The Cellar occupies the ground floor of a double-storied structure, the upper level of which contains the Larder and other necessary supplies (Infra cellarium. Supra lardari? &amp; alior? necessarioriu repositio). The Cellar is equipped with two rows of barrels set on rails: five large ones (maiores tunnae) and nine smaller ones (minores). The small barrels are 10 feet long and have a maximum diameter of 5 feet. Their staves, convex for most of the length of the barrel, take a turn toward the concave as they reach the end of the cask. The large barrels are 15 feet long and have a central diameter of 10 feet. Their staves are convex for the entire length of the vessel. The scribe does not distinguish which size barrel was used for wine and which for beer. (My colleague, Prof. M. A. Amerine, assures me that there is no technical reason why the same barrel might not be used successively for the storage of wine and of beer, except that red wine deposits pigment in the wood of the cask which, if the cask is then used for beer or white wine, tends to discolor these liquids.) It is likely that the practice was followed of decanting the contents of large wine casks into smaller ones, as volume was reduced through evaporation and consumption, in order to prevent the wine spoiling from contact with air. During the aging of wine, as modern enologists point out,194 194 See M. A. Amerine and M. A. Joslyn, 1970, 617-18. there is a constant loss of liquid (called "ullage") through the wood of the cask in which the wine is stored, a loss which will cause acetification of the wine if it is not made up. To prevent this occurrence, accepted modern practice requires that large containers of wine be refilled periodically (a process in California wineries called "topping") 240.B TRIER. AULA OF IMPERIAL PALACE. PERSPECTIVE FROM SOUTHEAST [by courtesy of the Laudesmuseum, Trier] The narthex (its walls are no longer standing) was internally divided into an entrance hall projecting forward, and presumably also reaching higher up than the two lateral arms, from which doors lead into the galleries of the two courts flanking the hall. with the same kind of wine, and preferably of the same vintage, a supply of which is stored in smaller casks and demijohns. The Monks' Cellar on the Plan of St. Gall, with its different sizes of barrels, would be perfectly equipped to handle this problem and the layout may indeed suggest that both operations, the topping of larger from smaller casks, as well as the decanting of larger barrels into several smaller ones, were practiced in the monastic wineries of the ninth century. Another reason for having a larger number of small barrels, in addition to the big ones is that this made it possible to store smaller quantities of wine, obtained from different vinyards, in separate containers and thus to retain their specific character. THE BARRELS IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE An invention of the Celts Recent research has shown that the practice of storing and moving wine in wooden casks made its appearance in Europe in the first century B.C. in the territory of the Celts and of the Illyrians. Pliny the Elder (A.D. 23/24-79) states that "in the neighborhood of the Alps people put [wine] into wooden casks and closed these round with hoops."195 195 Pliny, Hist. Nat., book XIV, chap. 27, ed. Rackham (Loeb Classical Library), Harvard Univ.-London, IV 1952, 272-73: circa Alpes ligneis vasis [vinum] condunt circulisque cingunt. Edward Hyams in an intriguing, but poorly annotated, book ascribes this invention to the Allobroges, a Celtic tribe that lived in and around the valley of one of the principal alpine tributaries of the Rhone river, the Isère (modern Dauphinois) where wine was first grown north of Italy.196 196 See Edward Hyams' interesting discussion of this subject in Dionysos, A Social History of the Wine Vine, New York, 1965, 164ff (a book brought to my attention by my colleague William B. Fretter, to whom I owe much other valuable information bearing on the problems raised by the Monks' Cellar). Hyams (op. cit., 165) names Pliny the Elder as the source for his contention "that the practice of storing and moving wine in wooden casks was of Allobrogian origin." I am not sure that this may not be straining the available evidence. But Hyams is surely on solid ground when pointing out that the customs of storing and moving wine in barrels has a prelude in the Near East, recorded by Herodotus (c. 484425 B.C.) who says that wine trade was carried on in palmwood casks floated down the Euphrates river from Armenia on circular boats made of skin (the source is quoted in full in Hyams, op. cit., 40). Strabo (64/63 B.C.-A.D. 21 at least) informs us that KONZ (CONTIONACUM) 241.B PERSPECTIVE RECONSTRUCTION [by courtesy of the Landesmuseum, Trier] 241.A PLAN 1:600 [by courtesy of the Landesmuseum, Trier] A summer residence of the Roman emperors in Trier, on a plateau above the confluence of the Saar and Moselle rivers, the palace consisted of a central heatable audience hall with apse—a much smaller replica of the great aula of Trier (fig. 240), plus two outer wings running parallel to the audience hall and separated from it by two inner courts. The wings were used as living quarters and included a bath. The grouping of the principal building masses, in their perfect bisymmetry, bears striking resemblance to the layout of the Novitiate and Infirmary complex of the Plan of St. Gall, except that in the villa of Konz the open courts were not colonnaded. wooden casks "larger than houses" (????? ξ???ν?? ???ζ??? ???ων) were used to store wine in Cisalpine Gaul,197 197 Strabo, Geography, book V, chap. 1, ed. H. L. Jones (Loeb Classical Library), Harvard Univ.-London, VIII, 1959, 332-33. and that the Illyrians brought their wine from Aquileia to various markets in wooden casks in exchange for slaves, cattle and hides.198 198 Strabo, op. cit., ed. cit., 316-17: ????ξ???? ?' ?&amp;#x1f57;τ?? ??ν τ? ?? ????ττη?, ??? ?&amp;#x1f36;ν?ν ??? ξ???νων ???ων &amp;#x1f01;?????ξ??? ?ν???ντ?? ??? &amp;#x1f12;????ν, ???&amp;#x1fd0;ν?? ?' ?ν??????? ??? β??????τ? ??? ?????τ?. Egyptian &amp; Greco-Roman methods of storing wine The Romans, who like the Greeks and Egyptians, stored and carried their wine in earthenware amphorae (fig. 227) were startled by this ingenious innovation. Hyams believes that this invention of storing wine in huge containers formed by a multitude of separate pieces was dependent on the more temperate climate prevalent in the lower Alps, where barrels could more easily be kept in good condition than in the hot and dry climate of the mediterranean countries.199 199 Hyams, op. cit., 165. Unlike the more breakable and considerably smaller amphora used in the classical world (as an official capacity measure the amphora was the equivalent of 25.5 liters) the wooden barrel was capable of storing wine in larger quantities, and at considerably lower cost. Its primary contribution to western life, however, appears to have lain not so much in this as in the fact that it enabled man to develop superior vintages by offering more favorable conditions for the aging of wines. Edward Hyams purports this fact to constitute the great difference between the wines of antiquity (made from sweet grapes and stored in heavily pitched containers offering poor conditions for maturing) and the wine of modern times (made from smaller and more acid grapes and susceptible to oxygenization under the influence of air filtering through the pores of the wood).200 200 Hyams, op. cit., 167. On the special role of wooden casks in aging wine by allowing a very slow diffusion of oxygen through the wood, and on the contribution made to the flavor of wines through the oak of the barrel staves, see Amerine-Singleton, 1968, 107. From a reading of Hyam's interesting study one may gather the impression that the ancients drank only young wines. This is clearly not the case, as a perusal of Billiard's exemplary and carefully documented study on wine and vines in the ancient world will show. Pliny (Hist. Nat., XXIII, 22, 3) makes it a point to emphasize that a good wine should neither be too young nor too old. Galen (De antidotis, I, 3) and Athenaeus (Deipn., I, 26, b) write that the wine of Alba reaches its maturity after fifteen years; the wines of Tibur, Pompeii and Labicum after ten years. Greek wines are said to decline after six or seven years (Pliny, Hist. Nat., XIV, 10, 2; Athenaeus, Deipn., I, 26, b). The wine of Falerno, bitter when young, became drinkable after ten years, and after fifteen or twenty years acquired the exquisite refinement that made it an incomparable liqueur (Pliny, Hist. Nat., XXIII, 20, 2). It could attain thirty or forty years (Petronius, Trim., XXXIV), but having reached that age, it began to turn (Cicero, Brutus, 83).201 201 See Billiard, 1913, 215ff; and Seltman, 1957, 152ff. Other works on this subject, such as Curtel, 1903; Ricci, 1924; Remark, 1927 and Reichter, 1932 were not available to me. If there was a difference, then, it could not have been in the possession or want of knowledge about the virtues of aging but in the more favorable conditions offered for this process by the new material used for the containers in which wine was matured. The ancients when faced with the problem of storing wine in bulk, did so by putting it into large earthenware vessels (dolia, Old Latin: calpares) which were covered by a convex lid (operculum) sealed to the body of the vessel by a heavy layer of pitch. These vessels were buried to the rim in a deep layer of sand (fig. 228). Some of the larger dolia were so high that a fully grown man could stand erect inside without being visible. The specimen shown (fig. 227) has a height of 6 feet 3 inches (1.90 m.), a circumference of 14 feet 8 inches (4.45 m.) and a storage capacity of 211 U.S. gallons (800 liters). There is no need to emphasize that these large earthenware containers must have been frightfully expensive, since their manufacture was dependent on firing ovens of unusual dimensions; and that to transport them, even over small distances, posed delicate problems, both in view of their weight and their susceptibility to breakage. It is also quite obvious that there was a non-transgressible upper limit for the size of an earthenware container that had to be fired in a single piece. The barrel: constructional &amp; viticultural advantages The barrel was free of any such limitations. Being composed of a multitude of long and narrow staves (laminae, tabulae) forced into position by iron hoops (circuli) its volume could be extended to previously unfeasible proportions, as witnessed by the casks, "as large as houses" which Strabo saw in Cisalpine Gaul, or the monster cask in the Castle of Heidelberg, which has a storage capacity of 49,000 gallons: 232 times the volume of the large dolium of the Maison Carrée in Nîmes (fig. 227). The transport of such large containers posed no problem whatsoever, since they were assembled on the spot. Smaller barrels, as a glance at fig. 230 shows, could even be rolled on the ground. Being set up above the ground the content of these containers was more easily tapped than that of the buried dolia; it did not require that the container itself be opened, another advantage to the process of aging. The oldest extant barrel and the earliest visual representations The oldest extant wooden barrel, to the best of my knowledge, is a cask that was lifted from a pond outside the city of Mainz in Germany, together with numerous other Roman objects (fig. 229.B). It was filled with fillets of fish. An oak barrel virtually contemporaneous with those shown on the Plan of St. Gall, and of the same elongated 242. KLOOSTERBERG (near Plasmolen) MOOK, LIMBURG, THE NETHERLANDS [after Braat, 1934, 9, fig. 6] This provincial Roman porticus villa is almost identical in plan with the imperial villa of Konz (figs. 240.A, B). A third luxurious villa of this type was excavated in Wittlich-on-the-Lieser. shape as the tunnae minores was found in the maritime trading settlement of Haithabu where, standing upright, it formed the walls of a well (fig. 229.A). To use barrels for that purpose appears to have been a common practice of medieval well construction.202 202 On the Roman barrel found in Mainz see Billiard, 1913, 60, fig. 69. Some eighty other such barrels, many quite well preserved, dating from the 1st-3rd centuries A.D., have so far been identified in various spots along the Danube, Rhine, Thames, and the Firth of Forth. They served as casks for transporting wine, after which they were almost invariably re-used as well linings. For a complete listing and description of this material with excellent bibliographical references, see Ulbert, 1959, 15-29 (Frison, 1962, dealing with the same subject, was not available to me). On the barrel of Haithabu and other 9th-century transport barrels re-used as well linings, see Schietzel, 1969, 8-13 and Behre, 1969, 10-13 (a final report on Haithabu is pending). The earliest visual representations of wine barrels are found on the column of Trajan (A.D. 113) where Roman soldiers are shown loading wine barrels onto a Danube boat at a fort in Northern Yugoslavia (fig. 231), and in a number of Gallo-Roman stone reliefs showing barrels as they are being moved on boats or carted on wagons (fig. 232 and 233). The shape and dimension of one of these, recorded on a Roman stone relief now in the Musé Saint-Didier at Langres (fig. 233), appears to be identical with that of the smaller barrels on the Plan of St. Gall. The barrel depicted fills the entire length of a four-wheeled wagon, and to judge by the size of the mules by which the cart is drawn and the height of the body of its driver, it must have had a length of roughly seven feet. It has the same concave curvature of the staves at the two ends of the vessel. This form may have been standard throughout the entire first millennium A.D., for it appears again in the Bayeux Tapestry (fig. 234) in a scene that shows William's army setting out to conquer England, and carrying on carts a provision of wine and weapons. The inscription leaves no doubt about the content of this precious container: ET HIC TRAHUNT CARRUM CUM VINO ET ARMIS. "And here they pull a cart with wine and with arms." THE MEASURE OF WINE AND BEER ALLOWED TO THE MONKS Conflicting views among the early fathers Most of the early desert monks looked upon wine as an unsuitable drink; St. Anthony never touched it and even St. Pachomius struck it entirely from the diet of his monks except in case of sickness.203 203 Vinum et liquamen absque loco aegrotantium nullus attingat ("Outside the infirmary no one shall touch wine and oil"), Rule of St. Pachomius, chap. 45, ed. Boon, 1932, 24. Even when on leave of absence from the monastery while visiting a diseased relative, this rule was rigidly enforced; see chap. 54 of the Rule, ed. Boon, 30. But others, such as Palladius (d. 431) proclaimed that "it is better to drink wine with measure than water with hubris."204 204 I am taking these data from Steidle's commentary to chap. 40 of the Rule of St. Benedict; Steidle, 1952, 238. For other early proponents of moderate use of wine see Delatte, 1913, 315. The moderates among the early fathers had a powerful precedent to lean upon since the Lord himself drank wine (Matt. IX, 11). St. Benedict settled the controversy with his distinctive discretion. "We do indeed read that wine is no drink for monks; but since nowadays monks cannot be persuaded of this, let us at least agree upon this, to drink temperately and not to satiety."205 205 Licet legamus uinum omnino monachorum non esse, sed quia nostris temporibus id monachis persuaderi non potest, saltim uel hoc consentiamus, ut non usque ad sacietatem bibamus, sed parcius; Benedicti regula, chap. 40, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 101-102; ed. McCann, 1952, 96-99; ed. Steidle, 1952, 237-38. The source referred to by St. Benedict is the Verba Seniorum. Cf. Delatte, 1913, 314, note 1. No difference in alcoholic content between ancient and modern wines Concerning the concentration of alcohol in wine, there is no reason to presume any appreciable difference between wines of ancient and modern times. Table wines (wine consumed with meals) cannot have less than 8 per cent alcohol by volume (at lower levels, the wine will not be stable, and will tend to spoil), and in general no more than 12 per cent. (At levels of alcohol higher than this, the wines are no longer table wines but are classified as sweet wines, the production of which requires special treatment or fortification by artificial sugars.)206 206 The concentration of alcohol in wine is conditioned by the volume of sugar occurring in the grapes from which the wine is made. My colleagues, M. A. Amerine and William B. Fretter, inform me that the sugar content of Central European grapes varies roughly between 16 per cent and an upper limit of 24 per cent, yielding a lower limit of 8 per cent and an upper limit of 12 per cent alcohol in the wine. If the sugar content falls below or rises above these limits, the yeast cells which convert the sugar into alcohol will either not be capable of starting fermentation or will cease to perform that function through attrition in too high a volume of alcohol. For more detail on the technology of wine-making, see Amerine and Joslyn, 1970 (2nd. ed.), especially chaps. 7, 8, 9, and 10. The hemina of St. Benedict: Charlemagne's attempts to establish its value St. Benedict allows each monk "a hemina of wine a day"207 207 Tamen infirmorum contuentes inuecillitatem credimus eminam uini per singulos sufficere per diem. Benedicti regula, loc. cit. and leaves it to the discretion of the prior to add to this a little more "if the circumstances of the place, or their work, or the heat of the summer require more."208 208 Quod si aut loci necessitas uel labor aut ardor aestatis amplius poposcerit, in arbitrio prioris consistat. Benedicti regula, loc. cit. The reform synod of 816 confirmed the directive of St. Benedict that a special measure may be added to the regular pittance of wine on days on which the monks were subject to heavy labor, and added to those the days when they celebrated the mass for the dead. Synodi primae decr. auth., chap. 11; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 163, 373. He holds out the promise of a "special reward" for those "upon whom God bestows abstinence"209 209 Quibus autem donat deus tolerantiam abstinentiae, propriam se habituros mercedem sciant. Benedicti regula, loc. cit. and admonishes the superior "to take care that neither surfeit nor drunkeness supervene."210 210 Considerans in omnibus, ne subrepat satietas et ebrietas, Benedicti regula, loc. cit. The precise content of the measure of wine which St. Benedict designated with the term hemina is unknown.211 211 Endless discussions have been carried on with regard to this subject, ever since Claude Lancelot, in 1667 published his Dissertation sur l'hemine et la livre de pain de Saint Benoit et d'autres anciens religieux. (For this and other early literature on the subject see Delatte, 1913, 309 and 313ff.) The issue may never be solved to full satisfaction, but it has fascinating cultural implications; and the question just how seriously the design, the dimensions and the number of the barrels in the Monks' Cellar must be taken, cannot be settled without establishing, at least in a tentative form the upper and lower limits of the daily ration of wine that each monk was permitted to drink with his meal at the time of Louis the Pious, the reason we attach some importance to this subject. Charlemagne made an attempt to ascertain 243. GERASA (JERASH), PALESTINE. THREE EARLY CHRISTIAN SANCTUARIES ON AXIS [after Krautheimer, 1965, 119, fig. 50] In the foreground and to the left the atrium and church of St. Theodore, built A.D. 494-496; in the center, but on a slightly lower level, the cathedral of Gerasa, built around A.D. 400. It had at its rear another atrium enclosing a shrine of St. Mary located directly behind the apse of the cathedral. This atrium was approached by a grand staircase from yet a lower level. Three sanctuaries were thus aligned on a common axis. 244. CANTERBURY, ENGLAND PLAN OF SAXON ABBEY CHURCH OF SS PETER AND PAUL, FOUNDED BY ST. AUGUSTINE (597-604), AND THE CHURCH OF ST. MARY [same period; after Clapham, 1955] To the left lies the church of SS Peter and Paul; to the right, the church of St. Mary. The church of St. Pancras, lying in eastern prolongation of the axis of these two churches, and dating from the same period, is not visible in this plan. The church of St. Wulfric (interposed between SS Peter and Paul and St. Mary) was not part of the original concept. In the medieval monastery of St. Gall, St. Peter's chapel (prior to 830), Gozbert's church (830-836) and Otmar's church (dedicated 867) lay in axial prolongation; see II, figs. 507-509. its value by sending a delegation to Monte Cassino. Hildemar, in discussing this event, in his commentary to chapter 40 of the Rule of St. Benedict, claims that the emperor succeeded in retrieving the old measure and that this was the measure currently used in the monasteries of the empire as the basis for the daily allotment of wine.212 212 Unde Carolus rex, qualiter ipsam heminam intellegere ac scire potuisset, misit Beneventum ad ipsam monasterium S. Benedicti, et ibi reperit antiquam heminam, et juxta illam heminam datur monachis vinum. Similiter et juxtam eam habemus etiam et nos. Expositio Hildemari, ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 445. The event is also referred to in a letter by Abbot Theodomar of Monte Cassino to Charlemagne, where it is said that a sample measure was dispatched to the emperor. Two of these according to the estimate of the older brothers of Monte Cassino formed the equivalent of the hemina of St. Benedict, one being served at the midday meal, the other at supper.213 213 Misimus etiam mensuram potus, quae prandio, et aliam, quae cenae tempore debeat fratribus praeberi; quas duas mensuras aestimauerunt maiores nostri emine mensuram esse. Direximus etiam et mensuram unius calicis, quam obsequiaturi fratres iuxta sacrae regulae textum solent accipere. Theodomari epistola ad Karolum regem, chap. 4; ed. Hallinger and Wegener, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 163. There is some question about the authenticity of this letter. See Hallinger and Wegener, loc. cit.; Semmler, 1963, 53-54; and Winandy, 1938. The text leaves no margin for doubt: it was not the original hemina of St. Benedict (or a duplicate thereof) that the emperor received from Monte Cassino but a sample of which the senior monks "supposed" (aestimaverunt, i.e., judged by careful consideration, yet from incomplete data) that it was half the equivalent of that measure. St. Benedict's original hemina, as we learn from Paul the Deacon's History of the Lombards had been taken to Rome by the Monks of Monte Cassino, as they fled from the invading barbarians in 581, together with the original measure for the Benedictine pound of bread, and the original manuscript of the Rule of St. Benedict.214 214 Pauli Historia Langobardorum, Book IV, chap. 17; ed. Bethman and Waitz, Mon. germ. hist., Sript. rer. Lang., Hannover 1878, 122: Circa haec tempora coenobium beati Benedicti patris, quod in castro Casino situm est, a Langobardis noctu invaditur. Qui universa diripientes, nec unum de monachis tenere potuerunt, ut prophetia venerabilis Benedicti patris . . . dixit . . . Fugientes quoque ex eodem loco monachi Roman petierunt secum codicem sanctae regulae, quam praefatus pater composuerat, et quaedam alia scripta necnon pondus panis et mensuram vini et quidquid ex supellecti subripere poterant deferentes. There is no evidence that these two measures were returned to the monastery in 720 when it was rebuilt, and the content of Theodomar's letter, as well as a good deal of other evidence, indicates clearly that in the eighth century even in St. Benedict's own monastery the precise value of the Benedictine hemina was forgotten.215 215 See Jaques Winandy's remarks on this subject, Winandy, 1938, 281ff.; also Semmler, 1963, 53ff. The Carolingian inflation of capacity measures The leaders of the Church, under Charlemagne, and even more so under Louis the Pious, had some reason to be concerned with this issue, since in the lifetime of these two rulers, the hemina had more than doubled its value. The base of the Carolingian system of capacity measure, as that of the Romans, was the modius internally divided into 2 situlae, 16 sextarii, and 32 heminae. The classical Roman modius had a capacity equivalent to 8.49 liters, the hemina to 0.2736 liters.216 216 For the liter equivalents of the old Roman modius and hemina see Pauly-Wissowa, Real Encyclopädie, s.v. Between the fall of the Roman Empire and its renovation under Charlemagne the capacity of these measures increased considerably. The modius in use in the Frankish kingdom and in the early years of the reign of Charlemagne was equivalent to 34.8 liters. In a capitulary of 794, Charlemagne instituted a new modius, larger by one third than the preceding one, which brought the modius up to an equivalent of 52.2 liters. Before 822, Louis the Pious increased again the newly established modius of his father, this time by one fourth of its current value, which brought it up to an equivalent of 68 liters. Thus in the short span of not more than 25 years, the hemina had risen from a capacity equivalent to 1.06 liters (in use when Charlemagne acceded to his throne) to one equivalent to 1.46 liters (instituted by Charlemagne in 794) and finally to one equivalent to 2.12 liters (instituted by Louis the Pious, prior to 822).217 217 I am basing these calculations on the data assembled by M. G. Guérard, who deals with Carolingian measures of capacity, on pp. 183ff and 960ff of his admirable work on the Polyptique of Abbot Irminon (Guérard, I, 1844. If Guérard's analysis of the relative values of the measures here cited is wrong, my conclusions will be wrong. I have no reason to doubt his findings. The inflation clearly worked in favor of the monks, with proportions that must have taxed the wit of even the most astute monastic leaders. St. Benedict may have foreseen such possibilities when he foreclosed all future abuse with the qualifying clause that whatever measure of wine the abbot should be willing to grant, "he always take care that neither surfeit nor drunkeness supervene,"218 218 Cf. above, note 210. a directive that as the centuries passed by must have proved to be a more trustworthy guide than any reliance on capriciously changing physical capacity measures. The probable daily allowance of wine at the time The Plan of St. Gall was drawn The hemina that St. Benedict had in mind probably came closer to that which was in use under the Romans in classical times than to any of the later Frankish measures. This would have entitled the monks to drink a little over a fourth and perhaps as much as a third of a liter of wine per day. Whether taken in the course of a single meal or spaced out over two meals, this amount could hardly have had any damaging effects on health or have lead to "surfeit" or "drunkeness," especially not if these meals were followed, as they traditionally were, by either a brief period of rest,219 219 After the midday meal, see above, p. 250. or by sleep.220 220 After the evening meal, which was succeeded only by a brief period of reading and by Compline. See Benedicti regula, chap. 42; ed. Hanslik 1960, 104; ed. McCann, 1952, 100-101; ed. Steidle, 1952, 240-41. St. Benedict's assessment of the quantity of wine that could be safely consumed at the monks' table was both conservative and judicious. But in evaluating his ruling historically one must not lose sight of the fact that when St. Benedict took the epochal step of sanctioning the consumption of wine for the monastic community, the issue was as yet a highly controversial one. Once the decision was made, the frailties of human nature would tend to push the allowance upward. From 0.2736 liters to 0.5 liters is not a big step; the less so, if one considers the great inflation the hemina experienced as an official capacity measure between the time of St. Benedict and the time of Louis the Pious. That the daily monastic allowance would follow this inflationary cycle, which peaked under Louis the Pious to the impressive equivalent of 2.12 liters, is impossible to assume. That it rose to 0.5 liters is probable. There are even some indications that it might have risen as high as 0.7 liters. A half-liter of wine per day, if consumed by a healthy man in the course of two successive meals, could still be interpreted as lying within the spirit of St. Benedict's ruling; 0.7 liters would have pushed the Rule to its limit; any amount above that would have been clearly in violation of the Rule.221 221 The effect of wine or beer on man depends on the concentration of alcohol in the blood, and this in turn is dependent on the manner in which the intake is spaced out over the day and to what extent the alcohol is diluted by food. Dr. Alfred Childs, an expert on alcohol in the School of Public Health of the University of California at Berkeley, advises me that half a liter of wine, spaced out over two meals, and allowing for some rest after the midday meal, would not have any damaging effects although it might well involve some temporary impairment of cerebration during earlier phases of the period during which the alcohol is metabolized. Even 0.7 liters, if spaced out over two meals and diluted by food, Dr. Childs opines, might still be within the safety limits set by St. Benedict (i.e., neither lead to "surfeit" nor "drunkeness") but would be pushing it close to the edge of these limits. For an analysis of the metabolism of alcohol, the mechanism of its toxic effects and its rational use by healthy persons, see Childs, 1970. My suspicion that the daily allowance of wine might have risen as high as 0.7 liters at the time of Louis the Pious is based upon a well known but perhaps not fully explored passage in the Customs of Corbie, where we are told that in this monastery each visiting pauper was issued two 245.

GALL DIAGRAM SHOWING THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE PRINCIPAL BUILDING MASSES The shape of Church and Claustrum bears striking resemblance to the Quoniam initial of the St. Mark Gospels, Book of Kells (fig. 245). The building masses grouped around this central motif likewise recall the manner in which secondary letter blocks are ranged peripherally around the initial. The similarity may be accidental, if not deceptive, since the prime reasons for grouping buildings on the Plan of St. Gall (as well as the development of the claustral scheme) are clearly funtional. Yet one cannot entirely discard the possibility of an interplay of functional with aesthetic considerations. 247. PLAN OF ST. GALL. NOVITIATE AND INFIRMARY PLAN. AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION The circular apses of the double chapel to which the Novitiate and the Infirmary are attached, as well as the round arches of passages and openings in the walls of the cloister walks (see fig. 236) leave no doubt that this building complex was conceived as a masonry structure. Each of its two components has all the constituent parts of a monastic cloister (Dormitory, Refectory, Warming Room, Supply Room, lodgings for supervising teachers and guardians) but since these facilities are strung out on ground floor level rather than in two-storied buildings, this architectural compound covers a surface area almost as large as that of the Monks' Cloister. It housed in practice probably no more than twelve novices plus twelve sick or dying monks—together with teachers and guardians not more than thirty individuals. Differing dietary prerogatives, bathing privileges, and need for special educational and medical facilities, required that novices and the ill not only be housed apart from regular monks, but also separated from each other. The Novitiate and Infirmary complex—inspired by the grandiose centrality and axial bisymmetry of Roman imperial palaces (figs. 240-242) —is an ingenious architectural implementation of all these needs. Two U-shaped ranges of rooms around open inner courts, on either side of a church halved transversely, served a dual constituency with identical, mutually isolated facilities. No doubt the location of Novitiate and Infirmary was purposeful. Away from the bustle and noise of workshops and near the open, "parklike" eastern paradise of the Church, the Orchard, and gardens, its residents might find activities and recreation suited to the returning strength of the convalescent, or the energies and spirits of the young. Proximity might serve to remind both ill and novices of beginnings and an end, in view of the great Cemetery cross, while healing and learning continued in the embrace of the larger community. "beakers" (calices) of beer per day. The context of the passage discloses that the "beaker" of Corbie was capable of holding 1/96 of a modius222 222 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 4; ed. Semmler, Corp. con. mon., I 1963, 373; and Jones, III, Appendix II, 105; where it is stipulated that a quarter of a modius or four sesters of beer be divided daily among twelve paupers, "so that each will receive two beakers." From this it must be inferred that there were 96 beakers in a modius (I do not see how Semmler arrived at the figure of seventy-two. Semmler, 1963, 54). Since in 822 when the Customs of Corbie was written, the official capacity of the modius was 68 liters, the beaker of Corbie must have been the equivalent of 0.7 liters. The directive reads as follows: De potu autem detur cotidie modius dimidius, id sunt sextarii octo, de quibus diuiduntur sextarii quattuor inter illos duodecim suprasriptos, ita ut unusquisque accipiat calices duos. which in the light of the values established by M. B. Guérard for capacity measures in use at the time when this text was written (A.D. 822) would amount to 0.7 liters.223 223 Cf. above, p. 299. The passage does not refer to wine but to beer; however, the relative value of wine and beer had been defined in 816 in the first synod of Aachen, in a chapter which directed that if a shortage of wine were to occur in a monastery, the traditional measure of wine should be replaced by twice that volume of beer: ubi autem uinum non est unde hemina detur duplicem eminae mensuram de ceruisa bona . . . accipiant.224 224 Synodi primae decr. auth., chap. 20; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 463. Chrodegang ordered replacement of wine by an equal amount of beer (chap. 23, Regula canonicorum, ed. J. B. Pelt, Etudes sur la Cathedrale de Metz IV, La Liturgie, 1, Metz, 1937, 20). This directive was promulgated as an imperial law and must have been known to everyone in the empire. Truly enough the Customs of Corbie speak of rations to be issued to the poor, not to the monks, but since from another chapter of that same text it can be inferred that monks and paupers are entitled to the same ration of bread,225 225 On the number of loaves of bread and their distribution in the monastery see Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 3; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 375ff; and Jones, III, Appendix II, 106. there is more than a high probability that they were also granted the same ration of wine or beer. Good monastic custom would require that an equal amount be also granted to the serfs. The latter might even have been issued slightly larger rations because of their involvement in hard physical labor. ARE THE BARRELS DRAWN TO SCALE AND SCALED TO NEED? The layout of the Monks' Cellar raises some interesting dimensional questions. Are the scale, the size, and the number of its barrels to be taken seriously? Or are they meant to simply indicate in a schematic and purely general way that there is a cellar full of barrels for the storage of wine and beer? An answer to this question depends on our ability to assess the total number of men who were to be housed in a monastery such as that which is shown on the Plan of St. Gall, the extent of their total annual need for storage of alcoholic beverages, and the relation of this need to the storage capacity of the barrels that are drawn out on the Plan. In entering upon a discussion of these relationships, one has to keep in mind, first, that the wine for an entire year is manufactured in the fall and must be stored in its entirety at that time; second, that this wine cannot be tapped during the first six months of storage (during which it is still in full process of fermentation) and preferably should not be tapped during the first twelve months. This means that a well planned monastic cellar should be able to hold the entire yield of not less than two years' vintage. Beer, unlike wine, was not a seasonal product, but could be manufactured all year round.226 226 See our chapter "Facilities for Baking and Brewing" II, 249ff. It needed only a few weeks of recovery in the cellar for clearing and therefore no large facilities for long range storage. A calculation of the probable number of people daily to be fed in the monastery shown on the Plan of St. Gall discloses that it consisted of about 110 monks, some 150170 serfs, plus an indeterminate and varying number of guests: all together roughly 300.227 227 For a detailed substantiation of these figures see our chapter "The Number of Monks and Laymen," below, pp. 342ff. Our analysis of the layout of the Monks' Cellar has shown that there are nine small barrels, each of a length of ten feet and a central diameter of five feet; and five large barrels each of a length of fifteen feet and a central diameter of ten feet.228 228 Cf. above, p. 292. My friend and colleague William B. Fretter (experienced vintner, and mathematician), by a calculation based on the apparent dimensions of the barrels portrayed on the facsimile Plan, concluded that each small barrel contained 4,250 liters and each large one, 28,250 liters. These capacities vary slightly from those determined by Ernest Born (Fig. 235.A-C, p. 286). Both tend to confirm nonetheless that the scale of the barrels on the drawing is not capricious, but an intentional representation of casks the size of which related directly to the needs of the inhabitants of the proposed community. On the preceding pages it has been shown that the daily allowance of wine for each monk at the time of Louis the Pious could not have been less than 0.2736 liters (old Roman hemina) and is very unlikely to have been more than 0.7 liters. The most persuasive historical assumption is probably that it was somewhere in the middle between these two extremes, perhaps around 0.5 liters. This gives us a lower and upper limit as well as an intermediate value, all of which can be checked against the storage capacity of the barrels actually shown on the Plan. 1. If the daily allowance was 0.2736 liters (fig. 235.B): If the normal daily allowance of wine had still been the old Roman hemina of 0.2736 liters the total daily consumption of wine for 300 people would have been 82 liters, the total yearly consumption, 29,930 liters. To store two years of vintage in this order of magnitude would have required barrel space for 59,860 liters. This amount could PLAN OF ST. GALL. NOVITIATE AND INFIRMARY. ELEVATION AND SECTION 248.A CROSS SECTION THROUGH CLOISTER AND CHAPEL LOOKING WEST 248.B WEST ELEVATION AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION The absence of explanatory titles to indicate the existence of any upper stories, as well as the fact that the ground floor accommodates all parts of the traditional claustral scheme, is clear evidence that all rooms of the Novitiate and Infirmary lay at ground level. In reconstructing the elevations and sections of this compound shown in this and the subsequent figure, we have followed the procedure chosen for every other building on the Plan by conjecturing comfortable minimum heights for each part of the complex: head clearance in the cloister walks, sufficient elevation in the walls of the chapels to receive the roof covering them, and sufficient height in the clerestory above that level to allow for proper fenestration. The outer wall perimeter, likewise, must have been of sufficient height to allow for windows giving light and air to the rooms they enclose. have been stored in two of the large barrels of the Monks' Cellar, but would have left a number of barrels empty, or for the storage of beer, which seems excessive: three of the large ones, and all of the nine small ones. We have already pointed out that from a purely historical point of view it seems unlikely that the daily measure of wine at the time of Louis the Pious was still the old Roman hemina of 0.2736 liters. Our analysis of the storage capacity of the Monks' Cellar would tend to confirm this assumption. The Cellar, if it was rationally planned, must have been planned for a larger volume of alcoholic beverages. 2. If the daily allowance was 0.5 liters (fig. 235.C): If the normal daily allowance of wine was 0.5 liters; the daily consumption for 300 people would have been 150 liters, the needed supply for one year, 54,750 liters; for two years, 109,500 liters. This amount could have been stored in four of the five larger barrels, leaving the fifth for the storage of beer, and all the smaller barrels for the aging of smaller quantities of higher quality wine, perhaps reserved for distinguished guests and for the abbot when he dined with distinguished guests. It is interesting to note that under this assumption, which we found to be historically the most persuasive one, the physical layout of the Monks' Cellar makes perfect sense. It offers comfortable space for everything, leaving perhaps even a small margin for extra needs—a condition that we found to prevail everywhere else in analyzing the scale of the Plan.229 229 See our chapters "Scale and Construction Methods used in Designing the Plan," above, pp. 77ff and "Schematic Drawing or Building Plan? The Problems of Scale and Function," above, pp. 112ff. 3. If the daily allowance was 0.7 liters: If the normal daily allowance was 0.1 liters, the daily consumption for 300 people would have been 210 liters; the needed supply for one year 76,650 liters; for two years, 153,300 liters. 153,300 liters would have occupied all of the five large barrels, plus three of the smaller ones, leaving only six of the smaller barrels for other purposes, such as the long term storage of wines of higher quality for aging, or the short term storage of beer. Again it is interesting to note that under this assumption, which lies at the borderline of what would have been acceptable within the tenets of the Rule of St. Benedict, would also in the physical sense have been a very tight fit. CONCLUSION All of these calculations tend to show that the storage capacity of the barrels in the Monks' Cellar was carefully planned, and that the person who decided on the number and the dimensions of the barrels shown in the cellar, as well as the dimensions of the cellar itself, had a clear and accurate statistical picture of the total annual needs in alcoholic beverages of the community for which the cellar was designed, as well as the precise volume of cooperage required to meet these needs. In the light of the results of our general analysis of the scale and construction methods used in designing the Plan, these findings will not come as a surprise. LACK OF FACILITIES FOR THE PRESSING OF GRAPES The Plan of St. Gall does not provide facilities for the pressing and processing of grapes. This work was probably performed in the outlying vineyards. The climatic and topographical conditions of many monasteries were such that the cultivation of grapes in their immediate vicinity was impossible. We know, for instance, that in the eighth and early ninth centuries, the Abbey of St. Gall had to import its wine from vineyards in Breisgau, and from others located in the Alsace.230 230 Bikel, 1914, 104-5. Later the grape was introduced into the neighboring Thurgau. In the days of Abbot Notker (971-975) and his skillful prior Richer, there were years when the supply was so abundant, the cellar could not hold it, and the overflow had to be stored in the open under guard. Spoiled by so much good fortune, the monks became fastidious enough to reject the red wine in favor of the white although, as Ekkehart remarks, "it had been a good vintage."231 231 Bikel, 1914, 106. Ekkeharti (IV.) Casus sancti Galli, chap. 134; ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 426-29; Helbling, 1958, 222-24. Wine and beer were probably not the only fermented drinks available to the monks. Ekkehard, in his Benedictiones ad mensas, refers to cider, spiced wine (Sabenwein, savina), mulberry wine, heated wine, mead and wine mixed with honey.232 232 Benedictiones ad mensas, verses 222-80. See Liber benedictionum Ekkehart's IV; ed. Egli, 1909. Dr. Johannes Duft brings to my attention that Ernst Schulz, 1941, 199-234, has demonstrated that Ekkehart's IV. Benedictiones ad mensas were modelled after the Etymologiae of Isidore of Seville and for that reason should not be taken as a realistic reflection of the monks' diet, as Egli, in his 1901 edition understood it to be. Larder The Monks' Cellar and Larder is the only one of the three principal claustral structures to communicate directly with the service yard to the south of the Claustrum. A door in the middle of its southern gable wall opens into the court around the Kitchen and other adjacent yards. This connection is indispensable, since in addition to wine and beer, all the meats and staples stored in the Larder above the Cellar had to be brought in from the outer areas. As with the Dormitory and the Refectory, the plan of the Cellar tells us nothing about the location of the stairs that connected the ground floor with the upper level, and since the Plan concentrates on the furnishings of the Cellar, we are left in the dark about the layout of the Larder. This gap can fortunately be closed by a vivid literary account from the pen of Abbot Adalhard. In a chapter devoted to a discussion of the "number and disposition of the pigs,"233 233 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 7; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 403-408; and Jones, III, Appendix II, 118. PLAN OF ST. GALL. CHAPEL OF NOVITIATE AND CHAPEL OF INFIRMARY 249.B LONGITUDINAL SECTION THROUGH CHAPELS LOOKING SOUTH 249.A LONGITUDINAL ELEVATION OF CHAPELS AND SECTION (EAST-WEST) THROUGH CLOISTER AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION Like the principal church of the monastery this building has an apse at either end; in contrast to the former it has no aisles and is internally divided into a Chapel for Novices (facing east) and a Chapel for Sick Monks (facing west), each furnished with its own altar, the patronage of which is not disclosed in its titles. The building was 27½ feet wide and 110 feet long, and including the ridge of its roof is here conjectured to have risen to a height of roughly 50 feet. On the ultimate Roman prototypes for double-apsed structures, and connecting Early Christian and Early Medieval links, see caption to fig. 111. Adalhard instructs us that the full number of pigs that were killed per year "at the cellar" of Corbie amounted to 600. Sixty of these went to the porter for the table of the guests, 370 to the cellarer for the sustenance of the serfs and the sick monks, 120 to the prebendaries and fifty into the abbot's reserve. The 370 pigs that went to the cellarer for use by the serfs and the sick were to be issued at the rate of one pig per day (365 a year), leaving a reserve of five to be used for emergencies. These 370 pigs, the abbot tells us, are to be hung in the larder, entrails and all, in monthly batches of thirty. If anything is left over from the previous month, it must remain hanging in its place and may be removed only if a shortage occurs in the meat or fat supply of the subsequent month. Never should the cellarer "take anything from a future month to compensate for a shortage of a preceding month," but always "a shortage of the following month must be covered by a saving from the preceding month." Since the entrails spoil faster than the meat and the lard, they must be distributed first. And since the lard, when rendered in January, is not fit for consumption before Easter, the cellarer must build up a reserve from the preceding year, to be used during this critical interval.234 234 That raw lard was not fit to be consumed before Easter was expressed by Pope Zacharias in a letter written to St. Boniface in 751. See Mon. Germ. Hist., Epist., III, 1892, 371, and Heyne, II, 1901, 295. One cannot infer from Adalhard's account that a full year's supply of pork was hung at the first of January. Several months' batches must have existed at a given time, however, since otherwise the abbot could not have warned against the loan of meat from a following month to make up for a shortage incurred in the preceding month. One must remember that in the Middle Ages, when farming practices provided only a limited supply of winter food for stock, at the end of each year the farmers customarily killed all but a small number of their cattle, sheep, and pigs and salted down the flesh for their winter meat supply. The traditional month for slaughtering pigs was December. In the illuminations of medieval calendars illustrating the labors of the months, this event is depicted with lavish attention. Adalhard tells us nothing about the disposition in the larder of the other kinds of meat, but if we add to the pig the carcasses of beef, mutton, and goat, and the vast array of sacks or baskets filled with beans, lentils, and onions, plus the racks of fruit, cheeses, and bread that passed through the larder, we have a fairly vivid picture of the disposition of the 2,700 square feet of storage space above the Cellar that insured the livelihood of the community. III.1.11 PARLOR ITS DUAL ROLE: CONVERSATION WITH VISITORS &amp; WASHING OF FEET Between the Cellar and the southern aisle of the church lies the Parlor, a long rectangular room that serves as exit and entrance to the Cloister, where the monks may engage in conversation with their guests, and where the washing of the feet takes place (exitus &amp; introitus ante claustr? ad conloquendum cum hospitibus &amp; ad mandat? faciend?). The parlor measures 15 feet × 47½ feet and is lined entirely with benches. It is the only legitimate place of contact between the monks and the outside world. It is here that, with the permission of the abbot or prior, they may meet with friends or visiting relatives. Here, also, they perform one of the most venerable Christian services, the so-called mandatum. Keller235 235 Keller, 1844, 23. translated the phrase ad mandat? faciend? mistakenly as "the place where orders are given to the servants," and some of the later commentators of the Plan inherited this error.236 236 Willis, 1848; Leclercq (in Cabrol-Leclercq, vi:1, 1924, col. 100) did not correct this error. It lingers on in Reinhardt (1952, 12), but was corrected in the same year by Alfred Häberle (Häberle, 1952). Mandatum is "the washing of the feet" and refers to an old monastic custom, based upon the example set by Christ himself, when before the Last Supper he humbly washed the feet of his disciples, admonishing them to fulfill his "new mandate" (novum mandatum)237 237 John, 13:14-15: "If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you." by perpetuating this rite. The custom has a long Biblical tradition and was widespread in eastern countries, where owing to the general use of sandals, the washing of the feet was from the earliest times recognized everywhere as a courtesy shown to guests. In the hot climate of the Mediterranean countries, with their dusty and often rain-soaked roads, to offer water to a guest for his feet was one of the duties of the master of the household, and in certain areas was even the equivalent of a formal invitation to stay overnight.238 238 For full documentation on the history of the mandatum, see Schäfer, 1956; for summary reviews: Thalhofer's article "Fusswaschung," in Kirchenlexikon, IV, 1882, cols. 2145-48; Thurston's article "Washing of Feet and Hands," in the Catholic Encyclopedia, XV, 1912, 557-58; as well as a most informative paragraph in Semmler, 1963, 37-39. Often this service was rendered by slaves, occasionally by the daughter or wife of the owner of the house.239 239 For references to sources for the occurrence of this rite in the Jewish and Hellenistic world, see Schäfer, 1956, 20 and 59. Common both in the Jewish and the Hellenistic world, the custom of washing feet was taken over by the Early Christian and became an integral part of the monastic tradition. MANDATUM FRATRUM AND MANDATUM HOSPITUM A distinction must be made between the mandatum fratrum, i.e., the washing of the feet of one brother by another, and the mandatum hospitum, the washing of the feet of guests. St. Benedict establishes both rites as obligatory, 250. PLAN OF ST. GALL. AIR VIEW OF NOVITIATE AND INFIRMARY AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION This drawing is after the reconstruction model of the buildings of the Plan made for the exhibition Karl der Grosse, in Aachen, 1965. Besides the Monastery Church (an airview of which is shown in fig. 352) the building complex which accommodates the claustral compounds of the Novitiate and Infirmary, in consummate symmetry on either side of the dominant mass of a double apsed Church, is the largest single building shown in the Plan. Its layout, wholly unrelated to the vernacular tradition of the North, is one of the finest products of the Carolingian renascence—a concept perhaps inspired by the layout of the Constantinian aula at Trier (fig. 240) or Roman imperial summer residences, such as Konz (fig. 241) and Kloosterberg (fig. 242). Its classicism could be defined as an architectural counterpart to some of the finest and most classicising manuscripts of the so-called Palace School, such as the famous Aachen or Vienna treasure Gospels, whose evangelists, portrayed in senatorial robes and seated in open landscapes, cannot be stylistically derived from the preceding Hiberno-Saxon schools of illumination, but are a revival of an illusionistic Roman tradition that had been lost in the shuffle of the Great Migrations. but places a higher premium on the mandatum hospitum, as it is in the service rendered to the poor "that Christ is most truly welcomed."240 240 Benedicti regula, chap. 35 (mandatum fratrum), and chap. 53 (mandatum hospitum); ed. Hanslik, 1960, 93 and 124; ed. McCann, 1952, 88-89 and 120-21; ed. Steidle, 1952, 227 and 258. The so-called Customs of Farfa (in reality the Customs of Cluny, written under Abbot Odilo, between 1030 and 1048) furnish us with a complete description of this ritual.241 241 Consuetudines Farfenses, book I, chap. 54 and book II, chap. 46; ed. Albers, Cons. mon., I, 1900, 49-50 and 178-79. The brother who is placed in charge of the service saw that everything indispensable for its conduct was kept in readiness: "the cauldron, in which the water is heated" (laebetem ubi aquam calefaciat), "the basin in which their feet are washed" (concam ad lavandum pedes eorum) and "three towels of linen" (tria linteamenta). One towel was used for drying the hands of the monks in charge of the service; with the second the pauper's feet were dried; the third one was for drying their hands.242 242 Ibid., book II, chap. 46; ed. Albers, op. cit., 178. The ritual took place after the evening meal, when the brothers left the refectory, assembled in procession in the cloister wing "next to the cellar" (juxta promptuarium)243 243 Ibid., book I, chap. 54, ed. Albers, op. cit., 49. and chanted the songs by which the service was introduced. The feet of one pauper after another were washed, and the monks to whom this task was assigned alternated with one another, each in succession. The first monk washed, dried, and kissed the feet of the first pauper. The second one relieved him of the towel and basin and carried it to the brother who stood near the water and the aqua manile, dried his own hands and withdrew to his station. Then the next brother advanced to attend to the next pauper, and the procedure was repeated until the feet of all were washed. At the end the pauper's hands were rinsed.244 244 "Postea dicantur aliae antiphonae, donec singuli fratres singulis pauperibus pedes lavent, tergant et osculentur. Ille namque qui lavat, tergat atque osculetur eorum pedes; alius accipiens linteum inprimis comcam: ipse eat locum ubi frater stat cum aqua et manule, abluat manus suas et regrediatur in suum locum. Caeteri similiter faciant; dum omnes abluti fuerint, incipiant donare aqua illorum manibus, tenente fratre mutuo manule ad illos . . . Ibid., loc. cit. While the feet of the newly arrived guests were washed daily, the mandatum fratrum was a weekly service extended to the assembled brothers by the incoming and outgoing servers, each Saturday after the evening meal. Although it is quite clear that the feet of the paupers were washed in the Parlour—both in the light of the latter's explanatory title, as well as in view of the fact that the Parlour was the only place where monks could legitimately meet with guests—the Plan of St. Gall does not tell us anything about the place where the feet of the brothers were washed. In leading Benedictine monasteries of the eleventh century it was done in the chapter house, as can be deduced without any shadow of doubt from the Customs of Farfa (1030-48), the Customs of the Monastery of Bec, composed on the request of Lanfranc while he was prior of his abbey, 1045-70 and the Customs of Lanfranc, worked out by Lanfranc between 1070 and 1077 for Christchurch Monastery after he had been made archbishop of Canterbury.245 245 This fact is not sufficiently stressed in the literature on the mandatum fratrum. The Customs of Lanfranc deal with the ritual in chapter 35 (DE MANDATO FRATRUM) where it is stated with unequivocal clarity that "the brothers after having left the refectory . . . and having congregated in the chapter house (egressis fratribus . . . Introgressis in capitulum fratribus) were joined there by the abbot and the prior (abbas et prior . . . ueniant in capitulum) "followed by those brothers to whom this task had been assigned that same day in the chapter meeting and who each in turn with bent knees wash the brothers feet, dry them and kiss them" (sequentibus eos fratribus, qui ad seruitium eorum ipsa die in capitulo fuerant ordinati, et utrique flexis genibus lauent pedes fratrum et tergant et osculentur). Decreta Lanfranci chap. 35, ed. Knowles, in Corp. cons. mon. III, 1967, 32. The Customs of Le Bec are equally clear on this matter: "After the evening meal . . . the prior rings the bell . . . and all assemble in the chapter house . . . Then the abbot and the prior enter the chapter house . . . and wash, dry and kiss the feet of everyone" (post prandium . . . sonet prior tabulam . . . et omnes conveniant in capitulum . . . Tunc abbas et prior . . . ingrediantur capitulum . . . pedes omnium lavent, tergant et osculetur). Consuetudines Beccenses, chap. 87; ed. Dickson, Corp. cons. mon., IV, 1967, 46. The Customs of Farfa are not quite that clear. The location of the rite, however, is indicated in the decisive phrase in book I, chap. 54, which informs us that at the end of the washing of the brother's feet and deacon and three of the servers go to the church to don liturgical robes, then return to the chapter house, where, upon their entry, all of the assembled brothers stand (Quibus ita capitulum intrantibus ante Evangelium surgant omnes). Consuetudines Farfenses, book I, chap. 54; ed. Albers, Cons. mon., I, 1900, 50. For further reference to sources attesting that the mandatum fratrum was held in the chapter house, see Schäfer, 1956, 64, note 22; and 66. The monastery shown on the Plan of St. Gall, as has been pointed out at the beginning of this chapter, was not provided with a separate chapter house. The chapter meetings were held in the cloister wing that ran along the southern aisle of the Church, and for that purpose the wing was furnished with two benches extending its entire length. This was the only place in the cloister beside the Refectory where the monks could be seated en masse, as they would have to be when their feet were washed. It is for this reason, as well as the association of the rite with the chapter house in later centuries, that I am inclined to assume that in the monastery portrayed on the Plan, the mandatum fratrum was performed in the northern cloister wing. During inclement weather both the chapter meetings and the mandatum fratrum may have been shifted to the Warming Room.246 246 Cf. Carolyn Malone's discussion of this possibility, II, 336. The rite of the washing of feet was dear to the brothers. When the abbot of Fulda proposed to abolish it, the monks of that monastery remonstrated before the emperor who ordered it to be reinstated.247 247 Supplex libellus monachorum Fuldensium, chap. 13; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 325. In remembrance of the washing of the feet of the disciples of Christ before the Last Supper, the mandatum conducted on Maundy Thursday was a special event. The synod of 816 directs that on this day the service be rendered by the abbot himself, who dries the feet of each monk with his own hands and serves him a drink in a beaker.248 248 Primae synodi decr, auth., chap. 21; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 463. 251. PLAN OF ST. GALL. ABBOT'S HOUSE The House of the Abbot lies in axial prolongation of the northern transept arm of the Church, in a position corresponding to that of the Monk's Dormitory on the opposite side of the Church. In contrast to the Guest and Service Buildings which have peripheral suites of outer spaces ranged symmetrically around an inner hall with a central hearth that emits smoke through a hole in the roof (see vol. II, pp. 117ff), it consists of two oblong spaces separated by a median partition wall, one serving as the abbot's living room (Mansio Abbatis), the other as dormitory (Dormitori?). Along each long side of the house is an arcaded porch opening on the surrounding yard. Like the corresponding arches in the Monks' Cloister (fig. 203) and in the cloisters of the Novitiate and Infirmary (fig. 236) these are shown in horizontal projection (cf. above, pp. 55ff). The inscription SUPRA CAMERA ET SOLARIUM written in the pale brown ink of the correcting scribe (cf. above, p. 13 and below p. 321) leaves no doubt that the abbot's house had two levels. The upper story accommodated a supply or treasure room (CAMERA) and a sun room (SOLARIUM). This arrangement precludes the use of an open central hearth, and necessitates installation of chimney-surmounted corner fireplaces (cf. II, pp. 249ff) in the abbot's living and bedroom. III. 2 NOVITIATE AND INFIRMARY III.2.1 TWO AUTONOMOUS CLOISTERS IN A SYMMETRICAL BUILDING COMPLEX The training of the novices and the care of the sick are relegated on the Plan of St. Gall to a building complex (fig. 236) that stands separate from the houses of the regular monks. It consists of two autonomous cloisters, each about two-thirds of the surface area of the cloister of the regular monks, laid out on either side of a double-apsed church (ECLESIA) which is internally divided into a chapel for the novices (facing east), and a chapel for the sick (facing west). The axis of this church is a prolongation of the axis of the main church. The entrances to the two respective cloisters lie on the west, on either side of the apse of the chapel for the sick, but since the apex of this apse touches the apex of the eastern paradise of the main church, it would have been impossible for any of the novices to stray onto the grounds of the Infirmary, or for any of the sick to enter into the cloister of the novices. Aesthetically, and even in the functional layout of their spaces, these two installations mirror each other in almost perfect symmetry, yet in actual life their occupants were completely separated. The church is 27½ feet wide and 110 feet long. Each of the cloisters on either side of it covers a surface area of 75 × 90 feet, not counting the adjoining privies and hypocausts. The entire complex of buildings was probably inscribed into a plot of land 110 feet wide and 210 feet long. III.2.2 TWO CHAPELS IN A CHURCH INTERNALLY HALVED The two chapels are designated by a single name ECCLESIA, in capitalis rustica. They lie on either side of a wall which divides the structure into halves, one chapel opening into the Infirmary (istorü ingressus), the other into the Novitiate (istorthic). Each chapel is divided into three areas of approximately equal size: an area where the novices and the sick are seated during the celebration of the divine services, an intermediate section with two freestanding "benches" (formulae) for a selected group of singers, and the apse with the "altar" (altar?; idem) raised one "step" (grad) above the level of the other parts of the oratory. Twenty-eight persons may be seated in each chapel: twenty-two in the principal space of each chapel and six on the freestanding spaces in front of the altar space. As in the principal Church of the monastery, a clear distinction is made between the seating of the general choir and the space reserved for the voices of the specially trained singers, who are in charge of the more difficult parts of the antiphon.1 1 On the stations of the specially trained singers in the main church see above, p. 137 252. CHRISTCHURCH, CANTERBURY. ABBOT'S HOUSE PLAN OF MONASTERY WATERWORKS [courtesy of the Trustees of Trinity College Library, Cambridge] Like the Abbot's House of the Plan, that of Christchurch Monastery was a two-storied structure with upper level containing a solarium. The entire Christchurch waterworks plan, prepared by Wibert ca. 1165, is reproduced in fig. 52 below. III.2.3 NOVITIATE LAYOUT OF THE CLOISTER A hexameter written clockwise into the open space of the cloister yard of the Novitiate informs us: Hoc claustro oblati pulsantib· adsociantur2 2 The first two words and the last word of this legend are written horizontally from left to right, the third and fourth are written vertically, each subsequent letter being placed beneath the preceding one. This is the only place on the Plan where this system is used. The scribe, obviously, did not want to rotate the parchment under his hands as he entered the title, but retained it in the position in which he held it as he started his line. In this cloister the oblates live with the postulants The oblati were youths offered to the monastery by their parents.3 3 For more details on this, see below, pp. 337-39. The pulsantes, literally "those who knock" (i.e., insist on being admitted despite initial rejection and deliberate discouragement) are novices on probation. The Rule of St. Benedict prescribes a probation period of one year for each novice.4 4 Benedicta regula, chap. 58; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 138-41; ed. McCann, 1952, 128-33; ed. Steidle, 1952, 275-79. 253. BAYEUX TAPESTRY (1073-1083). BAYEUX, CALVADOS, FRANCE. MUSÉE DE LA REINE MATHILDE [courtesy of Zodiaque] Harold and his followers take a last shore meal before sailing to Normandy, in the solarium of his castle at Bosham (on Bosham Channel, 3½ miles from Chichester, Sussex). Bosham had been acquired by Harold's father, Godwin, Earl of Wessex, "one of the most powerful men at the court of Edward I of England and the leader of the opposition to the Norman influence at the English Court" (C. H. Gibbs-Smith, The Bayeux Tapestry, London, 1973, 10). The feast is held in the upper story of a feudal hall reached by an outer staircase. The party drink from a horn and bowl, which appear to be passed around, while a servant standing on the upper landing of the staircase gestures to the men feasting in the solarium that the ship which will take them to Normandy is ready to sail. The hall, like most of the other buildings shown on the tapestry (with the sole exception of Westminster Abbey) is not an accurate architectural rendering. Nevertheless, the design suggests clearly enough that the hall was of two stories and that the upper story was supported from the ground floor by means of arcades. (For more detail on the history and narrative thrust of the tapestry see caption to fig. 234; on the artist's idiosyncrasies of portraying architecture: R. Allen Brown in Sir F. Stenton et al., The Bayeux Tapestry, a comprehensive survey, 2nd ed., London 1962). The cloister walks (porticus) with their arcaded galleries enclosing an open pratellum or garden repeat on a smaller scale the layout of the cloister of the regular monks. In both there is no direct communication between adjacent rooms; each opens separately onto the corresponding section of the cloister walk. The designs of the arcades and the layout of the pratellum are identical, and both elevations show in vertical projection three arcades on either side of a central passageway, a square area in the center of the pratellum with a circle, which (to judge by analogy with the same symbol in the monks' cloister) indicates the position of a savin tree in the cloisters of the novices. The cloister walks, in turn, give access to a U-shaped tract of buildings, containing on the west a refectory (refectorium) and a storeroom (camera); on the east, a dormitory (dormitorium) and a warming room (pisalis); and on the south, a sick room (infimort domus) and the apartment for the master of the novices (mansio magistr eort). Like the warming room of the regular monks, the warming room of the novices is heated by a hypocaust with firing chamber (camin') and smoke stack (exitus fumi). The sick ward and the lodging of the master are heated with corner fireplaces and have separate privies (exitus), each with two seats. The dormitory has a privy (neces?s?) with six seats. The beds for the novices are not shown on the Plan. If they were placed in single file along the four walls of the room, there would have been space for twelve beds; if they were arranged in alternating sequence, parallel and at right angles to the wall, the room could have accommodated about twenty novices. Twelve is the number prescribed by Abbot Adalhard of Corbie5 5 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 1; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 366; Jones II, Appendix III, 103. as the normal contingent of pulsantes for the monastery of Corbie, and this may reflect a general condition. NOVICES AND THEIR SUPERVISORS Hildemar6 6 Expositio Hildemari, ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 370-71. classifies the youths of the monastery as "children" (infantes), "boys" (pueri), and "adolescents" (adolescentiores) according to their respective ages: "children" up to the age of seven, "boys" from the age of seven to fourteen, "adolescents" from the age of fourteen to twenty-eight. Since every ten novices, according to Hildemar,7 7 Ibid., 418. had to have three to four supervisors with them at all times, the Novitiate must have housed, along with the novices, four or five regular monks. Some of those must have slept in the Dormitory of the Novices. Others may have shared the quarters of the master of the Novitiate. That the latter was not the sole occupant of his apartment is suggested by the size of his room and the fact that his privy has two toilet seats. But the master's room could never have held more than four or five beds besides his own. I call attention to the interesting observation that the maximum number of beds which could be installed in the novitiate (twenty-six) does not exceed the seating capacity of the chapel (twenty-eight), but is, rather, slightly below it.8 8 Cf. above, pp. 313ff. DIET AND CLOTHING The abbot was responsible for the novices' food and clothing. He had to provide them with fish, milk, and butter and even with meat on the days of the higher religious feasts. The younger boys received larger portions than the adolescents. From the age of fifteen on, the novices renounced meat entirely and their diet conformed to that of the regular monks.9 9 Expositio Hildemari, ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 418. Once each week, or at least once a month, the youths were taken out into the open for games and other forms of physical exercise.10 10 Ibid., 419. A complete account of their clothing is given by Adalhard of Corbie: These are what should be given to our aforesaid clerical canons who have the special title of "knockers": in clothing, two white tunics and a third of another color and four hose, two pairs of breeches, two felt slippers, four shoes with new soles costing seven pence at the cobblers, two gloves, two mufflers. These they receive every year, but a cope of serge and fur and a mantle or bedcloth, or a blanket, in the third year. All these should be taken from the clothing which the brothers return when they receive new. And they should select from the stock those garments which they think are most useful to them. The other cowled garment—the tunic or the cowl of serge from which the tunic can be made—will be issued at the discretion of the prior.11 11 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. I, 4, ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 371-72: "Haec sunt quae clericis nostris canonicis suprascriptis qui spetialiter pulsanti dicuntur dari debent: De uestimento tonicas duas albas et tertiam de alia colore et caligas quattuor, femoralia duo, soccos filtrinos duos, calciarios quattuor cum solis nouis exceptis denariis septem ad caltiamentum, uantos duos, muffolas duas: haec omni anno, cappam uero de sago et pellitiam, cottum aut lectarium siue sagum in tertio anno accipiant. Ista omnia de illo uestimento debent accipere quod fratres reddunt dum accipiunt nouum. Et talia de his eligantur illis qualia inueniri possunt utiliora. Ceterum capelle, hroccus siue cuculla de sago unde hroccus fieri possit ad arbitrium prioris erit." Cf. Jones, III, Appendix II. Adalhard also informs us that at Corbie some novices were attached for special duty to other buildings: three to the infirmary, one to the monks' laundry, and one to the abbot's house.12 12 Consuetudines Corbeiensis chap. 2, ibid., 366; Jones, III, Appendix II, 103. III.2.4 INFIRMARY LAYOUT OF THE CLOISTER The cloister containing the Infirmary lies on the northern side of the double chapel: Frib?s infirmis pariter locus iste par &amp; ur For the sick brethren similarly this place should be established The layout of its buildings corresponds in every detail to that of the Novitiate. The warming room (pisal) and the dormitory (dormitori?·) lie in the east wing; the supply 254. PLAN OF ST. GALL. ABBOT'S HOUSE RECONSTRUCTION BY FIECHTER-ZOLLIKOFER [after Fiechter-Zollikofer, 1936, 407, fig. 7] Fiechter-Zollikofer's concept of a low roof—also suggested in his reconstruction of the Outer School (fig. 278) is dependent on a house tradition too narrowly associated with post-medieval alpine Switzerland, to be acceptable for the interpretation of a document worked out in the heart of the Frankish empire (see II, 27ff) where the traditional house was covered by a steep-pitched roof (see II, 88ff). The absence of a title specifying that the ground floor porches were surmounted by an upper tier of porches suggests that the rooms on the second level did not extend over the entire width of the building. room (Camera) and the refectory (Refectorium) in the west wing—but the sequence is reversed, resulting in a complete mirror reflection of the arrangement of the corresponding spaces of the Novitiate. The room which in the Novitiate is reserved for the sick (infirmorum domus), is in the Infirmary designated as "the place for those who suffer from acute illness" (locus ualde infirmorum). The dormitory of the Infirmary (dormitori?·), then, must have served as sleeping quarters for those afflicted with minor ailments, as well as for the aged and infirm who made the Infirmary a permanent home.13 13 Jung (1949, 2) misinterpreted the respective functions of the various sickrooms and dormitories in the Infirmary and Novitiate. Its bedding capacity is the same as in the dormitory of the novices: twelve beds, if they were ranged in single file along the four walls of the room; about twenty, if they were staggered. The apartment of the master of the Infirmary (mansio magistri eorum) and the "room for the critically ill" each have a corner fireplace, but lack the other facility shown in the corresponding rooms of the Novitiate, the privy. This is one of the few genuine oversights of the Plan and may be an inadvertent omission by the copyist.14 14 See above, pp. 65ff for other oversights. CARE OF THE SICK: THEIR DIETARY PREROGATIVES The welfare of the sick was one of St. Benedict's primary concerns: Before all things and above all things care must be taken of the sick, so that they may be served in very deed as Christ himself; for he said: I was sick and ye visited me; and what ye did to one of these least ones, ye did unto me. But let the sick on their part consider that they are being served for the honour of God, and not provoke their brethren who are serving them by their unreasonable demands.15 15 Benedicti regula, chap. 36; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 95-96; ed. McCann, 1952, 90-91; ed. Steidle, 1952, 228-31. The abbot is admonished to take the utmost care that they suffer no neglect. They are allowed to take baths, as often as their condition requires and, in contradistinction to the healthy monks, to whom the meat of quadrupeds is categorically interdicted, the sick are allowed to eat meat when they are very weak, "for the restoration of their strength," but must abstain from it as usual, as soon as they are better.16 16 Ibid., loc. cit. St. Benedict stipulates that the Infirmary be established as a separate building (cella super se deputata) under the supervision of a "God-fearing, diligent, and careful" master, and Hildemar, in his commentary to this passage, says that it ought to consist of several rooms in order to be prepared for all exigencies; otherwise it might happen that "one is ready to die, another about to vomit, a third in need of eating, and a fourth compelled to take care of his natural needs."17 17 Expositio Hildemari; ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 406. See Hafner, in Studien, 1962, 184-85. As in the Refectory of the monks, the meal in this refectory was accompanied by reading. If there were six or less the text was read "in a subdued tone" (leniter); if there were twenty, it was read "in full voice" (in voce).18 18 Ibid., 422. The Infirmary had to have its own oratory so that the sick could attend mass.19 19 Ibid., 406. If they were too weak to be taken into the oratory, the office was read to them in the sick ward.20 20 Ibid., loc. cit. on measures taken on the approach of death, see II, 211. ADMISSION TO INFIRMARY Admission to the Infirmary was neither a trifling nor a purely private event. The first step was to appeal to the abbot and the entire body of the assembled community for entrance to the Infirmary. The Concordus regularis, a monastic consuetudinary of the end of the tenth century, based partly on ancient English and partly on continental traditions, defines the process as follows: When one of the brethren is called upon to pay the debt of the common fragility . . . he must declare to the abbot and the entire assembled community the reasons of his distress, and then, after having received their benediction, will be admitted to the infirmary.21 21 Sancti Dunstani regularis concordia, ed. J. P. Migne, Patr. Lat., CXXXVII, Paris, 1879, col. 500. The Infirmary does not include space for physicians. The quarters of these professionals are in an adjacent house, to the north; it will be discussed in a later chapter.22 22 See II, 175ff. III.2.5 KITCHENS AND BATHHOUSES Because of the detached location of their quarters, their special diet, and their prerogative to take baths whenever their condition required, the novices and the sick were provided with their own kitchens and bathhouses. These lie west of the Novitiate and the Infirmary, on either side of the eastern paradise of the Church. They consist of two oblong houses (22½ × 45 feet),23 23 For a dimensional analysis, see above, p. 90, fig. 65, and p. 95. each internally divided into two equal halves, one containing the "kitchen" (coquina eorund?), the other, "the bath" ([balnea]toriu, balneatorum domus). The kitchens have a square stove, the baths a central fire place, four corner tubs for bathing, and three short wall benches (fig. 237). The Infirmary kitchen, besides attending to the needs of sick monks, also provides the food for the brothers who are being bled in the adjacent House for Bloodletting (coqina eorunde &amp; sanguine minuentium). A thirteenth-century manuscript of the Chirurgia of Roger of Salerno, contains an illumination of a medical bath (fig. 238).24 24 Rogerius Salernitanus, Chirurgia, III, 25. London, Brit. Mus. Ms. Sloane 1977, fol. 7. The patient, as the accompanying text explains, is soaking in the tub in order to heal "a rib bent inward"; the instructions for the physician are that he "anoints his hands with honey, turpentine, or pitch, then presses and relaxes them at the hurt place, continuing until the rib is restored to its proper place.25 25 I am taking this information from MacKinney, 1965, 96. III.2.6 SCHEME OF THE COMPLEX ITS CLASSICISM I am not aware of the existence of any other complex of buildings of comparable designs, either earlier or later than this one, nor of the existence elsewhere of two chapels, placed end to end on the same axis, facing in opposite directions. No other building of the Plan of St. Gall is as classical in flavor as the complex which houses the Novitiate and the Infirmary. Its classicism stands out against the rest of Carolingian architecture with an intensity comparable to that of the Aachen or Vienna treasury gospels against the 255. PLAN OF ST GALL. ABBOT'S HOUSE RECONSTRUCTION BY VÖLCKERS (1937, 33) The roof line is more convincing than that of fig. 254, but there is no evidence that it extended over the entire width of the building. HELMSTED, BRAUNSCHWEIG, GERMANY 256.B 256.A MARIENTHAL. ABBOT'S HOUSE, 14TH CENT. [plan and perspective after Völckers, 1949, 53] The stairs shown at the gable wall give an idea of how the two levels of the Abbot's House of the Plan may have been connected. 257. PLAN OF ST. GALL. ABBOT'S HOUSE AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION BASED ON THE RECONSTRUCTION MODEL DISPLAYED AT THE EXHIBITION KARL DER GROSSE, AACHEN, 1965 As the lord of a vast web of manorial estates, the Abbot was the connecting link between monastery and the secular world. The location of his house in a narrow plot of land to the north of the Church (see fig. 77) is an expression of this fact. It is an area outside of the claustral compound of the monks, and in addition accommodates the Outer School (figs. 407-409) where the secular clergy and the sons of noblemen were trained, as well as the House for Distinguished Guests (figs. 397-401) where the emperor and members of his court were received while on travel or in attendance of great religious festivities such as Christmas, Easter or Pentecost. For reasons explained on p. 323 and in the caption to fig. 254 we have assumed that the roof covering the upper level of the Abbot's House did not extend over the entire width of the building. The arched openings of the two porches ranging along the east and west side of the Abbot's House suggest that it was a masonry structure. But the Privy and the free standing annex containing the Abbot's Kitchen, Cellar and Bath, may well have been built in timber. other schools of Carolingian book illumination. While no-one has pointed at any classical prototypes (the question has as yet not even been raised)—as one gazes at the consummate order of its building masses laid out at right angles around two open galleried courts on either side of a dominant axial structure, terminating in apse and counter apse, one's mind strays back to the grandiose layout of the forum of Emperor Trajan with its double-apsed basilica and its monumental courts (fig. 239). ROMAN IMPERIAL PROTOTYPES Constantine's basilica at Trier Yet the answer to this puzzle may be closer at hand. Excavations conducted after the close of World War II on the grounds of the Constantinian Basilica at Trier, have made it clear that the great audience hall in the palace of Constantine the Great (figs. 240.A and B) had attached to each of its two long sides an open galleried court.26 26 On the Constantinian audience hall of Trier, see Reusch 1956, 11-39; and idem, in Frühchristliche Zeugnisse, 1965, 144-50. The weight of the architectural masses differs distinctly (colossal hall with comparatively narrow courts at Trier—large courts with a comparatively narrow center tract of chapels in the Novitiate and Infirmary complex) but the underlying principles of composition are identical. The porticus villa at Konz The analogies are even stronger, if one turns from here to a building, excavated early in 1959, 8 km. upstream from Trier, on a high embankment formed by the confluence of the river Saar with the Moselle: the imperial summer residence of Konz, the ancient Contionacum.27 27 On the imperial porticus villa at Konz, see Gose, 1961, 204-206 and Reusch, in Frühchristliche Zeugnisse, 19611 150-52. This large and elegant porticus villa (fig. 241.A and B), of an overall length of 84 m. and an overall width of 38 m., consisted of a central audience hall flanked on either side by an open court that had attached to its outer side two massive cross wings, with dwelling units, view terraces and a bath. Lengthwise these units were connected by two magnificent porticos. Admittedly, even here the analogies tend to become evasive if one begins to focus on details: the courts are not colonnaded. Nevertheless, the two buildings make it forcefully clear that the Novitiate and Infirmary complex of the Plan of St. Gall, with its two open courts symmetrically laid out to either side of a dominant center block had its historical roots in Roman palace architecture. Other porticus villas in the territory of the Salian Franks The porticus villa at Konz is not the only example of its kind north of the Alps. In the early 1930s of this century the Dutch excavator W. C. Braat unearthed on a hill called Kloosterberg near Plasmolen, parish Mook, in the province of Limburg, Holland, the foundations of a Roman villa, which he interpreted to have been composed of a large central hall, flanked by two open courts with living ranges grouped around them on the three remaining sides (fig. 242).28 28 On the Roman porticus villa on the Kloosterberg, see Braat, 1934, 4-38. Another luxurious Roman porticus villa of this type had been excavated as early as 1904-1906, at Wittlich on the Lieser river, a northern tributary of the Moselle.29 29 On the Roman porticus villa of Wittlich, see the excavation report by E. Krüger, in Westdeutsche Zeitschrift, XXV, 1906, 459ff, and the literature cited in Swoboda, 1969, 56 (note 93) where the building is briefly discussed. This, however, exhausts our knowledge of this building type. No other Roman villas or palaces of comparable plan appear to have been found anywhere else in the Roman Empire; and it may be significant for our problem that the only four examples known to date are located within an air distance of no more than 62 (Wittlich), 75 (Trier and Konz) and 87 (Kloosterberg) miles respectively from the Palace at Aachen, where the details for the scheme of the Plan of St. Gall were worked out. Could they still be seen in Carolingian times? Of course, this raises the question whether any of these presumptive Roman prototypes could still be seen in Carolingian times. For the porticus villa at Konz and the audience hall of the imperial palace at Trier this question must probably be answered in the affirmative. The villa at Konz had walls of considerable height, even as late as the seventeenth century, as is attested by drawings made of its ruins at that period.30 30 On this point see Reusch, op. cit., 150. The audience hall of Constantine, although internally divided into a variety of smaller spaces and externally submerged in an agglomeration of other extraneous accretions, remained in constant use, and its masonry survived even the holocaust of Allied carpet-bombing in August 1944. Historians of Trier have pointed out that the worst damage inflicted to its Roman buildings was caused not by the havoc of the Frankish conquest (or any of the other barbarian incursions of the Moselle river valley), but through their ruthless exploitation, by their own medieval and postmedieval guardians, who used these treasures as a source for building materials, or ceded them for that use to others. The Roman amphitheater of Trier remained intact until the thirteenth century, when it was deeded to the monks of Hemmerode by the Bishop of Trier (1211) with leave to use its stones for the construction of buildings on a vignard they had acquired outside the walls of the city.31 31 On the demolition of the Roman amphitheater of Trier by the monks of Hemmerode, see Picht, 1966, 102. The Barbara baths were used for residential purposes by a local noble family, and in this manner preserved throughout the better part of the Middle Ages. It was only after the last descendant of that family had died, in the fourteenth century, that this building was abandoned and PLAN OF ST. GALL. ABBOT'S HOUSE. AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION 258.C The reconstruction of the various elevations of the Abbot's House shown here and in fig. 259 are purely conjectural; but based on the assumption of comfortable minimum heights for each of its component spaces (cf. the remarks made in connection with the reconstruction of the heights of the Church, above on pp. 160ff and in the captions to fig. 108 and 109). TRANSVERSE SECTION 258.B Since the drafter of the Plan does not tell us how the ground floor was connected with the upper level, we have not included such a feature in our reconstruction. For one of several ways in which this could have been done, see fig. 256. LONGITUDINAL SECTION 258.A The orientation of this building which places the Abbot's living room on the south side, his dormitory and privy to the north, and its two open porches east and west, enables the abbot and the brothers who share his quarters, to enjoy the benefits of the morning and afternoon sun, both on the ground floor and on the level of the solarium. Since the house has two stories it cannot draw its heat from open fireplaces on the lower level. To put the two corner fireplaces which service living room and dormitory back to back simplifies the task of smoke emission, which can be accomplished by a common smoke stack. For the shape and historical importance of this type of fireplace, see II, 123ff. surrendered to the citizens of Trier as a free-for-all quarry. What its medieval pilferers left behind was finally blown up by explosive charges in the seventeenth century and used for the construction of a college for Jesuits.32 32 Picht, op. cit., pp. 102-103. The ability to survive the storms of the Germanic migration was strongest of course in the walled and fortified towns, which continued to serve as administrative centers for both the church and the secular powers. But even in the country the continuity of life was not so radically broken as was formerly believed. In an illuminating review of this problem, based on a study of the distribution pattern of Roman and Frankish cemeteries, Kurt Böhner could demonstrate that large segments of the Roman and Gallo-Roman populations in the Moselle River basin continued to carry on their peaceful work, under their new Germanic rulers, living side by side with them on interspersed holdings.33 33 On the question of the continuity of life between Antiquity and the Middle Ages, as reflected in Frankish archaeology in the Moselle River basin and the confluence area of Moselle and Rhine, see Böhner, 1959, 85-109; von Petrikovits, 1959, 74-84; and Ewig, 22-302. In a recent study of the architecture and sculpture of the Migration period, Jean Hubert likewise emphasized the fact that many of the new barbarian masters of Gaul established themselves in palaces and villas dating from the Gallo-Roman period. He cites as a striking example an elaborate villa on a fortified Roman estate not far from Koblenz, in which Nicetus, Bishop of Trier, took residence. The palace is described in enthusiastic terms by the poet Fortunatus, around 565 (Hubert, 1969, 22). In the light of these conditions there appears to be no reason whatsoever to question the survival, in Carolingian times on Frankish territory, of buildings (albeit in ruinous, but nevertheless in recognizable condition) of the type of the imperial villa at Konz or to doubt the possibility of an influence of this building tradition upon the creation of the layout for the Novitiate and Infirmary complex of the Plan of St. Gall. III.2.7 NOVITIATE &amp; INFIRMARY COMPLEX IN THE CONTEXT OF THE WHOLE PLAN THREE SEPARATE CLOISTERS: AN ANSWER TO MONASTIC STRATIFICATION Conceptually, of course, this plan is an elaboration of the layout of the monastery's principal church and claustrum, and like the latter, it has its compositional roots in clearly definable functional needs. Monastic custom required that the novices be separated from the regular monks, the healthy from the sick, and all of the religiosi from the family of the monastery's serfs and workmen. This called for a tripartite internal division of the claustral section of the architectural plant as well as for a separation of this entire aggregate of cloisters from an outer belt of service buildings, in which the serfs and workmen were housed. The Plan of St. Gall offers a brilliant answer to these needs: in axial prolongation of the monastery church and the cloister of the regular monks, a second church, of one-third the length of the principal church, internally halved so as to be able to serve the occupants of two further cloisters, ranged symmetrically to either side of this sanctuary. AXIALITY OF CHURCHES: A PRINCIPLE INHERITED FROM EARLY CHRISTIAN ARCHITECTURE The placing of this complex on the axis of the main church recalls a scheme that was in use in Early Christian times in the eastern parts of the Roman empire, in such places as the sanctuary of Menas in Abu Mina, Egypt, fourth to fifth century,34 34 Wulff, 1914, 288, fig. 226. Cf. Ward-Perkins, 1949, 26-71 and Krautheimer, 1965, 85-86. the cathedral of Gerasa (Jerash, Palestine, ca. 400), and the church of St. Theodor, in the same town, 494-96 (fig. 243),35 35 See Crowfoot, 1941, 41-46, 110, and fig. 4. as well as an early Byzantine complex at Ephesus, in Asia Minor.36 36 Wulff, op. cit., 256, fig. 247. In all of these places several churches were arranged in sequence, one behind the other, along the same axis. The prototype of this arrangement may have been the Constantinian Anastasis Church at Jerusalem.37 37 Conant, 1942, Pl. VI, b and Pl. VII. A striking early medieval parallel existed at St. Augustine's Abbey at Canterbury (fig. 244). There, three churches, aligned east to west, were built in Saxon times (SS. Peter and Paul, 598-616; St. Pancras, before 613; St. Mary, about 618) and a fourth one at the time of Abbot Wulfric (d. 1059).38 38 Clapham, 1955, 9ff. Undoubtedly, there were others;39 39 On the problem of double, triple, and cluster churches, see E. Lehmann, 1962, 21-37 (and the bibliography there on 35, note 4); and Hubert, 1963, 105-25 (bibliography on 106, note 9). In dealing with double or cluster churches one has to use some caution. In many cases, where churches are said to be built in axial sequence, they could actually never have been seen in the manner in which they are shown on the plan, because a new and larger church was not added to another one in formal extension of the latter, but axially superimposed, taking its place. I have in mind such churches as those at Nantes, Paris, Beauvais, and Reims; see Hubert, 1938, 40; and idem, 1952a, pl. XVI fig. 24 (Nantes), pl. IX fig. 30 (Paris), pl. X fig. 31 (Beauvais), and pl. XI, fig. 33 (Reims). the majority of the early medieval twin or cluster churches, however, were laid out in lateral sequence or in rather haphazard fashion. GROUPING OF BUILDING MASSES: A TRANSFER TO SITE ORGANIZATION OF PRINCIPLES DEVELOPED IN BOOK ILLUMINATION In the layout of the churches and cloisters of the Plan of St. Gall another influence must be acknowledged: with all of its classicism, it also has an amazing kinship with the layout of some of the great illuminated pages found in Carolingian and Iberno-Saxon manuscripts, in particular, with those pages which illustrate the opening words of each Gospel. Again, it may be futile to point at any one specific example. Yet as one glances at the great decorated page with the opening word of St. Mark's (Quoniam) in PLAN OF ST. GALL. ABBOT'S HOUSE, AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION 259.C In the foreground the Privy. It lies in line with the privies of all of the other houses located north of the church and like the latter was probably cleansed by a common channel of water running from east to west (cf. above pp. 68ff and p. 74, fig. 53. NORTH ELEVATION 259.A The grouping into units of three and four of the arched openings that admit sun to the two porches ranged along the eastern and western long wall of the Abbot's House may be another manifestation of the maker's preference for sacred numbers (see above pp. 118ff). WEST ELEVATION 259.B The eastern porch of the Abbot's house faces the Annex with the Abbot's Kitchen, Cellar and Bath and for that reason is provided with two passages rather than the single passage of the west porch. EAST ELEVATION the Book of Kells (fig. 245),40 40 For the Quoniam page of the Book of Kells see Sullivan, 1933, Pl. XIV and The Book of Kells in three volumes, facsimile edition, II, 1957, fol. 188r. one cannot help but be struck by the compositional similarities between the layout of its dominant letter masses (stem and loop of the great initial Q) and that of the dominant architectural masses on the Plan of St. Gall (aggregate of churches and cloisters): their asymmetrical axiality, the manner of their framing by secondary surrounding units (fig. 246). One cannot help wonder whether there might not be some compositional connection between the shape of the large inverted L that forms the second dominant motif of the Quoniam-page of the Book of Kells and the manner in which the guest and service buildings to the south and west of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall are pressed into an L-shaped sequence of roofs that frame the dominant building masses of Church and cloister in a similar manner. I am far from attempting to establish any direct connection between the Plan of St. Gall and the Book of Kells—the influence could have come from common sources in a dozen different ways—but should like to confine myself to the more general observation that the comparison suggests that in the grouping of the basic architectural masses of his monastery site the architect may have drawn some inspiration from the grouping of the letter masses on the great illuminated manuscripts of his period. III.2.8 RECONSTRUCTION The reconstruction of the Novitiate and Infirmary (figs. 247-250) complex poses no problems. The round apses of its two chapels, its arcaded cloister walks, its Roman hypocaust system leave no doubt that it was to have been a masonry structure. In determining the heights of these buildings, we have based our calculations on the minimum requirements, as we did in the elevation of the Church. The arcades of the cloister walks would have had to be sufficiently high to give head clearance; the windows of the two chapels, to be above the line that touches the roof of the contiguous cloister walks. We need not assume a clerestory between the roofs of the cloister walks and the contiguous quarters of the novices and the sick, since the exterior walls of these structures would have offered ample space for the installation of windows. The Kitchen and Bathhouse have been reconstructed as timber-framed buildings. Even in considerably later periods ancillary structures of this kind were, as a rule, constructed in timber. III. 3 THE ABBOT'S HOUSE North of the Church, in line with the transept, is the Abbot's House (aula), and with it a narrow annex containing the abbot's kitchen (coquina), cellar (cellari?), and bath (balneatorium), as well as the quarters for his servants (cubiliae famulantium). The yard in which these buildings (fig. 251) stand is enclosed by fences: Saepibus in girum ductis sic cingitur aula All around, the hall is enclosed by fences Only on two sides (south and west) are these fences actually drawn out. The eastern leg of the fence probably coincided with the seam of two connecting sheets of parchment and was presumably left out for that reason.1 1 For similar occurrences in other places, see above, pp. 35ff. The northern portion probably coincided with the outer wall enclosure, which is nowhere shown on the Plan.2 2 See above, pp. 71ff. The plot appears to have been calculated as a square of 100 × 100 feet. The Abbot's House measures 40 × 55 feet; the annex (kitchen, cellar, and bath), 25 × 55 feet; the privy, 10 × 20 feet. III.3.1 THE AULA The aula consists of a double-storied oblong hall divided on the ground floor by a central cross partition into "the abbot's sitting room" (mansio abbatis) and his "bedroom" (dormitori?). On the upper level is the abbot's "store room and solarium" (supra camera et solarium), we are informed by a title written in the pale-brown ink of the second scribe.3 3 See above, pp. 13ff. On either side, along the entire length of the building, there is a "porch brightened by arcades" (porticus arcubus lucida and porticus similis). Both porches are accessible from the abbot's living room and both have doors that open to the exterior, two on the side of the annex, and one on the opposite side giving access to a plot of land that may have served as the abbot's garden. An opening in the center of the southern gable wall of the aula leads through a covered passage into the northern arm of the transept of the Church (ad eclam ingressus). In the opposite gable wall a similar passage connects the dormitory with a "privy" (requisitum naturae), furnished with six seats. Both dormitory and living room are heated by a "corner fireplace" (caminata; caminata).4 4 On heating devices and their development, see II, 117-38. Installed back to back they probably shared a single chimney flue. The abbot's living room is furnished with wall benches (sedilia) and two PLAN OF ST. GALL. ABBOT'S HOUSE, ANNEX WITH KITCHEN, CELLAR &amp; BATH 260.C SOUTH ELEVATION 260.B WEST ELEVATION Our assumption that the Annex of the Abbot's House was meant to be built in timber is reasonable, but by no means compelling. In so important a residence even its service building might have been of masonry. 260.A PLAN AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION The Annex is a narrow building, divided internally into three equal parts which contain the services that make the Abbot's House a self-sufficient residence. It is furnished on the east side with a lean-to which serves as bedrooms for the servants (FAMULANTES) who attend to the Abbot's needs as well as those of the seven monks who share his quarters. cupboards for dishes and drinking vessels (toregmata).5 5 On the term toregma, see above, pp. 269ff. His bedroom has eight "beds" (lecti hic). One of these, set slightly apart from the others and in closer proximity to the fireplace, was presumably the abbot's. III.3.2 OTHER MEDIEVAL BUILDINGS OF THE SAME TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION The plan of the Abbot's aula is, as far as I can judge, the earliest visual record we have of a medieval hall with a solarium. It is also the earliest record of a medieval residence whose rooms are heated by corner fireplaces that release their smoke through a chimney. A solarium is "a place open to the sun";6 6 This derivation is not uncontested. For the etymology of the term and the various theories attached to it, see Stephani, I, 1902, 274, note 2; also Hale, 1858, xcix, note †. in Rome the sun-exposed roofs or decks in front of houses (even the house-fronts of an entire insula) usually supported by colonnades or by arcades, were known as solaria.7 7 Smith, I, 1890, 672; Pauly-Wissowa, Real Encyclopädie, series 2, III, A:1, 1927, cols. 914-15. In medieval literature the term solarium is used varyingly to designate 1) the open galleries that surrounded the upper story of a palace; 2) the window-lighted chambers of the upper story of a palace, even if not surrounded by open galleries; 3) as pars pro toto for the palace; and 4) the galleries or tribunes of churches.8 8 Du Cange, VII, 1938, 511, and the examples cited in note 11 below and in the references listed there. An excellent example of a medieval residence with a solarium is the aula of the Priory of Christ Church at Canterbury. An elevation of this is given in the remarkable twelfth-century drawing which records the system of water distribution and drainage, installed in this Priory around 1165 (fig. 252).9 9 See above, p. 70, fig. 52 for the complete plan. A building of similar design was Harold's castle at Bosham, Sussex, depicted on the famous Bayeux tapestry (ca. 1070-1080) where a drinking feast is being given in the solarium above the ground-floor porches (fig. 253).10 10 For date and latest views on the tapestry, see Gibbs-Smith, 1973, 4. For an interpretation of the representation of Harold's hall and a reconstruction of its plan, see Stephani, I, 1902, 439-40. The solarium as such, however, is a considerably older institution. It was a favorite feature of the palaces of Carolingian emperors and nobles, as is attested by numerous literary references;11 11 Schlosser, 1896, No. 118, solarium of the palace of Charlemagne; No. 182, mansum indominicatum cum solario lapidio, time of Louis the Pious; No. 223, wooden solarium in Flamersheim, 870; No. 233, Imperial palace with solarium, at Gondreville, ca. 840; No. 503, sala cum solario in Secanio, mentioned in last will of Tello of Chur, December 15, 766 (earliest example attested); No. 709, Episcopal residence with solarium in Lyon, 813-815. By the eighth century the solar was also known in England, since reference to a solarium is made in one of Cynewulf's poems, see Pfeilstücker, 1936, 31. For solaria mentioned in documents of the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries, see the indices of Lehmann-Brockhaus, 1935, idem, 1938; Mortet, 1911; and Morter-Deschamps, 1929. in a contemporary work, the Brevium exempla,12 12 The Brevium exempla ad describendas res ecclesiasticas et fiscales are specimen descriptions of property, more or less fiscal in character, which were drawn up around 812 for the guidance of the royal agents engaged in assessing the produce of the domain. The first description is of the possessions of the see of Augsburg on an island in Staffelsee, Bavaria; the second is part of a register of the possessions of the Abbey of Weissenburg in Alsace, and the third is the survey of a group of royal fiscs belonging directly to the Crown. Two of the royal villas mentioned in the latter have been identified: Asnapium, i.e., Anappes (Lille, Nord), and Griscone, being the neighboring villa Gruson. Treola, another villa, was probably in Alamannia. The other unnamed villas were probably situated around Anappes, and are, according to Philip Grierson, the present-day Vitry, Cysoing, and Soumain. For date, presumable place of issue, and identity of unnamed fiscs, see Grierson, 1939; Dopsch, I, 1921, 75ff.; Verhein, 1954 and 1955. we find this description of a royal residence, which sounds like a literary counterpart of the drawing of the Abbot's House on the Plan of St. Gall: Invenimus in Asnapio fisco dominico salam regalem ex lapide factam optime, cameras iii; solariis totam casam circumdatam, cum pisilibus xi; infra cellarium; porticus ii. . . .13 13 Brevium exempla, ch. 25; ed. Boretius, Mon. Germ. Hist., Legum II, Cap. I, 1883, 254. On the crown estate of Anappes we found the royal residence, excellently built in stone, with three chambers, the entire building surrounded with solaria; with eleven heatable rooms; below, the cellar and two porches. . . . Although we lack particulars about this arrangement, the basic structure is clear: a two-story building abutted by two open porches on the ground floor, and above these porches the sunlit galleries designated as solaria. This is, in essence, the arrangement of the hall of William the Conqueror on the Bayeux tapestry (fig. 253), and it is like the aula of the Priory of Christchurch at Canterbury (fig. 252). III.3.3 RECONSTRUCTION Jules Leeman, in his model of 1877 (fig. 267),14 14 See II, 8. and Karl Gruber, in his bird's-eye view of 1952 (fig. 282),15 15 See II, 21. envisioned the Abbot's House as a structure of basilican elevation. Fiechter-Zollikofer (1936)16 16 Fiechter-Zollikofer, 1936, 407, fig. 7. and Otto Volkers (1937)17 17 Völkers, 1937, 33. thought of it is a simple box-shaped house with the second story extending over the porches (figs. 254-255). Leeman's and Gruber's versions appear to me the more likely of the two interpretations, because the Plan does not stipulate that the two porches were to be surmounted by upper galleries or other superincumbent rooms. Each porch is referred to in the singular, porticus arcubus lucida; porticus similis. This suggests that there was nothing above. If the architect had a building in mind in which the second story was to extend out over the porches, he could have stated this simply by adding to their titles supra similiter ("above, a second flight of porches"). There is no doubt that the house was a masonry structure. Its arcuated porches permit no other assumption. As in all the other buildings of the Plan where stairs are missing,18 18 See above, pp. 65ff; and p. 244, fig. 192. we have refrained from introducing them in our reconstruction (fig. 257-259). The problem could have been settled in a number of different ways. Perhaps the Abbot's House was meant to have had an outer flight of stairs, such as those in the Palace of William the Conqueror on the Bayeux tapestry (fig. 253) or in the abbot's house of the Cistercian Monastery of Marienthal near Helmstedt, Germany (fig. 256).19 19 Völkers, loc. cit. Or perhaps it was to have had a circular staircase tower of the type found on the Carolingian gate-house of the Monastery of Lorsch. I do not think that there is any necessity to assume that the annex was a masonry structure. In general, this type of ancillary structure was built in timber, even at considerably later periods. III.3.4 THE ABBOT'S RIGHT TO LIVE IN A SEPARATE HOUSE St. Benedict, in a chapter the brevity of which reflects its importance, grants the abbot the right to live in a separate house: Let the abbot always eat with the guests and pilgrims. But when there are no guests, let him have the power to invite whom he will of the brethren. Yet, for discipline's sake, let one or two seniors always be left with the brethren.20 20 "Mensa abbatis cum hospitibus et peregrinis sit semper. Quotiens tamen minus sunt hospites, quos uult de fratribus uocare, in ipsius sit potestate. Seniore tamen uno aut duo semper cum fratribus dimittendum propter disciplinam." (Benedicti regula, chap. 56; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 131: ed. McCann, 1952, 126-27; ed. Steidle, 1952, 273). During the preliminary discussions of the first synod of Aachen a movement was under way to curtail these freedoms. I have dealt with the dynamics of these attempts at length in a previous chapter.21 21 See above, pp. 20ff. A word should be said, however, to explain the fact that the abbot's bedroom contained seven beds in addition to his own. Chapter 22 of the Rule of St. Benedict prescribes that if possible, all monks should sleep in one place, but if their number does not permit this, they should sleep by tens or twenties, with seniors to supervise them (Si potest fieri, omnes in uno loco dormiant; sin autem multitudo non sinit, deni aut uiceni cum senioribus, qui super eos solliciti sint, pausent).22 22 Benedicti regula, chap. 22; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 77-78; ed. McCann, 1952, 70-71; ed. Steidle, 1952, 200-201. See above, p. 249. In chapter 13 of a capitulary issued at Frankfort in 794, this was interpreted to mean "that the abbot should sleep with the monks in conformity with the Rule" (Ut abbas cum suis dormiat monachis secundum regulam sancti Benedicti).23 23 Synodus Franconofurtensis, June 794, chap. 13, ed. Boretius, Mon. Germ. Hist., Legum II, Capit. I, 1883, 75. In one of the preliminary resolutions formulated during the first synod of Aachen (816) this view was reemphasized: "The abbots shall be subject to the same rules as the brethren in meal and drink, in their sleep and in all other matters" (Ut abates communes esse debeant suis monachis in manducando, in bibendo, in dormiendo seu in ceteris quibuslibet causis.)24 24 See above, p. 22. This can only have been intended to mean that the abbot should be brought back into the company of the monks, at least when he slept. To enlarge the abbot's bedroom into a dormitory, so that he could sleep in the same room with others, may have been an ingenious compromise between the rigorous views of the reformists and the abbot's traditional right to live in a separate house. Hildemar makes some interesting suggestions concerning the criteria which should govern the abbot's selection, should he make use of his "power to invite whom he will of the brethren": This must not be interpreted to mean that the abbot should choose according to his own volition and invite without necessity such men as the dean or the prior; rather should he call upon those who are weak and in need (of his company).25 25 Expositio Hildemari; ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 522: "Non debet intelligi ut illos, quos ad suum libitum vult, i.e. decanum aut praepositum sine necessitate, sed illos debet vocare, qui debiles sunt, quibus necessitas fuerit." Hafner (in Studien, 1962, 190) expressed the view that the dormitory in the Abbot's House was the place where visiting abbots and bishops found accommodation. This appears improbable to me. The appropriate place for dignitaries of such high rank, who always traveled with servants and a protective guard, was the House for Distinguished Guests, which was, in fact, designed so that it could accommodate the retinue as well (see II, 155-65. III.3.5 LATER PRACTICES Separate quarters for the Abbot became a standard practice in the monastic building tradition following the second synod of Aachen. But during the Cluniac reform of the eleventh century this privilege was revoked. The Customs of Udalric written about 1085, tell us that "the abbot's bed stood in the middle of the dormitory next to the wall" and that it was the abbot himself who struck the bell to arouse the brothers for the divine service.26 26 Cf. II, 338. In the early Cistercian monasteries likewise the abbot was at first required to sleep in the monk's dormitory, but later on, in the thirteenth century, he was again installed in a house of his own.27 27 Cf. II, 349. In Carolingian times, I am inclined to think this was the rule rather than the exception; and the Plan of St. Gall must have been a primary force in solidifying that custom. It certainly left its imprint on the monastery for which it was drawn. Gozbert (816-836), during the last six years of his abbacy, was too intensely preoccupied with the completion of his new church to allow himself to get involved in the construction of a new residence. This project was undertaken by his second successor Grimald, abbot of St. Gall from 841-872 (and for much of that time also chancellor at the court of Louis the German), who built himself an aula worthy of his high political standing. Two wall inscriptions of the new building, recorded in Cod. 397 of St. Gall28 28 Versus Sangallenses, V.: Tituli, ed. Karolus Strecker, Mon. Germ. Hist., Poetae Latini aevi Carolini, IV:3, Berlin, 1923, 1108. describe it as follows: Aula palatinis perfecta est ista magistris, Insula pictores transmiserat Augia clara. This hall was built by masters of the palace, while the island of Reichenau furnished its famous painters. A second inscription praised the splendid marble columns of the abbot's residence and stated that it was built by Grimaldus during the reign of Louis the Pious: Splendida marmoreis ornata est aula columnis, Quam Grimoldus ovans firmo fundamine struxit, Ornavit, coluit Hludewici principis almi Temporibus multos laetus feliciter annos. Here is the glamorous palace, with columns of marble augmented, which Grimold with pious intention on solid foundation erected, With art ornamented and cherished, in days of Prince Louis the Pious. Long years thereafter he proudly oversaw the care of its fabric.29 29 Translation by Charles W. Jones. Abbot Grimald's aula stood to the north of the abbey church—like the Abbot's House on the Plan of St. Gall, but a little further east than the latter. In 1414 it was gutted by fire, and subsequently rebuilt internally and re-roofed. In this form it is portrayed on the bird's-eye-view of the City of St. Gall, in 1596 (fig. 507), and all subsequent views II. 318 of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.30 30 Discussed in more detail, II, 318, fig. 507. TABLE I ADMINISTRATIVE AND EXECUTIVE ORGANIZATION OF A BENEDICTINE MONASTERY IN THE TIME OF CHARLEMAGNE AND LOUIS THE PIOUS "The Abbot is believed to be the representative of Christ in the monastery and his order should be received as a divine command and not suffer any delay in execution." St. Benedict, who wrote these lines, was wary of the office of Provost, preferring instead to divide power among deans rather than centralize authority in a second in command, whose presence "might lead to rivalries and dissention." But the growing managerial complexities of the medieval monastery, with its vast web of outlying estates, and with serfs and workmen living within the monastic enclosure itself, made inevitable the existence of such an executive. ‡ Latin words lacking English equivalents are set in roman type, an exception to normal editorial style.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV THE MONASTIC POLITY INTRODUCTION FOLLOWING the example of St. Anthony (251/2-ca. 356), the earliest monks established themselves in the Egyptian desert, living in eremitic isolation, entirely free from the fetters of any form of communal life.1 1 In the brief introductory review of the distinctive differences between Egyptian and Benedictine monachism I am leaning heavily on Dom Cuthbert Butler's incisive analysis of these relationships in Butler, 1898, 228ff. An excellent summary of the architectural layout of the Pachomian monastery, Pachomian customs, and Pachomian monastic hierarchy, as disclosed by the Rule, will be found in Ladeuze, 1898, 273ff. For a further analysis of Benedictine monachism, see Butler, 1919. On St. Basil, see Morison, 1912 and Murphy, 1930. Even when hermits lived in groups, they lived out of earshot of one another and assembled only on Saturdays and Sundays for divine services. Their practice of abstinence and self-mortification reduced the problem of securing nourishment to negligible proportions. Conditions changed when St. Pachomius (292-346) introduced in southern Egypt a new concept of monastic withdrawal, in which large groups of monks banded together to live and worship in common, within the stable enclosure of a fixed architectural settlement. Survival, worship, and conduct under such conditions had to be based on rules and order; and St. Pachomius, the founder of this type of cenobitic monachism, spent the better part of his life organizing and directing his order, which at his death included nine monasteries with some three thousand monks, and a nunnery. Each monastery consisted of a number of separate houses, accommodating thirty to forty monks, segregated accorded to trades—fullers in one, shoemakers in another, carpenters in still another, and so on— and each house had its own praepositus, its own cellarer as well as a variety of other administrative officers.2 2 The architectural layout of the monastery of St. Pachomius is known in general terms through the Rules of the Saint, the earliest extant version of which is a translation from a Greek manuscript into Latin made by St. Jerome around 404. Best edition: Amand Boon, 1932. Most of the religious services were performed in these individual houses; only the more important ones took place in the common church. Although the order as a whole had a remarkably centralized structure with a superior general, a common chapter, and a system of periodic visitations, the spirit within each monastery was surprisingly individualistic. Each monk was permitted to pit himself against the others in order to obtain a record in ascetic exercises such as reducing his measure of sleep and nourishment to the narrowest possible limit, and submitting to the harshest austerities. St. Basil (ca. 330-379), who had occasion to become familiar with the Pachomian system while journeying in Egypt, set himself against these excesses of bodily austerity and perfected the coenobitic form of monastic life by declaring its theoretical supremacy over the eremitical form or the Pachomian syncretism. When monachism spread through the crumbling Roman empire, the West adopted both the eremitical form of life that had been practiced by St. Anthony, and the cenobitic form established in Egypt by St. Pachomius, and in Asia Minor by St. Basil (ca. 330-379). It developed, in addition, a variety of hybrid forms—as in the famous island settlement of Lerins in Gaul, where the senior monks lived in separate cells in the more isolated spots of the island, joining the others for the celebration of the divine services or to receive instruction from the abbot. In their isolated retreats they still followed the Egyptian ideal of asceticism by fasting for prolonged periods and inflicting upon themselves those extreme forms of chastisement leading to ecstasy and devotional hallucination. St. Benedict of Nursia (ca. 480-ca. 547) began his monastic career by practicing these extreme forms of the prevailing type of monachism. For three years he lived in a cave without conversing with men, receiving his food on a rope, which the monk Romanus let down from the high rock that overhung his cave. From St. Gregory's dialogue we learn that he wore animal skins, that he came near to starvation, on at least one occasion, and that on others he overcame temptation by rolling himself naked in the thicket of briars and nettles.3 3 Gregorii Magni Dialogi, Book II, chaps. 1 and 2, ed. Morricca, 1924, 71ff.; ed. Zimmerman, 1959, 55ff. But in the maturity of his later life St. Benedict turned his back on these austerities and wrote a Rule for monastic life that formed such a complete departure from the prevailing types of monachism that it has been termed a revolution rather than a development from the earlier forms. The decisive features of this new concept are a deliberate rejection of the individualistic rivalry in ascetic achievement, which had been the keynote of Egyptian monachism, and the complete submersion of the individual in the community. While the life which St. Benedict prescribes may seem austere if viewed in a present day perspective, it was nothing of the sort when seen in the light of his own time. Whereas Egyptian monachism prohibited the consumption of wine and flesh and demanded that even the permissible types of food be reduced to the lowest limits required for survival, St. Benedict allowed a hemina of wine and a pound of bread per day, and prescribed in addition two dishes of cooked food and a third of fruit and young vegetables.4 4 On the hemina see above, pp. 296ff; on the daily ration of bread, above p. 277, and II, 255. He permits the meat of quadrupeds to be fed to the sick and convalescent,5 5 On meat for the sick and convalescent, see above, p. 314 and II, 185, 264, and 239ff. and is so vague about the consumption of fowl that later generations had no scruples in allowing it during the weeks of the great religious festivals.6 6 On the consumption of fowl, see above, p. 277 and II, 264. Whereas in Egyptian monachism cleanliness was thought to be a sign of worldly corruption or sensuous self-indulgence, St. Benedict permits the bath to both the healthy and the sick.7 7 On the privilege of taking baths, see above, pp. 22 and 262ff. Although certain Egyptian abbots could rule that the monks' clothes should be such that if they were left on the road, no one would think of taking them,8 8 Abbot Pamba, Patrologia Greca, ed. J. Migne, LXV, 1858, 369; cf. Butler, op. cit., p. 253. St. Benedict orders the abbot to see to it "that the monks' clothes fit them, that they are to get new clothes while the old ones are still fit to be given to the poor, that they are to have warmer clothes in the winter, lighter in the summer; that they are to change their clothes for the night, and that they are to be washed."9 9 Butler, loc. cit., and above, pp. 282ff. While in Egypt it was held that sleep should be battled by eternal vigilance and that the monks should lie on bare ground with stones for pillows, St. Benedict not only allowed his monks a normal and healthy ratio of sleep, but besides, also assigned to each a blanket, a coverlet, a mattress, and a pillow.10 10 See above, p. 250. The keynote of all of this is moderation, and it is in the general cultural acceptability of this very concept of moderation that we must recognize one of the primary reasons for the eventual universal success of Benedictine monachism. The second decisively new and creative element of Benedictine monachism pertains to the relation of the individual to the community. Egyptian asceticism had a clearly asocial tinge, which remained a dominant trend even where monks banded together, as in the monasteries of St. Pachomius. St. Benedict, adopting a monastic philosophy that had been developed and propagated in Asia Minor by St. Basil the Great (ca. 330-379), abolished this individualism altogether. His Rule frowns on any special form of penitential practice that would have pitted one monk against another in rivalry. He established instead one common mode of life for all, to which the abbot was held no less than the monks, and in which all segments of the community were bound to each other for life in a daily round of objective duties, consisting of public common prayer, manual work, and reading. It is in this orderly integration of the individual into the monastery as a corporate body that we must recognize a second primary reason for the acceptance of Benedictine monachism by both the ecclesiastical and the secular hierarchies. A third one is to be found in the soundness of the monastery's economic organization. Since the better part of the monk's day was taken up by services rendered to God,11 11 For more details on this, see below, pp. 339ff. the bulk of the basic industrial and agricultural chores on which the community depended for its physical sustenance had to be taken on by others. This brought into the orbit of the monastery, both within and without the monastic enclosure, a host of servants, serfs, and tenants, very much of the kind one would find about the manors of secular dignitaries. The Benedictine monastery in this way acquired the character of a landed estate, which differed from those of the secular lords solely by the fact that it had embedded in it a house of religious devotion and a school for religious learning. The successful management of this complex cultural organism depended on the existence of a well-trained staff of monastic administrators. The responsibilities of these men are defined in the Rule of St. Benedict, to the extent to which their offices existed in his days. Later developments are reflected in a brief about monastic officials written around 834-836 in the monastery of Bobbio by Abbot Wala,12 12 Breve memorationis Walae, ed. Semmler, in Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 420-22. brother of Abbot Adalhard of Corbie and the latter's successor at Corbie (823-833). A good deal of additional information can be gleaned from the Administrative Directives of Abbot Adalhard.13 13 Consuetudines Corbeienses, ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 355-420. Complete translations by Charles W. Jones of these two important sources are given in Volume III, Appendix II. There is no need to stress the fact that the review of monastic administrative organization offered in this chapter must by necessity remain abstract. There were many local variations in the number of existing positions, and in their titles. For a more detailed account of these one must turn to local sources such as the chronicles of St. Gall by Ratpert and Ekkehart IV, and to the unusually rich documentary legacy of this monastery, published by Wartmann.14 14 The administrative officials of the monastery of St. Gall were the subject of a special study, with careful tabulations, published as Excursi in Meyer von Knonau's editions of the Casus s. Galli by Ratpert (1872) and by Ekkehart IV. (1877). See Meyer von Knonau "Die bei Wartmann, Bd. I und II genannten St. Gallen'schen Officialen und deren Beziehungen zur Verwaltung der klösterlichen Oekonomie," Mittheilungen zur vaterländischen Geschichte, her. vom Historischen Verein in St. Gallen, XIII, 1872, 65-86 und "Die St. Gallen'schen Officialen von 920 bis zum Ende des zehnten Jahrhunderts," ibid. XV/XVI, 1877, 451-55. Also to be consulted in this connection are a study by K. H. Ganahl, published in 1931, and two articles by Paul Staerkle, one published in 1964, the other in 1966. All of these abound with references not only to the various administrative departments (called ministeria or officia) but also to the names and titles of their individual holders (officiales). MAJUSCULE LETTERS. OXFORD, BODLEIAN LIBRARY, HATTON 48, FOLS. 58R, 11V, 51V [shown same size as originals]. These letters (and passages reproduced below, pp. 330-45) are from the oldest extant copy of the Rule of St. Benedict, written in England around A.D. 700. The text is rendered in SCRIPTURA CONTINUA (i.e., without word spaces) in uncial letters of massive dignity, the opening of each chapter enhanced by handsome rubricated capitals. Ornamented initials are a distinctive trait of 7th- and 8th-century Hiberno-Saxon schools of illumination. Often initials extend over an entire page, suppressed beyond legibility in waves of the most exuberant, yet always carefully constructed interlace (cf. figs. 178-85, fig. 245). Through such manuscripts the Rule of St. Benedict was transmitted to the new barbarian nations of the north. On them is founded the entire history of medieval monasticism. They played a crucial role in deliberations of two reform synods of Aachen, from which the Plan of St. Gall emerged. D. H. Farmer (The Rule of St. Benedict, Oxford, Bodleian Library, Hatton 48, Copenhagen 1968) believes Hatton 48 is the English copy of a manuscript of the Rule brought to England by St. Winifred, who died in 709. II QUALIS DEBEAT ABBAS ESSE 1 Abbas, qui praeesse dignus est monasterio, semper meminere debet, quod dicitur, et nomen maioris factis implere. 2 Christi enim agere uices in monasterio creditur, quando ipsius uocatur pronomine WHAT KIND OF MAN THE ABBOT SHOULD BE An Abbot who is worthy to rule a monastery should always remember what he is called and realize in his actions the name of a superior. For he is believed to be the representative of Christ in the monastery, and for that reason is called by a name of his IV. 1 THE MONASTIC OFFICIALS IV.1.1 THE ABBOT (ABBAS) AUTHORITY AND OBLIGATION The head of the monastic community is the abbot. His qualifications and duties are set forth in chapters 2, 3, 27, and 64 of the Rule of St. Benedict—so fully and incisively as to have resisted all later attempts for revision and amplification. "The abbot is believed to be the representative of Christ in the monastery," Benedict declares,15 15 Christi enim agere uices in monasterio creditur, quando ipsius uocatur pronomine . . . abba pater. Benedicti regula, chap. 2.1; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 19-27; ed. McCann, 1952, 16-17; ed. Steidle, 1952, 79-94. and for that reason called abba, i.e., father—an epithet derived from Abba, Pater, addressed to Jesus and by Jesus himself addressed to the Lord.16 16 Epistle of Paul to the Romans, chap. VIII, 15. On the antiquity of the term abba and its use by the Christians, see the comments of Steidle, 1952, 84ff and the sources quoted in Blume, 1965, 2, note 2. His authority over the monastery is complete and unquestioned, extending even to those through whom it is enforced: "As soon as anything has been ordered by the superior, let it be received as a divine command and not suffer any delay in execution . . . for the obedience which is given to the superior is given to God."17 17 Mox aliquid imperatum a maiore fuerit, ac si diuinitus imperetur, moram pati nesciant in faciendo . . . quia oboedientia, quae maioribus praebetar, deo exhibetur. Benedicti regula, chap. 5.4 and 15; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 35-38; ed. McCann, 1952, 33-35; ed. Steidle, 1952, 117-21. In exercising his authority, if the matter is of general concern, the abbot must take council with his monks and hear what each one, including the youngest, thinks;18 18 Quotiens aliqua praecipua agenda sunt in monasterio, conuocet abbas omnem congregationem et dicat ipse, unde agitur . . . . Ideo autem omnes ad consilium uocari diximus, quia saepe iuniori dominus reuelat, quod melius est. Benedicti regula, chap. 1 and 3, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 27-29; ed. McCann, 1952, 24-25; ed. Steidle, 1952, 94-96. if the business to be done is of lesser importance, he may act on the advice of the seniors only,19 19 Si qua uero minora agenda sunt in monasterii utilitatibus, seniorum tantum utatur consilio. Benedicti regula, chap. 3, 12; ed. cit., loc. cit. but in either case "the decision depends entirely on the abbot's judgment, so that when he has decided what is the better course, all may obey."20 20 Et magis in abbatis pendat aruitrio, ut, quod salubrius esse iudicauerit, ei cuncti oboediant. Benedicti regula, chap. 3, 5; ed. cit., loc. cit. In all things the abbot must make disposition with prudence and justice, "knowing that he will certainly have to render account of all his judgments to God, the most high judge."21 21 Ipse tamen abba cum timore dei et obseruatione regulae omnia faciat sciens se procul duuio de omnibus iudiciis suis aequissimo iudici deo rationem redditurum. Benedicti regula, chap. 3, 11; ed. cit., loc. cit. The same thought is expressed in chap. 2, 6: Memor semper abbas, quia doctrinae suae uel discipulorum oboedientiae utrarumque rerum in tremendo iudicio dei facienda erit discussio. Benedicti regula, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 19-27; ed. McCann, 1952, 16-23; ed. Steidle, 1952, 79-84. He must neither make any personal distinctions in the monastery, not love one more than another, nor put a freeborn monk before one that was a slave, "unless he find him better in good works and obedience" or "there be some other just reason," in which case he "may fix anyone's order as he will." Otherwise, he must keep them "in their due places,"22 22 Non unus plus ametur quam alius, nisi quem in bonis actibus aut oboedientia inuenerit meliorem. Non conuertenti ex seruitio praeponatur ingenuus, nisi alia rationabilis causa existat. Quod si ita iustitia dictante abbati uisum fuerit, et de cuiuslibet ordine id faciet; sin alias, propria teneant loca, quia siue seruus siue liber omnes in Christo unum sumus. Benedicti regula, chap. 2, 17-20; ed. cit., loc. cit. i.e., the order of seniority established by the date of joining the community. In administering correction the abbot must proceed with due prudence and moderation "lest being too zealous in removing the rust he break the vessel."23 23 In ipsa autem correptione prudenter agat et ne quid nimis, ne dum nimis eradere cupit eruginem, frangatur uas. Benedicti regula, chap. 64, 12; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 148-52; ed. McCann, 1952, 144-49; ed. Steidle, 1952, 307-11. "Let him adapt himself to circumstances, now using severity and now persuasion, displaying the rigor of a master and the loving kindness of a father . . . and let him not shut his eyes to the faults of offenders."24 24 Id est miscens temporibus tempora, terroribus blandimenta, dirum magistri, pium patris ostendat affectum. Benedicti regula, chap. 2, 24; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 23; ed. McCann, 1952, 16-23; ed. Steidle, 1952, 79-84. As the titular head of the monastery and its only link with the outside world, the abbot was empowered "to eat with the guests and pilgrims" and for that purpose was provided with his own kitchen "so that the brethren may not be disturbed when guests—who are never lacking in a monastery—arrive at irregular hours."25 25 Benedicti regula, chaps. 53 and 56; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 123-27 and 131-33; McCann, 1952, 118-23 and 126-27; ed. Steidle, 1952, 257-60 and 273ff. The abbot's right to eat with the guests and pilgrims was one of the few directives of the Rule which became a stumbling block to later generations. For a detailed discussion of this issue, see above, p. 22. ELECTIVITY OF OFFICE The office of the abbot is elective, but has to be confirmed by the local bishop, who also has the power of correction: "Let him who is appointed be chosen for the merits of his life and his enlightened wisdom, even though he be the last in order of the community. But if (which God forbid) the whole community should agree to choose a person who acquiesces in its vices, and if these somehow come to the knowledge of the local bishop and neighboring abbots or Christians, let him foil this conspiracy of the wicked and set a worthy steward over God's house."26 26 Uitae autem merito et sapientiae doctrina elegatur, qui ordinandus est, etiam si ultimus fuerit in ordine congregationis. Quod si etiam omnis congregatio uitiis suis, quod quidem absit, consentientem personam pari consilio elegerit et uitia ipsa aliquatenus in notitia episcopi, ad cuius diocesim pertinet locus ipse, uel ad abbates aut Christianos uicinos claruerint, prohibeant praborum praeualere consensum, sed domui dei dignum constituant dispensatorem. Benedicti regula, chap. 64, 2-5, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 148-49; ed. McCann, 1952, 144-49; ed. Steidle, 1952, 307-11. St. Benedict here refers to a condition which Pope Leo the Great defines in succinct terms in a letter written in 446, namely, that in the case of a controversial or contended election it was the prerogative of the bishop who presided over the diocese in which the monastery was situated to decide which party has "the more healthy insight." (Leo the Great, Letter 14, chap. 5; ed. Migne, Patr. Lat., LIV, 1881, col. 673; ed. Hunt, 1957, 63.) For more details on the jurisdictional relationships between bishop and abbot, in pre-Benedictine days, see Steidle's excursus "Die Rechtliche Lage des alten Mönchtums" in Steidle, 1952, 66ff. In the kingdom of the Franks there was another power to be contended with, the secular ruler; the capitularies of Charlemagne leave no doubt on this score: Of the abbots and of the monks we wish and order that they be subject to their bishops in full humility and obedience, as is ordained by canonical law. . . . They will have to account to the bishops of their province; if they do not mend their manners, the archbishop will have to call them to the synod. If even then they do not correct themselves, they must come before our presence with their bishops.27 27 Capitulare missorum generale, 802, chap. 15, ed. Boretius, in Mon. Germ. Hist., Legum II, Capit. I, 1883, 94: "Abbates autem et monachis omnis modis volumus et precipimus, ut episcopis suis omni humilitate et hobhedientia sint subiecti, sicut canonica constitutione mandat . . . Et monachi ab episcopo provinciae ipsius corripiantur; quod si se non emendent, tunc archiepiscopus eos ad sinodum convocet; et si neque sic se correxerint, tunc ad nostra praesentiam simul cum episcopo suo veniant." The same idea is expressed in Capitula Francica (prior to 805?), chap. 5, op. cit., 214: ("Et quomodo abbates vel abbatisse subiecti sunt episcopis"); in Capitula ecclesiastica (810-813?), ch. 4, op. cit., 182 ("Ut episcopi habeant potestatem in eorum parochia sicut canon docet faciendi tam in vicis publicis, seu in monasteriis"); and as early as 794 in the Concilium Francofurtense, chap. 2, in Mon. Germ. Hist., Concilia, II, 1, 166ff. A classical case of the use of these powers was the deposition of Abbot Ratger of Fulda in 817 by Emperor Louis the Pious.28 28 Discussed above, pp. 187ff. MANORIAL POWER AND MILITARY OBLIGATIONS By the time the Plan of St. Gall was drawn, the abbot had become lord of a vast and ramified system of manorial estates which placed him economically and socially on a par with many of the leading secular lords of the empire. It was as landowner and as landlord of tenants and vassals that the abbot became subject to military assessments. At the time of St. Benedict it would have been unthinkable that the abbot participate in any military activities. But in the kingdom of the Franks the monasteries were held to contribute their share of the country's defense and although numerous public laws forbade that the abbots should personally ride into battle,29 29 For more details, see below, pp. 342ff. the emperors did not hesitate to order them to the rallies that preceded military campaigns with their armed and mounted vassals, and to specify the number of wagons and the volume of other military gear and provisions, to be taken along on these journeys.30 30 Karoli ad Fulradum epistola, cf. below, p. 347; and Prinz, 1971, 74-76. IV.1.2 THE PROVOST OR PRIOR (PRAEPOSITUS) Highest in rank after the abbot was the provost. St. Benedict recommended his appointment "if the circumstances of the place required it," but warned that rivalries and dissensions might arise from the presence of a second in command, "for there are men puffed up by an evil spirit of pride who regard themselves as equal to the LXV. DE PRAEPOSITO MONASTERII 1 Sepius quidem contigit, ut per ordinationem praepositi scandala grabia in monasteriis oriantur. 65 THE PRIOR OF THE MONASTERY It frequently happens that the appointment of a prior gives rise to serious scandals in monasteries. abbot."31 31 Quod si aut locus expetit aut congregatio petierit rationabiliter cum humilitate et abbas iudicauerit expedire, quemcumque elegerit abbas cum consilio fratrum timentium deum, ordinet ipse sibi praepositum, Benedicti regula, chap. 65, 14-15; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 152-55; ed. McCann, 1952, 148-51; ed. Steidle, 1952, 316-19. The dangers invoked by the appointment of a second-in-command are pointed out in the first two lines of the same chapter: Sepius quidem contigit, ut per ordinationem praepositi scandala grabia in monasteriis oriantur, dum sint aliqui maligno spiritu superbiae inflati et aestimantes se secundos esse abbates, adsumentes sibi tyrannidem, scandala nutriant et dissensiones in congregationes faciunt; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 152-55; ed. McCann, 1952, 148-51; ed. Steidle, 1952, 316-19. The office, nevertheless, became firmly established, probably because of the growing economic and administrative complexities of the medieval monastery. Chapter 29 of the resolutions of the first synod of Aachen (816) affirms the position of the provost as the direct representative of the abbot.32 32 Synodi primae decr. auth., chap. 29; ed. Semmler, in Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 466: "Ut praepositus intra et extra monasteria post abbatem maiorem reliquis abbati subditis habeat potestatem." Wala describes his duties as follows: The provost should be first after the abbot inside and outside the monastery; but these especially should be in his jurisdiction, to wit all work in the fields and the vineyards and on the buildings; and of the potters and the shepherds and of all the cells situated in this valley, except those which are assigned to the care of other brothers, or all farms held in fee, horses tamed and untamed, and he should allocate the quarters in the monastery according to need.33 33 PREPOSITUS PRIMUS sit post abbatem in monasterio infra extraque, tamen specialiter haec sint in sua potestate, id est omnis laboratio agrorum et vinearum et edifitiorum, figulorumque, pastorum atque omnium cellarum hac in valle consistentium, preter illas qaae aliorum fratrum providentiae depputantur, seu omnes cartes quae ad stipendi &lt;um&gt; pertinent, caballi domiti indomitique, et ipse mansiones in monasterio cui necessarie sunt distribuat. Breve memorationis Walae, ed. Semmler, in Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 421, 25. Under the jurisdiction of the provost were the keeper of the vineyards (custos vinearum), the master carpenter, and all other masters who worked in wood and stone (magister carpentarius et omnes magistri de ligno et lapide).34 34 Breve memorationis Walae, ed. cit., 422. IV.1.3 THE DEAN (DECANUS) The dean was in charge of the spiritual conduct of the monks and of monastic discipline. Wala informs us that he took the responsibility for the monastery as a whole, as the third in command, when the abbot and the prior were absent.35 35 DECANUS *** ubique specialiter curam habeat intra extraque de conversatione fratrum et cottidianus cum fratribus in obedientia sit, et si defuerit abbas seu prepositus, cuncta ad ipsum respiciant. Breve memorationis Walae, ed. cit., 421, 30. Originally the term decanus was a denotation for the leader of a group of ten men, both in secular and in ecclesiastical life. Wala uses the title in the singular form, clear evidence that by the ninth century the institution of multiple deanships had made allowance for the emergence of a senior dean who could act as vicegerent for the abbot or prior. The division of the community of monks into groups of ten, each under the spiritual and disciplinary supervision of a dean, is an old monastic custom attested by St. Jerome, St. Augustine, Cassian36 36 For courses see Steidle, 1952, 198 note 1. Cassian traces the deanships back to Exodus 18: 25, where it is said that "Moses chose able man out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens." and St. Benedict. St. Benedict stipulates that they be chosen "not by order (of seniority) but according to their worthiness of life, learning and wisdom."37 37 Benedicti regula, chap. 21; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 76-77; ed. McCann, 1952, 68-71; ed. Steidle, 1952, 198-200. He preferred a division of power among deans to the centralization of authority in the person of a prior, since "the business being thus shared by many, no individual will become proud."38 38 Benedicti regula, chap. 65; ed. cit., see note 31 above. A late reflection of this influence can be seen in the rulings of the Council of Mainz (813), which also favored the sole institution of deans,39 39 Concilium Moguntinum (813), chap. 40; ed. Werminghoff, in Mon. Germ. Hist., Concilia, II:1, 1908, 263; Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 263. but it was revoked by the first synod of Aachen in 816. Until the beginning of the ninth century, however, the deans had occupied a rank superior to that of the prior in such monasteries as Fulda, Reichenau, St. Gall, and Weissenburg.40 40 Verhulst and Semmler, loc. cit. XXI. DE DECANIS MONASTERII 1 Si maior fuerit congregatio, elegantur de ipsis fratres boni testimonii et sanctae conuersationis et constituantur decani. 21 THE DEANS OF THE MONASTERY If the community be a large one, let there be chosen out of it brethren of good repute and observant life, and let them be appointed deans. IV.1.4 THE CELLARER (CELLARARIUS) The Cellarer was in charge of everything pertaining to the kitchen or to food after it had reached the monastery (except for bread and fruit in the case of the monasteries of Bobbio and Corbie).41 41 CELLARARIUS pre/videat quicquid ad cibum et ad potum pertinet postquam in monasterio adducta fuerint, preter panem et pomam, atque dispenset, et ad ipsius curam pertineat quod in refectorio vel in quoquina agi &lt;tur&gt;. Breve memorationis Walae, ed. cit., 422, 1. The duties of the Cellarer are also detailed in the Administrative Directives of Abbot Adalhard of Corbie. See Consuetudines Corbeienses, ed. Semmler, 1963, 383ff. and the translation by Charles W. Jones, III, 118ff. St. Benedict asks that he be "a man who is prudent, of mature character, temperate, not a great eater, not proud, not headstrong, not rough-spoken, not lazy, not wasteful, but a God-fearing man, who may be like a father to the whole community. . . . Let him not vex the brethren. . . . Let him neither practice avarice, nor be wasteful and a squanderer of the monastery's substance; but let him do all things with measure and in accordance with the instructions of the abbot"42 42 Cellararius monasterii eligatur de congregatione sapiens, maturis moribus, sobrius, non multum edax, non elatus, non turbulentus, non iniuriosus, non tardus, non prodigus, sed timens deum, qui omni congregationi sit sicut pater . . . fratres non contristet . . . Neque auaritiae studeat neque prodigus sit et stirpator substantiae monasterii, sed omnia mensurate faciat et secundum iussionem abbatis. Benedicti regula, chap. 31, 1-2, 6, and 12; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 87-89; ed. McCann, 1952, 80-82; ed. Steidle, 1952, 220-22. Cf. Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 264. to whom he had to render a full and strict account of his expenditure. Adalhard of Corbie paints a vivid picture of the various duties of the cellarer in supervising the cooks in the kitchen: he was to name what brothers were to serve in the kitchen every week, to see that they did their job to satisfaction and to check carefully all the utensils they had used at the end of their service. He also was in charge of the laymen who did the rough work of cleaning and dressing the food for the kitchen.43 43 Consuetudines Corbeienses; ed. Semmler, in Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 383-86; and Jones, III, Appendix II, 109ff. In larger monasteries, such as Bobbio and Corbie, the senior cellarer was assisted by a junior cellarer who apportioned to each brother his daily measure (hemina) of wine and looked out for the cleanliness of the Refectory and its utensils.44 44 Breve memorationis Walae, 422; and Consuetudines Corbeienses, 383. Still another assistant cellarer, the cellarer of the servants (cellararius familiae), took care of the monastery's serfs and servants, under the supervision of the prior.45 45 CELLARARIUS FAMILIE provideat potum illorum sub preposito. Breve memorationis Walae, ed. cit., 422, 5. The keeper of the bread (custos panis) was responsible for the storage of the grain, after it had arrived in the monastery, as well as for the bread and the bakers.46 46 CUSTOS PANIS provideat annonam, postquam in monasterio adducta fuerit, panem et pistores. Breve memorationis Walae, ed. cit., 422, 7. He had to reckon in advance how much bread he would use each day of the year, and like the cellarer, had to give a strict account of his expenditures.47 47 Consuetudines Corbeienses; ed. Semmler, 1963, 377-78, and Jones, III, Appendix II, 107. XXXI. DE CELLARARIO MONASTERII, QUALIS SIT 1 Cellararius monasterii eligatur de congregatione sapiens, maturis moribus, sobrius, non multum edax, non elatus, non turbulentus, non inuriosus, non tardus, non prodigus, 2 sed timens deum, qui omni congregationi sit sicut pater. 31 WHAT KIND OF A MAN THE CELLARER SHOULD BE As cellarer of the monastery let there be chosen out of the community a man who is prudent, of mature character, temperate, not a great eater, not proud, not headstrong, not rough-spoken, not lazy, not wasteful, but a God-fearing man who may be like a father to the whole community. IV.1.5 THE CHAMBERLAIN (CAMERARIUS) The chamberlain was responsible for the clothing of the brothers, their bedding, and all the monastery's tools and utensils. In certain monasteries, such as Bobbio, this function was divided between two officers, a senior chamberlain (camerarius) and the abbot's chamberlain (camerarius abbatis).48 48 CAMERARIUS PRIMUS provideat omnia vestimenta vel pannos ad diversos usus fratrum seu calciamenta pedum ac manuum, et sutores calciamentorum ac vestimentorum seu conpositores pellium, et calderarios provideat, quibus administret opus eorum, et curtes ad cammaram deputatas, de quibus hec prefata exigenda sunt, et omnia erea vasa quae ad usus fratrum data sunt. CAMERARIUS ABBATIS provideat omnes fabros, scutarios, sellarios, tornatores, pergamentarios, furbitores, et ipse prevideat omnia ferramenta. IUNIOR PREPOSITUS super opera et operarios ceteros, preter eos qui in diversis officinis deputati sunt. Breve memorationis Walae, ed. cit., 422, 18-27. Wala defines their duties as follows: The first chamberlain should have charge of all clothing and blankets for the diverse needs of the brothers, and footwear, and gloves, and shoemakers and garment-makers, and makers of fur clothing and the bronzesmiths whose work he supervises, and the villas assigned to his office, from which the aforesaid provisions are drawn, and all bronze instruments that are furnished for the use of the brothers. The chamberlain of the abbot should have charge of all blacksmiths, shieldmakers, trenchermakers, wheelwrights, furbishers, and he should look after all iron tools. On the Plan of St. Gall all these crafts, except those of the wheelwrights and coopers, were performed in one workshop (Great Collective Workshop).49 49 See II, 189. At the monastery of Corbie, and probably many others, the chamberlain was the superior of the keeper of the clothes (vestiarius) as well as the gardener (ortolanus).50 50 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 264. IV.1.6 THE PORTER* * See ill.I.345, for excerpt from Hatton 48. (OSTIARIUS) The porter was in charge of food and shelter for visitors. He received the monastery's guests, announced them to the abbot, if worthy of attention, and assigned them to the appropriate quarters. In order to be able to perform this task he drew one-tenth of all the monastery's revenue.51 51 PORTARIUS hospites omnes suscipiat primum et nuntiet, de&lt;ci&gt;mas omnium rerum accipiat, de quibus iuxta constitutum tribuat hospitaliario pauperum. Breve memorationis Walae, ed. cit., 422, 9-11. For a more detailed review of the porter's duties and qualifications see II, 153ff and St. Benedict's thoughtful analysis of the criteria to be used in the appointment of this official, in Benedicti regula, chap. 66; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 155-57; ed. McCann, 1952, 152-53; ed. Steidle, 1952, 320-21; cf. Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 264. He was the superior of the master of the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers (procurator pauperum) and furnished the latter with all the supplies required for his service. The master of the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers also took care of the sick who came to the monastery, and distributed to the indigents a fifth of all of the revenues in money that came into the porter's hands.52 52 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 265-66 and II, 153. IV.1.7 THE WARDEN OF THE SICK (CUSTOS INFIRMORUM) Wala describes the warden of the sick succinctly, as the official "who should look after the sick and his helpers."53 53 CUSTOS INFIRMORUM prevideat eos &lt;cum&gt; adiutoribus suis Breve memorationis Walae, ed. cit., 422, 16. It is noteworthy that neither the Rule of St. Benedict nor later monastic consuetudinaries refer to a physician's being a member of the regular monastic hierarchy of officials.54 54 See II, 175ff. IV.1.8 THE MASTER OF THE NOVICES (MAGISTER PULSANTIUM) He is not mentioned in Wala's brief, but his office is implied in chapter 58 of the Rule of St. Benedict,55 55 Benedicti regula, chap. 58; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 133-38; ed. McCann, 1952, 128-33; ed. Steidle, 1952, 294-97. and a special room was assigned to him in the Novitiate of the Plan of St. Gall.56 56 See above, p. 313. IV.1.9 THE SACRISTAN (CUSTOS ECCLESIAE) The supervision of the services that were celebrated at the altar, as opposed to the choral phase of the opus dei, was the responsibility of the sacristan. Abbot Wala refers to him simply as "keeper of the church (custos ecclesiae) and lists among his responsibilities the "care of the lamps of the church and its every ornament, and the regulation of the hours" (competentia horarum), i.e., the important task of assuring the correct maintenance of the prescribed liturgical timetable. He also "receives the alms that come to the brothers."57 57 CUSTOS ECLESIAE provideat luminaria et omne ornamentum eiusdem, seu conpetentiam orarum, et ipse recipiat elemosinam, quae fratribus advenerit. Breve memorationis Walae, ed. cit., 421, 33-35. Later consuetudinaries inform us that his manifold duties included maintaining the cleanliness of the chalices and cruets for wine and water, preparing the host, ringing the bells or instructing others to do so, distributing candles throughout the household offices, and taking charge of burials, both lay and religious.58 58 The Monastic Constitutions of Lanfranc; ed. Knowles, 1951, 82-85, and idem in Cory. Cons. Mon., III, 1967, 69-70. IV.1.10 THE CHOIRMASTER (CANTOR) "The choirmaster," Abbot Wala states, "should regulate whatever pertains to the chant."59 59 CANTOR ordinet quicquid ad cantum pertinet. Breve memorationis Walae, ed. cit., 422, 17. He is assisted in this task by others specially trained in chant, the praecentor, the succentor and the concentor.60 60 For more detail on their specific functions see the chapter "The Monks," below, p. 339. Since the service books used in the chant and other phases of the divine service formed the nucleus of every monastic library the choirmaster, in early times served often as librarian.61 61 See above, pp. 147ff. Under the impetus of the Carolingian revival of learning, this latter function was transferred to a special official, the librarian.62 62 In the monastery of St. Gall this office was instituted under Abbot Grimald (841-872). The first known holder of the title is Liuthard (858-886), whose name appears on charters as diaconus et bibliothecarius and as monachus et bibliothecarius (Bruckner, 1938, 33). Librarians of unusual distinction, at the monastery of St. Gall, were Notker Balbulus, who served under Abbot Hartmut (872-883) and Waldram, who served under Abbot Solomon III (890-919). See Bruckner, op. cit., 39. IV.1.11 THE LIBRARIAN (BIBLIOTHECARIUS OR ARMARIUS) "The Librarian is to have care of all books, readings, and writings."63 63 BIBLIOTHECARIUS omnium librorum curam habeat, lectionum atque scriptorum. Breve memorationis Walae, ed. cit., 421, 36-37. He is in charge of both the library and the scriptorium. He receives his orders directly from the abbot, distributes the workload, provides the scribes with all the requisites needed for their work (desks, parchment, ink, pens, penknives, pumice stone for smoothing the parchment, awls and rulers for making guidelines, reading frames to hold the original being copied)64 64 For details of the equipment needed in the scriptorium see Wattenbach's chapter on "Die Schreibgeräte und ihre Anwendung," Wattenbach, 1875, 170-263. and sees to it that no one, during the hours of work, leaves the scriptorium without permission.65 65 Roover, op. cit., 606. XXXII. DE FERRAMENTIS UEL REBUS MONASTERII 1 Substantia monasterii in ferramentis uel uestibus seu quibuslibet rebus praeuideat abbas fratres, de quorum uita et moribus securus sit, 2 et eis singula, ut iudicauerit utile, consignet custodienda atque recolligenda. 32 THE TOOLS AND PROPERTY OF THE MONASTERY For the care of the monastery's property in tools, clothing, and all other articles, let the abbot appoint brethren on whose life and character he can rely: and let him, as he shall judge fit, commit the various articles to them, to be looked after and to be collected again. IV.1.12 THE KEEPER OF THE CHARTERS (CUSTOS CARTARUM) As the monastery grew from the relatively simple economic organization of the time of St. Benedict into the complex manorial enterprise of the Middle Ages, there arose a need for a genre of scribes distinct from those who devoted their time to copying books—the writers of charters.66 66 For more details on this division of labor see Bruckner's estimate of scribes used for these varying tasks in the monastery of St. Gall under Abbot Johannes (760-780) and under Abbot Gozbert (816-837). Bruckner, op. cit., 17ff. This activity was placed into the hands of a new official, The Keeper of the Charters who, Wala tells us, "should take care of all the monastery's records."67 67 CUSTOS CARTARUM omnia prevideat monasterii monimenta. Breve memorationis Walae, ed. cit., 421, 38. Besides all these major officials there were a number of minor functionaries. There were junior deans (decani iuniores) to whom the senior dean could delegate any particular function of his office of maintaining monastic discipline.68 68 Breve memorationis Walae, ed. cit., 422, 33. The masters of the children (magistri infantum) were the constant companions of the youngsters, as is made abundantly clear by Hildemar in his commentary on the Rule of St. Benedict.69 69 Expositio Hildemari; ed. Mittermüller, 1890, 418. See above, p. 313. The roundsmen (circatores), mentioned by both Wala and Adalhard,70 70 Breve memorationis Walae, ed. cit., loc. cit., 422; Consuetudines Corbeienses, ed. cit., loc. cit., 417. consist of an indefinite number of seniors charged with supervision in the cloister and dormitory. Hildemar stresses that these seniors must be "highly qualified" (valde boni) because "it is through men of this type that the orderly conduct of monastic life is maintained" (quia per istos ordo monachorum consistit). They have "the power," should the need arise, "to correct the deans, the provosts, and even the abbot" (potestatem debent habere corrigendi decanos et praepositos, etiam abbatem).71 71 Expositio Hildemari; ed. Mittermüller, 1890, 483. The synod of 816 stipulates that their custody over the monks extends to work performed both within and without the monastic enclosure.72 72 Synodi primae decr. auth., chap. 32; ed. Semmler, in Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 466. Wala's brief also makes mention of a caretaker of the lamps (lucernarius) and a keeper of the orchard (custos pomorum).73 73 Breve memorationis Walae, ed. cit., loc. cit. Thus, in a monastery of the time of Louis the Pious, some twenty to thirty monks were engaged in important administrative functions, and since each of these officials had, in addition, an indefinite number of assistants, it was possible for about half of the entire community, as Dom Knowles has pointed out, to have been engaged in one way or another in administrative responsibilities.74 74 Knowles, 1950, 429. IV. 2 THE MONKS IV.2.1 ELIGIBILITY &amp; SOCIAL BACKGROUND Although the Rule of St. Benedict granted admission in principle to men of all walks of life, all classes, types and ages,1 1 Decisive in this context are the words: "Let not a freeborn monk be put before one that was a slave unless there be some other reasonable ground for it, . . . because whether slaves or freeman, we are all one in Christ." Benedicti regula, chap. 2, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 22-23; ed. McCann, 1952, 18-19; ed. Steidle, 1952, 81-82. in the early days of monasticism most of the monks appear to have come from lower-middle-class families.2 2 Knowles, 1950, 9-10. At the time of Charlemagne and Louis the Pious, by contrast, the monks were drawn almost exclusively from the ranks of the freemen and the nobility. This held true in a special sense for the royal foundations. In some of these, such as the Abbey of St.-Riquier (Centula), the Frankish nobility was so widely represented that the eleventh century chronicler Hariulf could exclaim that "every higher dignitary, wherever located in the kingdom of the Franks, boasted of having a relative in this abbey . . . for in this monastery were educated dukes, the sons of dukes and even the sons of kings."3 3 For a fuller quotation of this passage see II, 168. On nobility in the Abbey of Corbie, see Charles W. Jones, III, 95. Also to be consulted in this connection are Schulte, 1910, and Prinz, 1975, both treating the question of aristocracy and Christianity in the medieval church. The passage must be taken with some caution as it refers more specifically to men who received their education in the monastery of St. Riquier than to regular and permanent monks of this abbey; but a remark of another chronicler, of the same period, likewise coined with regard to a royal abbey, is unequivocal in its reference to monks of regular standing: "For although St. Gall has never had a monk who was not of free birth," writes Ekkehart IV in his account of the death of Wolo, a noble monk of unruly temper, "those of more noble rank erred more often."4 4 "Nam cum nunquam sanctus Gallus nisi libertatis monachum habuisset, nobiliores tamen sepius aberrabant." (Ekkeharti (IV.) Casus s. Galli, chap. 43; ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 153; ed. Helbling, 1958, 90.) The documentary sources published by Wartmann, 1863-92, appear to confirm the veracity of Ekkehart's claim. For conditions in St. Gall specifically see Henggeler, 1926; Ganahl, 1926; and Staerkle, 1964 and 1966; Prinz, 1967. The pride with which these statements were made suggests that they reflect the special conditions found in royal abbeys rather than a principle universally practiced in the recruiting of monks. Yet that the social composition of recruits both for monastery and church was not a matter of fleeting concern to the empire, may be gathered from such crucial imperial ordinances as the famous Admonitio generalis, issued in 789, where these institutions are directed to attach to themselves as future monks and clergy "not only infants from servile classes, but also the sons of freemen" (non solum servilis conditionis infantes, sed etiam ingenuorum filios adgregent sibique socient).5 5 Admonitio generalis, chap. 72; ed. Boretius, Mon. Germ. Hist., Leg. II, Cap. I, Hannover, 1883, 59-60. IV.2.2 NOVICES AND OBLATES An adult who sought admission (pulsans, i.e., one who knocks) was first put up in the guest house, after having knocked at the monastery door repeatedly and having been rejected repeatedly for four or five days. If he still insisted, he was admitted to the Novitiate. There he was initiated into the Rule by a supervising senior. After six months of intensive training, he was given an opportunity to depart. If, after a year had passed, he still decided to stay (being by this time fully aware of the severity of his prospective life) he was, upon written petition, formally received at the high altar. There he solemnly relinquished all his private property and was stripped of his worldly clothing, prostrated himself before the entire congregation, monk by monk, received his tonsure, and thereafter was "no longer free to leave the monastery, or to withdraw his neck from under the yoke of the Rule."5a 5a Benedicti regula, chap. 59; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 133-41; ed. McCann, 1952, 128-33; ed. Steidle, 1952, 275-97. On variations on the length of time of probation and the formula of admission, see Semmler, 1963, 44ff., and Herwegen, 1912, 57-67. The rank and order of the brothers within the monastery was established "according to the time of their entry," except for those "whom the abbot has by special decision promoted or for definite reasons degraded."6 6 Benedicti regula, chap. 63; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 145-48; ed. McCann, 1952, 142-45; ed. Steidle, 1952, 304-307. Children (oblati, i.e., those who are offered) were presented by their parents to the monastery for acceptance, by formal petition. If from rich families, the children had to entirely relinquish their right to inheritance, but the parents might deed this to the monastery.7 7 Benedicti regula, chap. 59; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 138-39; ed. McCann, 1952, 134-35; ed. Steidle, 1952, 298-99. This practice of deeding inheritance rights to the monastery, in time abused by greedy abbots,8 8 Extraordinary proficiency in attracting novices into the monastery in order to obtain their property was exhibited by Abbot Ratger of Fulda, to judge by the complaints of his own monks. Supplex Libellus, chap. 8; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 323. Cf. Semmler, 1963, 46. was criticized in 794, 811, and 813, and was finally revoked, in full departure from St. Benedict's Rule, during the synod of 816.9 9 Synodi primae decr. auth., chap. 33; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 466. Cf. Semmler, 1963, 44ff. The new ordinance may have had a frustrating effect upon the economic and monetary exploitation of the system of monastic oblation but it could hardly eradicate the deeper evils inherent in oblation itself, which bound men to celibacy and monastic isolation through paternal decree instead of their own choosing. Yet it cannot be denied that some of the greatest medieval minds emerged from this system, such men as the Venerable Bede XLIII. DE HIS QUI AD OPUS DEI UEL AD MENSAM TARDE OCCURUNT 1 Ad horam diuni officii mox auditus fuerit signus, relictis omnibus, quaelibet fuerint in manibus, summa cum festinabone curratur, 2 cum grauitate tamen, ut non scurilitas inueniat fomitem. 3 Ergo nihil operi dei praeponatur. 43 OF THOSE WHO COME LATE TO THE WORK OF GOD OR TO TABLE As soon as the signal for the Divine Office has been heard, let them abandon what they have in hand and assemble with the greatest speed, yet soberly, so that no occasion be given for levity. Let nothing, therefore, be put before the work of God. (672/73-735),10 10 In a short biographical note appended to his Ecclesiastical History Bede remarks about himself: "I was born in the territory of the said monastery [St. Peter and Paul at Wearmouth and Jarrow], and at the age of seven I was, by the care of my relations, given to the reverend Abbot Benedict (Biscop) and afterwards to Ceolfrid, to be educated. From that time I have spent the whole of my life within that monastery." Historia Ecclesiastica, Book V, chap. 24, ed. Charles Plummer, I, 1896, 357; and Bede's Ecclesiastical History, ed. and trans. Bertram Colgrave and R. A. B. Mynors, Oxford, 1969, 566-67. St. Willibrord, the "apostle of the Frisians" (c. 657-738)11 11 St. Willibrord was sent to be brought up at the monastery of Ripon as soon as he was weaned. See Lexikon für Theologie und Kirchengeschichte, X, 1965, col. 1166. The main source is Alcuin, Vita S. Willibrordi, Book I, chap. 3, in Migne, Patr. Lat., CI, Paris 1863, col. 696: "Et mulier peperit filium . . . et statim ablactatum infantulum tradidit eum pater Ripensis ecclesiae fratribus, religiosis studiis et sacris litteris erudiendium." and Hrabanus Maurus (c. 776-856).12 12 According to a biography written in 1515 by Abbot Trithem of Würzburg, Hrabanus Maurus was given to the monastery of Fulda by his parents at the age of nine. See Kunstmann, 1841, 15; Dümmler, 1888; and Hablitzel, 1906 (the latter work not available to me). Another outstanding Carolingian oblate was a man of major concern to this study, Bishop Haito of Basel, the presumptive maker of the Plan of St. Gall. He entered the monastery of Reichenau at the age of five, became a teacher in the school where he himself had been taught, rose to the rank of bishop in 803, became abbot in 806, and subsequently, one of the most illustrious councillors at the court of Charlemagne.13 13 For details on Bishop Haito's career and reference to sources, see Horn, in Studien, 1963, 107, note 20, and 110, note 32. Boys who were raised in the Novitiate were kept under strict discipline at all times by everyone, especially by their masters.14 14 Benedicti regula, chap. 63; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 146; ed. McCann, 1952, 142-43; ed. Steidle, 1952, 305. Hildemar, in his commentary on the Rule, prescribes that three or four supervising seniors be assigned to each group of ten young boys, and that these supervisors see to it that none of their young charges is ever left untended, not even in his most private moments; and under no circumstances is he ever to be alone with another boy.15 15 Hildemari Expositio, ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 333; cf. Hafner, in Studien, 1963, 183-83; and above, pp. 252ff. Priests and clerics formed a third category of eligible candidates. St. Benedict warns that permission for them to enter not be granted too readily, and only on condition that they are willing to observe the full discipline of the Rule.16 16 Benedicti regula, chap. 60: ed. Hanslik, 1960, 141-43; ed. McCann, 1952, 136-37; ed. Steidle, 1952, 299-300. The second synod of Aachen (817) reaffirmed this rule.17 17 Synodi secundae decr. auth., chap. 2; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 473: "Ut nullus plebeius aut clericus secularis in monasterio recipiatur ad habitandum nisi uoluerit fieri monachus." IV.2.3 DAILY ROUTINE The monks' daily life was divided to allow some four hours for common liturgical prayer and chant (opus dei), some four additional hours for meditative reading or private prayer (lectio divina), and another four to six hours for manual occupations (opus manuum).18 18 With regard to the monastic timetable, cf. Butler, 1919 (2nd ed., 1927), chap. 17; Berlière, 1927, 51-54; Knowles, 1950, 448-53; and an excellent summary in Steidle's commentary on the Rule of St. Benedict (ed. Steidle, 1952, 146-53). OPUS DEI The noblest of the liturgical occupations was the Work of God, "over which nothing must take precedence" (Ergo nihil operi Dei praeponatur).19 19 Benedicti regula, chap. 43; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 106-110; ed. McCann. 1952, 102-105; ed. Steidle, 1952, 241-43. This began at two o'clock in the morning, when, after seven hours' sleep, the brothers rose from their beds to celebrate what to St. Benedict was known as the Nocturne (to later monasticism as Matins). In the course of the day that followed they attended seven additional services: Lauds (called by St. Benedict Matutinas), held at the break of dawn; four shorter ones—Prime, Terce, Sext, and None20 20 In our system of counting, Prime would correspond to about 6:00 a.m., Terce to 9:00 a.m., Sext to noon, and None to 3:00 p.m. —held at the first, third, sixth, and ninth hours of the day; Vespers at sunset; and, on the advent of darkness a last one, Compline. Generally, these services began with an invitatory and a hymn, followed by three to six psalms or canticles, three to four readings from the Gospel, a responsory, and on Sundays and feast days, a mass. The central and longest phase of these services was the chanting of the psalms. St. Benedict devoted no less than nine chapters of his Rule to the order and manner in which they were to be sung throughout the year.21 21 Benedicti regula, chaps. 9-18; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 53-74; McCann, 1952, 50-67; Steidle, 1952, 153-78. He makes allowance for changes, provided "that the psalter with its full hundred and fifty psalms be chanted every week and begun afresh every Sunday at Matins."22 22 Benedicti regula, chap. 18; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 68-74; McCann, 1952, 66-67; Steidle, 1952, 175-78. He makes clear on which occasion the psalter should be sung "straight through" (in directum) and on which occasion "with antiphons" (cum antiphonis).23 23 Benedicti regula, chaps. 11, 12, 13, and 17; ed. Hanslik, 1960; McCann, 1952; Steidle, 1952. The structure of the Hebrew psalms renders it probable that the division of the religious congregation into choirs singing separate parts in alternation may have originated in the ancient Jewish Church. In the Eastern Church antiphonal song was introduced by Ignatius Bishop of Antioch (d. 115). In the West it was not practiced prior to St. Ambrose (d. 379). Firmly established in the ecclesiastical liturgy by Pope Gregory the Great (d. 604), by the ninth century antiphonal singing had developed into an elaborate sequence of responses which soloists sang in alternation with various other groups of singers under the guidance of a conductor. The performance of this art was held in such high esteem that on the days of the great feasts, visiting bishops did not hesitate to join the rows of chanting monks to sing under the direction of their former teachers.24 24 For details and sources, see Husmann, 1954, a reference which I owe to my colleague, Richard L. Crocker. The supervision of this important phase of the divine service was sometimes the office of the cantor, at other times that of the master of the library and scriptorium (armarius).25 25 See the sources quoted in Du Cange, Glossarium, under "cantor" and "armarius," and the remarks on these two offices in Knowles, 1951, 80-81. In his commentary on chapter 8 of the Rule of St. Benedict, Hildemar lists those who perform specific functions in the chanting of the psalms: the cantor, the praecentor, the succentor, and the concentor. The cantor is a soloist "who modulates his voice" (vocem modelatur in cantu), the praecentor "opens the song" (vocem praemittit in cantu), the succentor "responds" (subsequenter canendo respondet), and the concentor is the one who "harmonizes" (consonat).26 26 Expositio Hildemari; ed. Mittelmüller, 1880, 275. The very existence of these names is evidence of the extent to which the various phases of the antiphonal chant had around 845 already been delegated to specialists. LECTIO DIVINA The Rule allows for a long period of meditative reading and prayer, that is, for the furthering of the spiritual well-being of the individual rather than for the promotion of his intellectual powers. It involved the reading of the scriptures, early monastic literature, and the writings of the Church Fathers. Monks with superior intellectual capacities could devote this time to the copying of manuscripts and to their own creative writing. Chapter 48 of the Rule states that "one or two senior monks should be deputed to go round the monastery at the times when the brethren are occupied in reading, to see that there be no slothful brother who spends his time in idleness or gossip and neglects the reading."27 27 Benedicti regula, chap. 48; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 114-19; ed. McCann, 1952, 110-13; ed. Steidle, 1952, 246-51. The same chapter recommends that some kind of manual labor be given to those who cannot read. When Abbot Ratger of Fulda, in the heat of an ambitious building program that fatigued the monks beyond endurance, shortened the time for the lectio divina, the brothers made this the subject of a complaint to Emperor Charlemagne.28 28 Supplex Libellus, chap. 12; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 324. "Fratribus quoque secundum regulam certis horis vacare lectioni liceat et item certis operari." Initially rejected, eventually they secured the dismissal of their abbot.29 29 Semmler, 1958, 296. XIX.

OPUS MANUUM Chapters 4130 30 Benedicti regula, chap. 41; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 102-104; ed. McCann, 1952, 98-99; ed. Steidle, 1952, 238-39. and 4831 31 Benedicti regula, chap. 48; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 114-19; ed. McCann, 1952, 110-13; ed. Steidle, 1952, 246-51. of the Rule speak clearly of monks working in the fields. But the fact that the first synod of Aachen found it necessary to admonish the brothers not to murmur, "if the necessity arises to help in gathering the harvest or in other chores of this kind,"32 32 Synodi primae decr. auth., chap. 16; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 461: "Ut si necessitas fuerit eos occupari in fruges colligendi aut alia opera non murmurent." implies that to many, labor in the fields had become a task quite out of the ordinary. The brothers' opus manuum, in fact was not primarily work of this nature. Most of the regular and heavy agricultural work was performed by serfs or coloni, and the monks' manual labor was generally restricted to tasks that could be performed within the cloisters or the buildings directly connected with them: cooking, baking, serving meals, sweeping the claustral buildings, and washing and mending clothes. Those skilled in the arts and crafts could spend the time allotted for manual labor in the nobler pursuits of carving ivories, painting frescoes, illuminating books, or making sacred vessels and ornaments. It is likely that in addition to his regular chores, every healthy monk, for part of his lifetime at least, participated in the work of building and repairing the buildings in which he worshiped and lived. At Fulda the number of hours allocated to construction was so exorbitant that, as just mentioned, the monks turned to the Emperor for redress. They complained that the time given to building interfered with their ancient rights to work "in the bakehouse, the garden, the brewhouse, the kitchen, and the fields."33 33 Supplex libellus, chap. 16; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 325: "Ut ipsa monasterii ministeria per fratres ordinentur: id est pistrinum, hortus, bratiarium, coquina, agricultura et cereta ministeria, sicut apud decessores nostros fuerunt . . ." The synod of 816 reaffirmed these rights, and prescribed in addition that the monks wash their own clothes.34 34 Synodi primae decr. auth., ch. 4; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 458: "Ut in quoquina, in pistrino et in ceteris artium officinis propriis operentur manibus et uestimenta sua lauent oportuno tempore." END PART IV.2 IV. 3 LAYMEN IV.3.1 THE MONASTERY'S INDUSTRIAL &amp; AGRICULTURAL FORCE OF LABOR The bulk of the labor for the monastery's industrial and agricultural domain was done by laymen. The Plan of St. Gall refers to these people as famuli,1 1 Gardener's House, Mill, Mortar, Drying Kiln, House of Wheelwrights and Coopers, see II, 199, 236ff, and 248. famulantes,2 2 Abbot's House, see above, pp. 321ff. servitores,3 3 Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers, see II, 144ff. custodes,4 4 House for the Fowlkeeper, see II, 264ff. custodientes,5 5 House for the Emperor's Following, see II, 166ff. and uernae;6 6 Monks' Bake and Brewhouse, see II, 253ff. or by the craft they performed, as shoemakers (sutores), saddlers (sellarii), trenchermakers and furbishers (emundatores uel politores gladiorum) shieldmakers (scutarii), turners (tornatores), tanners (coriarii), goldsmiths (aurifices), blacksmiths (fabri ferramentorum), fullers (fullones),7 7 Great Collective Workshop, see II, 189ff. coopers (tunnariores) and wheelwrights (ternarii),8 8 House for Wheelwrights and Coopers, see II, 199ff. or named by livestock for which they cared, as ostlers (equos seruantes, custodes equaritiae), oxherds (bubulci),9 9 Stable for Horses and Oxen, see II, 271ff. cowherds (armentarii), swineherds (porcarii), shepherds (opilji), goatherds (pastores),10 10 Houses for livestock, see II, 287ff. and fowlkeepers (pullorum custodes, aucarum custodes).11 11 House for the Fowlkeepers, see II, 264ff. The collective name for this monastic family of laymen was familia. Those who lived within the monastery were called familia intus; those who lived on the outlying estates familia foris.12 12 See Berlière's study on the monastic family (Berlière, 1931). FAMILIA INTUS Depending on the terms of their registration, the "inner" monastic family was divided into "prebendaries" (praebendarii or prouendarii) and "odd-jobbers" (matricularii). The term "prebendary" was in its narrow sense applied to adult oblates who received their daily sustenance from the monastery in return for the performance of a craft or service. In the broader sense the term was applied to anyone sustained for life by the community, including priests, clerics, and other pensioners. Some of the prebendaries relinquished all personal property upon entering the monastery; others renounced ownership but retained the income; still others kept both income and ownership.13 13 Ibid., 7 and 42ff. The prebendaries of the inner family were always unmarried. The odd-jobbers were selected from among the poor entered on the matricula or "poor list" of the monastery.14 14 Ibid., 8-9. The 150 prebendaries listed by Abbot Adalhard include twelve referred to by the term matricularii.15 15 Consuetudines Corbeienses, I, 2; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 367; and translation by Jones, III, Appendix II, 103. They appear to have been entrusted with such duties as ringing bells and general housekeeping in the guest-houses.16 16 Berlière, 1931, 8. FAMILIA FORIS The position of the seculars who formed the monastery's "outer family" was preferable in many respects to those of the domestics who lived within the monastic enceinte, since they could marry, raise children, and work the land assigned to them with the help of their entire family, in exchange for the payment of a tribute (tributum) or the rendering of a service (servitium). Depending on the degree of servitude or freedom they enjoyed, they were classified as liberi, coloni, lides, and servi. The homo liber, "free man," had the right to go wherever he wanted, and was not claimed by any master. The colonus enjoyed freedom as a person, but was inseparable from the land he cultivated. The lidus was dependent both on the lord and the land, and thus held a position midway between the colonus and the servus. The serf had no freedom whatsoever and could be sold, given away, or traded with the land on which he lived.17 17 For masterful definitions of the social and legal status of these classes of men, and their manorial duties, see Guérard, I, 1844, 212ff (liber), 225ff (colonus), 250ff (lidus), 227ff (servus). From these seculars who lived in villages (villae) under the supervision of a mayor (maior or villicus) or rural junior deans (decani iuniores),18 18 On the duties of the mayor, see ibid., 442ff; and Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 237ff. the monastery recruited its rural personnel of foremen and artisans, the keepers of the rural food stores (cellerarii, not to be confused with the monastic official of this name), the foresters (forestarii), the keepers of the livestock (pastores) and their master (magister gregum), the millers (mulinarii), as well as an indefinite number of craftsmen.19 19 On the rural deans and cellarers, see Guérard, op. cit., 456 and 465; on the foresters and millers, ibid., 467 and 468ff; on the keepers of the herds, Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 237. A more fundamental view of the operation of these villages, their population and the services they rendered to the monastery, can be gleaned from the Administrative Directives of Abbot Adalahard of Corbie20 20 Consuetudines Corbeienses, VI, 2ff; ed. Semmler in Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 389ff; and Jones, III, Appendix II, 112. and the Constitution of Abbot Ansegis of St. Wandrille.21 21 Constitutio Ansigisi abbatis, in Gesta SS. Patrum. Fontanellensis Coenobii, ed. Lohier and Laporte, 1936, 117-23; and translation by Charles W. Jones, III, 103ff. The Plan of St. Gall does not reflect much of the life of this outer family, except for the presence within the monastic enclosure of buildings that serve as storage spaces for the harvest and for the staples produced by the labor of these people (Granary, Cellar, and Larder) and the presence of a house in which the men were put up who brought this produce from places too distant to return to within the same day (House for Servants of Outlying Estates).22 22 See II, 165. END PART IV.3 IV. 4 NUMBER OF MONKS AND SERFS IV.4.1 MONKS (RELIGIOSI) The first cenobitic monastery, founded around 320 by St. Pachomius in Tabennisi near Dendera in the Upper Nile Valley, had at one point in its history between 1,200 and 1,600 monks.1 1 Boon, 1932, 5 and 17, chap. 15. In the preface to his translation of the Rule of St. Pachomius, St. Jerome says that there were thirty to forty houses in one monastery and that each house had an occupancy of "plus or minus forty" monks. Benedictine monasticism reduced these figures to more manageable proportions. Although the Abbey of Jumièges, in the seventh century is said to have had as many as 900 monks,2 2 Berlière, 1929, 248. Charles W. Jones brings to my attention that the Northumbrian Abbey of Wearmouth and Jarrow, according to Bede, had 600 brothers in two cloisters about five miles apart. See Venerabilis Bedae Opera Historica, I, chap. 18, ed. Plummer, I, 1896, 382-83. the largest Carolingian monasteries north of the Alps rarely exceeded a count of 300 monks. The average number of monks of a transalpine monastery in the ninth century appears to have ranged between 100 and 150. The following is a list of the approximate number of monks in certain Carolingian monasteries, based primarily on the studies of Dom Ursmer Berlière.3 3 Berlière, 1929, 231-61, and 1930, 19-42. Allowance must be made for the fact that Berlière's studies do not extend to the whole of the Frankish empire. They might, nevertheless, provide a workable average. I am not repeating here the reference to original sources, which will be found in Berlière's study. The monastery on the Plan of St. Gall can house approximately 110 monks. I arrive at this figure through a count of the beds that are actually shown on the Plan, adding to this the number that might be installed in the bedrooms of houses where they have not been designated. The Dormitory of the Monks is equipped with seventy-seven beds,4 4 On the Dormitory, see above, pp. 249ff. the dormitory in the Abbot's House with eight.5 5 On the Abbot's House, see above, pp. 321ff. There are five beds in the Porter's Lodging,6 6 On the Porter's Lodging, see II, 153ff. two in the lodging of the master of the Outer School.7 7 On the Outer School, see II, 144ff. To this must be added an estimated minimum of twelve beds in the dormitory of the Novitiate8 8 On the Novitiate, see above, pp. 311ff. and an estimated three beds in the apartment of the master of the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers. It is not quite clear from the Plan where the chamberlain slept.9 9 On the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers, see II, 144ff. If the gardener was a monk (as he appears to have been),10 10 On the Gardener's House, see II, 203ff. he would probably also have had with him one or two assistants. There were at least two physicians, who may also have been monks.11 11 On the Physician's House, see II, 178ff. This brings the total of the religiosi to the estimated 110 monks. Because of the paradigmatic character of the Plan, these figures must be looked upon as a reflection of what the assembled bishops and abbots, in 816 and 817 at the time of Louis the Pious, considered to be the ideal number of monks in a monastery. There is no doubt in my mind that the architect who developed the scheme of the Plan based his work upon a clearly formulated population plan, as I have demonstrated earlier,12 12 For the detailed reckoning, see above, pp. 113-14. and that he implemented this plan as he established the dimensions of the individual buildings. IV.4.2 WORKMEN, SERFS, AND SERVANTS (FAMILIA) Judging from the number of bunks that could have been installed in the bedrooms of the workhouses, stables, mill, and mortar, etc., the total number of workmen, serfs, and servants must have ranged between 130 and 150. The estimate runs as follows: gardener's crew, 6; fowlkeepers and their crew, 6. Workmen and artisans: 4 shoemakers, 4 saddlers, 3 trenchermakers, 3 shieldmakers, 4 turners, 4 curriers, 2 goldsmiths, 2 blacksmiths, 2 fullers, 5 coopers, 5 wheelwrights. Servants: in the abbot's kitchen and bathhouse, 6; in the Bake and Brew House of the Monks, 8; in the Mill, 4; in the Mortarhouse, 4; in the Drying Kiln, 4; horsegrooms, 8; oxmen, 8; for pilgrims and paupers, 6; in charge of the House for the Emperor's Following, 8; keepers of livestock: cowherds, 6; keepers of the mares and colts, 6; swineherds, 6, goatherds, 6; shepherds, 6. This is a purely mechanical count based on the number of beds that could be installed while still maintaining comfortable sleeping arrangements. The number could be increased considerably if beds were crowded into sleeping areas. Except for the Abbey of Corbie, we do not have much specific information about other Carolingian monasteries with which to compare these figures. At Corbie, under TABLE II LIST OF THE APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF MONKS IN CERTAIN CAROLINGIAN MONASTERIES MONASTERY TIME NUMBER OF MONKS note St.-Riquier Angilbert (833) 400[a] [a] Three hundred monks and 100 boys; Berlière, 1929, 243. St.-Wandrille Seventh century 300[b] [b] Berlière, 1929, 249. By 854 the population of St. Wandrille had shrunk to 70, but provisions were made for future increase, if resources permitted. Fulda Ninth century 270[c] [c] Berlière, 1930, 22. In 920 the population had shrunk to 180. St.-Germain-des-pres Toward 815 212 In 829 120 841-847 122[d] [d] Berlière, 1929, 244. The figure 212 listed for A.D. 815 appears to include monks living on outlying cells (cf. A. Lognon, Polyptique d'Irminon, Paris, 1895, I, 187), while the two others refer to the number of monks in the monastery itself. Corbie Adalhard (822-826) circa 150-200[e] [e] In chapter 3 of the Consuetudines Corbeienses (ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 375-76; and Jones, III, 106) Abbot Adalhard informs us that the total of men to be provided with their daily ration of bread, in the monastery of Corbie, varies between 350 and 400 ("at present not more than 350, . . . sometimes 400, rarely more, usually fewer"). From chapter 1 of the same source (ed. Semmler, op. cit., 365ff, and Jones, III, 103) we can infer that these figures included 150 prebends, 19 clerks, 12 almsmen and 30 laymen. If we subtract these from the total number of mouths to be fed within the monastic enclosure, this would leave 146 regular monks in normal times when the total was 350, and 196 in the more unusual days, when the total reached as many as 400.

By the middle of the century, the population had risen to 44 monks besides the abbot. Kornelismünster is a special case, as it was founded as a model monastery by the leader of the monastic reform movement, Benedict of Aniane, who probably fully intended to restrain its size. LVII. DE ARTIFICIBUS MONASTERII 1 Artifices sí sunt in monasterio, cum omni humilitate faciant ipsas artes, si permiserit abbas. 2 Quod si aliquis ex eís extollitur pro scientia artis suae, eo quod uideatur aliquid conferre monasterio, 3 hic talis erigatur ab ipsa arte et denuo per eam non transeat, nisi forte humiliato ei iterum abbas iubeat. 52 THE CRAFTSMEN OF THE MONASTERY If there be craftsmen in the monastery, let them practise their crafts with all humility, provided the abbot give permission. But if one of them be puffed up because of his skill in his craft, supposing that he is conferring a benefit on the monastery, let him be removed from his work and not return to it, unless he have humbled himself and the abbot entrust it to him again. Adalhard, the prebendaries numbered 150 "within" and forty "without" the monastic enclosure. Adalhard gave instructions that "whenever one died, he should be immediately replaced by another, so that the number be always complete. And no one should ever be added to enlarge this number."13 13 Consuetudines Corbeienses, I, 1; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 365; and Jones's translation, III, Appendix II, 103ff. This group included in the first workshop (ad primam camaram): three shoemakers (sutores tres), two saddlemakers ([ad] caualos duo), and one fuller (fullo unus); in the second workshop (ad secundam cameram): one storekeeper (ad camaram unus), six blacksmiths (fabri grossarii sex), two goldsmiths (aurifices duo), two shoemakers (sutores duo), two shieldmakers (scutarii duo), one parchment-maker (pargaminarius unus), one polisher (saminator unus), and three foundrymen (fusarii tres). Two servants from the third workshop were attached to the cellar and storehouse of the porter (ad cellarium et dispensam portarii duo); one to the infirmary (ad domum infirmorum unus). There were two helpers (gararii duo), one in the woodshed of the bakehouse (ad lignarium in pistrino unus), the other at the center gate (ad portam medianam). Lastly, there were four carpenters (carpentarii quattuor), four masons (mationes quattuor), and two physicians (medici duo). Two servants were attached to the house of the vassals (ad casam uasallorum duo).14 14 Consuetudines Corbeienses, I, 2; ed. cit., 367; translated, III, 103. We do not have enough information to draw any concrete conclusions about the average ratio of monks to secular domestics in Carolingian times, and there were probably vast fluctuations, since there must have been some relation between the number of serfs who worked within the monastic enceinte and the number of serfs and workmen stationed outside it, yet still within the immediate vicinity of the monastery. If the calculations of von Arx are correct, the Monastery of St. Gall, in 895, when it had 100 monks, employed some 200 secular domestics,15 15 Arx, 1810, 127; see Bikel, 1914, 9. At the time of Abbot Notker (971-977), their number had shrunk to 170; see Ekkeharti (IV.) Casus sancti Galli, chap. 136, ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 433, ed. Helbling, 1958, 227. and the Abbey of St. -Bertin at St.-Omer, toward the middle of the ninth century, when it numbered eighty-three monks had ninety-five domestics.16 16 Berlière, 1931, 42. If the Plan of St. Gall represents the typical, as its paradigmatic nature suggests, the average Carolingian monastery at the time of Louis the Pious must have had a lay population of domestic serfs and workmen exceeding that of the number of monks by some 15 to 30 percent. According to calculations found in many sources, the number of people in the "outer family" was considerably higher than the number of domestics. An inventory of 831 of the Abbey of St.-Riquier lists no less than 2,500 men, including 110 mounted knights,17 17 "Inventaire des Cens et Redevances," in Hariulf, ed. Lot, 1894, 306-8. on the land immediately LXVI. DE HOSTIARIIS MONASTERII 1 Ad portam monasterii ponatur senes sapiens, qui sciat accipere responsum et reddere et cuius maturitas eum non sinat uacari. 2 Qui portarius cellam debebit habere iuxta portam, ut uenientes semper praesentem inueniant, a quo responsum accipiant. 66 THE PORTERS OF THE MONASTERY At the gate of the monastery let there be placed a wise old man, who understands how to give and receive a message, and whose years will keep him from leaving his post. This porter should have a room near the gate, so that those who come may always find someone to answer them. around it. The number of all persons living on the lands of the Abbey of St.-Germain-des-Prés has been calculated by Guérard to have amounted at the time of Abbot Irminon (ca. 800-826) to about 13,300.18 18 Polyptique d'Irminon, ed. Guérard, 1844, I, 358-60. If we add to this the approximately 160 serfs and laymen who worked in the monastery itself and divide the total of 13,460 thus obtained, by the 120 monks of the monastery, we find that, as far as the Abbey of St. Germain-des-Prés is concerned, to sustain one single monk involved the support of 112 laymen.19 19 Ibid. The figure 13,300 of St. Germain-des-Prés does not include those persons who lived on land that the monastery had granted in benefice (in beneficium). If the latter were included the general population of the Abbey of St. Germain-des-Prés, as Guérard estimates, would have been around 40,000.20 20 Ibid. The abbeys of St.-Wandrille and St. Denis appear to have had populations of similar magnitude.21 21 Ibid. NOTE ON THE HATTON 48 INSCRIPTION ILLUSTRATIONS Inscriptions are shown same size as the originals and are based on Bodleian Library, Oxford, photographs, centimeter-inch scale shown, and on Farmer, Early English Manuscripts in Facsimile, vol. 15, Rosenkilde and Bagger, Copenhagen, 1968. The original script was written in black ink on parchment. A splendid capital marks the start of each chapter, drawn in black outline with vermilion infill that gives pleasing brightness to the work. Black outline capitals are surrounded with a line of red dots, a characteristic feature of Insular manuscript ornamentation. The excerpts used in the preceding pages do not occur, in all cases, in the exact sequence as reproduced. A dotted line printed in black shows where the text of the manuscript is interrupted by breaks, such as occur in moving from one column or one page to the next. Folio identification is included with each excerpt. The adaptation or translation from tonal-range copy to line copy with tone absent was resolved by making photographic enlargements precisely 4 times original size. Extraneous background blemishes or other stains and `show-through' were easily eliminated at this scale (letters ca. 15mm high, lines ca. 5.5cm apart). Thus, corrective measures were subtractive (removal of unwanted stains) rather than additive (as they would have been by redrawing or tracing from the original). Exceptions are the red dots, where in many cases the original vermilion dots had long ago faded and were barely legible around the black outlines of the capitals. Many of these red dots were supplied here by hand to correctly portray a continuous sequence of dot ornamentation as originally executed. Then, by photographic reduction back to the original size (with precision equal to the procedure of enlargement), together with careful darkroom and laboratory control with high-contrast processing (by Irwin Welcher, General Graphics, San Francisco), images were obtained of clear and precise definition of outline, devoid of tonal background, and without supervening interpretation of additive subjective character. Consequently the elegance of the letter forms of the script is reproduced with a high degree of fidelity to the original and with authenticity of impression. E. B. 261. UTRECHT PSALTER (CA. 830). PSALM XIII (14), DETAIL UTRECHT UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, CODEX 32, fol. 7v [courtesy of Utrecht University Library] The singing of psalms, as many as three to six during one service, was one of the central and longest phases in a monk's daily worship. In the adoption and reshaping of the old Gregorian chant, in which psalms were sung from the days of Gregory the Great, and in its transformation into the medieval sequence by Frankish monks in the 8th and 9th centuries, Carolingian monasticism made one of its greatest and most innovative contributions to the birth of Western music (see Crocker, 1975). Richly illuminated psalters existed in the Roman world as early as the 4th and 5th centuries. The Utrecht Psalter, made in the abbey of Hautvilliers near Reims, is the finest Carolingian copy of this kind of Early Christian psalter. In its rendering of landscapes, architecture, people and animals it is full of classical reminiscences, but combines the sketchy illusionism of Late Antiquity with a nervous and lively linear expressionism that appears to be more typically medieval. This illustration to Psalm XIII shows men doing evil to one another as described in verses 2-4 (for more information see Dewald, 1932, 9). END PART IV. 4 IV. 5 THE MONASTERY'S MILITARY OBLIGATIONS IV.5.1 MEN &amp; HORSES FOR BATTLE &amp; OTHER SUPPORTIVE SERVICES Like all the other landed corporations of the empire, the estates of the monks were bound to render their share in the defense of the country (ad hostem). The men of the church were forbidden to render military service in person,1 1 In capitularies issued by Carloman in 742, Pepin in 744, and Charlemagne in 802.

Thus the Abbey of St.-Germain-des-Prés at the time of Abbot Irminon placed at the emperor's disposal not only men whom it held in tenure, but also furnished the army with carts, oxen, beef, mutton, pork, and wine.3 3 Polytique d'Irminon; ed. Guérard, 1844, 661. In an order issued to him by Charlemagne between 804 and 811, Fulrad, the Abbot of St.-Quentin, was directed to join the army at its assembly place at Stassfurt, in Saxony, on June 17, with his men fully equipped and armed. The men were to be fitted out in such a way as to be able to proceed to whatever point in the country the emperor wished to dispatch them. The order itemized the type of weapons each man was to carry and the tools with which each wagon was to be stocked: straight axes, broadaxes, augers, hatchets, hoes, shovels. The troop was to be provisioned with rations for a period of three months, and with arms and clothing for a period of six.4 4 Karoli ad Fulradum epistola (804-811); ed. Boretius, op. cit., 168. Some of these services were exacted only in times of war; others were rendered in the form of periodic "gifts" or "donations" (dona or munera) which had acquired an obligatory character.5 5 Brunner, II, 1892, 69, note 11; and Ganshof, 1958, 80. The annual "gift" required of each abbey at the time of Louis the German consisted of two horses, two shields, and two lances.6 6 "Statuimus etiam, ut annuatim inde dona nostre serenitati veniant, sicut de ceteris monasteriis, id est caballi duo cum scutis et lanceis." (Deed of Louis the German, dated Ulm, July 22, 854. See Wartmann, I, 1863, 52-54.) In addition to the men the monasteries had to furnish for the service of the king, they maintained others for the protection of their own land, and it is on permanent resources of this kind that the king may have drawn in times of war. The Chronicle of Hariulf furnishes us with the names of 100 armed men whom the Abbey of St.-Riquier maintained on its various manors.7 7 Hariulf, Chronique de l'abbaye de St.-Riquier, ed. Lot, 1894, 96-97. An inventory of 831 lists the total number of men then in the service of the Abbey as 110 and informs us that "each man always has ready for inspection a horse, a shield, a sword, a lance, and other armaments."8 8 Vicus militum CX: unusquisque semper equum, scutum, gladium, lanceam, ceteraque arma exhibet. "Inventaire des Cens et Redevances dus a l'Abbaye de Saint-Riquier," Hariulf, ibid., 308. Hariulf defines their duties very clearly: "They served the abbot and the other officials of the church on land and sea or wherever else the brothers needed their concourse . . . accompanied the abbot and the priors on their journeys . . . They always gathered dutifully at the monastery on the days of the feast of St. Richarius, Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost, as thoroughly equipped as each could and by his presence lending to our church almost the appearance of a royal court."9 9 "Quique cum sibi subditis militibus nostro abbati et ministris ecclesiae nobiliter satis serviebant terra marique, vel ubicunque eorum comitatu quilibet e sancti loci fratribus indiguisset. . . . quos ubique abbas, vel praepositi, secum ducebant, quique consuetudinaliter in die festi sancti Richarii, et in Nativitate Domini, vel in Resurrectione, seu in Pentecoste, semper monasterio aderant, accurate prout quisque poterat, ornati, et ex sua frequentia regalem pene curiam nostram ecclesiam facientes" (Ibid., 96-97). But Hariulf's reliability has been questioned (Evergates, "Historiography and Sociology in Early Feudal Society: The Case of Hariulf and the ?Milites? of St.-Riquier, Viator, VI, 1975, 35-49). It is the maintenance of a military retinue of this kind which explains the presence in the House for Workmen, on the Plan of St. Gall of "shieldmakers" (scutarii) and "grinders and polishers of swords" (emundatores et politores gladiorum).10 10 See II, 189ff. In addition to their direct share in the military defense of the country, the annual presentations to the king (servitium regis)—and especially those made by the royal abbeys— might include a considerable amount of eatable livestock and other agricultural products. Thus the servitium regis of the Abbey of Werden around 1050 amounted to 8 cows, 83 pigs of various size, 8 peacocks, 195 chickens, more than 95 cheeses, 870 eggs, 47½ malters of bread, 95 sheffels of oat, 172 pitchers of beer, 485 bowls, and 147 beakers.11 11 Heusinger, 1923, 37. The volume of services that the monastery rendered to the state in time of war of course exceeded by many times the revenues it was required to furnish in time of peace. Admittedly this imposition of military obligations upon the abbey, as Dom Ursmer Berlière has pointed out, "is in formal opposition to the constitutive principle of the Benedictine order," and, further, it is understandable that this "intrusion of the world into the cloister" should become one of the primary targets of the reformists in the centuries that followed.12 12 Berlière, 1931, 26. At the time of Charlemagne and Louis the Pious, the interdependence of church and state was not yet questioned. In their search for peace and Christian unity and their common concern to see the will of God embodied on each, the administration of church and state worked hand in hand.13 13 See Ganshof's lucid remarks on this subject (1955, 510), and the brilliant analysis of these relationships in Prinz, 1971. 262. UTRECHT PSALTER (CA. 830). PSALM LXXXIV (85), DETAIL UTRECHT UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, CODEX 32, fol. 49v [courtesy of Utrecht University Library] The detail here shown forms the lowest register of the illustration. It explicates with various scenes from agriculture and animal husbandry the phrase "and our land shall yield her increase" (verses 12-13) in the rich and imaginative pictographic style characteristic of the Early Christian prototype of this psalter. To the left, a man tills the soil with the primitive Roman plow (not as efficient as the medieval plow). At the right, two men cut sheaves of grain by hand with sickles, as was done in Roman and medieval times. Below them, oxen and sheep graze along the banks of a stream that issues from springs to the left of the picture. (For more details and a reproduction of the entire illustration see Dewald, 1932, 38-39.) IV. 6 THE MONASTERY AS A MANORIAL CORPORATION IV.6.1 OUTLYING ESTATES The agricultural and industrial economy of a Carolingian monastery was based not only on the produce of the land that lay in the immediate vicinity and the labor of the monks and serfs who resided within the monastic enclosure, but also on the revenues and manufactured goods of a vast web of outlying estates, the monastery's curtes or villae. Recent investigations have made it clear that these outlying estates consisted in part of holdings that formed a reserve exploited directly for the benefit of the abbey, and in part of tenures granted to tenants against the payment of tithes1 1 Tithes, decimus, i.e., the tenth of the yield of a respective holding. On the development of the institution of tithing, see Ganshof, 1958, 135ff. or against the rendering of certain labors or services needed in the exploitation of the reserve.2 2 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 236. This arrangement is very similar, as François Ganshof has pointed out, to the tripartite division of the fiscal property of a royal domain prescribed by the famous Capitulare de villis, which earmarks one-third of the produce of the domain for use by the manor itself, one-third for use by the court, and another third for use according to instructions from the palace, or for sale.3 3 Ganshof, 1958, 115-16; and Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 247. For a more general study of the rural economy and life in the medieval western world, see Duby, 1962 and Duby, 1968. RESPONSIBLE MONASTIC OFFICIALS The Administrative Directives of Adalhard of Corbie make it clear that the exploitation of these outlying estates for the monastic community lay in the hands of the prior, the chamberlain, and the porter. The prior had the responsibility of supplying the monastery with its basic food provisions, and for that reason had under his authority specifically the cultivation of the fields and vineyards as well as the supervision of the herdsmen.4 4 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 114; and above, p. 332. The chamberlain was in charge of the monastery's material equipment, including as one of its indispensable items the monks' clothing.5 5 Ibid. Also above, p. 335; Jones, III, Appendix II, 105. For the fulfillment of their respective duties, each of these officials had assigned to him the yield of a specific number of services or manors, while the porter was charged with the collection of tithes in those tenures which were subject to tithing. This included the chore of transportation and storage, as well as the conversion of the tithes into money when the produce was sold.6 6 Verhulst and Semmler, 1962, 110; and above, p. 335. The collection of revenues from outlying, and especially from distant, manors posed problems of logistics in transportation capable of taxing the wit of even the most astute abbots. Abbot Adalhard of Corbie invented a unique plan for reducing the costs of such deliveries by instituting a barter system through which the produce from distant lands was made available to the monastery by being traded in stages from the periphery toward the center of its economic orbit.7 7 Consuetudines Corbeienses, VI, 1; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 391ff; and Jones, III, Appendix II, 113. MANAGEMENT BY MONKS OR BY LAYMEN? Whether the monastery's outlying estates should be administered by monks or by laymen was a matter of debate and widely varying practice. In 812 the monks of Fulda protested before the emperor against the increasing administrative fragmentation of the holdings of their abbey, declaring themselves in favor of a single and common manorial entity (commune ministerium)—managed by the monastery as a whole through its leading representatives, the deans and the prior8 8 "Quod commune ministerium a decanis et praeposito omnibus fratribus fiat, quia hae divisiones quae modo factae sunt occasiones sunt scandalorum, dissensionum et contradictionum." (Supplex Libellus, chap. 11; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 324. See Semmler, 1958, 284.) —as preferable to watching their holdings being surrendered to the "selfish interest of laymen" or to "malicious serfs."9 9 ". . . quia devotius et dignius per fratres omne exercebitur officium quam per laicum aut servum malevolum." (Supplex Libellus, chap. 16; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 325.) But at the synod of Aachen held in 816, the assembled bishops and abbots of the empire ruled that the outlying estates should henceforward be managed by laymen exclusively. The monks who had been entrusted with their supervision were ordered to return to the mother house, and the abbots were admonished to reduce the number of their visits to the outlying manors to the absolute minimum.10 10 Synodi primae aquisgranensis actap raeliminaria, chap. 14; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 434; Statuta Murbacensia, chap. 10; ed. Semmler, op. cit., 445. The capitulary of Louis the Pious which promulgated these resolutions consolidated them into imperial laws.11 11 Synodi primae decr. auth., chap. 23; ed. Semmler, op. cit., 464; "Ut uillas frequenter et nisi necessitas coegerit non circumeant neque suis illas monachis custodiendas committant. Et si eos ire ad eas necessitas fuerit expleto necessitatis negotio ad sua mox monasteria redeant." SIZE We are well informed about the size, nature, and location of these outlying estates by such contemporaneous sources as the Administrative Directives of Abbot Adalhard of Corbie,12 12 Consuetudines Corbeienses; ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I 1963, 355-422, and translation by Jones, III, Appendix II, 103ff. or the famous Polyptique of Abbot Irminon of St.-Germain-des-Prés,13 13 Polyptique d'Irminon, ed. Guérard, 1844; and ed. Longnon, 1886-95. which furnishes us in many cases not only with a full account of their annual yield in harvest, equipment, and livestock, but also with the names of many of their tenants and serfs as well as the deliveries of food and produce to which they were held. In size these holdings varied greatly. Some were small, the majority large, a few colossal. At the time of Abbot Irminon (ca. 800-826), as we have already had occasion to mention,14 14 See above, p. 345. the total number of men who lived on the monastery's outlying possessions was calculated by B. E. C. Guérard (who spent the better part of his life studying the extent and the form of management of its holdings) as amounting to nearly 40,000. As a manorial entity the Carolingian monastery thus differed little from the fabric of a feudal estate, save that the corporate community of men for whose sustenance this organization was maintained consisted of monks who served God in chant and spent much of their time in reading and writing. Of the vast fabric of agricultural and industrial activities which enabled them to devote their lives to these tasks, the Plan of St. Gall reflects only a small fraction: that portion which was carried on within the walls of the monastery itself. An analysis of these activities, the houses, machinery, and equipment with which they are associated will form the subject of the second volume. 263. UTRECHT PSALTER (CA. 830). PSALM LXXVII (78), DETAIL UTRECHT UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, CODEX 32, fol. 45r [courtesy of Utrecht University Library] Inspired by the hand of God issuing from heaven a patriarch from Israel (perhaps Moses), having risen from a large chair to stand upon a rock, announces from a lectern the law of the Lord (verse I) to a host of people who are gathered around him in huge semicircle (only partly visible in this detail): "the people", "fathers", "children" and "generations to come" referred to in verses 1-8. Three attentive representatives of the people stand directly before the patriarch. Behind the latter is David, youthful and crowned and carrying a spear in his left hand; in front of David a few of his sheep (verse 70); behind him the unicorn mentioned in verse 69 (ET AEDIFICAVIT SICUT UNICORNIUM SUUM). For more detail see Dewald, 1932, 35-36. To render the principal figures at a larger scale than secondary persons is a stylistic convention frequently employed in Early Christian art, and used even in Greco-Roman art, to distinguish higher from lesser gods. The Utrecht Psalter manuscript is comprised of 108 leaves 33.5 × 26cm. The pen drawings made on parchment, probably in black ink, are now faded to a kind of bistre. The details shown in figures 261, 262, 263, only crudely simulate the color and tone of the present state of the manuscript. Each drawing is somewhat enlarged here. IV. 7 THE MONASTERY AS A CULTURAL INSTITUTION IV.7.1 SUPERIORITY IN MORAL AND IN MANAGERIAL STANDARDS If there was little difference, then, at the time of Charlemagne and Louis the Pious between the basic administrative and economic organization of the great monastic and secular estates, there remain, nevertheless, a number of distinct features that set the monastery on a separate, if not higher plane from its secular counterpart. It is probably safe to assume that because of its attachment to such inherently Christian concepts as charity (caritas) and spiritual discipline (oboedientia),1 1 On caritas and oboedientia see Benedicti regula, ed. Hanslik, 1960, index, sub verbis; and the corresponding passages in McCann, 1952 and Steidle, 1952. a monastic community was less susceptible to corruption than the secular fiscs. Moreover, there is a good likelihood that because of the number of people it had to sustain as a corporate body, in an architectural plant that had the appearance of a town rather than a rural settlement, the monastery reached higher levels of attainment than its secular counterpart—even in such agricultural skills as gardening, the scientific management of crops and viticulture, the art of planting orchards and improving fruit trees through grafting, as well as in the dissemination of such important technical devices as water power for mill and mortar operation, sewage disposal, and the dissemination of old and new heating devices. I shall deal with these contributions individually, at their proper places later on in this study. In the present context they must be touched upon only to the extent to which they are part of a general picture, the whole of which does not emerge in the discussion of its individual components. IMPROVEMENT OF TREES BY GRAFTING The Plan gives us an accurate account of the wide variety of vegetables,2 2 On vegetables, see II, 203ff. fruit-bearing trees,3 3 On fruitbearing trees, see II, 211ff. and medicinal herbs4 4 On medicinal herbs, II, 181ff. that were grown within the confines of a Carolingian monastery. The great estates of the crown, as we learn from certain administrative directives such as the famous Capitulare de villis,5 5 On the Capitulare de Villis, see II, 33ff. had planting programs of comparable richness, but it is very unlikely that the average secular manor was equally prolific and advanced in these standards of planting, and there can be no doubt that the art of improving trees through grafting, as it was practiced on monastic lands, must have had a stimulating effect on the agricultural management of the secular manors with which its holdings were interspersed. IMPROVED METHODS IN MANAGEMENT: BREEDING OF LIVESTOCK The same might be said about contributions made by the monks in setting standards for the management and breeding of livestock. An analysis of the houses set aside for this purpose shows that the monastery of the Plan of St. Gall had room for eleven horses and eleven oxen,6 6 On horses and oxen, see II, 271ff. forty to seventy cows,7 7 On dairy cows, see II, 279ff. eleven foaling mares and their offspring,8 8 On foaling mares and their offspring, see II, 287ff. seventy to one hundred sheep,9 9 On sheep, see II, 297ff. about a hundred goats,10 10 On goats, see II, 289. and some twenty-one sows with litters.11 11 On sows and their litters, see II, 289ff. All of these were breeding stock and therefore only a small portion of the monastery's total number of chattel. Again, one might venture the proposition that by the sheer weight of the number of men it had to sustain, the monastery would tend to nurture a more systematic approach to such tasks as housing, breeding, and feeding of stock. Few royal abbeys had less than 250 men to be fed within the monastic enclosure alone—while some had as many as 400, 500, or 600. To provide for a steady flow of supplies for the sustenance of such a concentration of men was a logistic problem of the first order. NEW STANDARDS IN MANAGERIAL PRACTICE AND THEORY The monasteries, whose schools produced the intellectual leaders of the period, brought resources of formidable ingenuity to deal with this problem in a superior and exhaustive manner. This is attested by such milestones in the history of managerial organization as the Administrative Directives of Abbot Adalhard of Corbie,12 12 Consuetudines Corbeienses, ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 355-420; and translation by Jones, III, Appendix II, 103ff. the Constitution of Abbot Ansegis of St. Wandrille,13 13 Gesta SS. Patrum Fontanellensis Coenobii, ed. Lohier and Laporte, 1936, 117-23; and Jones, III, Addendum II, 125. and the Polyptique of Abbot Irminon of St. Germain-des-Prés.14 14 Polyptique of Abbot Irminon, ed. Guérard, 1844 and ed. Lognon, 1886-95. The two former, full translations of which are given in our last volume, are a complete analysis of the volume of revenues and labor required for the sustenance of a settlement of some 350 to 400 people, setting forth when, how, and by whom these revenues should be rendered and received; the latter is an exhaustive inventory of the land, people, chattel, and produce down to the smallest basket of cheese and eggs from a web of estates so vast as to accommodate in its totality as estimated 40,000 human beings. These documents have parallels in certain directives issued by the crown, such as the Capitulare de villis or the Brevium exempla,15 15 On the Brevium Exempla, see II, 36ff. but there are no equivalents from any of the lower rungs of the feudal ladder, and even on the level of the Crown there are no parallels of comparable complexity until three and a half centuries later, when William the Conqueror took it upon himself to tighten his grip over England by instituting that hated survey of people, chattel and land (1085-1086) to which his Anglo-Saxon subjects referred derisively as the Domesday Book. IV.7.2 SUPERIOR TECHNOLOGICAL STANDARDS NEW OR UNUSUAL HEATING DEVICES Because of the number of men it had to sustain, the monastery must have played a significant role in acceptance and diffusion of new or unusual heating devices. The primordial and common way of heating houses north of the Alps from the Stone Age onward, was the open fireplace that burned in the middle of the living room emitting its smoke through an opening in the roof that was protected by a lantern. This device, as our analysis will show, appears in all of the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall.16 16 On the open central fireplace (locus foci), see II, 117ff. But the Plan of St. Gall teaches us also that an exemplary monastery of the time of Louis the Pious was provided with two further methods for heating. In one of them the heat is generated by a furnace (caminus) built against one of the outer walls of the building, conducted into trenches beneath the floor and from there released through openings in the room above. This method—an obvious derivative of the Roman hypocaust system—was capable of producing an even flow of heat for large spaces and therefore used for rooms where the entire community of monks and novices slept or worked together.17 17 On the hypocaust system in the Monks' Warming Room and the dormitories of the Novitiate and the Infirmary, see above, pp. 253ff, 311f, 313f, and II, 130ff. In the other one, found in the lodgings of the higher ranking members of the monastic community as well as in the private bedrooms of the distinguished guests, the heat was produced by a hooded corner fireplace (caminata) that emitted its smoke through a chimney stack.18 18 On corner fireplaces see II, 123ff. Both these systems are highly sophisticated and have no parallels in the secular early medieval world, save for a few isolated occurrences on the highest social levels, namely in the palaces of kings.19 19 See II, 123ff, 130ff. SYSTEMATIC USE OF WATER POWER Another major cultural contribution made to Western life by the medieval monastery was its use of water power for such vital operations as the grinding and crushing of grain and, perhaps, for fulling. Our analysis of the machinery used for these purposes on the Plan of St. Gall will show that they were water-driven.20 20 On water powered mills and mortars, see II, 225ff. The system was known, but for peculiar reasons never widely employed in Rome. Again, it must have been the need for producing basic staples in bulk rather than the more modest quantities required for scattered individual households that prompted monastic planners to use water power and hydraulic machinery programmatically and from the very outset. The economic advantages of these power plants were obvious to anyone who had eyes to see, which explains fully enough why the secular lords, in imitation of the examples set by the large corporate organizations of the monks, reserved the right of milling for themselves and made it a primary means of feudal exploitation. IV.7.3 SUPERIOR STANDARDS IN THE ART OF WINE MAKING &amp; IN LARGE SCALE PRODUCTION OF WINE &amp; BEER It would be a grave mistake to overlook in this context the impact the medieval monastery had on modern viticulture as a guardian and transmitter of standards established by the ancients: the art of moving, storing and aging wine in quantities sufficiently large to guarantee to every member of the community the daily ration of wine permitted by St. Benedict.21 21 On wine and cooperage, see above pp. 292ff and II, 199ff. And it would be an even greater mistake to overlook the contribution the monasteries made to the modern brewing industry, by producing this beverage on a scale that had no parallels in the secular world, where beer in general was brewed in the home, and for the consumption of small groups of people.22 22 On monastic brewing, see II, 249ff. Nor can one disregard the effect which the monastic wine and brewing industry had on the cultivation of that highly specialized and proficient skill of manufacturing for the transportation and storage of these liquids, those large and ingeniously constructed casks which in addition of being perfectly tight, when filled, and of resisting considerable internal pressure during fermentation, must also be capable of bearing the strain of transportation to great distances. IV.7.4 SUPERIOR METHODS OF SANITATION It is equally clear that accounting for the needs of a concentrated body of people would foster the invention of superior methods of sanitation. Our account of the privies attached to the various homes shown on the Plan of St. Gall discloses that the standards of sanitary hygiene in a paradigmatic monastery of the time of Louis the Pious were far advanced not only over those of any of their classical protoand antetypes, but—with the sole exception of modern deluxe hotels—even conspicuously superior to common standards of modern sanitation.23 23 On monastic sanitation, see II, 300ff. IV.7.5 CULTIVATION OF LINGUISTIC INTELLECTUAL SKILLS Yet all of this fades into insignificance if viewed against the contributions which the monastery made to Western life in the fields of learning and in the arts. Early monastic asceticism generated disgust rather than sympathy for classical learning. But the teaching and dissemination of the Faith depended on the availability of a substantial body of sacred texts, which necessitated the establishment of libraries and of schools of writing both in the secular and the monastic churches. It was inevitable that the linguistic and intellectual skills required for the copying and writing of these books would engender an interest in the study of the great secular legacy of classical writing as a preparatory education for religious teaching.24 24 On the dissemination of learning in monastic schools, see Thompson, 1939, 20ff, and Southern, 1953, 185ff. The great protagonists of this school of thinking were such giants of Early Christian learning as St. Augustine (354-430) and Cassiodorus (c. 490-585). From them a direct line leads to Alcuin (735-804) who formulated, under Charlemagne, the educational policy that made the establishment of schools of learning a primary monastic obligation, and who was himself the founder of some of the greatest monastic schools of writing, including the school that flourished at the Palace itself. To define what went on in these scriptoria would mean to write half of the intellectual history of the Middle Ages and half of the history of its visual arts. Apart from the important task of providing the books that were indispensable for the conduct of the religious services, there was a demand for a great variety of original compositions, the writing of the lives of the saints, the writing of the monastery's own history, often reaching out to include a rich account of events that took place in the secular world, the creation of new hymns, and lectionaries, new antiphons, and numerous other liturgical innovations. The ever increasing preoccupation with these concerns—as students of medieval intellectual history have pointed out—"made men into historians, prose writers, poets and composers."25 25 Southern, op. cit., 186. IV.7.6 MONASTIC TIMETABLE &amp; ITS EFFECT UPON THE CREATION OF A MODERN CONCEPT OF TIMING Not among the least of the monastic contributions to Western life is the impetus which it gave to the modern concept of timing. Max Weber was one of the first to sense this connection when in his analysis of the role of Christianity on economic development, he wrote: "In that epoch the monk is the first human being who lives rationally, who works methodically and by rational means toward a goal, namely the future life. Only for him did the clock strike, only for him were the hours of the day divided for prayer."26 26 See Weber, 1927, 365. The passage, first published in 1923, was brought to my attention by Meyer Schapiro. Max Weber touches upon this same point in his Economy and Society: "The monk lived in a methodical fashion, he scheduled his time, practiced continuous self-control, rejected all spontaneous enjoyments and all personal obligations that did not serve the purpose of his vocation. Thus he was predestined to serve as the principal tool of bureaucratic centralization and rationalization in the church and, through his influence as priest and educator, to spread corresponding attitudes among the religious laymen. (Weber, 1968, III, 1172-1173; first published in Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft in 1922.) The issue is also discussed in Werner Sombart, Der Moderne Kapitalismus, I, 1928, 506; II, 1928, 127ff and 1080 (but not in the original edition of 1902). Lewis Mumford in his Technics and Civilization devoted an entire chapter to a discussion of this subject (beautifully written, but unfortunately devoid of any reference to original sources). See Mumford, 1962, chap. 2 "The Monastery and the Clock" and in particular, pp. 13-14. I presume that both Sombart and Mumford derive a good deal of their knowledge from Gustav Bilfinger's, Die Mittelalterlichen Horen und die Moderne Stunden, published in 1892, a thorough and very carefully documented inquiry into the history of time measurements. The division of day and night into twelve hours is a concept that the Greeks appear to have learned from the Babylonians, but one that does not seem to have had a deep effect on the actual conduct of the daily life of the Greeks.27 27 On the concept and measurement of time in Greco-Roman life, see Wilhelm Kubitschek's magnificent study of 1928; on the particular aspects here discussed especially, 178ff. (division of day into hours). Also to be consulted the article "Tageszeiten" by Walter Sontheimer, in Pauly-Wissowa, Real Encyclopädie IV:2, 1894, cols. 2011-2023; and idem, article "Zeitrechnung," IX:2, 1967, cols. 2338-2472. Because the hour was calculated as 1/12 of the span of the day, from sunset to sunrise, its length varied not only with each successive day, but also between each day and each night. Only during the equinoxes were the hours of day and night of equal length. Astronomers and scholars could cope with the daily adjustments subsumed in this system, but in rural life, both in Greece and in Rome, man continued to determine time, as he had done in the most remote ages, by measuring the length of his shadow with the sole of his foot.28 28 Kubitschek, 1928, 180-81; and Derek J. de Solla Price's chapter on "Precision Instruments: to 1500," in Singer-Holmyard-Hall, A History of Technology, III, 1957, 582-619 as well as an article by the same author on "Portable sundials in Antiquity," in Centaurus, XIV, 1969, 242-66. Sundials, which measured shadows in a more systematic manner, as well as water clocks were well known in ancient times and seem to have been of some importance in Roman public life.29 29 Ibid., 203ff., where the evidence is discussed which attests the use of water watches to limit the speaking time of Roman orators and prosecutors in Roman legal and political life. But in the Middle Ages, the only corporate segments of society where the whole of the daily cycle of activities was regulated by the striking of a bell, were the church and the monasteries.30 30 On the use of bells in monastic life, see above, pp. 129ff. The humble task of seeing that the services began at the right time, varying with the seasons, required careful thought and no mean knowledge about the movement of the stars. St. Benedict considered this task to be of such extreme importance that he entrusted it to the care of the abbot, whom he admonished to perform this duty either in person or to delegate it to a brother so careful "that everything may be fulfilled at its proper time."31 31 Benedicti regula, chap. 47, ed. McCann, 1952, 108-109; ed. Steidle, 1952, 245-46; ed. Hanslik, 1960, 113-14: Nuntianda hora operis dei dies noctisque sit cura abbatis aut ipse nuntiare aut tali sollicito fratri iniungat hanc curam, ut omnia horis conpetentibus conpleantur. Computus, i.e., the study and transmission of the knowledge about the Christian calendar, became a primary curricular subject of monastic learning, for which Bede (as Charles W. Jones has shown) played the role of prototypal master as author of De Temporibus, which became a textbook for centuries to follow.32 32 On Bede's treatment of computus and ths history of computus from the first Christian chronographers, Hippolytus and Julius Africanus, c. A.D. 200, see Charles W. Jones, 1937, 204-19; also see Jones' introduction to Bedae Opera de Temporibus, 1943, 3-121; and the chapters "The Master and the Calendar" and "Time References in Ecclesiastical History," in Jones 1947, 5ff and 31ff. The subject is again touched upon in Jones' preface to Bedae Opera didascalia, in Corpus Christianorum, CXXXIII:B, 1970. In later monastic practice the timing of the religious services, no easy task, became the charge of the sacrist33 33 Thus already clearly in the monastery of Bobbio, in 834/836, as stated in the Breve Memorationis of Abbot Wala. See above, p. 335, 1.9, CUSTOS ECCLESIAE. who, if he struck the bell for the meals or various parts of the divine office too late or too early, committed a breach of duty. For such a defection he was bound to give satisfaction at the next chapter meeting or, in the case of graver negligence, during the divine service, by standing at the foot of the steps of the presbytery with his body bent to the ground (stans incurvus) and retaining this penitential position throughout the Kyrie eleison until the completion of the service with the end of the Deo gratias.34 34 Consuetudines Cistercienses, chap. 114, ed. M. Guignard, 1878, 234: Que si citius vel tardius quam debent sonuerint. vel ad collationem lumen fuerit. in sequenti capitulo satisfaciat. Quod si in vigiliis duodecim lectionum tantum tardaverit. ut citius cantare et lectiones abbreviare necesse sit: ante gradum presbiterii satisfaciat. stans incurvus ad Kyrieleyson. usque post Deo gratias. On clear days and nights the relative length of each hour could be established with the aid of a sun dial or by the position of the stars. Rachel L. Poole published the text of a monastic star time-table of the eleventh century which gives accurate instructions to be followed by the night watchman of a monastery near Orleans.35 35 Poole, 1914-15, 98-100. A typical example follows: On Christmas Day, when you see the Twins lying, as it were, on the dormitory, and Orion over the chapel of All Saints, prepare to ring the bell. And on January first, when the bright star in the knee of Artophilax (i.e., Arcturus in Boötes) is level with the space between the first and second window of the dormitory and lying as it were on the summit of the roof, then go and light the lamps.36 36 Poole, op. cit., 103: In natale domini [Dec. 25] cum geminos quasi super dormitorium iacentes uideris et signum ORIONIS super capellam omnium Sanctorum preparate ad commouenda signa. In CIRCUMCISIONE domini [Jan. 1] dum claram stellam quae in genu ARTOPHILACIS est contra spacium quod inter primam et secundam dormitorii fenestram habetur quasi super summum tectum uideris tunc ad accendendas lucernas perge. The English translation given above is quoted after R. W. Southern, 1953, who touches upon the subject of timing on pp. 186ff. Similar directives concerning the relative position of stars to predetermined architectural features, at the desired hour, are given for the nights of all of the other important offices of the year. On dull days and nights, however, neither the sun quadrant nor the stars were of any use. On these occasions the sacrist's only recourse was the water clock. Excavations conducted in 1894 in the ruins of the Cistercian Abbey of Villers brought to light five fragments of slate, incised in a delicate cursive minuscule of the second half of the thirteenth century, with a series of minute instructions to the sacrist of Villers for regulating the monastery's water clock.37 37 Sheridan, 1896, 203-15 and 404-51; a study brought to my attention by Lynn White. The texts disclose that this water clock ran in cycles of 32 hours, that it had to be refilled when three-fourths depleted,38 38 Ibid., 210. and that its deficiencies in precision were checked by the angle of the shadows cast by the sun upon the jambs of the windows in the apse of the abbey church.39 39 Ibid., 420. There was no need in any institution of the secular world to transmit or nurture similar skills. The life of the medieval peasant was controlled by such simple and ever recurring events as the rising and setting of the sun, the waning and waxing of the moon, events whose seasonal variations placed little strain on the human ability to time action through observation. Even in military life where failure to maintain schedules might become a matter of survival, there were no timing needs of comparable complexity, comparable duration, or comparable consistency. Between the military division of the night by the Greeks and Romans into watches marked by the change of sentries and the time-controlled activities of the modern professional man who regulates the hours of both his work and his leisure (even his sleep!) by a portable timepiece attached to his wrist, there lies historically the monastic practice of dividing the day into a carefully calculated sequence of religious services (matin, lauds, prime, terce, sext, none, vespers, and compline) in which the 150 psalms could be cited in their entirety in the course of a week. IV.7.7 DEVELOPMENT OF NEW CONCEPTS IN ARCHITECTURE Our account of the monastery as a cultural institution would widen into a panorama of kaleidoscopic complexity were we to raise the question of the monastery's contribution to the development of western architecture. Up to the very close of the eleventh century all truly important architectural innovations were made in the great monastic compounds. Centula, Fulda, St.-Martin-du-Canigou, Tournus, Jumièges, Cluny, Santiago, Canterbury and Durham, to mention only some of the most obvious examples, are highlights in a spectacular pageant of monastic churches. The Church of the Plan of St. Gall with its modular schematism pointing centuries ahead in the development of medieval church construction—its apse and counter apse, its dual system of crypts—bears favorably the test of comparison with any of these great architectural innovations. 263.X CHRIST IN MAJESTY. DETAIL GOSPEL BOOK OF GUNDOHINUS (A.D. 754). Autun, Bibliothèque Municipale, MS. 3, fol. 12v [after Porcher-Hubert-Volbach, 1970, fig. 62] Made upon the order of a lady named Fausta and a monk, Fuculphus, this Gospel book was written by the scribe Gundohinus, in an unidentifiable monastery called Vosevium. The book's historical position at the start of a new era of Western life, marked by the coronation at St.-Denis of Charlemagne's father Pepin by Pope Stephen II, has been persuasively defined by Jean Porcher (op. cit., 71ff): "The book was completed in 754, the third year of the reign of King Pepin, the very year in which by a remarkable coincidence the Carolingian dynasty officially began. . . . Nothing like it had yet been seen on the continent north of the Alps. The history of the Carolingian book begins with Gundohinus, just as the Carolingian dynasty begins with Pepin." Drawn with a clumsy hand, in lines intoxicated with a naive sophistication, this sensitive head of Christ—whose frontal stare has distinguished antecedents in Imperial Roman art—is, among other things, a reflection of the deep cultural shock to which the Northern barbarians, with their nonfigurative art, were exposed in this first encounter with the anthropomorphic imagery of the Christian South. MUSÉE D'HISTOIRE ET D'ART, LUXEMBOURG. FIFTH CENTURY A.D. Two doves confront each other on either side of a vase. The engraved marble fragment from Ettelbrük bears an Early Christian inscription commemorating a man who, dead at the age of 38, was mourned by his wife Dalmatia. AN END OR A BEGINNING? A symbol of expectation of eternal life awaiting the faithful who, as doves, pluck flowers from the fountain of life, the composition is a fascinating link between Roman, Early Christian, and medieval art. In Roman times, the motif was primarily decorative. But stripped of the sculptural plasticity and the pictorial realism which it then possessed, enriched with Christian symbolism, and recast in the flat, linear style favored by the barbarian conquerors of Rome, the fragment displays a freshness of spirit that heralds the ascendancy of a new cultural mood—a new feeling for life that, interacting with the heritage of Antiquity, was to generate a cultural synthesis of rich and unprecedented sophistication. The Carolingian Renaissance which among other great accomplishments produced the Plan to which these volumes are dedicated, was one of the first great peaks of this cultural encounter.
