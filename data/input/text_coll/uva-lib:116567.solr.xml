For admission to the Freshman Class in the Department of Engineering the candidate must be at least sixteen years old. He must present a certificate of honorable withdrawal from the school last attended, or other valid proof of general good character. He must further satisfy the Dean of the University as to his adequate preparation for the work by passing the Entrance Examinations specified below or by the presentation of equivalent certificates of preparation signed by the president of a recognized institution of collegiate rank, or by the principal of an accredited high school. The topics required for entrance and their values in units are as follows, the unit being one year's work on the subject in an accredited high school: English A.âGrammar and Grammatical Analysis 1 English B.âComposition and Rhetoric 1 English C.âCritical Study of Specimens of Literature 1 Mathematics A1.âAlgebra to Quadratics 1 Mathematics A2.âQuadratics, Progressions, Binomial Formula 1 Mathematics B.âPlane Geometry 1 Mathematics C.âSolid Geometry Â½ Mathematics D.âPlane Trigonometry Â½ History.âAncient; MediÃ¦val; English; American (any one) 1 Electives 7 Total 15 High school students who expect to study Engineering are advised to include among their electives one Modern Language, Chemistry or Physics, and Mechanical Drawing, and Shop-work. Other electives which may be profitably offered are History of English and American Literature, History, Latin, Greek, Botany, ZoÃ¶logy, Physical Geography. A candidate may be admitted as a Conditioned Student in spite of some deficiencies, provided these are not such as will impair the integrity of his work. But no such candidate will be conditioned except upon subjects actually taught in this university, nor will any candidate be conditioned on more than two units; and all conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the next session after initial registration. Courses taken for the removal of entrance conditions may in no case be counted as part of the work credited for any degree. No conditions will be allowed in English A or B or in Mathematics A1, A2, or B. A candidate may be admitted as a Special Student without formal examination, provided he is more than twenty years old if a Virginian and not less than twenty-three years old if a non-Virginian, and gives evidence of serious purpose and of fitness to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for any degree. No conditioned student may register later as a special student. ADMISSION OF WOMEN. Women may be admitted only as regular students in the Department of Engineering provided they have completed at least two years of standard college work before entrance, and are at least twenty years old. ADVANCED STANDING. Under the elective system of the University of Virginia, a student who has completed courses of college or university grade in other institutions of learning on mathematical or scientific subjects may be excused from attendance upon these courses by the Dean, with the advice and consent of the professors in charge, and will then be registered for the more advanced work. In order to secure College Credit upon such courses toward a degree in Engineering from this University, the applicant must showâ 1. That the courses offered are coextensive with the corresponding courses as given in the University of Virginia. 2. That his grades on them were not below the seventy-five per cent. pass-mark of this University. Such credits may be granted by the faculty upon the recommendation of the Dean and the professors in charge; but are automatically revoked by the failure of the student to pass in the more advanced courses in the related topics. The same rules apply to Credits on Summer School Courses; except that for courses in the Summer School of this University the examination questions must be prepared by the professor in charge of the regular course, and the answers must be read and graded by him. Students, suspended from other universities, are not granted college credit on courses previously passed, except upon the explicit recommendation of the suspending university, and after such additional tests as this Engineering Faculty may impose. Credits on Practice-Courses in Drawing, Shop-work, or Field-work may be granted to applicants who have gained in professional practice the training which these courses represent. Such applicants must file with the Dean proper certificates from the official under whom the work was done and must in every case pass an additional practical test on the subjects for which credit is desired. College credit is not granted for high-school work. PROGRAMS OF STUDY. The candidate who has satisfied the requirements for entrance as above defined is matriculated as a student of Engineering and admitted to the Freshman Class. The studies of this class comprise lecture courses in English, Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Chemistry with associated laboratory courses in Chemistry, Drawing, Shop-work and Field-work. For advancement to the Sophomore Class the student must have completed at least two-thirds of his Freshman work. Upon entering this class he elects his specialty. The courses thereafter diverge according as the student is an applicant for a degree in Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Chemical, or Mining Engineering. Programs of study for each degree are given below. The courses are so ordered that the specified entrance requirements are adequate for the work of the Freshman Year. Each succeeding year presupposes the completion of the work for all the foregoing years. Students are advised to adhere strictly to the regular programs. The arrangements specified in them have been carefully planned and are the best. Departures from the curriculum will in almost every case produce conflicts in lecture hours or laboratory periods and may cost the student a year's time. Haphazard election is discouraged and in extreme cases will be prohibited. No student will be registered for a course unless, in the opinion both of the Dean and of the professor, his preliminary training has fitted him for the profitable pursuit of that course. Students are especially advised against the attempt to crowd too many studies into their scheme of work, and are warned that admission to advanced courses will be granted only to those who have adequate mathematical and scientific training to profit by them. Men overloaded with work, too great in volume or in difficulty for their powers, suffer inevitable discouragement and incur almost certain failure. Changes of classes with transfer of fees may be made, subject to the approval of the Dean, within two weeks after the beginning of any term. Thereafter such changes may be made only by special order of the faculty, and then without transfer of fees. Upon the completion of the four years' course as defined in any one of the Programs of Study, the faculty will award to any student in regular and honorable standing the appropriate degree of Civil Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Chemical Engineer, or Mining Engineer. ANNOUNCEMENT OF FIVE-YEAR CURRICULUM. In view of the impressive and growing demand from practicing engineers and industrial leaders that Schools of Engineering should enlarge the field of study to embrace more of the humanities and better opportunities for student research, to the end that graduates may be better fitted to undertake their duties as engineers and citizens, announcement is here made that the engineering curriculum of the University of Virginia is to be enlarged from four to five years. In the new curriculum courses will be offered in modern languages, history, government, sociology, philosophy and like studies, and graduate courses will be developed in the main divisions of engineering instruction. Under the new curriculum the B.S. degree will be awarded at the end of four years upon satisfactory completion of the work and the specialized degrees (C.E., Ch.E., E.E., E.M., and M.E.) at the end of the graduate year. The entering class of 1923-24 and subsequent classes will be matriculated under the new program, while students registered before the session of 1923 or with corresponding advanced standing will be permitted to graduate under the present curriculum, but not later than June, 1926. The full revised curriculum will be published later but the Freshman courses will be the same as under the present system. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. The Subjects of Instruction in Engineering are grouped into classes, each designated by a distinctive number for each term, the lecture and laboratory courses being likewise differentiated. This grouping follows the arrangement shown below: Business Administration 1 to 99 Mathematics 100 to 199 Physics 200 to 299 Chemistry 300 to 399 Geology and Mining 400 to 499 Applied Mathematics 500 to 599 Experimental Engineering 600 to 699 Civil Engineering including Field-work 700 to 799 Mechanical Engineering including Shop-work 800 to 899 Electrical Engineering 900 to 999 Lecture courses are listed in the first fifty numbers of all classes; laboratory or practice courses are listed in the second fifty numbers of all classes. The same numbers are used in schedules of lecture hours, laboratory periods and examination days. The last pages of this announcement are devoted to a description of the courses in Art and Architecture now offered. There will be found the requirements for admission, the statement of requirements for a degree in Architecture and description of equipment available for instruction in the McIntire School of Fine Arts.

These societies hold regular meetings for the discussion of periodical literature and the exposition by resident and visiting engineers of the present-day problems in Engineering. A valuable feature of the meetings is the opportunity presented for practice in public speaking and debate. At stated meetings the Branches hold joint sessions for the discussion of mutually interesting questions. TAU BETA PI. In May, 1921, a chapter of the National Honorary Engineering Fraternity of Tau Beta Pi was granted and the Alpha of Virginia Chapter of Tau Beta Pi will henceforth serve to further inspire high scholarship and integrity. This fraternity is recognized as the leading honorary engineering fraternity of this country and its chapters have been installed in some forty engineering schools of the highest standing. The members are selected with care and the standards maintained are rigid both in respect to scholarship and character. ENGINEERING JOURNAL. During the session of 1920-21 the University of Virginia Journal of Engineering was first issued. The Journal is published by the Students of Applied Science and is issued ten times yearly. Contributions are made by students, instructors and alumni and the Journal gives to the students especially an opportunity to take part in an activity of interest and value while providing a medium in which may be published results of individual experience and research. ENGINEERING STUDENTS' READING CLUB. A gift to the Department of Engineering from Messrs. Arthur P. Jones, William Barham Jones (B.A. 1907) and Major Kenneth S. Jones (B.A., LL.B., C.E. 1915, Major U. S. A., Engineer Corps) in memory of their father, the late Walter H. Jones of Norfolk, Va., and of his deep interest in the University of Virginia, in the form of an endowment fund has made it possible to provide a considerable number of professional periodicals representing the various engineering activities. To promote the regular use of these periodicals an Engineering Students' Reading Club has been formed to which all engineering students are eligible and this club is expected to foster proper use of the periodicals to the end that the maximum of value will be obtained by the students from their reading.

The examination day for a particular course is indicated in the table above by the Roman numeral in the space denoting hour of lecture. The examination period covers ten days at the end of each term. A change in lecture period for any course will change the examination day correspondingly. Classes for which lecture periods are not indicated will have examination days fixed by the arranged lecture hour in accordance with above schedule. EXPENSES OF REGULAR STUDENTS. The average annual expense of a student who pursues the regular course in Engineering will be: NonVirginians Virginians University Fee $ 40 $ 20 Tuition 160 85 Laboratory Fees (average) 35 35 Living Expenses (for nine months) 400 400 Books and Drawing Materials 30 30 Incidental Expenses (for nine months) 60 60 Total annual for average conditions $725 $630 The charges for Tuition are uniform to all students, except that Virginians are relieved of tuition on courses offered in the College, this exception saving regular Freshmen from Virginia $100 and all other Virginia students $65 each year in comparison with non-Virginians. The laboratory charges are $15 per class for the year's course in Physics, and $20 per class for a year's course in Chemistry. A deposit for breakage of $5 is required for each laboratory course in Chemistry. The fee for each practice course in the Engineering Department, Drawing, Engineering Laboratories, and Shop-work is $5 per term for each course. The fees for Field-work and Bridge Drafting are each $10 per term per course. These fees include all charges for laboratory materials; but the student is held further responsible for breakage. The living Expenses include board, lodging, fuel and lights, servant and laundry; the average is $10.00 per week, the minimum $7.50, and a reasonable maximum $12.50. Books and Drawing Materials will cost about $120 for the four-year course. Incidental Expenses ought to be kept within modest bounds; the above estimate is sufficient; large allowances of pocket money promote idleness and attract companions of the baser sort. No allowances are included for clothing and travel, the expenses for which vary too much to be introduced into any general estimate. The charges payable on entrance are the University Fee, and the Tuition and Laboratory Fees. EXAMINATIONS AND REPORTS. Oral examinations are held at the beginning of each lecture hour on the topics of the preceding lecture. Written test papers are set monthly, or at such interval as the professor may appoint. Absences from lecture except by reason of sickness are not excused without a written leave from the Dean. Class standing is determined on the basis of the oral examinations and the written tests. Absence from the latter or failure to answer incurs a zero grade. Absences from laboratory periods, however caused, must be made up by special private arrangement with the instructor. Written examinations are held at the end of each term on the entire work of that term. The result of examination combined with the student's class-standing gives his term-grade. The pass-mark is seventy-five per cent. Absence from the written term examination incurs a zero term-grade, which may not be removed except by the passage of a special written examination on the work of that term. Such special examinations are granted only upon presentation of a written certificate from a reputable physician that the student by reason of sickness on the day of the regular examination was unable to attend. Regular Reports are sent out at the end of every term to the student's parents or guardian. These state for each course followed the term-grade and the number of absences. Further comment may be added by the Dean or the professor, if it appears probable that such comment would be helpful to the student. Parents are urged to examine these reports carefully and to exert such parental influence as may seem needed to establish and confirm the student in habits of industry and order. Special Reports are sent to parents at the end of each month for students delinquent in attendance or studiousness and for delinquents only. When a student is making steady progress and showing due diligence in his work, only the regular reports are sent. The receipt of a special report is evidence that, in the judgment of the faculty, prompt and pointed parental admonition is urgently needed. If in any class in the Department of Engineering a student fails to make satisfactory progress, he is first admonished by the professor in charge. In default of prompt and permanent improvement, he is next formally warned by the Dean. If due amendment is then not immediately effected, the student's name is dropped from the rolls of the Department, on the ground that he is not accomplishing the purposes for which he should have entered upon a University course of study. REGULATIONS. The following regulations, adopted to define the policy of the faculty, are published for the information and guidance of the students: 1. Practice-courses as well as lecture-courses must be conducted under the Honor System. The student who submits any work to be graded is considered to submit it under pledge. 2. When the lecture-course and the associated practice-course are given in the same term of the same year, no student will be admitted to examination on the lecture-course until he has completed at least three-fourths of the practice-course. 3. No student will be admitted to any practice-course unless he is at the same time pursuing the associated lecture-course, or has already received credit for the same. 4. No student will be admitted to the graduating examination on a lecture-course unless he has been present at more than half the lectures in that course. 5. In the technical courses in Engineering (i. e., courses not given in the College) term-grades shall not be averaged; except that the term-grades for Freshman Applied Mathematics may be averaged for the first-year men only, provided no mark is below 65. 6. The pass-mark in every course is 75. Class standing is estimated at 20 points; the written examination at 80 points. 7. No student who fails to make 75 on term-grade shall be granted another examination on the course until he has again attended lectures on that course. 8. Special examinations are not given except by reason of sickness on the day of examination, attested by the written certificate of a reputable physician, or for other like providential causes. In every case they must be validated by special vote of the faculty. 9. A student whose term-grades average less than 40 for all the courses in which he is registered shall be at once dropped from the rolls. If his average is above 40 with no mark above 65, he is placed on probation. 10. A student on probation may engage in no collegiate activities, athletic or musical. If in the next term he makes less than 65 on each and all his courses, he shall be at once dropped from the rolls. DRAFTING ROOMS. The drafting rooms are abundantly lighted and are provided with solidly constructed tables with locked drawers for instruments and materials. Each student is assigned to a table and has a drawer for his exclusive use. The regular Drawing Classes execute each one plate a week under the supervision of the Instructors in Drawing. The more advanced students have such additional drawings assigned by their respective professors as are needed for the full development of the courses of study. Careful attention is given to the training of the students in free-hand lettering, in the conventional signs of mechanical drawing, in the proper lay-out of drawings, and in neat and accurate execution. Exercises are required also in tracing and in blue-printing, the rooms for which are conveniently arranged and in close contiguity to the drafting rooms. While, however, technical dexterity is demanded, the graphical method is taught and used primarily as an indispensable instrument of research, the thoughtful mastery of which is essential for the instructed Engineer. The construction and theory of the Polar Planimeter, the Slide Rule, and the Pantograph are carefully taught, and the student is trained in the practical use of these appliances for the rapid and accurate production of estimates and copies from finished drawings. SHOPS. The machine shop is provided with six first-class engine lathes, illustrating the practice of the best American makers; with a planer, a shaper, two drill presses, a universal milling machine (Brown &amp; Sharpe), and a universal grinder (same makers); also with a gas forge for tempering tools, a cut-off saw for metal rods, an emery wheel, grindstone, and so on. The wood shop is furnished with five small lathes, a large patternmaker's lathe, a jointer, a planer, a saw bench for slitting and cross-cutting, a band-saw, a jig-saw, and a wood trimmer for pattern-making, six cabinetmaker's benches, and an ample supply of hand tools. EXPERIMENTAL ENGINEERING LABORATORIES. Road Materials Laboratory.âThe apparatus for tests of non-bituminous road materials includes a two-cylinder Deval abrasion machine, a ball mill, a moulding press for briquettes of rock dust, a Page impact cementation tester, a Page impact toughness tester, a rock crusher and a Purdue brick rattler. This outfit the University owes to the generous aid of the late Dr. Logan Waller Page. In addition, the Department has acquired a 40,000-pound compression tester, a diamond core drill, a diamond rock saw, a grinding lap, a Westphal balance, specific gravity apparatus, and a complete set of sieves. Useful researches in the road-building rocks and gravels of Virginia, as well as the standard tests, are conducted each year by the class in Civil Engineering. The apparatus for tests of bituminous road materials includes the New York Testing Laboratory penetrometer, the Kirschbaum ductility machine, the Engler viscosimeter, the asphalt viscosimeter, the New York Testing Laboratory extractor, the New York State Board of Health oil tester, Hubbard pyknometers, asphalt flow plates, gas and electric hot plates, and the accessory apparatus needed for research on bituminous road-binders. Structural Materials Laboratory.âThe Sinclair Laboratory for work in testing structural materials was founded on the original donation of Mrs. John Sinclair, of New York City, as a memorial to her late husband. The collection has since been considerably enlarged. It contains a Riehle 100,000-pound machine, arranged for tensile, compressive, and transverse tests, with an attachment for taking autographic diagrams; an Olsen 100,000-pound machine fitted with a suspended ball compression block; an Olsen torsion machine of 50,000-inch pounds capacity; a Ewing machine for finding the modulus of elasticity; hand machines for testing rods and wires under pull, and small specimens of timber and cast iron under transverse loads. It is also equipped with accessory measuring instruments; these include a Henning extensometer, an Olsen compressometer, and a Ewing optical extensometer of great delicacy. The laboratory is completely equipped for making tests of cement, cement aggregates, and concrete. It contains a Fairbank's tensile tester of 1,000 pounds capacity; an Olsen steaming over for accelerated tests; an Olsen drying oven with automatic temperature regulation; moist air closets; sieves for mechanical analysis; moulds for tension and compression tests; and the required small apparatus. Fuel and Oil Laboratory.âFor the determination of the heating value of coal, petroleum, etc., the laboratory has an Emerson bomb calorimeter. For gas calorimetry, a Junker calorimeter made by the American Meter Co. is used. The equipment also includes a Braun gas muffle furnace, a Brown high resistance pyrometer, balances, platinum crucibles, etc. For investigating the coefficient of friction for lubricants, the laboratory has an Olsen-Cornell oil tester, and is further equipped with such apparatus as flash and chill point testers, hydrometers, viscosimeters, etc., used in the determination of the physical properties of oils. Hydraulics Laboratory.âThe laboratory equipment for work in hydraulics comprises a steel tank for weir experiments with interchangeable bronze notches; a hook gauge for measurement of surface levels; a standpipe provided with a set of standard bronze orifices for experiments on efflux; commercial pipe and elbows arranged for determining friction losses; and the necessary scales, tanks, manometers, etc. It also includes a pump which is piped to circulate water from a cement cistern to a tank in the attic of the building. A recent addition to the equipment of this laboratory is a motor driven centrifugal pump with a capacity of 350 gallons per minute at 100 feet head, equipped with a Venturi meter and the necessary piping, valves and gauges to provide for complete performance tests on the pump. This unit also supplies water at constant pressure for the other hydraulic tests. Power Laboratory.âThe laboratory is equipped to illustrate the theory involved in Mechanical Engineering; to give practical instruction in the handling of machinery; and to teach the fundamental methods of experimental work. It contains a Ball high-speed engine; a De Laval turbine with condensing and non-condensing nozzles, which is direct-connected to a 20-kva. alternating-current generator; an Otto gasoline engine with a special piston for alcohol; a Wheeler surface condenser to which the exhaust from any of the steam units may be connected; a Sturtevant blower; an air compressor; an A. B. C. Pitot tube; a steam pump; steam traps, etc. For boiler tests, the boilers of the University Heating and Lighting Plant are used. The instrument room contains all necessary apparatus for carrying out complete tests. Among this may be mentioned indicators, thermometers, gauges, planimeters, with standards for their correction and calibration; two types of Orsat apparatus; separating and throttling calorimeters, etc. FIELD WORK IN CIVIL ENGINEERING. The outfit of field instruments contains compasses, transits, and levels of various approved makes; a solar transit, furnished also with stadia wires and gradienter for tachymetric work; hand-levels and clinometers for field topography; plane tables; a sextant; together with an adequate supply of leveling rods, telemeter rods, signal poles, chains, tapes, pins, and so on. For hydraulic surveys a hook gauge and a current meter are provided. All students are instructed in the theory and adjustments of the field instruments and in their practical use in the field. They are also required to make up their field-books in standard forms; to reduce their surveys and execute all the necessary profiles, plans, and maps; and to determine lengths, areas, and volumes both from the maps and from the original notes. Polar planimeters are provided for facilitating such estimates, and a pantograph for making reduced copies of finished drawings. In recognition of the growing interest in Good Roads in Virginia and the immense social and economic importance of the construction of such roads in all parts of the commonwealth, the Faculty of the Department of Engineering has rearranged the courses of instruction in this topic and brought them together into the Spring Term, so as to form a special course in highway engineering for the benefit of young men from Virginia who wish to go into public highway work. To such Virginians, if adequately prepared and recommended, free scholarships will be given. Application should be made to the Dean, accompanied by recommendations from the State Highway Commissioner or from the Board of Supervisors of the applicant's county. ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING LABORATORY. The Scott Laboratory of Electrical Engineering.âThis laboratory was initially equipped and endowed by Mrs. Frances Branch Scott, of Richmond, Va., as a memorial to her late son, an alumnus of this University. During the year 1910 the equipment was substantially increased through the generosity of the Hon. Charles R. Crane, of Chicago, Ill., a friend of the University. During 1912 still further substantial additions were made, consisting of measuring instruments, auxiliary control apparatus, and more particularly a steam-turbine-driven three-phase alternating-current generator with exciter and control switchboard. In addition to full sets of electric meters with the appliances for testing and calibrating them, galvanometers of the best modern types, standard cells and resistances, standard condensers, and other pieces of apparatus for minor tests, this laboratory contains numerous pieces of the very best construction. Such are the Wolff potentiometer, the Seimens and Halske Thomson double bridge, the Koepsel permeameter, the Station photometer with Lummer-Brodhun screen, the Carey-Foster bridge and others. For the work in machine-testing there are a number of direct-current generators and motors, series, shunt and compound, interpole motors, a double current generator, a two-phase alternator, a General Electric experimental test set for alternating current, comprising a generator furnishing single, two, three, six or twelve-phase current, and, in addition, offering three types of induction motors with all necessary starting and controlling devices, a single-phase repulsion motor, a two-phase induction motor, two three-phase induction motors, several pairs of constant voltage transformers, a constant current transformer, frequency meters, power factor indicator, synchronism indicator, ground detector and the auxiliary apparatus used in testing these machines. The laboratory has been arranged with a system of universal plug and receptacle-connections to facilitate the setting up of all experimental combinations. Additional equipment is now being installed which comprises a complete three-element oscillograph set with necessary accessories, two direct current motor generator sets with automatic push-button start and stop control complete, and an experimental alternator test generator with complete modern switchboard panel for its control as well as a motor to drive it equipped with push-button start, reverse and stop control. BUILDINGS. The buildings devoted wholly or in part to the work of the Department of Engineering are the following: The Mechanical Laboratory is the main seat of the instruction in technical studies. It is 180 by 70 feet and contains on the main floor the Dean's office and the offices of three other professors; and three lecture-rooms. Above are an office, a small drafting room for advanced students, and blue-print and photographic rooms. Below on the ground floor are an office and classroom, the electrical laboratories, the testing laboratories, apparatus and storerooms, and the students' lavatory. In order to more adequately care for increased numbers this building has undergone a considerable rearrangement during the past few years. Wood and machine shop equipment has been entirely removed from the building, as well as the facilities for Freshman and Sophomore Drawing. This change made available much needed classroom space and allowed the electrical laboratories to be expanded. Incident to the changes new cement floors were constructed for the Road Materials Testing Laboratory, the main testing Laboratory and the main hall. A new high-pressure steam line from the Power House was also installed. The Shops are now temporarily housed in the Garage erected for the Motor Truck Training Detachment during the World War. This building gives a floor space of some 5,000 square feet and has allowed the rearrangement of wood and machine shop equipment for group drive by four electric motors. Space is also available in this structure for use in connection with the course in automobile construction and testing. The Drawing Room is temporarily housed near Peabody Hall in one of the Barracks taken from the Training Camp site and rebuilt and fitted for drawing. The building accommodates about 180 men, each man having his individual drawing desk. The Power House is a single-story building 110 by 40 feet. In addition to the University boiler plant and the electric lighting plant, this contains the foundry and the forge-room. The Boiler plant consists of two horizontal return-tubular boilers, each of 140 horse-power. The lighting plant consists of three electric generators directly connected to high-speed engines, the respective capacities being 25, 50, and 75 kilowatts. The whole plant is available for purposes of instruction, study and experiment. In addition to the University plants there are available by courtesy of the owners for purposes of inspection, study and tests such plants as the turbine station and railway and power substation of the Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway Company, the water turbines and oil engine plant of the Charlottesville Woolen Mills, and plants of the local ice companies and cold storage. The Geological Museum is 120 by 50 feet. It is a three-story building. The main floor is devoted to the very extensive geological collection of specimens, charts, relief maps, and so on. The gallery above contains an equally good collection of minerals and numerous models of typical crystallographic forms. The upper floor contains the lecture-rooms and the laboratories of Economic Geology. In the basement are stored subsidiary collections and new material accumulated in more recent geological surveys. The Physical Laboratory faces the Mechanical Laboratory on the opposite side of the quadrangle, and has almost the same proportions. The main floor contains the lecture-room, the professors' offices, the laboratory of experimental physics, and the storeroom for the very large collection of apparatus used in the lectures. On the ground floor is the laboratory of theoretical electricity, the storage battery room, a well-equipped shop for the repair and manufacture of apparatus, and smaller rooms for the work of graduate students. Considerable special equipment is available for the study of problems in thermodynamics. The new Chemical Laboratory was opened for use in September, 1917. In this fire-proof structure all the work in Chemistry is assembled. The floor area provided is about 30,000 square feet. The lecture-rooms seat classes of 300, 75 and 25 students. The laboratories assigned to General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Qualitative Analysis, Quantitative Analysis, and Physical Chemistry contain 110, 60, 40, 30, and 20 desks. Altogether by dividing classes into sections, 600 students may be accommodated. Smaller private laboratories are provided for research workers. Large stock rooms communicating by elevators with the several floors contain ample stores of chemical supplies. The 5,000 volumes of books and bound sets of journals constituting the Departmental Library of Chemistry are so housed as to be accessible to both teachers and students. McINTIRE SCHOOL OF FINE ARTS. Fiske Kimball, A.B., M.Arch., Ph.D. Professor of Art and Architecture Stanislaw John Makielski Assistant Professor in Art and Architecture Louis Francis Voorhees, B.Arch., M.S. Instructor in Architecture INSTRUCTION IN ARCHITECTURE. Instruction leading to the professional degree of Bachelor of Science in Architecture is offered in the University by the McIntire School of Fine Arts in collaboration with the Department of Engineering and with the other academic schools. This work is under the administrative jurisdiction of the College, and the rules of the College regarding entrance requirements, fees, choice of courses, and requirements for degrees are those which apply in it. Thus the entrance requirements are fifteen units, of which three must be in English, two and one-half in Mathematics, one in History, and two units in each of two Modern Languages. Solid geometry and elementary physics, though not made the subject of entrance conditions, are absolutely required in the course of the work, and if not presented for entrance must be taken at once in collegeâif necessary in addition to the number of hours required for the degree. The fees are as follows: University fee, for non-Virginians, $40; for Virginians, $10. Tuition fee, for non-Virginians, $160; for Virginians, nothing, except in technical courses in the Engineering Department a tuition fee equal to $10 per term for each course, and in the courses in architectural design (Architecture B2 and C1) $40 each. The total of university, tuition and laboratory fees for the four years shows an annual average as follows: for non-Virginians, $208; for Virginians, $65. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE IN ARCHITECTURE. Candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Architecture must complete the 63 session-hours listed below. To complete the work required for the degree in four years from the time of entering college, students without advanced standing or college credit should adhere closely to the following program in choosing their courses. It is strongly urged, however, that those students who can do so should devote an additional year to study for the degree, taking also such other cultural and scientific subjects as foreign languages, history, and chemistry.
