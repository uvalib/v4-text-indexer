      <field name="fulltext">THE RECORDS OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY OF LONDON VOLUME IV DOCUMENTS, II</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Preface The records of the Virginia Company during the first three months of the years from January, 1622/23 to January, 1624/25, picture the final attempts to regulate and develop the tobacco trade with Virginia. Then follow papers revealing the bitter attack upon the Earl of Southampton and the adventurers associated with him, by Sir Nathaniel Rich and the defenders of Sir Thomas Smith's regime. Throughout the whole period are portrayed the struggle of the plantation to recover from the Indian massacre of March 22, 1622, and the efforts made by the officials in London and by the Governor, Council, and Assembly in Virginia. The most important and perhaps unique document of the entire series published in volumes III and IV of the Records of the Virginia Company is the Records of Pro- ceedings upon Information of Quo Warranto in the Court of King's Bench, found by the editor in the Public Record Office, London. It, alone, covers one hundred pages of volume IV. The largest number of documents come from the Manuscript Records of the Virginia Company, Volume III. Like volumes I and II, comprising the minutes of the London company, it is deposited in the Library of Congress, Washington, District of Columbia. In it are spread the official papers of the Governor, Council and Assembly of Virginia. They include letters to and from the officers of the Virginia Company of London, commissions issued, orders declared, petitions granted, warrants for elections, statements of the condition of the colony and other documents revealing the history of the plantation. A long series of papers shedding much light on the terrific conflict within the Company, resulting in its dissolution by Quo Warranto proceedings, comes from the Manchester Papers, now in the Public Record Office, London, being largely letters and memoranda of Sir Nathaniel Rich. The Colonial Office Papers in the Public Record Office, the Ferrar Papers, and the Papers of Lord Sackville, now deposited at Knole Park, Kent, each supplied a number of important documents. In this volume, then, is to be found the record of the dissension within the company that brought about the close of the corporation and the end of the first period of the colony's history. At the same time the beginning of Virginia as a crown colony is set forth. Here also is portrayed the settled life of the plantation. Much is told of the colonists and their efforts to create an organized and systematic government, to produce commodities that would provide the necessities for living, and to develop resources that might result in needful trade with the Indians and with England. Two documents of importance, inadvertently omitted at first, but now numbered CCCXLV A and CDXXXVII A, will be found, not in their chronological place, but at the end of the volume, as Addenda. The editor wishes to make acknowledgment to Dr. Hubert Hall for his labors in supervising the transcript of the Quo Warranto Proceedings and in translating the entire document. As in the previous volume, the editor is deeply indebted to Professor J. Franklin Jameson for his continued care in seeing the document through the press; to Marian Carter Anderson for her assistance in preparing the manuscript for the press and in the difficulties of reading the proof. Helen Kingsbury Zirkle has prepared the index for this volume as she did for Volume III, and to her again the editor wishes to express appreciation of her contribution. A part of the expense of arranging the manuscript, reading the proof, and making the index was met by a grant from the Social Science Research Council. Susan M. Kingsbury. December 1, 1934.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CCLXXV. Statement of Advantages to Virginia and Somers Islands Companies of the Tobacco Contract 1622/3 (?) Manchester Papers, No. 311 Document in Public Record Office, London. Autograph of Edward Collingwood (?) List of Records No. 396 A comparison of the former estates of the Companies for their Tobacco, with what it is nowe by this Contract. First in the yeare 1619 there came neare vpon 70000: weight of Tobacco from the Su?er Island?: great quantities whereof were sold for twelue pence the pound, and generally 2s the pound was the highest price that it was sold at. There came the end of that yeare; and the begininge of the yeare 1620 for the Account of the Magazine for Virginia about 26000: weight: whereof about 20000: weight was bought by Alderman Johnson and his partners for lesse then 2s 3d a pound: and generally one with another the Tobaccoes returned from Virginia that yeare were not sold for 2s a pound or not aboue. So that the estate of the Companies was that indeed except some Retaylors, there was not generally made aboue 2s a pound toward? all Charge. And this price was likely to decay euery yeare as greater abundance of Tobacco came in: wherevpon in the yeare 1620 in March, there was a Charter sent to the Colonie in Virginia from the Companie here, where- in they directly declared vnto them, that they should not expect more then twelue pence a pound in Virginia. Nowe putting this to be § the § true state that Tobacco was solde, this Contract will put vs in better case: for then for then 3 pound sent home at 2s made 6s But the King had of it 3s wch was to be layd downe in ready money before the Owner might haue his To 3s bacco wch doun vpon his 3 pound he only cleared Nowe bringing home 3 pound of Tobacco, the King hath one And then the two other being sold ? 4s whereof the King hath 1s And then the owner cleares 3s. So that in this case the owner hath asmuch money and a great deale of advantage, in reguard that by the former Course to a bad Co?odity, he layeth downe half money, whereas here, he layd downe but a sixt. [2] But it perhapps it wilbe said that this was the Lowest price rate of the Tobacco and that there was sold at 2s 6d or 3s ? pound: then the com- parison stands thus. 3 pounds of Tobacco at 2s 6d was sold for 7 6 Nowe of 3 pound brought the King hath one, the other two being sold for—2s 6d ? pound 5s The King had 3 0 wherein the King hath 1s 0 So then remayned to the Owner but 4 6 So the owner hath but 4s 0 And if in case the Contract makes Tobacco to yeald Lesse by—3d ? pound. 3. pound sold at 3s ? pound yeald 9s Nowe the King hath of 3 pound one and the other 2 pounds sold at 2s yeald 6s the King had 3s But the King is to haue for Custome 1s then there remayned to the owner 6s Then there remaynes to the owner but 5s So this Tobacco formerly solde for 3s ? pound, wch was the highest price, and whereof but a verie litle quantity, this Contract yealdes lesse—6d ? pound. But for that 6d the Company by this Contract hath the sole sale and sole Importa?on, whereby vndoubtedly the price wilbe doubly raysed: so that this Contract bettereth the Company.

By Computatione and Confessione of the Indyans themselves we have slayne more of them this yeere, then hath been slayne before since the begininge of ye Colonie. Wheras in the begininge of your Lres by the Trewloue you pass soe heavie a Censure vppon us as yf we alone were guiltie, You may be pleased to Consider what instructions you haue formerly given us, to wynn the Indyans to us by A kinde entertayninge them in our howses, and yf it were possible to Cohabitt wth us, and how ympossible it is for any watch and warde to secure us against secrett Enemies yt live ?miscouslie amongst us, and are harbored in our bosomes, all Histories and your owne Dis- course may Sufficyently informe you. For the warninge given ye last yeere, some of us heere cann say nothinge vnto yt, but Sr: George yardley and mr Pountis them selves doe affirme, yt notice beeinge given by the Kinge of the Easterne shore of Apochaukeno his plott, at the takinge vpp of Powhatans bones at wch Ceremony great numbers of the Salvages were to be assembled to sett vppon every Plan- tatione of the Colonie, Sr. George yardley him selfe in ?sonne went to every Plantatione and tooke a generall muster of all the men and theire Armes, gaue straight Charge yt watch &amp; warde should bee kept every where, But Apochancono, earnestly denying1 1 Written over the word "denies." ye plott, and noe aparant proofe brought in, our people by degrees fell againe to theire ordinary watch not beeinge able to follow theire seuerall Labors and keepe soe strict a guarde, especyally beinnge seated in smalle ?ties, and at divers tymes havinge had many the like Alarumes wch cam to nothinge. Neither was it to be imagined yt vppon ye death of Nenemachanew, a man soe farr owt of the favor of Apochancono yt he sent worde to Sr. George. Yardley beinge then Gournor by his interpreter, yt for his ?te he could be contented his throte were Cutt, there w[ould] falle owte a generall breach, wee beinge intreatie wth him and offeringe to doe him Justice Accordinge to the Articles of the peace, yf vppon the takinge vpp of the dead bodies yt might appere yt Nenemachanew had noe hande in theire deaths wch was all yt Apochancon[o] required and ther vppon sent oute as he fainde to search for ye bodies, and in the mean tyme sent woorde yt the death of Nenemachanew beinge but one man should be noe occa- sione of the breach of ye peace, and yt the Skye should sooner falle then [ye] Peace be broken, one his ?te, and that he had given order to all his People to give us noe offence and desired the like from us.

The quittinge of soe many Plantations was absolutly necessarie, and wee more willinglie suffer a reprooff in ?servinge your people, then Com- endatione in their hazarde (in one wee will instance ye necessitie of all) by A muster taken of my Lady dales family, wch consisted of two and twentie wherof eight were boys, most of the men were new and vntrayned wth very little munitione, and but six peeces and one Armour amongst them, and 54 headd of Cattle, wch all those men were nott Sufficyent to guarde, except eyther the place or Industry of inclosure had given advantage. As for ye Irone Woorkes we had resolved to haue strengthned them wth all ye planters therabout?, yf soe many of ye princypall woorke men had not beene slayne, as in the opinione of mr Barkley and mr Southerne it was vtterlie ympossible to ?ceede in that woorke though wth ye asistance of the whole Colonie, neyther was it possible retaynige any more of ye plantations eyther to Draw a Competent force to revenge our selves vppon our eniemies, or to send abroade ?ties to ?cure Corne for our ?rnt reliefe, wch our reputa- tions and necessetie required, as may appeere by this, wheras by Comon consent, 300 were thought to bee the lest number to assault Apochancono him selfe, whose discomfiture, would proue ye dishartinge of the residew, vppon A generall vew taken, there could nott be levied aboue 180 men, wherof 80 at least were only serviceable for Caryinge of Corne, and yet these few Plantations wee helde, especyally by resone of the sickness of our people were left as weake, as was in any sorte Justifiable.

For our former wante of Corne, wee yt are latelie come can say nothinge, those yt were heere before, alleag[e] ye scant and bad ?visiones xxx §sent ouer§ wth new Comers, and that all Tenant? at halfes (the Colledge only excepted) were never able to feede themselves by theire labours three moneths in ye Yeere Wheras the ffree men generallie haue allways plentifully §prouided for themselues and others, and some of them haue§ effected more wth §their§ ?ticuler families, [then] the whole Colonie in that alleaged infancie; And yf this last disaster had not beefallen us wee should nott haue needed yt supplie of meale, for your great paynes and travell ?curinge wherof wee give you humble thanks, but we confes freely, yf we had knowne yt would haue cost you soe much trouble, wee would never haue writt for yt, and for ye future see yt they be ?vided for yt shall heerafter come over, we are Confident there wilbe noe cause To intreat your helpe for supplie of Corne or any other ?visone, fourther then voluntary Adventurer[s] will bringe in, wch shall never be intreted for us, seeinge by reasone of our great Crosses, wee haue nott beene enabled to our griefe, to make such speedie and full retourns for those adventures you haue ?cured as was expected. pag: 5 The maine Cause why retournes were not made for ye last yeers magazine, was because before the arivall of the warwick, most of the Tobacco in ye lande was solde and made Away to other shippinge that formerly arived, To whom you required our favors to be shewne in respect of theire lesse number of people Transported then vsuall, soe as of necessitie your factor must haue kept yr goods dead vppone his handes, or sell them to be paide this Cropp, Wherin, yf hee haue been denied any asistance from vs for Recoveringe his depts you might then soe bitterly Censure vs. Other helpe wee coulde nott giue him, beinge not at all acquainted wth ye ?ticularities of his busines, Besid?, there haue and doe come daylie into this lande soe many privatt Adventurs equallie Recom- ended vnto us, as five tymes ye Cropp of this yeere will nott satisfie, there beinge not made aboue three-score thowsand waight of Tobacco in the whole Collonie, and soe many privatt Adventures besid?, that except wee should deny fre[e] trade contrarie to ye equitie of your order, doe and will take Away much of our Tobacco though wee geeue noe warrant to them to recover it, Because many of their comodities as Sack? sweete meates and stronge Liquors, are soe acceptable to the people. Concerninge ye raisinge of Staple Comodities, our endevors therin and how farr, it was advanced before this disaster, you haue been formerly advised, how ernest our intentes are to ?secute them heerafter, Mr. Th?e: will more ?ticulerly informe you. The failinge of ye Irone woork? is much lamented by the whole Collony whose asistance they wanted nott, whiles it was in theyr power to asiste them, the state of wch woorke wee Referr to ye relatione of Mr. Maurice Barkley, who is now to retorne, by whom we will send you a list of ye names and ?fessions of the men, togeather wth a note of ye tooles and mate- rialls necessary for the reerectaige of that woorke.

The little experience wee hadd of mr Leake, made good your Comendations of him, and his death to us very greveous. fol [5a] Sr. William Nuce did not aboue two days surviue the readinge of his Pattent, Whose longe delay and sudden losse were to our great disadvan- tage, He brought wth him very few people, sicklie, ragged and altogether wthowt ?visione, his sudden death and great Depts, left his estate much intangled to our extraordinarie trouble. Mr. Treãor hath receaued abooke of accompts concerninge the Tobacco sent home for the fiftie youths sent in the dewtie, and the maides in the Jonathan, and Londone marchant, and of 2407 pownde of Tobacco sent home by the George, 1407? thereof was for ye Transportatione of nyne of the Cyttie boys, nyne maides and fower men: the residwe wth 20 barrells of Corne paide heere, was for ye rent of twentie boys of the Cyttie Boys the yeere past, wch was as much as you receaved for most of yor Tenants, wt the Tobacco comes shorte of makinge vpp the somme expended for the duetie boys and the maides, wee will doe our best, yt they who had them may make you Satisfactione. Concerninge the revenews of the Compenie, we suppose you haue fownd by your officers where the error is, we conceave yt yf you would be pleased to Chaunge the Conditione of Tenat? into servants for the future Supplies, and nott send over new officers meerly vnexperienced in the Countrey to comande them, who though they may be * * * * very sufficyent for much worthier ymployment, eyther martiall or Civill, are not soe fitt for ye overlookinge and directinge men in theire labours, in wch affayrs experience instructs more then any other Sufficyencie, That then your revenues might be greatly Improved. Capt Eache hath not yett vewed the place at Wariscoyks whether it be fitt for fortificati[on] or nott, when he hath, yf he shall find it fezable and will vndertake it, he shall haue our vtmost and best Asistance, as far as this yeers povertie will ?mitt, wch we will supplie in the next.

March, 1622/3 Manchester Papers, No. 318 Document in Public Record Office, London Autograph letter signed List of Records No. 415 Worthy Sr, be this my excuse, that I in particular write not to ye generalty: I haue nothinge wherewth to palliat there humors; who, I too well perceaue, will both iudge and condimne whatsoeuer succedes not to theire desires, wthout either enquiry of the truth or necessity of or actions. But we, whom the hand of heauen hath humbled, professe the inability of ye best Counsel[l] &amp; indeauors that are not supported by ye diuine assistance, neither haue theire assertions much trubled vs. yt are confirmed wth innocency and habituall patience. Sr Wi?m Nuce arrived here about the beginninge of October, wth a very few of weake and vnseruiceable people, ragged, and wth not aboue a forthnights prouision: some bound for 3 yeares, a few for 5, and most vppon wages of all his goods hee hath made a deede of guift to the owners of ye shippe for ye security of her hire, wch though they were sould at excessiue rates, would hardly discarge yt ingagement. Aftr his death 11 men were all that remained for the Company, whom for want of prouision I was enforced to sell. Three I sold to Captaine Wilcocks for 600 waight of Tobacco to bee paide this yeare but two of Them dyed before hee could get to his Plantation: two to Capt: Smyth for 400 waight, halfe to bee paide this yeare and halfe ye next, one to Capt: Tucker for an hundred in hand, and two more the next croppe if hee liued soe longe, and an other to Capt: Croshaw for 200 Fower yt were left one my handes, I was fayne to send to my owne plantation; two of these a little aftr ran away (I am afraide to ye Indians) and noe doubt the other two [2] would haue consorted wth theire companions if sicknes had not fettered them. For ye 5 men wch Sr Wi?m Nuce should haue deliuered me here, I was glad to take his page (dead before deliuered) &amp; an other little boy hardly worth theire victuals. But of all that came ouer wth him I haue sent you here inclosed a list of theire names and how they are disposed of. I haue receaued your booke of debts; in the gatheringe whereof there shall be noe fault in my indeauor: although I am affraid there bee little Tobacco left wch the Magazin hath not receaued, or the marchants &amp; seamen not gleaned for theire sackes &amp; stronge waters. 60000 waight beinge the most yt this yeares crop hath produced. As for ye Deuty Boyes, they thinke much to be brought to a backe reconinge: since they paid as much as was demaunded for th? &amp; receaued acquitances. Yet Sr George Yardly will pay the ouerplus for those wch he reserued to himselfe: the like offer was made by Capt. Wi?m Powell (who is now wth God) but yt they are not able at this time to dis- charge it. Sr George complaines not wthout cause who I beleiue hath lost this yeare two thirdes of his estate: &amp; to giue him his dew he hath behaued himselfe very nobly in ye seruice of ye Country to his great expenses. But what I can I will doe &amp; send you the accomptes by the Abigall. Concerninge ye Shipwrights (ye best proiecte for ye Country &amp; most profitable for ye Aduenturers) hath fayled wth ye rest in this generall decay: wherein, if you blame vs, you must blame the hand of God, that hath taken away Capt: Barwicke &amp; 6 or 7 of his principall §worke§ men. A hard man, yet not a little toutched in conscience that he hath conuerted the releif of his men to his particular benefit: But out of yt wch is his (whereof I haue [3] made a stay) satisfaction vppon proofe shalbe giuen. Those yt remaine shall imploy theire time to your best aduantage. The ill successe of ye glasse workes is allmost equall vnto this: first the coueringe of ye house, ere fully finished, was blowne downe, by a tempest noe sooner repaired but ye Indians came vppon vs, wch for a while deferd ye proceedinges. Then they built vp ye furnace, wch after one forthnight yt ye fire was put in, flew in peeces: yet ye wife of one of ye Italians (whom I haue now sent home, haueinge receaued many wounds from her husband at seuerall times, &amp; murder not otherwise to bee ?uented, for a more damned crew hell never vomited) reueald in her passion yt Vincentio crackt it wth a crow of iron: yet dare wee not punish theise desperat fellowes, least ye whole dessigne through theire stubbornesse should ?ish. The su?er cominge on, Capt: No§r§ton dyed wth all saueinge one of his seruants, &amp; hee nothinge worth: The Italians feel extremely sicke: yet recoueringe in ye beginninge of ye winter, I hyred some men for yt seruice, assisted th? wth mine owne, rebuilt the furnace, ingaged my selfe for prouisions for them, &amp; was in a mannr a seruant vnto them. The fier hath now beene six weekes in ye furnace, and yett nothinge effected. They complaine yt ye sand will not run. (though themselues made choise thereof, and likt it then well enought) &amp; now I am sendinge vp ye riuer to prouide th? wth better, if it bee to bee had. but I conceaue that they would gladly make the worke to appeare vnfeasable, yt they might by yt meanes be dismissed for England. Much hath beene my truble herein, and not a little my patience (f haueinge beene called rascall to my face for reprouinge them of theire ryot, negligence &amp; dissension) but, for the debt wch I am in, for theire sustentation I hope ye aduenturers will see it discharged. The silkewormeseede yt came in these last shipps, are well conditioned for the most ?t. I haue deliuered them to ye Frenchmen least they might miscarry out of our want of skill: but when ye [4] time of the yeare shall come, I will distribute of them to such as haue the most desire &amp; the best meanes to cherish them. Many Mulbery trees the last yeare were planted, &amp; many vines; but the later came to nothinge out of ye trouble of ye times, or want of art &amp; perhaps ye badness of ye cuttings: for they all grow on old stocks, and are yearely burnt downe by ye firyinge of ye woods: but the neglect of tendinge them I beleiue is ye cheife. Wherefore now wee haue taken an other order; that every plantation, (who are bonde vnto it by indenture) shall imploy§ale§ two acres of grounde, and imploy the sole labor of 2 men in yt busines, for ye terme of 7 yeares enlarginge ye same 2 acres more, wth a like increase of labore: in wch they are to build a large sto house of 2 storyes, well seiled, for silkewormes. by this meanes I hope this worke will goe really forwarde, &amp; ye better if good store of Spanish or French vines, may be sent vs. I haue hired a ship to cary ye Colledge men to theire plantation, wch is now vnder sayle, I pray god it succeede well; but I like not this strange- linge: &amp; if all had beene of my minde, I would rather haue disobayed your co?aunds, then subiected ye Collony to such disorder and hazards. For how is it possible to gouerne a people so dispersed; especially such as for ye most part are sent ouer? how can they repaire to diuine seruice, except euery plantation haue a Minister? how can wee raise soldiers to goe vppon the enimy or workemen for publique imploiments, wth out weakeninge them to much, or vndoeinge them by draweinge th? frõ their labors? whereas if wee had planted together wee could haue borne out one anothers labors, &amp; giuen both strength and beuty to ye Collony &amp; all though they goe forth in sufficient numbers, what certainety is there in yt, when ?haps 10 of 60 will not stand to theire health [5] and a number of them dye? whereof this yeare wee haue had a miserable experience. The other day a party went vp to seat on ye Kinge of Apo- matuckes townes, but before they could get thither, they were soe de- minished by death, and weakened by sickenes, that they were fayne to giue it ouer. Such a pestilent feuer rageth this winter amongst vs: neuer knowne before in Virginia, by the infected people yt came ouer in ye Abigall, who were poisened wth stinkinge bere all fallinge sike &amp; many dyinge; euery where dispersinge the contagion. The fore runninge Su?er hath bene alsoe deadly vnto vs; I for my part, haueinge lost 19 by sickenes &amp; 4 by ye Indians. You may ges in what a pore condition I am, but the extreame sickenesse I haue sufferde, the heart-breakinge to see the ill successe of your affayires, want of all thinges necessary for life, my debts in supplyinge youre scant prouisions, the Companyes not performeinge there contractes &amp; approatchinge pouerty, I shou[ld] esteeme as nothinge, if our incessant toyle &amp; best indeauors could but ?serue your good opinions: but since all wee can doe can purchase vs but vnde- seruerued infamy. Vltra Saromatas hinc libet fugere et glacialem Oceanum. wch is oft in my minde and all most in my resolution. It remaines yt somethinge I should write of Virginia, whereof (be not offended yt I speake ye truth) you know but little, &amp; wee not much more, (for what can be discouered wthout meanes, or wth such an handfull of people soe dispersed?) but this I must defer vntill a time of more leasure, beinge now wholy taken vp wth full fillinge of your co?aunds: wherefore I pray you excuse me to my particular freindes yt I write not vnto them. As for yr priuate affayres, I will make them myne owne, &amp; aduance them wth my best industry: but wth all aduize you, yt you aduenture not to much in ioynt stockes, nor in those proiectes wch ever fayle by ye death of ye co?aunder &amp; principall workemen; for ye life of one in euery family §faculty§ is not to be relied vppon: such is ye state of this country. As for or other crosses &amp; the comeinge soe far short of yr expectations, I had rather other should screch them, then yt they should proceede from my pen, but both you and wee must submitt orselues to ye iudgments of god, to whose protection I co?ende you, &amp; rest.

And it is nowe to be observed that these Propounders though their pretence in their wrighting be for the equall menaginge of the Contract, And although they have often in the courts very solemnly protested and vowed, that they were not against the Contract itselfe, yet when they came before the Lord Treasuror, they dismasked themselves, and unani- mously professed that they were against the very body of the contract: which sheweth, that these Articles can be noe other then Cavills, seeing their pretence is one way, and their intent another way. And before wee come to the answering of the perticuler Articles, wee are inforced to take excepcions unto the manner of propounding them. For it is necessarie to be knowne, that the Counsell, Comittees and Com- panies having first concluded on the Offices necessarie for the menaging of this Contract, as also of their rewardes by way of Sallarie (according to the fifte Article of the Contract): The Officers themselves were lastly chosen in both the Courts: and the burthen was imposed upon the chiefe of them, in a free and unanimous eleccion, contrary to their most earnest and often iterated desires. It is also further to be knowne, that by reason of these troubles, both the chiefe Officers and divers of the Comittees having voluntarily surrendred their places, and greatly importuned the Courts, to accept of their Surrenders; yet the same have beene refused, and they continued in their offices, much contrary to their wills, and most earnest suits, whereas contrariwise these Articles are propounded in that manner, as though the Officers had bin ambitious of this imployment, and conse- quently were to undertake it with all indignities. Then which noething can be more untrue and unjust. 1.To the first Article it is answered, that the matter therein conteyned is allready regulated in the Quarter Courts of bothe the Companies. And that the Officers or Agents of the companies have noe more to doe in the bringing in of the Varinaes Tobacco, then any other perticuler member that liste to adventure his stock therein: By which order of the said Quarter Courts, it is declared that the perticuler Adventurers for the said Varinaes Tobacco are to bring in the proporcion expressed by the Contract: the Bodies of the Companies bearing a tenth part with them. But in case of any misfortune by losse of their Tobacco without the default of the said Adventurers, they are not to be farther charged also with restitucion or recompence: but the same is to rest upon the whole body of the Companies, and consequently to be answered out of the Companies publique Stocks: and if these should not suffice, then out of the Stocks of the Generall Adventurers returned from the Plantations, as heretofore in like cases had beene usually done. 2.In the second Article, the Question is likewise resolved by bothe the Quarter Courts; vizt. that generally the Adventurers and Planters, both for price and payment, are to goe in equall lines: Neither of which are to be ordered or concluded by the officers, but by the Generall Courts them- selves; the matter being first seriously debated and prepared by the Comittees. And in favour of the poorer sorte of Planters, there have beene divers other wayes devised and resolved upon, by the generall consent of bothe the Courts; both for the advancing of their prices, and expediting of their payments. 3.To the third Article it is answered, that it is grounded wholy upon errors. An error it is, to conceave that the rating of charges, is in the power of the Officers: being reserved (as all other important matters) to the Generall Courts. An error it is, to thinke, that the labour of the Officers, consisteth wholy or chiefly in the matter of Sale: the well men- aging of the Contract extending itselfe in the difficulties thereof to a much larger Compasse. And lastly it is an error and misinformacion, to say that the Salaries amount unto five and twenty hundred poundes: whereas they come but to Seaventeene hundred poundes. But to the matter itselfe of this article, the answere is not difficult. For the charges to be imposed wilbe lighter or heavier according to the proporcion greater or lesser of Tobacco to be brought in, and that with this comfort both to Adventurers and Planters that the greatnes of the quantity will diminishe the perticuler charge; and the smallnes of the quantity will enhance the generall price. But whereas there is mencion made of the selling the Tobacco together, it is to be observed that the course thereof lately propounded, by these Objectors, is subject to Fraude and much wrong both to the Kinge and Companies: vizt. that certaine Undertakers, being members of the Companies, should rayse a greate Stock in money, to buy of all the Tobacco by way of whole Sale. For considering the courts in the vaca- cions are often times very thinne, and the Somer Ilandes Court by the Letters Pattents may consiste of Eighte persons onely: these Under- takers may easily attayne to be the greater parte of the Courts, and con- sequently may be both Buyers and Sellers at the same time. A feare not causeles, but grounded on former experience; whereby some of these Objectors have made themselves rich, by the great losse and detriment of the Adventurers and Companies. To the 4th Article the answere is, that the Court have allready ordered that the Custome and freight shalbe discharged by the Officers, who are to be secured from damage by the goodes in their custody. 5.To the 5 article it is likewise answered that the Courts with Generall consent (onely one dissenting) have taken full order for security both of goodes and money: which orders have beene read before the Lord Treas- uror, and wee suppose they are more exquisite for caution on all sides, then are used in anie other Company whatsoever, as at the making of them was openly acknowledged. The perticularities whereof are to long to be here sett downe: but are ready to be shewen to any that shall desire to see them. Whereunto wee may add a strict oath, which is to be administred to all the Officers of what degree soever, for just and equall dealing, both in keeping, preserving, selling and accompting for the goodes; as also in making the paymnts at such time as they shall growe due wherein the Officers also from time to time are to be directed by the Courts. 6.To the Sixte Article, it is answered, that by vertue of the Contract, the Proclamation mencioned was presently to come forth. But upon mocion from the Lord Treasuror, the Companies have consented, that it may be forborne till the Twentith of June: at which time the Lord Treasurer hath promised that it shalbe published. Of the performance of whose promise, though the Propounder here seeme to make soe great doubt; yet the Companies will make none at all: and therefore hold it unfitt to follow the Propounders stepps any further; in which it seemeth that jealousy hath outrun their duety. 7.To the Seaventh it is answered that the Officers are to be accomptable for all charges, if five and twenty hundreth poundes will serve, the re- mayne is to be restored. If more be necessary, that which wants must agayne be leavied. That the Officers out of their owne estates, should beare those uncertaine burthens, of desperate debts, suits in lawe, shrink- age and the like, is soe farr not onely from Equitie, but from all ordinarie reason, that they hope the Propounders themselves upon better consider- acion will retract the Question. 8.To the Eighte Article it is answered, that the case of meane Tobacco is much more difficult without this Contract, then with or under it. For the Twelve pence on the pound amounted to much more then the vallue of one entire halfe, not onely of the meaner, but also of the middle sort thereof as experience hath shewed. 9.To the Ninth Article, which layeth aspersions on the Officers' persons, the Answere is plaine. The two chiefe Officers were chosen by the Ballat- ing box with 65 votes for them, and not above five against them. The Eighte Comittees were chosen by ereccion of handes out of the nomber of Sixteene, named by the Courts to stand for the places: In which nomber of Sixteene, were divers of these objectors. The Companies made choise of them whome by experience they knewe to love the Plantations, and were fitt for the diversity of imployments incident to this busines: some of them being Merchantes, some Retaylors, some skilful in the Portes, and others such as by long continuance and attendance in the Courtes, were skilfull in the affaires of the Companies and Plantacions and withall large Adventurers. Of which Eighte, six have beene yearely chosen Comittees and Assistants for these Three yeares last past; neither any just excepcion can be taken to any of them by mindes unpossessed with partiallity or mallice, neither are the companies to be blamed in this or other their eleccions, if they have rather made choise to entrust their Goodes in the hands of men untainted for integritie and honesty, then in theires, whose wisdome hath beene for their owne perticular benefitt, who in their former menagements of Tobacco have reduced Seaven thow- sand poundes sterling to Fower thowsand poundes, and who never yet gave up any faire account of the Companie's goodes.

Doctour Wynston Sr It was my promise to write, as I remember, and you desire to heare from me, I perswade my selfe you thinke I will not dissemble, and I protest you are in the right: Now for true newes thus it is, the Indians are drawne of as farre, as a man can hurle a stone at twice, I make no question, but when the leaves are greene, they wilbee somewhat nearer, and now forsooth they would faine have peace, Conditionallie, that they may haue their Corne at Kiskiek, and Pamaunkok, that is Just at our back?, and when their Corne is readie, haue at yor bucklers you braue §Cow—§ Englishmen. I was with the Go?nour at James Cittie, and told both him, and the Councell that I came not ou9 to plant Tobacco, neither for my owne end?, although the Companie was at no Cost with me, but onelie bare passage, neither was I beholding to them for ought but love, yet if they pleased to accept of my seruice I would by the helpe of God, and a few hand? make them wearie of their lyues; this was well taken, and eu9ie one was perswaded I would bee as much or more then my word, presentlie ther was a warrant sent vp for men, and another downe, and all I demaunded was but 40, vi?t 30 small shott, and 10 men to secure the Boat?, but I feare now the Deuill is the hinderer, for this Caveat is put in, that if theis men should be slayne then the whole state were ou9thrown this Councell I doubt cometh from the right worthie Statesman, for his owne profit Sr George. for he well knoweth, that the Councell Careth not for him by reason of some foule matters, and now to salue vp that sore he will perhaps take the paynes to burne a few of their houses, eu9ie yeare like a Surgion, that wanteth meanes, to keepe one in hand 3 yeares, that maybee Cured in 3 quarters, or 3 monethes: Now I pray you Sr for my good will in sending you the truth, let me not haue blame by yor showing of yt. But you may ?haps say what will you write that you dare not Answear? Sr I dare avouch it to his face that dares Contrarie it, on equall Tearmes, but here you know a man may not, for hee is a Councellor and I a private man, so when God shall send me home againe, say not but I was readie and wilbe still for my King and Countries good. I rest: you may let Sr Jo: Brookes see it for he is also my deare ffreind.1 1 Written lengthwise in the margin. yors William Capps. 1623 [2] I pray you aske Capt: Butlers opynion of this matter, if you misdoubt myne, I could beleiue, if I thought it were possible for so wise a man to bee blinded, as I know our Gou9nour is, that Sr George had throwne a mist before his eyes, but I dare beleiue and say of him; behold an Israelite in whom is no guile, verilie wee were farely blest, and you haue obtayned by him yor desire, wch was that you might have a man to gou9ne like a Moyses, accepting no person, nor profit. Now Sr her'es another Deuill, you know amongst most men the old Prou9b is, Charitye first beginnes at home, take away one of my men, there's 2000. Plant? gone, that? 500 waight of Tobacco, yea and what shall this man doe, runne after the Indians? soft, I haue ?haps 10, perhaps 15, perhaps 20 men and am able to secure my owne Planta?on; how will they doe that are fewer? let them first be Crusht alitle, and then perhaps they will themselues make vp the Nomber for their owne safetie. Theis I doubt are the Cogita?ons of some of our worthier men, If ther bee anie such, I would God had their soules, and I their meanes. As I live if I had but men of my owne, I would never aske their helpe to destroye their Enimies. But how haue I behaued my selfe that might haue had offices, and furtherance in my office by my Lord, by Sr Thomas Gates, and Sr Thomas Dale, and alwaies refused it, by reason that was but to secure men that were to worke, at home? but God forgiue me I thinke the last massacre killed all our Countrie, besid? them they killed, they burst the heart of all the rest. Nowe I protest if this will not take effect, but that wee shall haue peace, I will forsweare eu9 bending my mind for publique good, and betake me to my owne [3] profit with some halfe a score men of my owne, and liue rooteinge in the earth like a hog, and reckon Tobacco ad vnguem by hundrethes, and quarters, and serue my owne turne on the Countrye, as other men doe, and when wee Come into England, wee'le tell what Act? wee haue done, in ventureing our lyues for smoke, like a Companie of Shepbeters as wee are Swoond?

This done the 5 Article was read (viztt) vnto wch Mr John ffarrer §Deputy§ answered, that true it was, that at what rates or prices what soeuer the good? of their Magazine was sold for §there§ they neuer receaued penny proffitt as yett, nor scare their Principall. Mr Edward? sayd that not long since he sent a little Magazine to the Iland?, &amp; yt some told him Mr E It was §being§ demaunded §likewise§ of the Com?, whither any of them did euer rate their Tobacco at ijs vj? a pound, it was generally denyed; diuers affirming that they neuer made 20? a pound of it here in England. And Mr Palmer sayd that he had §hauing§ asmuch Tobacco as stood him in xvj?, he protested he neuer made §of it§ xvjt?? of it In the end, this is for answere to this Article, it was agreed that this should be made §this was agreed vnto, that for rating§ of the Tobacco the Compa neuer did and that for the rate of 2s 6d the [3b] pound, they neuer made halfe the money of it. &amp; §yt§ for the good? they sent hither they neuer had any returnes back againe of scarce their Principall and the price of Tobacco for ready mony is but 12? or 18d the best in ye Iland? Next was read the 6 Art vizt wch Article was adiudged to be a dishonest accusa?on: &amp; that it is an impossibility to tax the Compa therewith wthout they canne shewe that euer the Compa made any such order; for will any man make the sonne paye the ffathers debt, if he leaues nothing wherewith to pay it, that was conceaued the a most vnconscionable thing: and for what serues the Gouernor there, but to see the children of the deceased educated &amp; brought vp in convenient education &amp; Liuing for food, apparell, &amp; all other necessaryes whatsoeuer? and therefore this was adiudged by the mr generally by ye whole Cort to be a most vniust accusa?on against the Company. Mr. Spurrowe sayd, that he hath §hauing§ a freind there in the Iland?, §he§ who saith; he will not lett his child come from thence, it is * * *1 1 So well (?). educated &amp; brought vp from for noe good, it ben §because it§ is soe well brought vp &amp; educated, hauing §and hath§ all things fitting &amp; necessary.

Sr Edw: Sandis ?d it was true that the Bayliffs &amp;c.

Ffirst the Planta?ons subsisting as yet by this Comoditie of Tobacco it is necessarie that some Prouision be made that the sale and vent thereof may be contynewed, and that the price may be kept vp at some such proportionable Rate as may yeald the Aduenturers and Planters reason- able proffitt And as it is necessarie for the good of the Planta?ons so likewise His Maties proffitt is carefullie to be regarded, whose casuall Reuenew by this Co?od- itie hath ben increased at least to 8 or 10 thowsand pounds ? An9: and may hereafter be much more: But if some tymelie Prouision be not made both his Maties Reuenew wilbe lost, and the Planta?ons (especiallie that of the So?er Iland?) in danger to be vtterlie ruyned, for 1.The Quantitie of Tobacco (by reason of the late excessiue planting thereof in the West Indies and in the new Planta?ons of Guiana and Brasil) is like to be so great that all these parts of Christendom wilbe glutted with it, and the price of Tobacco brought so lowe that in proba- bilitie it will not be worth so much a pound as His Matie hath now for Custome. 2.The Tobacco of those Countries, though not in wholesomnes yet in strength and tast and estima?on doth so farr excell ours of the English Planta?ons that if in His Maties dominions we can not find sale for it, our Tobacco will yeald nothing at all. Therefore for the setling be and aduancemt both of His Maties yearelie Reuenew and the good of the Planta?ons in Virginia and the So?er Ilands (wch are amongst many others most memorable works of His Maties happie gouermt) It is propounded That as the French King hath the Gabell of Salt in France: and the K: of Spaine the sole Merchandize both of Pepper and euen of this particular co?oditye of Tobacco in Spayne: So it would please his most Excellent Matie our Soueraigne to take the sole preemption of all the Tobacco of the English Plantations in Virginia and the S: Ilands: allowing the Aduenturers and Planters §within some conuenient tyme after they shall delyuer it at ye Port of London § 2s a pound for the worser sort (so yt it be merchantable) 2s 6d for the middle sort, and 3s a po: for the best: cleare of charge of fraight, Custome and Impost: only the Ad- uenturers and Planters to [beare] delyuer theyr when it sh This will giue full and uniuersall content to the Planters and Aduenturers, who must needs acknowledge it a worke of great grace and princely wisedom in his Matie so to prouide for them that they shalbe in better case then euer they we[re.] [2] And for securing His Maties yearelie b proffitt it may be managed that *Some able men may be conferrd wthall who will become the King? Mer- chant? for this Co?oditie and allow his Matie double the propor?on wch His Matie payes to for this Tobacco: so that the quantitie thereof exceed not 400 thowsand weight, wch is as much as the Plantations wilbe able to affoord, and these Kingdomes of England and Ireland vsuallie vent. Thus will His Maties Reuenew by this Co?oditie be raysed to fortie if not fiftie thowsand pounds ? Añ certaine and his Matie not one penny out of purse: *] Or if Mer- chants will not take so great a bargaine then may it be man- aged by some Co?issioners wholy for his Maties benefitt wch will much in- crease his the kings proffitt. And for incouragement of these ?chaunt? it is propounded that they may haue the sole power to licence the Retayling of this co?odity: And then for their owne securitie they may agree wth a convenient nomber in euery Citie, Towne, and §greate§ ?ishe to buy from of their hand? yearelie a propor?on of this Tobacco, at such Rates as the saied ?chants may be reasonable gayners, and such quantities as the ?chants shalbe sure to haue the whole co?oditie taken from them and dispersed into many hand?, and this is very feasible fro[m] for if none may §sell or§ retaile §Tobacco§ but such as shalbe licensed by the King? ?chant? they will find rather too many then too few that will in this kind deale wth them. 1.By this meanes the King? Proffitt is highlie increased. It is §And§ §2ly§ 2.His Matie euen in that respect (besid? his owne gracious disposition) deepelie ingaged in the welfare and Prosperitie of those Planta?ons that already euen by one Co?oditye affoord him as greate or phaps greater yearelie proffitt then all his Reuenew both certayn and Casuall in the Kingdom of Ireland doth come vnto wch yet is a potent and fruitefull Countrey §so large a Reuenew§. 3lieIn this course His Matie shall not need to inhibitt the importa?on of Spanish Tobacco, or by inhibiting th' importa?on of forrey[n] Tobacco, for if §also auoyd so much as a colourable occasion of giuing offence to His Maties Allyes abroad§ 3lieThe excesseue stealing in of §forreyn§ Tobacco into this Kingdom wilbe §hereby§ auoyded and the charge of strict search for it in the Portes saued, for euery Retaylor will in his case be an Informer because it will hinder his both his owne and his fellowes proffitt: And for their better incouragemt they may haue the Moyetie of all such Tobacco as they shall discouer to be brought in and acquired by fraud §in any other sort then as is formerlie propounded. 4lieIt wilbe§l§ §tend to the general§ §generally§ good §o§for this kingdom both by restrayning thexcessiue expence of Bullion wch was wont to be wasted layed out in forreyne ?tes for [3] this comoditie to the great dimi- nu?on of the Treasure of this kingdom 2ly it will §And secondly by§ mayntein §ing§ a trade and co?erce betweene theis kingdoms and those new acquired Countreyes of Virginia and the S.

And thirdlie by regulating the g this way of managing the sale of Tobacco if it be ordered so, that the last price of the best Tobacco exceed not ten or xj shilling? will as it very well may then hath doth the Subiect buy it at a better rate then euer he hath done heretofore.

Reasons offered to the Privy Council against Sir Edwin Sandys's Contract and Joint Stock for the Virginia and Somers Islands Tobacco March 20, 1622/31 1 The date given in Sainsbury is March 20, 1623/4. On the manuscript, the date is indorsed in the same hand as the document, March 20, 1622, and in another later hand March 20, 1623. Another copy, without date, is No. 6163 of Lord Sackville's manuscripts at Knole Park, and is printed, under the heading "Argument against the Contract," in the American Historical Review, XXVII, pp. 754–757. C. O. 1, Vol. III, No. 10 Document in Public Record Office, London List of Records No. 424 Sund §r§y Reasons against the Contract and Joynt stocke for the Virginia and summer Island? Tobacco. 1.The Contract besides Custome and charges is to yeald his matie one third part of the good? in kind, wch third part (by reason the Condi?on of this yeares Tobacco falles out to bee meane and littleworth) will disappoint his matie in point of profit And the other two third? being of like bad Condition (all charges deducted) there wilbee litle or nothing remayneing for the Adventurers and Planters 2.The greate quantitie and meane Condition of the Virginia and summer Island? Tobacco is such as for the most parte it must bee exported at easie rates into Turkie Barbarie and other forreine part? Which by the charge of this Contract is impossible without great damage and losse to the owners. 3.The heauie charge laid vpon Tobacco by this Contract will occasion the transporta?on thereof from the Planta?ons into forreine part? and not into Englande, whereby his matie wilbe a great looser and the Companie much damnified nay it is to bee feared that the people in the summer Island? will growe altogeather idle haueing nothing else to raise profit by and then povertie and want may driue them to revolte and so his matie loose the strongest knowne forte in §the§ Christiandome world tending both to the safetie of this kingdome and acquisition of that other of Vir- ginia to the wch it serues instead of an impregnable forte 4.No such Contract as this can bee made but by the Joynt Consent of all the Adventurers and Planters whereof not one of ten haue giuen their [2] Consent and manie of those that consented conceiued themselues inforct vnto it but being since better acquainted with his mat? most free and gracious inten?on doe now humblie declare their disassent therevnto conceiveing that this Contract cannot be proceeded in without extreame Iniustice and forfeiture of our Charters by wch wee are to governe our affaires according to the Lawes of England that doe not allow the good Subiect to bee dispossessed of his good? without his Consent And wee doe humblie pray that the Act of a fewe and such as are least interessed in point of charge, and therefore doe not feele the waight of the burthen wch they lay vpon other men may not preiudice the whole Companie. 5.The rate for exporteing of people to the Plantation was wont to bee fiue or sixe pound a head to bee paid in Tobacco but by this Contract the rate will growe to bee ten or twelue pound at least; the owners forecasting that the Tobacco wch they shall take for freight of the Passengers wilbee more then twice dearer vnto them §then§ in former times And soe by that meanes will extreamelie hinder the Peopleing of the Plantations when passengers cannot but at such extreame rates bee transported thither 6.The sole importa?on of Spanish Tobacco is a part and cheife Considera- tion of this Contract by which importa?on not the Companies but priuate men that make the stocke shall receiue the benifit; And therefore [3] noe cause why in that respect the good? of the Adventurers and Planters should bee charged by this contracte. 7.It is a thing of great daunger and hazard for particuler mens estates to bee ingaged to his Matie by the seales of the Companie for the per- formance of so great a Contract wch may breede questions and lie as a perpetuall charge and Incumbrance vpon the persons good? and land? of them and their heyres that are free of the said Companies yea although they neuer receiued one pennie benifit by their freedome. 8.A single Planter doth raise at the most but 30 pound wight of To- bacco in the Summer Island? in one yeare for his owne part whereof one third by the Contract is to goe to his nother third imatie, an ordinarie charges besides Salary, and so rest? scarce ten pound wight to the poore Labourer not worth in all aboue one pound fiue shillings for his whole yeares paines and euen out of this 25s being the labour of the whole yeare hee is by the Contract to allowe double salarie wch may take away all the rest and leaue him nothing at all; And the Adventurers are in the same case soe as appareantlie the planta?on wilbee ouerthrowne if this Contract doe proceede. Neither Will the monopolizeing of Tobacco into one hand anie waies better this bargaine but rather make it worse for 1.If by that meanes they suppose to raise the price and to sell it dearer that wilbe the next way to cause such an importa?on by stealth (as was seene in peppar when the like course was taken) as that owr Tobacco will lie vnvented till it rott and perish, and the charge of keepeing §the§ Port? to prevent it wilbee in likelihood more then the good? are Worth. [4] 2.It were a dangerous President and neuer heard of that pluralitie of voices should conclude the good? of other men without their Consent to bee put into a Joynt stocke at the comeing home of the shipp whereas the Aduenture outward was by particuler men not in Joynt stocke wch if it shalbee admitted to take place wilbee the vtter ruyne and destruction of all trade and Commerce. 3.It occasions a straunge charge of a yearelie stipend or off Salarie to Officers to mannage this Joynt stocke wch the Companies are not able to beare and yet by votes of such as are least interessed and of those men themselues who are to receiue it, was caried by pluralitie of voices. 4.By this meanes his matie wilbee charged with 8 or 900li per Anñ cer- taine for his third part of this salarie and how much more Wee know not so that perhaps his matie charge wilbee more then his whole third part of this meane Tobacco will come vnto. 5.It hinders the poore people from trucking away their Tobacco for Comodities by wch heretofore they haue releiued themselues and made a greater benifit then euer they could doe by selling for readie money. 6.It bereaues both Planters and Owners of present meanes to supplie their shares seeing they must attend the sale and Accompt of the Joynt stocke. It subject? them to great hazard by ill debt? 8.It involues them in intricate Accompt? and is like to occasion infinite suit? and Conten?ons and will breede much cõnfusion in the sale of their good? for in this Comoditie one mans parcell of Tobacco is much better then another and either it must bee sold with theires of lesse value and soe a losse to the Owner and generall discouragement to make their To- bacco good or else if euerie mans bee kept apart wee must rest [5] vpon the good will of the Agent? when this or that mans parcell shalbee sold. 9.The experience of the losses and inconveniences wch haue growne by all other Joynt stockes is sufficient to deterre men from this course and wee hope his Matie will not permit that anie man should §all§ bee forced to it whether hee will or noe. Wee conceive this buisines wilbee better mannaged if it will please his matie to limit the Importa?on of Spanish Tobacco to a reasonable propor- ?on as alreadie he hath done and to graunt the farme thereof to whom his matie shall please for his owne best benifit And then (reserueing onelie that proportion of Spanish Tobacco) to inhibite the importa?on of all other saue that wch shalbee brought in from theis Planta?ons, and that euerie Aduenturer and planter may receiue and dispose of his owne good? for his best aduantage, and wee shall humblie submit orselues to his mat? gracious pleasure for such a Custome to bee layd vpon owr good? as may incourage all the Planters and Owners to import all the Tobacco that shalbee made both in Virginia and the Summer Island? into this Realme of England and not otherwhere, wch as it would increase and aduance the planta?ons so the quantities that wilbee brought in wilbee so great that wee conceiue his mat? yearelie profit wilbee much greater this way then the other how specious so euer, and it is hoped it will prosper much better because it wilbee accompanied with the willing and heartie affections of those that pay it. [6] And wee humblie pray that in the layeing on of this this Custome his matie will haue a speciall regard to ease the Tobacco of the Summer Island?. 1.Because it is a place of great importance and therefore very behoouefull to giue that Colonie content and to provide for their supplies. 2.This poore planta?on hath had no helpes of Lotteries Collections and other Assistances as that of Virginia hath had 3.because the Tobacco of the Summer Island? generallie is of a meaner sorte then that of Virginia and this yeare so bad that it is little worth. 4.By his mat? ?res patent? they are to paye but 5li ? C. for all Charges whatsoeuer. 5.Because it is rather a forte then a Country able to produce staple Comodityes as that of Virginia and so hath no other meanes but by this poore Weede to subsist 6.Because those of the Summer Island? Companie that are to beare the burthen of this charge are very few and no meanes to mantaine the publique charge of those Island? but out of their purses wch euery yeare cost? them manie thousand pound? and yet they are Comforted with the assureance of his mat? gracious respect for their good seruice in acquireing and mantayneing a place of so great Consequence without anie Charge to his matie though to the great ?iudice and vndooeing of some of their owne particuler fortunes vnles his matie take a speciall regard of them ther being twentie of them that at least are out of their purses twentie Thowsand pound? in this Plantation.

Oh they bee verie godlie folkes, and loue me verie well, and will doe anie thing for me, and he much marvailed that you would send me a servaunt to the Companie, he saith I had beene better knocked on the head, and Indeede so I fynd it now to my greate greife and miserie, and saith, that if you love me you will redeeme me suddenlie, for wch I doe Intreate and begg, and if you cannot get the marchaunt? to redeeme me for some litle money [3] then for God? sake geta a gathering or intreat some good folk? to lay out some little Su? of moneye, in meale, and Cheese and butter, and beife, anie eating meate will yeald great profit, oile and vyniger is verie good, but ffather ther is greate losse in leakinge, but for God? sake send beife and Cheese and butter or the more of one sort and none of another, but if you send Cheese it must bee very old Cheese, and at the Chesmongers you may buy good Cheese for twopence farthing or halfepenny that will be liked verie well, but if you send Cheese you must haue a Care how you packe it in barrells, and you must put Coopers Chips betweene eu9ie Cheese, or els the heat of the hold will rott them, and looke whatsoeu9 you send me be it neu9 so much looke what I make of yt I will deale trulie with you I will send it ou9, and begg the profit to redeeme me, and if I die before it Come I haue intreated Goodman Jackson to send you the worth of it, who hath promised he will; If you send you must direct yor letters to Goodman Jackson, at James Towne a Gunsmith.

So vale in Christo. Loueing ffather I pray you to vse this man verie exceeding kindly for he hath done much for me, both on my Journy and since, I intreate you not to forget me, but by anie meanes redeeme me, for this day wee heare that there is 26 of English men slayne by the Indians, and they haue taken a Pinnace of Mr Pountis, and haue gotten peeces, Armour, sword?, all thinges fitt for Warre, so that they may now steale vpon vs and wee Cannot know them from English, till it is too late, that they bee vpon vs, [and wee Cannot knowe them from English, till it is too late, that they bee vpon vs,] [sic] and then ther is no mercie, therefore if you loue or respect me, as yor Child release me from this bondage, and saue my life, now you may saue me, or let me bee slayne, with Infidelle, aske this man, he knoweth that all is true and Just that I say here; if you do redeeme me the Companie must send for me to my Mr Harrod for so is this Mrs name. Apr: the 2 day Yor loueing sonne Richard Ffrethorne Moreou9 on the third day of Aprill wee heard that after theis Rogues had gotten the Pynnace, and had taken all furnitures as peeces, sword?, armour, Coat? of male, Powder, shot and all the thinges that they had to trade withall, they killed the Captaine, and Cut of his head, and rowing with the taile of the boat formost they set vp a pole and put the Captaines head vpon it, and so rowed home, then the Deuill set them on againe, so that they furnished about 200 Canoes with aboue 1000 Indians, and came and thought to [5] haue taken the shipp, but shee was too quicke for them wch thing was very much talked of, for they alwayes feared a ship, but now the Rogues growe verie bold, and can vse peeces, some of them, as well or better then an Englishman, ffor an Indian did shoote with Mr Charles my Mrs Kindsman at a marke of white paper, and hee hit it at the first, but Mr Charles Could not hit it, But see the Enuie of theis slaues, for when they Could not take the ship then or men saw them threaten Accomack that is the next Planta?on and nowe ther is no Way but starueing ffor the Gou9nour told vs and Sr George, that except the Seaflower come in or that wee can fall foule of theis Rogues and get some Corne from them, aboue halfe the land will surelie be starved, for they had no Crop last yeare by reason of theis Rogues, so that wee haue no Corne but as ships do releiue vs, nor wee shall hardlie haue anie Crop this yeare, and Wee are as like to perish first as anie Planta?on, for wee haue but two Hogshead? of meale left to serue vs this two Monethes, if the Seaflower doe stay so long before shee come in, and that meale is but 3 Week? bread for vs, at a loafe for 4 about the bignes of a pennie loafe in England, that is but a halfepenny loafe a day for a man: is it not straunge to me thinke you? but What will it bee when wee shall goe a mo§n §eth or two and never see a bit of bread. as my Mr doth say Wee must doe, and he said hee is not able to keepe vs all, then wee shalbe turned vp to the land and eate bark? of trees, or mould? of the Ground therefore with weeping teares I beg of you to helpe me. O that you did see may daylie and hourelie sighes, grones, and teares, and thumpes that I afford mine owne brest, and rue and Curse the time of my birth with holy Job. I thought no head had beene able to hold so much water as hath and doth dailie flow from mine eyes. [6] But this is Certaine I neu9 felt the want of ffather and mother till now, but now deare ffrend? full well I knowe and rue it although it were too late before before I knew it.

March 28, 1623 Manchester Papers, No. 319 Document in Public Record Office, London List of Records No. 427 Noble Sr I am almost ashamed that I haue left yor ?re vnanswered thus longe: but a bodie languishinge, well nigh vnto death, and a mynd distracted and broken with ill successes here, and hard Censures at home haue disabled me from all dutyes but those wch necessitie inforceth. But now I thanke God, I haue recovered my health, and a litle cured my thought? with the balme of my Innocencie resolving to strive against theis Torrent? of difficultyes till I passe them over, or bee swallowed vp by them: rather in that I wilbe Constant to my Course, then out of anie hope to gaine reputa?on or satisfie your Concep?ons. For their affections to this Plan- ta?on hath so ou9 hightned eu9ie thinge that it is impossible for our Indevours to give it that lustre, wch must need? redound to the disgrace of vs, and will, I feare, to the preiudice of the Collonie. I would to God that some one of Judgment and Integritie whom you trusted might bee sent ou9 to give you a true Informa?on of our proceeding? and the State of this Countrye. If then it be found that Wee are faultie let the Censure and punishment light vpon the ill deserver: for my owne part I will desire no favour. But if our want of meanes haue frustrated yor hopes, or the hand of God, by extreame sicknes, and vnheard of mortalitie hath pre- vented our Indevours, or if wee haue beene inforced by some of yor Instruc- tions to goe Contrarie to or Judgment?? If wee should imploy our owne or the Serveant? of others (wch would never bee endured) for future expecta- ?ons; how in the meane time shall they be fed and Clothed or how shall wee give a satisfaction to their maisters? It is not a small propor?on of Corne that will feed a man, when that is his onelie sustenance. Had you no other provisions in England perhaps the land were too litle to sustaine her Inhabitant?. and for apparrell I will giue to the Magazine 10?i sterling a yeare (as the rates here goe) for the Clothing of each particuler Servaunt. for eu9ie labourer wee giue one Pound of Tobacco a daye, besid? his diet and 3 or 4 §a day§ to Artificers. from whence shall theis payment? arise? moreou9 so manie come ou9 without anie provision, and those you set out yorselues so furnished to halues (a maine Cause of their debt? and deathes and of yor small retournes) that they make a dearth of a plentifull harvest. I protest for my owne part if I knew how to defraie the expences of the yeare, I would not set one plant of Tobacco whilst I lived in this Countrie: so much I loath it and onelie desire that I Could subsist without it. Now if anie will vpraid vs with the successe of this yeare, let them takeheed least they manifest [2] not themselves to bee of the race of those Gyant? wch made warre with heaven; for who is ignorant how the heavie hand of God hath suppressed vs? the lyveing being hardlie able to bury the dead through their owne Imbecillitie, insomuch as I am afraid wee haue not lost lesse than 500 by sicknes (with a generall weaknes of the rest) wch taken out of so small a number (farre short of yor Coniectures) I belieue haue not left behind them so manie able men in the Countrye. And by the way I would you Could hang that villaine Dupper who with his stinking beere hath poisoned most of the Passengers, and spred the Infection all over the Collonie wch before the Arrivall of the Abigall were recou9ed. lastlie, whereas it was the onelye benifit wch wee reapt from the treacherie of the Indians in drawing ourselues into a narrower Circuite, whereby the people might haue beene better gou9ned, and lived with more Comfort and securitie, publique Charges more easilie defraied, forces raised with lesse difficultie, and hazard to the Remaynder, townes in short time would haue beene forfeited, framed houses erected, Orchards planted, and ground? impailed for the keeping of Cattle, staple Comodities the better aduanced, strength, beautie, pleasure, riches and reputa?on added forthwith to the Collonie: by yor Comaunding vs to dispearse wee are like quicksilu9 throwne into the fire and hardlie to bee found in so vast a distance. But I can but giue you a touch of theis thinges wch perhaps were better vnwritten then not written to the full. If God spare me life I will write a particuler discourse of this Countrie, the hindrances to the Planta?on and waies to aduance it, with an answeare vnto Calumny meane while I referre you to others for other particulers, and will now addresse my replie to yor letter. ?that some may be sent over truly to informe of the ?ceedings there? ?The officers in Virginia by instructions from hence enforced to goe against theyr Judgments.? ?Corne is their only sustenance.? ?Apparell? ?Complaynt ye too many come over and those ill prouided? ?The lyuing hard- ly able to bury the dead 500 dyed by sickness not 500 able men left? ?Dupper? ?The benefitts of drawing the Colo- ny together? ?much damnifyed by dispersing then vpon Comd of ye Company? If I could be proud yor Censure had so made me for that slothful worke wch I was ashamed to ffather. Notwithstanding it begat a desire to pro- ceede: but heare my owne Author. —nec plura sinit tempus? pudor? Dicere maius opus magni certaminis vrget. Yet amongst the roreing of the seas, the rustling of the Shrowd?, and Clamour of Saylers, I translated two bookes, and will perhaps when the sweltring heat of the day confines me to my Chamber give a further assaye. for wch if I be taxt I haue noe other excuse but that it was the recrea?on of my idle howers, and say with Alciat.

[3] As for dubius accusa?ons, Custome and the meanes of the man hath made me insensible of such Injuries but more ignoble was that, though pro- ceeding from a nobler Person who said wee held not our selues secure with- out the guard of a Thowsand men: when it is well knowne, that I receiued not one man in to my Planta?on though I had at sometymes not five that were able to beare Armes, and for the Gou9nour I my selfe was an Eye witnes, that the Councellors themselues were Constrayned to watch nightlie by turnes, vntill the Countrie allowed him a Guard of thirtie. for whose intertaignment he is yet vnsatisfied. O what a lying deuill is a mallice! And nowe alitle to degresse (for I write as thinges Come into my mynd and expect from so worthie a freind as you are a Pardon of Errours, since I haue not the leazure to read ou9 what I haue written) what a flagitious offence was that in vs to fetch of men from their dividend? who had neither food nor Muni?on nor in Nomber able to defend them- selues in the Cultivateing of the earth, or guard of their Cattle, all being slaine about them and wee vnable to supplie anie one of their want? without the ruyne of others! must they not haue beene left of necessitie a pray either to slaughter or famyne? or how would their weakenes have indured the want of their ablest men to haue gonne vpon the Indians, when out of the whole Collonie wee Could but raise 180 (whereof 80 were fit onelie to Carrie burthens) to incounter 1000? wch had put all in hazard if God had not taken their heart? from them: though as valiant as lyons against one another, and as skilfull in their bowes as the Beniamites with their slinges; haueing manie peeces besides, with Powder and Shott, and knoweing too well how to vse them, how §am§ I touched in particuler about that ignominious proposi?on of removeinge to the Easterne Shore, when I onelie related the Argument?, and nomynated the Author, And although the Gou9nour and my selfe gaue way that the place might be survaid for the planting of a Partie there as better furnished with all sort? of prouisions and fit there- after for fortifica?on: yet neu9 was it so much in or Thought? (though manie ranne violentlie that waye) to quit the places wch wee held and I for my part would first haue beene torne in peeces. But I wilbe more warie hereafter what I write. ?Ignoble speach of a noble man? ?But 180 men able to incounter the Enemye whereof 80 were fitt only to carry burthens? I vsed Mr Calthrope at his landinge with all the Curtesie I Could and brought him acquainted with the Gou9nour. I proferd him the Enter- tainment of my house, and my owne Chamber to lodge in [4] wch he refused in that I was to bee but seldome there my selfe, in regard of my almost dailie attendance at the Councell table (for besid? our owne part?, wee are faine to discharge the Offices of others: if Mr Secretarie had beene good for anie thing wee would never have suffred him to haue gon home, and what a pittifull Councellour haue wee of yor Doctour!) I haue giuen from time to time the best Councell I am able. At the first he kept Companie too much with the Inferiours, who hung vpon him while his good liquor lasted, after he Consorted with Captaine Whitacres (a man of no good example) with whom he is gone into Kicotan, yet wheresoeuer he bee, he shall not been without the reach of my Care, nor want for anie thing that I or my Credit can procure him.

Manchester Papers, No. 321 Document in Public Record Office, London List of Records No. 430 Sr It is a Curtisie that add? not a litle to those manie wch I haue received from you, that you vouchsafe to remember the so farre distant. A hope- full begynneing we had in this Countrie, yet seconded with all the Calami- ties wherwith God vseth to scourge a disobedient people, as murder, dead by diseases, and scarcitie almost vnto famyne. Yet the first had been a reforma?on, had wee beene suffred to haue made the true vse of it. for the English throughout this wild Countrye, planted dispersedlie in small familyes, far from Neighbours, as Covetous of large po?sions (larger then 100 tymes their Nomber were able to Cultivate) and to lyue like Libertines out of the eye of the Magistrate, not able to secure them- selues, nor to been releiued by others, vpon anie occasion, insomuch as if they had had anie knowledge of the purpose of the Indians, the most part Could not possiblie haue preuented their treacheries: but must either haue beene beseiged in their houses (and Consequentlie famished) or Cut of as they followed their labours. Vpon this occasion wee drew the remainder Close together, whereby they might haue beene the better gou9ned, and haue added to their lyues both Comfort and securitie presentlie wee should haue begunne to fortifie Townes, to haue built framed houses, to haue planted hortyard? and gardens to haue inclosed ground for or Cattle, and set vpon more reall Comodities, by wch the Collony in short time would haue growne strong, beautiful, pleasant rich and reputable But such is the disposi?on of those who glorie in their wisedomes, that they will rather Justifie and proceed in their Errors then to suffer a supposed dis- grace by reformeing them; So that wee are Comaunded to suffer eu9ie man to retourne to his [2] divident, though in some stronger fashion and haue our discre?ons and Courages Censured for doeing that wch they should have begunne with, Who cleare themselues by the wronginge of others; obiecting vnto vs their Instructions, whereof manie are infeasible and the most Inconvenient, for to say the truth they knowe nothing of Virginia, nor will beleiue anie thing from vs that is not answereable to their former Con- cep?ons. But if eu9 they will doe anie good they must admit of our In- forma?ons, and suffer ther Instruc?ons, for the most part, to bee rather advices then Commaund?. Extreame hath beene the mortalitie of this yeare, wch I am afraid hath dobled the Nomber of those wch were massacred; yet with our small and sicklie forces we haue discomforted the Indians, round about vs, burnt their houses, gathered their Corne and slaine not a few; though they are as swift as Roebuck? and not to bee destroyed but by surprize or famine they now beginne to desire a peace, and after the restitu?on of their Prisoners, for whose sakes wee seeme to bee inclineable thereunto and will trie if wee can make them as secure as wee were, that wee may followe their example in destroying them Although in particuler I haue not suffred much by the Indians, yet haue I lost by sicknes 23 men of my small Nomber to the greate diminu?on of my meanes, and impaire of my last yeares profit, and had I not hired in good time the sixth part of a ship (wch Cost me aboue 140?i for my share) I and the rest of my men had harld hardlie [3] escaped the perishing by famyne. ffor all theis disasters I have sent home as much as will pay that Sum; discharge 100? wch I owe vnto them who haue my Cropp in their po?sion, with 50 more wch my Cozen Myles stand? bound for, and to furnish me with necessityes in some poore sorte, for the yeare ensewinge, I onelie ?sume of yor fauour, in that I cannot possiblie th at this time in regard of my great losses and unexpected vnexpences doe otherwise, to deferre the payment of that 100?

Letter to Sir Samuel Sandys March 30, 1623 Manchester Papers, No. 320 Document in Public Record Office, London List of Records No. 429 Sr I humblie crave yor pardon if I have not written §vnto you§ so often as you expected, and my dutie bound me: presumeinge that the Governour had acquainted you with whatsoeu9 was worthie your knowledge: We found at our Comeing over the Country in peace, but in such a peace as presaged ruyne: the people dispearsed in small familyes, farre distant one from another, and like the foolish Arcadians, exposed to the pray of who- soeu9 would assaile them, yet Could wee not reforme this mischeife, they haueing Pattent? granted from the Court in England to plant wheresoeu9 they pleased contrarie to all order, discipline, and Example: but how well wee beganne to build (though impossible to Continew) on this prescribed founda?on I coniecture is not unknowne vnto you; Neither could the Trecherie of the Indians (although foreknowne) have beene but in part prevented: who like violent lightening are gone as soone as ?ceived. Yet are we taxed with indiscre?on and Cowardize for draweinge theis miserable people to places of securitie; Who had neither victuall nor muni?on (nor Could wee helpe them wth either) nor of strength to defend themselves: so that of necessitie they must have perished either by the Enimye, or famyne. But men that are ambitious to bee Counted wise will rather Justifie then acknowledge their Errors and impute the fault to the execu?on, when it is indeed in the proiect. Wee held not our selves secure said an ignoble Noble man vnles wee had 1000 Souldiers to guard vs; what a strict affynitie is there betweene the divell and a lyer! for my owne part I receaued not a man into my Planta?on although at one time I was so weake that I could not arme 5 able men: and for the Governour, the Councellors themselves were con- strayned to watch nightlie by turnes vntill the Countrye allowed him a guard of 30 men. Sr Edwin writes that strucke with a Panicke feare wee proposed a Removeall of the Collonie to the Easterne shore. Indeed I writt home of such a proposi?on and named the Proposor with his Argu- ment? which were hotlie mantayned by others, (and no question but [2] that place had beene better, at the first, to have seated on, in regard of fertilitie, Convenience, all sorts of provision and strength both against the Native and fforreiner) yet theis were refuted by vs in point? of Reputa?on, being besid?, as wee alledged, an intollerable presumption for vs to attempt such a Change without your Consent?: howsover wee thought it fitt that the place should bee further survaied, and a Partie there seated, and this is that treason against God and man, for wch wee deserve to bee hanged.

The Gouernor stood at that tyme for a Cypher whilest they stood ripping open or gutts: Captaine Newce he cutts our throate on the other side and he letts in th' Indians, and that while the other prouides to kill all the swyne as it were of sett purpose to ou9throw all: and who must make this good againe? The old smoker our (I know not how to terme him but) Gouernor, so good so carefull mild, Religious, iust, honest that I protest God I thinke God hath sent him in mercie for good to vs, he vndergoeth all your cares &amp; ours, and I feare not but god will bless him in all his ?ceeding? but who must be th' Instrument to make all this whole againe? Why Capps: all voyces can sett him forth about these businesses: But who must pay him his hyer?

I pray good Sr take these few lynes and ?use them well for these are dangers that may be auoyded: I meane the vnhealthines at Sea, and worse when it comes a shoare The first cause is for want of cleaneliness, for betwixt the decks there can hardlie a man fetch his breath by reason there ariseth such a ffunke in the night that it causeth putrifaction of bloud &amp; breedeth a disease much like the plague: the more fall sick the more they annoy and poyson their ffel- lowes the wch may be preuented by care had by you: Ffor I remember when I was in the voyage wth Sr Tho?s Gates and Sr George So?ers: We came in heate of So?er &amp; were at sea fifteene Weekes &amp; lost not a man and farr southerlie wch was indeed the great m9cie of God, &amp; the meanes of health was not neglected, wch were these: By that tyme we had layd our owne latitude &amp; raysed 2 or 3 degrees to the Southward they appointed that euery man should haue halfe a Biskett Cake and halfe a small Can of Beare euery morning: Then were appointed swobbers for the cleansing of the Orlopp and euery part of the Ship below: Then euery man was forced in faire Weather to bring vp his Bed to ayre in the shrowdes: In the meane tyme the quarter Masters were busied in the swobbing of euery cabbine belowe wth Vinigar as also betweene Decks wch cast such a sauor of sharpnes to the Stomach that it bred health.

S. tyme: Nor no diuisions of land. Ans.There were many diuisions of land made: but true it is the Colony was not so scattered as since. And for the Seale then that wch was then vsed was the Seale made for the Counsell of Virg by his Mates own appointmt. 6That though there were ensamples of ii staple Co?odityes in the 10th yeare of his go?nt yet in the 12 y. of his gou9nt only Tobacco &amp; Sassafras.

Answ[2] There were lawes for the Company there. And none for the Colony since but where made then. 8There was a generall neglect in his officers: Mr Cañing and Alderman Johnson who neu9 cleared his Accompt §but wronged the Company of Answ300li in fauor of the Magazin.§ and good? bought at excessiue Rate And the lists of mens names and of the ?res writt to &amp; from Virginia not care- fully kept And that Alderman Johnson in a discourse of his to a priuate freind did disco?end the Countrey.

Thus much for neglects in Sr T. S. tyme. Now for 3 matters of a high nature. That his Maties Instructions first giuen for gou9mt were not obserued, nor so much as published. 1 He did follow thinstructions: And gaue Coppies thereof to the President &amp; Counsell first established: And they were engrossed fairely in a Book as a Record.

Answ. That Sir T. Smith suffered a Booke of lawes for gou9mt of the Colony chiefely extracted out of the lawes for gou9ing the Aermye in the low Contreyes. 3 That was answered before the LLs &amp; allowed. Answ.

John Radish was lett out for Rent, but after the Massacre, (being furnished with neither cloathes nor pro- uision nor well in health) his Mr kept him to find and cloath him onely: There was neither ground for these to plant, nor prouision, and therfore I gaue way that 3 or 4 of them should be lett out: and you see how lost a yeare it was, els there had beene made an agreement for 100wt of Tob: and three barrels of corne for each: since Capt9 Nuces death Mr Threasuror for the yere [2] to come will take order, that which is past hath beene in effect lost: I placed Capt9 Whitakers vpon the best ground I had, where he had neere 5000 wt of Tobacco, if he placed no more of the Companies Ten- ants there, but two, and I had no more ground to spare: indeed I was streightened for roume, and such was the charge of guarding, as I had not aboue a 1000 wt of Sixteene Tenants of mine, yt Planted at Pasbehaighes. Truth is I was faine lend many of them (hauing wiues and Children) more corne, then all their Croppe of Tobacco was worth: Therfore You will not by this yeare esteeme what successe may be hereafter, it was my ill fortune to come when mischief was breeding couered ouer with a treacherous peace: and thinke of supplying mee, though but for vpholding the reputacion of my place: Fauour vs what you may both in yor conceptions of what is feazible by vs and in charging vs, ere wee be recouered, and belieue Con- fidently if you were here, you would think wth vs: The Margarett and John lighted in the Company of a Dutch Ship who said he would come hither, I should be glad to know, what is to be done in those cases, as also to haue a Copy of the Patent, wee hold by: Our people are so carelesse, as if you please to thinke of some co?ission for a Martiall Court, at least ad terrorem, with what limitations you shall please for cases of life, it may do much good: wee had lately some cutt off a trading, who I know were strong enough, and it manifestly appeared they were surprised because there was not a piece discharged: without §doubt§ either wee must drive them, or they vs out of the countrey, for at one time or other they play vs false, and indeede all trade must be forborne, and subsist of our selues, which hitherto our necessity forced vs vnto: [3] Here are two Ships newly come in the Margarett and John, of which wee were in despayre, and one from Mr Gookin with 40 men for him, and 30 passengers besides: the first is in great distresse for prouision and like to be burdensome to the countrey for that: the other very scant also, both hauing?[sic] long out, and suffred extreamly in their Passage: God send vs in some ships with prouision to ballance the[m]1 1 Torn.

Autograph letter, signed List of Records No. 460 Worthy Sr, I have sent you the coppy of my Letter by the Hopewel how coppied, I know not, for I have not the leasure to pervse it. N. P. Of all your depts, &amp; the tobacco dew for the saile of their times wch belonged to Sr William Nuce (of whom 3 onely are alive) I can but receive a hundred weight, wch I am ashamed to send you single Som fault I must lay vpon the tardy receait of your accounts, wch I have often importuned. I have divers under arest, &amp; distrained on the goods of others; but the Country is so empty of tobacco, that no present satisfaction wilbe given. Let it be accounted my fault if you have it not the yeare following wth arerages, for I wil trust no more vnto promises but seaze on their crops before any be distributed. The like Counsil I gave Mr Blany the last yeare (for yoyr §your§ informations cam too late for me) but he trusted too much vnto those who had never formerly faild him. Leifetenant Perce hath tak[en] order in England to pay you the 501 wch he owes. I have beene at Kicotan to order your affaires in that place. Captaine Nuce died very poore: he had no crop of tobacco this yeare, nor hath any of the tenants a graine, hardly, of corne to sustaine them. it is aledged that most was spent in releiving of those that came thether for succor. But they lay al on the short provitions sent wth them: by wch meanes they [do] depart wth most of their corne as soone as it is reaped to dis- charge their borrowings &amp; besides the Companyes tenants are planted on the barrenest places in al the Country, by reason of your affecting of cleared ground, wch is generaly worne out, &amp; vngrateful to the planters. Captaine Whitacres lost yearly his labor on the place where he was seated. Of him onely I receaved 180 waight of tobacco, wch wth 20 more, I payd to Mr Cleyborne for his wages according to your agreement. He is now at Kicotan, drawne thether by Captaine Nuce a little before his death. I have disposed of things there in this manner. I have taken Captaine Whitacres bond to pay you for the tenants, together wth those wch he formerly co?aunded, a hundred waight of the best tobacco a man, &amp; 15 bushels of corne, (besides a like proportion for themselves) wch is as great a rate as any wil do give, &amp; more then most men can make. Captaine Wh Wilcocks pays 20 waight les a man, being compounded wth before: &amp; Captaine Smith shal pay, if he have his, as much as the most. By this meanes you wil have a constant rent, &amp; equal the gettings of the privat planter, the moyety for the tenant deducted: wch other wise wil com (as it hath don) vnto nothing. The tenants that belong to Captaine Nuce his place, I have suffered his widdow (provided that it be alowd of by you) to enioy them this year: not out of charity onely, although she hath nothing left to sustaine herselfe, &amp; her poore child (her houband [sic] having sould his land to furnish himselfe for this place; she being besides a woman of good birth, &amp; better conditions.) but partly out of right in that he livd a good part of the yeare, &amp; partly out of necessety; they having no corne nor we able to help them wth any, the Seafloure not [2] yet arived; so that they must have famished, or by shifting abroad returnd you no proffit. You may hereafter save the charge of a Deputy, who can no way advantage you in I have sent you hereinclosed the names of al your tenants that are living; Wth the times past I wil have nothing to do; but for the future I doupt not but to give you contentment. Your pinnas lies like a wrack at Elizabeth citty; wch hath brought in this year not les then 1800 bushels of corne, &amp; yet, wch is strange, not any in the Colony so nere starving as they. I sent Nun wth his fellows (of whome none deserve the name of a shipwrite) to vew her; who writ the woord that 1501 would not repaire her; wch was twice as much, if not more, as she cost: but one having offered to buy her, I suspected som knavery, &amp; vpon my co?ing downe had her exactly serched, &amp; found that no great matter would renew her: so that I have set both them &amp; others vpon her. yet sailes &amp; tackling we shal want except you supplie vs: &amp; I doubt not but to imploy her to your better satisfaction. The Vinerouns are placed together at Elizabeth Citty &amp; altogether im- ployed about silek §silck-woormes§, that we may preserve the seede &amp; send you home som silck the next yeare. for the planters are so busied about rebuildings &amp; prepareing theyr grounds, that few, at this time, ether can, or wil atend them. Yet for my owne part I have set 4 to do nothing else: &amp; im prepared the chamber where in I ly at Leiftenant Perses (the fairest in Virginia) for that purpose. I heare the Frenchmens times com out the next yeare: you must vse the meanes to procure their stay, &amp; send more of their quality if you would have that woorke goe realy forward. Since my last letter I have sent my shallop with my servants as far almost as the fals for sand for the Glasse men, but can §could§ find none that would serve; &amp; since to Cape Henry, where they lighted of that wch they like (however send us two or three Hogsheds out of England) if it be not disliked in the tryal. Al the servants are dead, wch you must supply, for the charge is intollerable to hyre them: wch, wth their provitions, lyes al vpon me, that am not able to feede my owne familie. And, to give a greater blow to our necessitys, the Tygar sent forth a trading wth Mr Puntises pinnace vnder Captaine Spilman (a man warie enough hereto- fore &amp; acquainted wth their trecheries) is not onely returned empty, but himselfe wth 26 wel armed, sufficient to have defended themselves against 500 Indians, are cut off or taken prisoners; ether by ambushes or too much credulity: for as yet we know not the certanty. the ship attempted by 60 canoues (not above five of the seamen aboard) but were dispersed by the discharge of their Ordnance. So that if the Seaflower com not quickly in, there wil hardly be found a preservation against famin. And, by the way, to our no little discontentment, we having wth great expence set out that ship to Somer Ilands for furnishing the country wth their frutes, in print you have given the reputation [to another] Sic vos non vobis. [3] Since our general letter we have vewed the place where we are now goeing about to erect our fort; naturaly almost intrenched about wth deepe ditches: wch, by the grace of God, shal not want our vtter most indevours in the finishing. We shal need great ordnance, whole Culvering &amp; demy- culvering at the least. And if God shal prosper vs, we wil frame a plat- forme hereafter &amp; sinck it on the opposite flat, to large enough to containe 5 or 6 peeces, &amp; thereby make the passage more vnpassable for an enimy. Qy Answer to Capt Butlers Un- masking of Vir- ginia1 1 In pencil in modern hand. For Silke gras, earths, rareties &amp;c, it was impossible for me this year, by reason of the trobles &amp; want of meanes to send you any. But if I can make the pinnace Navegable, &amp; furnish her (wch I shal do the better of your healpe) you shal never [haue] occation to complaine in that kind. It would wel please the Countrye to heare that you had tak[en] revenge of Dupper for his stincking beare; wch wth what [hath] succeed by their contagion, in my conscience hath beene th[e] death of 200. You have imployed a strange Purser: a m[an] wthout witt, or out of his witts: who hath lost much &amp; never d[e]livered a great part of his good; throwing them vpon the shore scarce above the hygh water mark, wthout the informing of any, or setting any to guard them. But Mr Tucke deserves your thancks, &amp; our co?endations. Great are the likelyhoods of the vicinity of the South sea by a general report of the Indians: the mountaines being, as they say, not past 4 days iourny above the falls, they two days over, &amp; rivers on the other sid there into of no great length.

I were furnished wth meanes, I would willingly venter my life in that discovery. but we want asineicos, provisions, &amp; numbers of men fro for such an attempt: wch requires a general purse, &amp; patient expectance of proffit. And indeede theise slow supplies, wch hardly rebuild every yeare the decayes of the former, retaine vs onely in a languishing state, &amp; curb vs from the carrying of enterprise of moment.

Vnles it can be thought that a man should dispraise a Contrey England or any other Contrey if he should affirme that some ?tes thereof were v barren &amp; vnhealthfull wch were a strange kind of construction.

Comes in the Reare and it is [2] thought might well haue beene spared for it is not remembred that in those tymes wch were ?the? begynning? of the Planta?on there were anie or at least of any ?much? value of ?in? that kinde: especially not beefore the time by them limited in theyr declaration viz not beefore the 18 of December 1618. They say that there were then left 600 ?sons and 300 Cattle in the Colony Although this is noe small matter Consideringe the Infancie of the Planta?on in those tymes and the many Difficulties they mett wthall in theire first enterprises that only wth ?less then? the expence of 70000li there should be planted soe many men and all of them soe well provided that even by theire owne Confession ? ?of these ?men? that vsurp the name of the Companie of the Authors of this declara?on? ? there was for every twoe persons in the Collonie one head of English Cattle then lefte (besid? manie other plentifulle provisions not men?oned) yet Certeynly both the Nomber of Men and of Cattle was much more then they speake of B Wch in regard they haue the book? ?res and Record? of those tymes they are better acquainted wth then anie mans memory can serue nowe to remember: At least to those 600 men left in Virginia in the end of Decem- ber 1618, they should haue added as was aforesaid those that were sent between that tyme ?stet? and the end of Sr Tho: Smiths Gou9nmt as alsoe ? ?by wch Accompt it would as we conceaue appeare that there were 12 or 1300 ?sons left ?in the Colony?

Neither should they haue omitted ? ?the large prouisions that were from time to time sent from hence at the charge of the publicke to feed ?&amp;? cloth and furnish them Colony with necessaries which was giuen freely to the Planters for their sustentation and releife which could not bee estimated at less then 20000 markes if not 20000l nor haue omitted? ? the Ordinance then sent, the Towns that were built, the fort? that were raised, thin- closures that were made, the grownd? that were Cleared, the Churches storehouses bridges and other publi? work? that were built? ? nor the ships that were bought an for the Company ?stet? with the publique stocke and worne out in the Companies seruice? ? All wch besid? diu9s staple Co?od- ities then raised were the fruit? of that expence and of the endeavors and Ac?ons of those tymes, wch were blessed wth a successe if not answereable to thexpecta?on of all yet Certeynly beyond the hopes of many And therefore vnder Correc?on it savors of too much detrac?on to passe over those thing? wch should most Commend and giue his Matie best satisfac?on Concerninge the Well mannageinge of those affaires dureinge that tyme and to in siste only vpon the leaveinge of soe manie men or ?and? Cattle as if that had beene all that had beene done wth thexpence of soe much money: When indeed though it were a good ?great? advancemt of the Planta?on to haue soe manie men left there, well furnished, yet it seemes to be but the leaste parte of the services that were then ?formed. But let vs see whether they deale more ingeniously in that wch follow- eth. They say That the Companie was left then in debt neere 5000li [4] But they are desired to sett downe wthall what was left in stocke toward? the paymt thereof in money Plate and Comodities ?weh if Or Memoryes faile vs not was not less then 40001 for more eer besid? 800li payed in vnto the Magazine the ?ceed whereof came to the Companie and besid? sondry 800li that was in the colledg Cash &amp; besid? sondry? also in debt? due to the Companie wch since that tyme haue beene payd in and then it will appeare whether there be not likewise a Defecte of truth in this Clause as well as in all the former? ?; for an if or memoryes doe not faile vs, ther was left toward? the paymt of the s?? It is also desired whether that it be declared whether 700li pretended to be owing by the Companie to the Cash of the Colledge be not included in their 5000li wch they say the Company was left in debt, for? ? But though the Authors of this Declara?on mistooke the former, yet per- happs they will come neerer the Marke in declareinge the ?sent State of this Planta?on?, during the and of that wch hath ben done during the last gouerment.? They say therefore that whereas about a 4 yeares since there were but 600 ?sons, nowe (notwithstandinge the late Mortalitie and Massacre) there are remayninge as they Compute about 2500 ?sons. To wch wee answere that this Parenthesis of (Notwthstandinge the late Mortalitie and Massacre) is not soe slightly to be passed over seeinge that in the tymes of the greatest strength and enmitye of the Savages and of the Weaknes of or Colony the like mischeife never happened as this wch hath redownded not only to the losse of the lives of soe many of his Mat? Subiect? (whereof in all disasters of the like nature a strict Accompt hath beene §alwayes§ required) and to the detriment of the Planta?on thereby, but alsoe to the shame and reproach of or Na?on whoe heretofore wth lesse then halfe the men that were thus butchered did dare the whole power of those savage Princes and forced them either to a good Corespondencie or to a yearely Contribu?on ?and let them shew for triall of the truith heereof whether in the whole 12 yeeres of Sr Thomas Smyths gouernment there euer pased perished by the sword of hand? of the sauages half so many as haue bene butcherd and slayne by them in the compass of one yeere? But then were the Gou9nors and Cheife Officers in Virginia men of knowne sufficiencye and experience of §for§ those services and meerely for theire meritt was that Charge and trust Co?itted to them But [5] whether those that at this tyme doe principally mannage those affayres are men soe quallifyed or noe or rather out of favor or ?alliance &amp;? affec?on haue beene reco?ended to that imployment and whether through theire negligence and want to still this miserable accident hath §not§ befallen wee leaue it to be examined soe farr forth as to his Mat? Co?is- sioners shall seeme fitt: As alsoe whether there be 2500 ?sons nowe remayn- inge in the Colony wch will appeare by the list? of men directed to be Yearely sent from thence, in the ?formance of wch mayne Instruc?on wee suppose the Gou9nor and Officers there (whose Care and obedience in this declara?on is Co?ended) would not faile, especiallie it beinge easier to make those list? of Men more ?fecte this yeare then heretofore because the people were drawne fron theire dispersed habita?ons and lived Close together: But wee vehemently suspect that the nombers of people there nowe resideing are farre lesse ? ?and that in truth there are either not so many or very few more ?now in the Colony? then by in or Computa?on were left by Sr Tho: Smithe wch we are the rather induced to beleaue because for ought we heare the ?last? Catalogues of theise names ?sons are concealed so that ?and it will appeare (though wth greife wee speake it) wee haue wthin theis 4 yeares lost as manie or more men that wee did in the whole 12 yeares before? we feare it will appeare that neare 4000 pso[ns] of 4270 ?sons wch by their owne Ro wthin theis 4 yeares haue ben sent thither wee haue searee so many hundred and of 12 or 1300 left in Sr Tho. Smithes tyme wch make about 5500 in all we haue not 1500 there now remayninge: And we thinke that in 12 yeares before notwithstanding the many difficulties that all new begun actions are subiect vnto, we lost not 1200 ?sons ?For in the booke of the Massacre there was sent they say in the first three yeares after Sr Tho. Smith left the Gou9nmt 3570 psons And in theire rela?on they say there went 700 over the last Su?er that is 4270 in all And by theire owne Confession there were 600 §left§ in the Colony at that tyme. Soe that of 4870 psons and the Children wch since that tyme haue beene borne of them there is ?are? nowe as they Compute? not aboue 2500 §left§: by wch it is manifest that even by theire owne Accompt ?adding to that nomber the children that haue ben borne of them? wee haue wthin the said 4 yeares lost at least as many as wee haue remayninge and wee feare many hundreds moe. A thinge most lamentable ?that the liues of so many men should be thus lost? especiallie if vpon proofe it fall out that this great Destruc?on of people hath beene occasioned by the Wilfullnes [6] of those whoe had the principall stroke in mannaginge those affayres here and should neither haue procured nor given way to the transportinge of such multitudes of people ?as haue ben sent thither? till the Country had beene provided wth able and fitt ?sons to direct and wth Convenient lodginge and provision to receive releive and maynteyne them. ?And therefore it is humblie desired as a thing of most important consequence that the causes of this great? Alter this com- puta?on when we see how many were sent be- tweene the 18 of Dec. 1618 and Mch. 1619? They add further in theire Declara?on that theis 2500 ?sons now remayninge were sent with thexpence only of 30000li of the publi? stock besides the charges of ?ticuler societies and Planters. To wch is answered that it is too grosse a solecisme ?contradiction of themselues? to say that the ?sons nowe remayninge in Virginia were sent thither at the Charge of the 30000li publi? stock in the Declara?on men?oned whereas themselues Confesse but a fewe lynes before that there were 600 ?sons ?of them? left there in December. 1618. wch was longe before that publi? stocke raized soe that noe parte of that stocke could be imployed about the transporta?on of 600 of those 2500 ?sons wch as they ?tend are now remayninge. But is this 30000li all the money thath hath beene spent in theis planta?ons since Sr Tho: Smiths tyme? they imply noe, but (wthout nameinge any Su?e) they bringe in the rest wth a (besides the Charge of ?ticuler societies and Planters) This (besides) Carries more Weight wth it then it seems they would haue it doe, and is indeed worthy to be placed in front in Capitall letters and not to come in the Reare as a poore helpe, for sure it must need? be a farr greater Su?e then the form9 and therefore worth the nameinge. But somewhat is in it that this point must be thus obscured, ?happs they thought that seemes ?seeing? all wch is toe be seeme §seene§ of theire foure yeares labor is only some ?very? fewe ?sons more in Virginia then were when Sr Tho: Smiths gou9nmt expired ?wch yet is doubted?, The ?the? greater they made [7] the nomber of ?sons to appeare and the lesse the su?es of money thatei were expended, the better would theire Accompt be accepted But for the Clearinge of the truth herein wee ?say that we? Conceive that the moneyes expended wthin theis 4 Yeares about this Planta?on cannot be lesse then 85000li 85400li for ?or Reason is this? the 4270 ?sons wch they say haue wthin theis 4 Yeares beene exported at the rate of XXli a man comes to 85400li And that is the propor?on wch in theire printed paper (Called the Inconveniences) they say the Companie vsually allowes to the furnishinge of one man And in the paper of Accompt how they the Lottery Money was expended wch they deliu9ed to his Matie about twoe Yeares agoe they affirme as much: Soe that vnles they will denye what heretofore they haue affirmed this Collec?on of the Charge of 90000li 85400li to be expended wthin theis last 4 Yeares seemes to be very moderate ?for we abate 5400li in the whole, of the proporcon wch they themselves say they bestow in setting out these men For they say that afterward in this declara?on that they spent 5000li in Iron Workes besid? what was spent in other attempt?? And what effect? that huge expence hath produced is in parte discovered by what hath beene alredy sayd And shall hereafter be declared. The Cattle they say what by Newe supplies and what by increase of the form9 provision are multiplyed to aboue 1000. of Beasts It is strange to see howe theis thing? are shuffled together tendinge to obscure the truth for it had beene a very easie Matter and a farre more Directe Course to haue ?distinguished these and to haue? sett downe the number of Cattle that haue beene sent wthin theis 4 yeares wch for ought appeares to vs there haue not beene 200. A strange dispropor?onable propor?on for soe manie thowsand? §?sons§ as in that tyme haue beene sent thither, and therefore this blinde of putting them together served well to Cover that error But touchinge the number [8] of Cattle Wee may well from their owne Confession make this Collec?on: The Cattle wch were sent thither theis laste 4 Yeares if theire printed papers ?that we haue seene? be true were only 180 192 wch till this last Springe haue bred few or none. Some of theis 180 192 dyed by the way and many dyed as Wee haue Crediblie heard for want of good lookeinge to in Virginia. Many alsoe haue beene slayne by the Indians since the last Massacre. And yet if there remayne aboue 1000 it must necessarilie followe that there were in many aboue 300 lefte by the old Gou9nmt But to howe manie more might these haue beene encreased had not soe many persons beene vnfortunatelie and inconsideratelie (as is Conceived) sent over to Consume the fruit? of the form9 labors and another abuse latelie crept in of killing the bull Calves wch was not suffred before theis last 4 Yeares for the Males in form9 tymes were ?served and trayned up to the yoke soe it appeares that all they speake of to purpose in this Clause is only thencrease of the old stocke for theire newe supplies in this kinde was scarce worth the men?oninge. But the Goats increase (say they) and the hoggs are growne innumerable And what is herein Co?ended but the ould Gou9nmt whose founda?on this was and is meerely the worke of the Decourse of tymes for the goat? would haue encreased whosoever had beene Gou9nors (if they would not haue killed them vp) and the wilde Hogg? in the wood? would haue multiplyed wthout a heardsman If any of theis had beene sent over wthin theis 4 yeares it is like wee should haue heard of it in print And wee would be gladd to heare of any store of tame hoggs re?ved out of the ould store But this is Warilie declyned ? ?for we heare that notwithstanding this infinite multitude of swyne a ?the price of a? tame hogg is so much is m is now 12li in the Colony.? ? As for those wilde hogg? wee accounte of them as of the Deare in Virginia thing? belonginge to noe man and serue to feed the Savages or the Maryners that live idlie there, rather then the people of the Colony, whoe haue starved in the middest of this Imaginary plenty, And by the end of this [9] Su?er wee faere it will to or greife yet more appeare what mischeife and miseries theis Conceipt? of aboundance haue brought vpon the Planta?ons. The last Clause of theis first branch is: That the old Debt of the Companie (which before they men?oned to be 5000li) is Discharged But it must be knowne as is aforesaid what of the old stocke was left toward? the paymt of it ?wch we conceaue was as much if not more then would discharge it? And it is doubted that the Companie is at this ?psent more in debt then it was left then. For it is an vndeniable truth that they haue stated Certeyne offices ?in Virginia? wth great nombers of Teñnts namely Gou9nors the Treasurors the Secretaries the Phisitians Vice Admiralls A Deputie for the Companie?s?, and another Deputie for ?the? Colledge Teñnt?: and by or Computa?on there want? to theis officers aboue 120 Men of the p theire promised and Contracted for nombers, wch in equitye and Justice are to be made good vnto them and the very sendinge soe manie ?sons over, reasonablie furnished will Coste the Com- panie at their owne rates 2400li the first penny and if anie of theis Newe men should dye the first yeare the Company must supply them againe wch will encrease the Charge. Besid? the Company owe to theis officers Nneere twoe Yeares arreares for the Want of soe many Tenant? wch in equitye they are bound to satisfie for especiallie seeinge by an Acte of Courte the 7th of Oct: last it is acknowledged to be a Due Debt vnto them: The entrie of wch Courte beinge afterward? Called into question as a Wronge done to the Company it was iustefyed and maynteyned that the Courte had done right therein By wch it appeareth that even this way besid? all others the Companie is at least 4400li in debt. And it is Conceived that the seale of the Company is given here §for§ at least 2000li more And the vnder officers of the Companie here are either in parte or whole vnpayed there wages wch they haue dearely earned, besid? the wages Contracted for wth the French [10] Viniarons All wch layd together wee Conceive that the Companie at this ?sent will proue to be in debt betweene six and seaven thowsand pownd? And noe meanes appeares wch may Way it can be satisfyed or the Companies Teñnts nowe remayninge in Virginia hereafter to be supplyed And thus much by way of Answere to the first branch of that Declara?on §by§ wch §it§ is apparent howe those th men that vsurp ?vnder? the name of the Company haue dealt wth his Matie in settinge downe both the former and ?sent estate of Virginia in the most Materiall part? thereof. The second branch followeth in which they say ?The second branch now followeth?

Whereas they say at the begynninge of the 4 last yeares ?there were no Co?odities but Tobacco &amp; Sassafras? Wee goe further and say (and that more truelie) that At the end of theis 4 Yeares there is noe Comoditie but Tobaccoe, soe little hath beene done (since Sr Tho: Smith left the Gou9nmt) toward? the advancemt of staple Co?odities and it is an abuseinge of the world to sett out book? wch haue Caused much laughter ?as they haue done? of the prizes of good? to be had in Virginia when either they are not nor canot cannot be had there at all, or at least not in many yeares The modesty and Wisdome of the form9 gou9mt is to be Comended that ?was such as it? would not set a valua?on of that that either was not in Esse, or was in noe greate propor?ons there but lefte eu9y Man to make his best price of those thing? when they had raised them and not to vndervalue mens labors soe much as this last valua?on of the Companies hath done by wch Course ?it is conceaued that? men haue beene deterred from imploye- inge theire labors in raisinge those Comodities seeinge they will not produce profitt enough to Clothe and feede them at the rate they prize them at But whereas they affirme there was noe other Course to sett vpp other Co?odities besid? Sassaphras, §&amp;§ Tobaccoe [11] in twoe yeares before the old officers left the Gou9nmt, there is herein Co?itted a Wilfull error for wthin those twoe Yeares there were other Co?odities besides those twoe before named sent over and sould here in England and the perticulers together wth their moneyes made of them given in Accompte by Sr Tho: Smith or the husband of the Companie to the Auditors and to the then Treasorer Sr Edwyn Sandys By wch Accompt? it appeares that there was aboue 1000li starlinge made of staple Co?odities dureing the old Gou9nmt, parte of wch moneyes was raised vpon staple Co?odities sent over the twoe last yeares And this the Twoe Auncient Auditors Sr Edwyn Sandys and Sr John Danvers are not ignorant of But of all other Sr Edwyn had least Cause to taxe the twoe last Yeares Gou9nmt for he dureinge all that tyme Wa was Chosen assistant to Sr Tho: Smith in regard of whose sicknes and other imployment? he vnder that title did in a manner ?wholie? supplie his place, soe the errors Co?itted wthin that tyme (if any be) reflecte vpon himselfe And here theire owne reason excuseth the former Gou9nmt Vizt the povertie of the Companie and this branch likewise Sr Edwyn might haue spared ?for? the Companie could not haue beene soe poore if the Lotteries had not beene suspended By wch Meanes Sr Edwyn made his way easie to be Treasorer of Virginia and when he had obteyned that place i?ediatlie he was a meanes to sett vpp the runninge Lotteries againe. ?quere? ?quere what? ?3 Branch: During these last 4 yeares there hath ben expended in setting vp of Irone workes (ye Oare whereof is there in great plenty and excellent) aboue 5000li which worke beeing brought in a manner to perfection was greately interrupted by the late Massacre but ordered to be restored againe with all possible diligence.? ?Answ.? Iron the oare in greate plentie and excellent was found to theire hands many Yeares since and brought ouer wrought and vnwrought into this Kingdome. It is by vs Confessed that the greatest parte of the stocke belonginge to the Colledge was wasted in this proiecte: for the 50 men sent over were not able to mannage an Iron worke and soe turned good honest Tobaccoe mongers The like successe [12] for the same reason had the twoe Iron Work? attempted by the Adventurers of Southampton Hundred Then the Companies stocke comes into ?to? repayre the ruyns and if Wee may beleeue ?res there would haue beene somethinge done in the busines but the same ?res Craved large supplies and therefore were bound to ?mise faire then comes the Massacre and that was the fayrest excuse for all errors and might haue served the relators turne very well and made them bould to affirme that worke was wholly over throwne by it: especiallie they hav- inge soe ?sent a remedye at hand as this it is ordered to be restored wth all possible dilligence But are either Workemen sought after, much lesse intended to be sent, or is there any roule of subscrip?on made to sett that proiecte on foot againe? or is the publi? stocke able to doe it? or will the private purses of Southampton Hundred be any further drayned?

In the salt work? wch they speake of there hath beene soe little done that the Collonie by buyes all theire salt for theire necessarye vse wch worke the old Gou9nors had brought longe since to good perfec?on In deed there was an inten?on to haue sett vp those work? vpon Condic?on the Co?oditie might haue beene engrossed by thadventurers of Sout?ton Hundred wch monopolie was vrged home wth pressinge argument? by the faithfull Treas- urer ?Sr Ed: Sandys? but was opposed to effecte, and ?by wch? it is to ?may? by ob?ued that Sr Edwyn loues Monopolies better then the world thinck? he doth and ?els would he not as it is thought? proiected secretly to his owne benefitt this of salt, and wiselie Contrived that other of Cole sole sale of Tobaccoe; but fatallie failed of both in soe much that neither the primitiue salt nor the derivative sallary prospered wth him: For the other Co?odities that ?they speake of wch? they say they haue sent other persons over to raise them: When they shall be at leasure to name them wee will giue them a directe answere thereto, in the meane tyme Wee passe over wth silence those nameles and to vs vnknowne Co?odities wch vnles there were anie such indeed wee wish noe men?on had beene made of them in print wch hath given an occasion both to them in Virginia and to those here that knowe they are but meere fancies to suspecte the integritie and realitie of or proceeding? in theis businesses. [16] ?8 Branch? The lawe which stints men ?Answ.? from plantinge aboue 100 Weight of Tobaccoe was passed wth great difficultie in the Quarter Courte here as ?iudiciall to the Adventurer and was ?sently Confirmed by the Planter whoe knowes nowe his vnder- taker in England can demand of him but 50li of Tobaccoe for his whole yeares labor soe that his Tenancye at halues is turned to a Certyne rent But if the Planter that is a Teñnt shall punctuallie ob?ue this lawe then he hath to cloath himselfe and to buy Workinge tooles [sic] about 46li ?pound weighte? of Tobaccoe for the other 4li ?pound? is defalked for duties belonginge to his officer and minister and Tobaccoe beinge decried to 12d the pownd in Virginia (as Mr Nicholas Ferrar affirned at the Councell board it was) then the Planter hath 46s of money for his Tobaccoe and the Marchant wth whome he is to trade raiseinge the prize of his good? at pleasure sometymes to the double sometymes to a 3d and never lesse then to a 4th more then they Cost here in England the Planter hath by this Account about 34s worth in Co?odities when he is best dealt wthall for his whole yeares labor and soe instead of reclayminge the Colonie from excessive plantinge of Tobaccoe the poore planter must either starve or be forced to plant it in greater quantities for his necessarye maynteñnce And as for the settinge soe manie staple &amp; rich Co?odities on foote at one instant ?wch they speak of? it was a worke of an ill Consequence for thereby nothinge is done in anie one of them but all is vanished into smoke (that is to say into Tobaccoe) whereof alsoe they haue noe great store, for this yeare they haue not sent home soe much as the little poore Planta?on of the Su?er Island? hath done wch is brought to the perfec?on that it is come vnto by the labors and Charge only of a fewe priuate men. ?qr? The pretended competent val valua?on set vpon Co?odities was a Worke meerely vnnecessary: for the Marchant knowes what to giue and the Planter loues his libertye, and esteemes this set price a bondage, it made him alsoe despaire to thincke of those businesses because the rates were sett soe lowe; It alsoe brought a scandall vpon the Companie as hath beene said before to sett out in print fancies and imagina?ons in stead of reall truth. [17] ?9. branch? The officers in Virginia are applauded ?Ansr.? for their obedience in executeinge the direc?ons and Desires of the Company here: Wee wish that men had beene imployed in that service to whose advice and Councells the Companie here might rather haue hark- ened and received light and informa?on for theire ?ceeding? ?from thence? Then might it haue beene hoped that wee should neither haue spent soe much money and paynes to soe little purpose, and most especiallie that Wee should not haue lost the liues of soe manie of or deare Countrye Men, a thinge that lies most heavie vppon vs: for wee knowe that he that send? a shipp to sea in an vnseasonable tyme, or wth an vnskilfull Pilott and he that Co?itt? the leadinge of soldiers to an vnfitt §&amp;§ experienced Capteyne is reputed Co?onlie the Cause of theire destruc?on if such a disaster doe befall them: And therefore Wee desire that or Co?enda?on of those officers ?and that govermt? vnder whome the destruc?on of soe manie men hath happened may be spared vntill vpon due examina?on they shall appeare to haue de?ued noe blame therein. ?10 branch? ?Answ.? ?10. It is not remembred that there haue ben any lawes giuen to the people in the Colony from hence during these last 4 yeares, but it is desired if they have made any such for the well gouerning of the Colony they may be produced. We confess there were some lawes made by the Planters themselues, if they have made any such in their generall assembly, but were neu9 that we know confirmed here so that they remayne not in force but by coñiuence only and so may serue to ensnare a Gouernor who shall not concurr wth their Humor that manage businesses here and what content or settlement this can giue to the Company Colony we know not in the meane tyme we are sure we heare much complaint of wrong? and oppressions amongst them And whereas they say that? To remoue extortion and to allure worthy ?sons, they haue sett out Competent maynt?ance for officers and Wee haue Cause to Conceive the sicknes is not Cured but the Charge increased and become insupportable to the Companie. Wee are sure the benefitt is shared by brothers, Cozens, and assured freind? there to those whoe by that and other meanes sway all the businesses of the Planta?on both there and here; Wee say alsoe that parte of this Charge was vnseasonablie layd when the Companies stocke was vtterly exhausted whereby or bound bountie may be applauded but or discre?on will be shrewdly questioned; And whereas they say that theis offices were stated wth pencions at the Councells and Companies great Charge, It had beene as wee Conceive more truely and gratefully said that it was done wth the Monies raised by Lotteries wch was a Worke and effecte of grace in his most excellent Matie soe that the Charge in deed issued not from the Councell and Companie as here is alledged ?intimated? but out of the purses of the subiecte in gen9all. [18] ?11 branch? Theire cares haue not bene ?Answ9? vneffectuall wee Confesse for the Colony is nowe oppressed wth famyn and sicknes wthin and engaged in a Warre wth the Natives wthout, And whereas the savages were formerlie brought to good Corespondencie ?&amp; or? made tributarie to vs, they nowe dare maynteyne an open Warre wth or people and beinge armed wth or Weapons and havinge learned the vse of Muskett ?or guns? can brave them ?or men C countrymen? at theire verie doores: and in theis necessities what but vtter shippwracke can be expected when at the helme of this Wetherbeaten shipp ?vessell? there sitt? scarce one able and experienced Councellor to guide her but all of them gen9allie either newe Co?ers or men of Contempla?on and dis- course ?&amp;? not of action or experience in gou9nmt. But you ?they? say that at home you ?they? haue raised soe great a fame of Virginia that many ?sons of good sorte haue remoued themselues thither. Wee Confesse that the fame they haue raised of Virginia hath sent manie other over of good qualitie that trusted to their rumors of plentye and aboundance wth small or noe ?visions whoe either haue all perished or haue suffred horrible extreamities for theire Credulitye and this mis- cheife would haue swallowed vp the liues of many more men but that there haue alwayes some risen vpp in the Companie whoe haue opposed theis miserable pollicies wch being vsed vnder a specious ?tence of ad- vanceinge the Planta?on haue produced the miserable effect? that nowe though too late Wee may be all sensible of, that haue anie Christian Compassion lefte ?in vs?: But as the miseries wch manie haue Mett Wthall in Virginia hath ?haue? sent back some of good quallitie (that ?who? haue outlived them) home into England, soe wee feare more will shortly followe But were the former tymes in this inferior to theis later as theis men would imply If it be soe for tryall of the truth thereof wch must appeare by ?ticulers, Wee desire ?amongst others whose? they would match theis men whose names they shall finde in the m9gent whoe adven- tured their ?sons into Virginia dureinge the old gou9nmt And then it will appeare whether in this point alsoe as in all others the Planta?on goeth not backward. [19] ?12 Branch? There haue beene 44 Patent? ?Answ.? graunted wthin theis 4 yeares and many more Wee Confesse but aboute 28 of them ?(as we compute)? were either graunted to such persons as had begunne theire Planta?ons before theis 4 yeares or to men that haue done nothing wth them but only purchased theire freedomes thereby and perhapps a Councellors place either here, or there or by it haue made theire farest introduc?on to an office in Virginia or ?sently made demand of one But whereas they say that theis persons to whome theis 44 Patent? are graunted haue haue vndertaken each of them to transporte one hundred men at the least It is desired they would set downe what securitie the Companie hath that this shall be ?formed ?and in what tyme? and why those that haue not ?formed accordinge to theire vndertakinge are not pressed therein. The last Clause of this branch wch ?sayes? positively that in the former 12 yeares there were not aboue twoe Patent? graunted seemes too peremptorye that in theis former 12 yeares Wee finde that theis 4. ?double that number? vizt one to Sr Samuell Argall, one to Martyns Hundred, one to Capteyne Martyn and one to Capteyne Lawne whoe all proceeded effectually to plant the land graunted vnto them effectually accordinge to the purpose of theire Patent? Soe that what good hath beene effected by this Course of grauntinge Patent? had it? vse and grownd ?rise and ground? from the old Gou9nmt, though wee Confesse it was not soe lavish in Parchmt as theis later tymes haue beene, the good fruit? whereof wee would most gladdly knowe. ?quere? ?branch 13.?

May (?), 1623 Manchester Papers, Nos. 331, 332, 333 Document in Public Record Office, London List of Records No. 447 A note of some thinges fit to bee inquired into by the Comrs. for the better discouerie of the true estate and Condition of the Plantations, and of the proceedeinges and cariage of that buisinesse. And first for that of Virginia. This Inquirie is to respect two severall times, vi?t the time when the affaires of those Planta?ons were chiefelye directed by Sr Tho: Smith (wch was about the space of ten or twelve yeares) and the tyme since hee gave over the said Government to this ?sent. Concerning the first, for a more distinct proceeding in this Examyna?on, theis things amongst manie others may bee inquired into. 1.When the first Pattent beganne, how by degrees that Planta?on was prosequuted, by what rules those affaires are, and haue binne governed, and whether the same shalbee thought fit to bee continewd, or altered to a better. 2What moneyes were received in the severall yeares of Sr Thomas Smithes Government, to whom they were paid, who kept the Accompt of them, howe the said moneyes were severallie brought in, vizt. what by Lotteries, what by other Collections, and what by voluntarie Adventures, and how those moneyes haue bynne accompted for, and what discharges thereupon given. 3What ships, men, Cattle, muni?on, and furniture were set forth in the said severall yeares. 4What publique Work? were effected dureing this Government, vi?t what houses or Townes built, what bridges, what fort?, what Churches &amp;c. what Nomber of English persons were resideing in Virginia, when Sr Tho: Smith left the Government, and whether the said Persons were sent, and the said building? and publique workes performed by private Adventures, or vpon the publique stocke and for the benifit of the publique, 5What were the vsuall prices of Corne and Provisions in the Collonye dureing the time of Sr Thomas Smithes Government, how were they sup- plied of victuall &amp;c from hence, whether vpon the publique stocke, or by private Adventurers that made Comoditie, and advantage of what they sent thither. 6.What magazines were set vp in Sr Thomas Smithes time, and by whom, what were the vsuall prizes at wch the said magazines bought and sold, by whom were the said magazines cheifelie mannaged, and what gaine or losse came to the Adventurers thereby. 7What staple Comodities were raised and what attempted dureing the time aforesaid. [2] 8Whether was there anie open and notable differences and dissentions, among the Companie here, dureing the time aforesaid, if anie how did they growe, and how were they compounded, or was there a generall Concord, and agreement amongst them, and in what Tearmes stood the Collonies there at at that tyme in regard of peace, or enmitie with the Savages. 9Howe came the lotteries first to be invented, and by whom, when did they beginne, who directed that buisines, and who were imployed as Agent? in it, what fraud? or abuses were comitted in the cariage of them, howe were the said lotteries furnished, and by whom, whether vpon the publique stocke, or by private men, and who were they that did s helpe to supplie it it with prizes, or Comodities of their owne pro? good?, money, plate, or Jewells &amp;c. what were the particulers that were so put in, and vpon what Tearmes, and what gaine or losse came to such private Persons, in lieu of the said Comodities. What were the valewe of all the prizes in the said lotteries, were the prizes that were drawne dulie paid, what was the totall Sum of money collected by the lotteryes, and in what places were the said moneyes collected, what course was held for secureing a true Accompt to bee given, of all the said moneyes, what Charges for dyet, horsemeat, and travaileing expences were demanded, by those that mannaged that buisines, and what for those Charges was allowed, and by whom was the said allowance of ordinarie Charges made, what reward? were given to anie Person or Persons whatso- ever out of the said lotteries, and by whom, and in what respect, what Accompt was made of the moneyes, &amp;c thus Collected, and by whom, who tooke th'accompt, to whom were the said moneyes paid, and what discharges haue binne given for it. How long did the said lotteries Continew, did they for a time cease, how came they to cease, and how, when, and by whom were they againe set vp, and how came it to passe that at last they were quite taken away. [3] The like Course of Examyna?on to bee held for the 4 yeares since Sr Thomas Smith mutatis mutandis. With a particuler direction, exactlie to distinguish the men, muni?on, Cattle and other supplies sent by private Pattentees, and such as were sent vpon the publique stocke. (for it is to bee observed and remembred, that divers have taken Pattent? and planted at their owne Charge, wch is no part of the publique.) As also to Inquire throughlie what Commoditie hath ben produced dureing the said last yeares in lieu of the great expence of this§e§ publique Treasure, raised by lotteries, collections, voluntarie Contribu?ons &amp;c. who hath had the benifit hereof if anie hath ben made, what new offices haue bin in this time invented, who are the principal Officers, what allowance is made vnto them, and by whom, and what Charge haue they put the Companie to That the Comr? inquire carefullie vpon what ground? good and warrant- able ground? the Companie adventured to send such multitudes of people theis 4 last yeares, whether the sending of so manie people hath not vndis- creetelie wasted the whole publique stocke, and bin a meanes to cast away the lyves of so manie of his mat? Subiect?, therefore to know what Intelligence they kept with the cheife of the Collony there, to vnderstand whether they were able to lodge, and feed so great a number as were from time to time transported thither. That the Comrs cause that vpon oath they produce all their ?res to that purpose ?swadeing or diswadeing the sending of so manie ?sons, and vpon oath to inquire whether at one and the same time from some one or the same ?son, or by some other of good Credit, there were not private ?res written to some cheife men of the Companie, concerning the true estate of the Collonies, contrarie to those that were read in publique, whereby the Court? were deluded and drawne to Consent to the vast Proposi?ons of some, who it is to bee feared ayme1 1 The draft (Manchester Papers 331) has "ayming" altered by Sir Nathaniel Rich from "ayme." more to obtaine the fame of sending great multitud? of people in so short a time, could not or would not see the daunger of the way they tooke to arrive at that End.

Indorsed in autograph of Sir Nathaniel Rich List of Records No. 482 If the Companies be bound to bring in all their Tobacco although the payment of 12d the pound be reduced vnto 9d the pound, yet the clogg is greater then the ease: in reguard that the Plantations haue neuer vented aboue Third of their Tobacco in this Kingdome when the quantities returned from the Plantations was not halfe of what is now certaine to be, but to speake with the largest, allowe that there shalbe half of it vented, then the case will stand thus, ?it was a merue- yle that when Tobacco was freely brought in from other places that prevented any at all of ours? ?first, they doe not make so much? Virginia and the Su?er Ilandes bring home 300000 weight of Tobacco whereof there will not be vented aboue one hundred and 50000 here in England at ye most &amp; at 9d ye pound, for this the are to pay the some of ?2ly, if none be brought in but from thence we shall vent about 300,000wt?. 11250li But if they were not thus compelled they will bring in no more then will serue the markett (viz.) one hundred and 50000 weight for which although they pay 12d the pound it comes vnto but 7500li So that being thus compelled to bring in all they doe not ease themselues (as the Customers pretend) of 3d the pound: but they doe charge the tobacco with 6d the pound more then they formerly payd: And the ffarmors although they pre- tend to abate for the good of the Plantations in reguard that in euery perticuler pound they abate 3d yet indeed they take very much from them for whereas bringing in only what would vent they should receaue but only 7500li Now by this meanes they rayse by bringing in all 11250li wch is 3750li more then they should haue otherwise had, &amp; soe much losse it wilbe to ye Companies yearly in this one thing and that indeed howsoeuer it seemes that they doe abate 3d in the pound, yet indeed they make the Owner pay 6d a pound more, and so I must conclude, that every pound stand? in 18d So that it appeareth playnly that the condi?on onely of being forced to bring all in from the Plantations doth putt ye Companies in a farre worse case then they were before although there be 3d in a pound abated to ye intent they should agree therevnto. [Indorsed, in the hand of Sir Nathaniel Rich, in which the marginal notes are also written:] Mr Nicholas Ferrar his Computation by which he would prooue that to pay but 9d ? po. for or Tobacco, and to bring all in is worse for the Companye then before to pay 12d and to be left at libertye what we would bring in—in wch he speakes not one word of the benefitt of sole Importation that accompanyes the 9d whereas before we payed 12d and all other Tobacco came in.

May—June, 1623 Manchester Papers, No. 340 Document in Public Record Office, London List of Records No. 437 §Thus appeares theire miserye now§ that the people §now there§ remayning in the Colony in Virginia §are few are few§ we gather, it thus.

This is either omitted this yeare or concealed from vs. And no reason can be §is§ alleadged, for the omittal of it but on the contrarye it was easier this yeare to haue taken euery mans name in the Colony, because they were by reason of the Massacre they were driuen from their s seuerall Planta?ons and forced to inhabitt neare together 2lyBy the last Muster Rowle of the people there taken §the last Su?er§ much about the tyme of the Massacre there were in all of men women &amp; Children §in Virginia§ but 1240: and except only the people remayning at Warasquiack wch were but 3 households. Since wch tyme their letters make men?on of 5 or 600 that haue ?ished wth sicknes and famine. And many after that tyme perished by the hand? of th'Indians. And here we doe obserue that when this Muster Roule of the yeare 1622 was taken it appeareth §by the printed bookes of the Companye§ that t in the 3 yeares before vzt 1619. 1620. 1621: there had ben 3570 people trans- ported: And there was not less then 800 at least left in the Colony when Sr Thomas Smith left the Gouermt: wch makes 4370 ?sons. So that it is playne by those Muster Roules that §euen§ in those 3 yeares before the Massacre there were lost aboue three thowsand soules §wch need? proceed from much negligence &amp; want of good gou9nt:§ besid? those that haue ?ished by t since by th'Indians and by sicknes: And so consequently that the people remayning in the Colony are but few. wch likewise appeares by some of their ?res. 3: Mr George Sandys in his ?re to Mr Wrott hath these word? The lyuing haue ben hardlie able to bury the dead thorough their Imbecillitie We haue lost not less then 500 by sicknes (wth a generall weakenes of the rest) wch taken out of so small a nomber forth §farr§ short of yor Coniec- tures I belieue haue not left behind them so many able men in the Contrey: And more expressly he saieth that out of the whole Colony the we could rayse but 180 whereof 80 were fitt only to carry burthens. Againe the Gouernor Sr Francis Wyatt 4 Aprill last writes to [sic] §in§ his father sayeth thus: They (meaninge the Company here) talke [2] of an Armye of 500 to issue out vpon th' Indians in all parts and after a Ruñing Armye of 150 to vex them in all places This ioyned wth the 5th man te keepe for the ffort would leaue some xx men to guard 40 Planta?ons halfe a man to each, counting any that were tolerable shott for a man. I know what I say and to whom I speak it. Againe we find besid? diuerse passages in their ?res from thence by wch we may discerne the paucitie of the people we find that one Wi?m Capps beeing generallie approued as a fitt man to be imployed against th'Indians he demanding but 40 30 small shott and 10 men to secure the Boates was as it seemes putt of wth §by§ this Reason giuen in their Counsell there. That if theis men should be slayne then their whole state were ouerthrowne. By all wch we conceaue that in truth their nombers are very small and weake: And in great danger either to be vtterlie ruyned either by th Enemy or by ffamine or both. The §generall§ causes of this misery for ought appeares to vs seemes to be theis may amongst diuerse others saue be theis 1§Ffirst &amp; principally§ The sending of so many people b ill furnished before the Contrey was fitt to receaue them both either for lodging or Prouisions: a thing wch to vs seemes vnexcusable. 2Ffor b By stuffing of their Shipps in their passages wth too great a nomber, for the lucre &amp; gayne it seemes of the owners of the Shipps. 3Ffor want of able Co?anders and directors in the Contrey, so that 4By tying the 4By tying the Col Co?anders there too strictlie to obserue the direc?ons of the Companie here; who (as is conceaued) could not possiblie These may be gathered, not only.

Whereas the coming of certaine Indian? lately to Martins Hundred hath given vs cause to suspect, that theire intent is only to spy and obserue the weaknes of or plantation?, that they may take the better advantage to effect any treachearous plott against vs. The Governor considering the manifold daungers, that may follow by the Indian? resorting to privat Plantacions, and treating wth them, out of his especiall care to ?vent any mischeif that may hapne thereby, doth charge and co?and, that no ?son whatsoeu9, (but only the chiefe Comander of any Plantation) shall hold any conference wth any Indian? (if at any time they shall in peaceable maner resort vnto them, and desire a parley) wthout first givinge notice thereof to his Comander: And that no Comander of any planta?on shall in any wise giue them pledges, wherevppon if they shall stand out, to shoote or kill them by any meanes they can: but if they shall voluntarily com in and yeeld themselues vnto them, then to take and keepe them safely guarded, vntill they can giue notice thereof to the Governor, or send them vnto him.

[2d Proc.] By the Governor and Captaine generall of Virginia May 9, 1623 Forasmuch as this Colony hath been many times in danger of famine through the peoples great neglect of planting Corne, notwthstanding very strict decrees and Proclamations in former times Co?anding the same: And that nothing can be more dishonorable to or nation, then to stand in need of suplies of or most necessarie food from these base Salvages nor more dangerous, then to haue or liues, and the life of the Colony it self, to depend vppon the vncertaine hope of trade wth them. Yet so measurable is the coveteousnes of of [sic] many in planting Tobacco, and so great theire improvidence, as to neglect the planting of Corne, to ?serue the liues of them and theire families. The Governor therefore, wth the advice of the Counsell of State (out of theire care to ?vent the danger that might heareafter befall this people and Commonwealth, by the neglect of planting Corne) haue ordered and appointed, and by these ?sent? do straightly charge and Co?and all ?sons whatsoeu9, wch now do or hereafter shall inhabitt in this Colony, that they plant at least a sufficiencie of Corne for themselues and theire families, and that they do not hope or rely vppon any supply of Corne, by trade wth the Indians, wch wilbe in vaine, since leaue and license to trade wth them, shalbe very sparingly grannted to any, and not at all to such, whose want of Corne hath proceeded from theire neglect of planting thereof These Co?and? they require and charg all men to obey, as they will answer the contrary at theire vttermost perill.

This §if it bee granted§ will vtterly defeate his Maties purpose to preuent the meeting of a multitude together: for there are 50 or 60 Patents of this nature granted, and in each Patent there are vsually 40 or 50 ioynt Aduenturers, and so they may at that rate assemb?e three two or three thousand people together. It is therefore desyred It may therefore (if so it please his Matie) be answered that for euery of those petty Plantations which are §so§ made by a ioynt stock they may choose one na or two men §(such as haue paid in their money for that Planta?on)§ in the name of the rest to be present at theyr Courts and that for the businesses of each seuerall Plantation the Patentees may meete together among themselues as they were wont to doe: So theyr priuate Plantations may be ordered among them that are partners in yt Plantation: and yet the Courts not pestered with multitudes, nor no man at any preiudice The second part of his Maties letter is that no Complaynts shalbe brought to the Comissioners in the name of the Company Against this they intend likewise to petition because by this meanes (they say) no the Iniuries offered to the Company as cannot be com- playned of, for no p man will become an Informer Ob. To this it is answered that the Company may appoint 3 or 4 who may receaue and collect all comp wrongs of that nature, and if they be such as wilbe by any man iustified they may be presented to the Comrs with §vnder§ theyr names that will iustifie it: Otherwise any man of what qualitye soeuer may be shamefully traduced by a multitude and can haue no redress for it, wch was one mayne reason why his Matie m and the Lords made that Order.

Secondly such as haue planted but ther be (people being dead) ther planta?ons are now not ?sently occupied &amp; dwelt vpon. Thirdly such as hauing men ther; but ther men being vpon th occasion past drawne frõ ther ?? planta?ons, they being spoyld did possesse others plañs And that none (howsoever pur- posing to send men by the i?- ediate next ship- ping) could be admitted to the Court. Lastly all such as weer engaged by ?sent supplies expecting frõ hence returne of ther co?oditie. And inferr that m ther are not men enough so qualified as shall or can make vp a number of ye Court. To this wee Answeare wee conceiue his Maties pleasure is only to su exclude such as hauing no ?sent stocke running ther either in men or supplies alone or wth others nor expecting or hauinge frõ thence no ?sent profitt or disprofitt, ought not by ther votes to charge or order other mens interests. Ther being besids much suspi?on that such votes serue only to make vp a side therby to double yt to cary what yt pleaseth to the disadvantage of such as are ingaged in the ?sent advancemt of the planta?ons and by supplies of men or ?uisions. [2] And therefore wee conceiue his Maties pleasure is. That all men wch are free of the companie and haue§ing§ shares that ether haue had men vpon ther planta?ons: or haue men or servants resident ther vpon ther ?? planta?ons: or vpon a ioynt- planta?on: or are engaged by supplies expecting returne of co?oditie, are enabled and allowed to be ?sent at Co?ittees &amp; Courts. Of wch ther are many hundreds suffycient for abilitie or number to hould Courts. And therfore some declara?on &amp; explana?on may be made of his Maties lettre by his Maties or the Ld? Inter?ta?on and no reason to alter but explyan. Ther peti?on relating reciting the two ?hibicons of his Maties lettres desires the altera?on of his Maties inhibi?ons as ?ceeding frõ his Maty vpon misin- forma?on. The first tending in effect to dissolue the companie by dis- abling them to hould any Court. And Wth this that they durst not he returne agayne to hould any Court vntill the same was revoked: And that the second tended to take frõ them all redresse of any wrongs done to the Companie or any way to complayne. The reasons of these conclusions they left to be drawne and agreed vpon by Sr Edward ye L. Pagett Sr Ed. Sackvile. The Ffarrers &amp;? wch wthout being [3] co?unicated to the Court should be deliu9d as their reasons for th' vphoulding of the conclusions of the peticn.

For the King's letter, see Records of the Virginia Company, Vol. II, pp. 434–435; for the Company's petition, see ante, No. CCCLIX List of Records No. 511 First whereas Yor Matie is pleased to Commaund that none be ?sent at the Court? or Committees of the Companie dureinge the Contynuance of the said Co?ission but such as haue Men nowe or lately planted vpon theire shares and that are at this instant engaged (and accordingly pur- suig) the sendinge of men or supplies by the next shippinge Yor Matie may be graciously pleased to take notice that the Companie for Virginia Consistinge of aboute One thowsand ?sons Adventurers by purse (besid? some fewe others admitted accordinge to the expresse libertie of Yor Mat? graunt as namely the Lo: Marques Hamilton the Earle Marshall the Earle of Carliel and some others of yor Mat? Courte as Sr Henry Mildemay and a very fewe principall officers and eminent ?sons that by sundry good offices haue des9ued well of the Companie all wch haue free accesse and voices in theire Court? by graunt in yor Mat? ?res Patent? vnder yor great seale of England to suspend that originall libertie graunted by Yor Matie and to exclude them from the moste important Consulta?ons of the Company as they conceive it to be noe Way in the power of the Company to doe, as beinge Contrary to yor Mat? ?res Patent? soe it must need? be to theire vnderstandinge a gen9all dishartninge of all men and a ?sage of future evill and as they feare will Cause this great Worke to be forthwth abandoned. Secondly by Yor Mat? ?res Patent? there can be noe Courte kept vnder the number of Five of the Councell and Fifteene of the Gen9allitie wch nomber is impossible to be made vp at this ?sent wthin theis limita?ons nowe ?scribed by Yor Matie For yor Matie may be pleased to be informed that although the engagement and adventures of the most of them that doe nowe vsually followe and attend the Cort? (except those only that haue of late opposed the Company) be very greate and too many of them the best parte of theire estates yet very fewe of them either nowe or formerly haue had any men planted on theire perticuler shares it beinge the Custome for divers to ioyne together in one body or ioynt stocke, and the like Course is held in Magazines and all other Adventures the retornes whereof beinge dayly expected will noe doubt drawe them on to a newe and Contynuall supplie both of Men and provision. But if for any the least tyme the care of them should be neglected (and otherwise then in publi? Court? and Co?ittees they cannot treate nor order them) there must need? followe an inevitable ?iudice if not vtter ruyn of all mens estates there and here and a Certeyne stoppe to that happy Way of the Planta?ons encreas wherein nowe it runnes: Wherevnto not only those whoe doe nowe bringe in moneyes and make supplies but divers likewise of the Auncient Adventurers whoe havinge by the misgovernmt of former tymes lost all theire former adventure can nowe hardly be ?swaded to adventure anewe, Yet theire ?sence in the Court? theire Advice theire industry and other manifold assistance encourageth dayly a multitude of able Planters in ?son to transporte themselues thither and soe to advance the Planta?on: Besid? a greate parte of theis beinge men of qualitie when occasion of publi? benefit as fortifica?on or other provision for the strength or benefitt of the Collonie shall require the gen9all Contribu?on of the Adventurers are and haue beene ever the most ready of all others to lay out theire moneyes as men not fixeinge theire myndes on the hope of hasty gayne from a private Planta?on. Soe that to debarre and exclude them even in this regard much hinder and sett backe the encrease of the Planta?on by depriveinge the Court? of soe many able and vnderstandinge ?sons, and soe well versed and experienced in the busines [2] besides that the good and fayre Carriage of the busines theis last foure yeares hath soe wound vpon divers of the said auncient Adventurers as they doubted not to haue had newe and fresh supplies from them before this; in Case theis late troubles and distrac?ons had not happened And soe much the more doe they Conceive it needfull that the Court? be nowe frequently attended in respect of that gen9all discour- agemt given by that Vnmaskinge of Virginia ?sented vnto yor Matie by Capt Butler Soe that if by the ?formeinge of this Yor Mat? Co?aund the said Court? and other meeting? should for the tyme be discharged (wch they Conceive will of necessitye followe, if Yor Mat? Co?aund herein be still Contynued) must need? breed an instant dissolu?on of this great Worke wch would be hardly ever possible by or meanes to be sett vp againe. Touchinge the later point of Yor Mat? said ?re wherein you are pleased to forbid that noe Complaint be brought to the Co?issioners against any man in the name of the Councell or Companie but that the Complaynant? subscribe their Complaint? wth theire owne names Wee hold orselues bound in the greatest bond of dutie to signifie vnto yor Matie that wee Conceive that in effecte this will tend to noe lesse then an ex- emp?on from any Complaint to be brought against any of those tymes and ?sons Wherein and by Whome huge su?es were in greatest parte mispent; Yor Mat? gratious instruc?ons and direc?ons violated or neglected the Planta?on oppressed, robbed, and ruyned and other outrages of very high nature Co?itted by rovinge and robbing on the spanish Territories in the West Indies and faction lately begunne and maynteyned in the Court? and Companie All wch havinge beene done to the wronge of the publi? and Countenanced by some of or societye there is noe ?ticuler ?son or ?sons to be found of all the Company as Wee Conceive whoe for prosecute- ing of theis publi? iniuries will expose themselues to soe much private Mallice and to such sharpe revenge as hath beene threatned heretofore in some of theis Cases. And they humbly desire that yor Matie wilbe further pleased to take knowledge that the principall Wrong? and iniuries wch they shall complaine of haue not beene done to any ?ticuler. For if Sr Thomas Smith haue not rightly disposed of the moneyes in his Charge, it is not a Wronge to any private man but to the Companie. If Sr Samuell Argall hath ruyned and made deprda?on of the Colony in Virginia the iniurie is not to any ?ticuler ?son but to the Company. If by sending out a shipp by Capt: Argall and his Partners to make spoile vpon the spanish territories in the West Indies there had followed that mischeife wch was both threatned and feared by theire takeinge revenge vpon the Colony in Virginia that had not beene the losse of a ?ticuler, but of the Company. If that inten?on of Capteyne Butlers in his paper of Vnmaskinge of Virginia had taken his desired effecte to the disgrace and Consquently ruyn of the Planta?ons private ?sons might suffer but the Notorious iniurie is done to the Company, and soe they might instance in diu9s other ?ticuler offences done to the body of the Companie and not to any ?ticuler ?sons. And for iniuries done to anie private ?sons except it be the Complaint of a multitude the Company ever intended to leave them to their owne ?secu?on And what they shall doe as an vnited body, they doe not nor cannot wth any ?tence of reason goe aboute the Acte of the Courte to ?occupate the iudgmt of Yor Mat? Co?issioners, or to oppose therevnto any such Acte [3] of Courte. But as the Informa?on of anie ?ticuler man, is the Acte of that one man and standeth only but as his accu- sa?on Soe they humbly beseech Yor Matie that this exhibi?on of their Complaint? may be taken as the Acte of the Courte Complayninge, not iudginge, for they acknowledg the iudgmt to belonge to Yor Co?issioners but im the impleadinge to belonge to the body of the Company. For by Yor Mat? gratious graunt in Yor Mat? ?res Patent? they are in expresse Word? made a Corpora?on and to be Called by the name of the Treasuror and Companie of Adventurers and Planters of the Cittie of London for the first Colony in Virginia and by that name enabled to pleade and to be impleaded as all other Corpora?ons are; The Company therefore havinge never had Cause to thinck that Yor Mat? pleasure is to take away this originall and essentiall libertie by Yor Mat? said gratious ?res Patent? graunted to them, Cannot conceive that Yor Matie meaneth that if the Vnited body of the Companie haue received wronge they may not alsoe ?secute the lawe against such as haue done the same whether he be an Accomptant to them, or haue robbed pilled or defrauded them in their substance, or done them any other iniurie aswell as any other Cor- pora?on or private ?son may doe though the Word? of Yor Mat? said ?re to the greate greife of Yor Peti?oners seeme to importe the Contrary. But for such iniuries as any private man shall ?tend to haue beene done him it was never intended to ?secute them in the name of the body of the Companie; but to leave them to theire seu9all private Complaint?. For they conceive it not to be accordinge to lawe either for the Com- pani[e] to followe private mens Causes in the name of their body, nor for any privat man or men to ?secute in his or theire owne names the causes of the Corpora?on. Knowinge it therefore to be agreeable to Yor Mat? iust and gratious purpose that both parties finde the like indifference of tryall and aseured that it is tendinge to Yor Mat? pious end? that abuses on all sides Where they are to be found should be discou9ed that soe they may be alsoe re- formed; Yor Supplt? most humbly beseech Yor most gratious Matie (Consideringe that the one partie is the vnited body of the Company and the other partie a very fewe private ?sons wch never appeared to exceede sixe and twenty in nomber and not aboue foure or five of them at the most that wee knowe that haue for theis last foure yeares brought either money or Councell to the Ac?on, and the rest of them especially the principall beinge those against whome the Companie most Complayne) that the said body may ?secute theire iuste and greate greif? in such sorte as it is only possible by them to be prosecuted.

Capt Isack Maddeson Sworne and examined saith that (as neare as he remembreth) the first Motion made to him by Mr Grivell Pooley, touchinge a match wth Mrs Jordan, was about three or foure dayes after Mr Jordans death, who entreating this examinant to moue the matter to her, he answered he was unwillinge to medle in any such bussines; but beinge vrged by him, he did moue it: Mrs Jordan replied that she would as will- ingly haue him as any other, but shee would not Ma§r§ry any man vntill she was deli?ed. After this Mr Pooley (having had some private talke wth Mrs Jordan) tould this examinant that he had contracted himself vnto her, and desired him and his wife to be witnesses of it, wherevppon Mr Pooley desiring a dra? of Mrs Jordan, and shee bidding her servant fetch it) said he wold have it of her fetchinge, or not at all: then she went into a roome, and this examinant and Mr Pooley went to her, but whether she were privy to his intent this examinant knoweth not: when Mr Pooley was come to her, he told her he would contract himself vnto her, and spake these words.

June 9, 1623 Papers of Lord Sackville, No. 6212 Document at Knole Park, Kent From Bennetes Wellcome this 9th of June, 1623 Loving Brother Yours Out of the John and Frances I received with letters from Edwarde Haresse and Robert Bennet out of Spain, the 27th of Maye the shippe arrived heare in saftie God be thancked, and out of her I received some 19 Buttes of exclent good wynes, 750 jarse of oylle, 16 Barelles of Resones of the Sonne, and 18 Barelles of Rysse, tooe halfe hoghedes of Allmondes, 3 halfe hoghedes of wheate and one which was staved at seae, 18 hog- hedes of Olives and some 5 ferkenes of butter and one Chesse. Allso I received 1 chest and tooe barelles of Candells, with 3 packes of Linen Cloth marked in your marke and tooe dryfattes of Mr. Kinge's. All these goodes came safe and well condisioned to my handes and the beste that I received since I came in to the lande, and I macke noe question but to macke you by God's helpe good profet one them, and your retorne to sende you home in the same shipe. She is gone, God sende her well, for Canadaye but with her ladinge to retorn hether agene. For the yeare beinge soe fare spente I knowe that fysh will yealde more her thene in Spayne and I knowe her frayght hom wilbe a great mater more, soe I hope I shall not incore your displesures doinge as I hope all thinges to the best for your profet. My laste letter I wrotte you was in the Adame from Newfowndland the which I hope you have received er this. God sende her backe in saftye and this from Canaday. I hope the fyshe will come to a good reckning for vytelese is verye scarse in the contrye. Your Newfowndland fyshe is worthe 30 s. per cente, your Drye Canada 3 l. 10 s. and the wette 5 l. 10 s. per cent, and I doe not knowe nor hier of anye that is comyinge hether with fyshe but onlye the Teger, which wente in companye with the Adam from this plase and I knowe the contrye will carye awaye all this forthe with. Our men stande well to ther helthe God be thanckd and I hope to macke you a good crope, bothe for Tobaco and Corne. The Fortte is abuyldinge apase. I hope yt wilbe a great strenth- ning unto us, for God sende us well to doe this yeare; the nexte year, God willinge, we meane to seatte by them and sette out all this lande, and howsses. Therefore praye lette me intreat you to wrytte me at large whether Capten Basse or Leftenent Barklye or anye other have anye thinge to doe or claym anye lande as ther ryghte, for I macke noe question yf plese God but to blese us this yeare the nexte to have tooe or three hondred men more into our plantasions to be our terretory for yt is the beste state in all the lande, and not the lycke quantitie is grown for good- nes in the lande. Newse I have not anye worthe the wryting but onlye this. The 22 of Maye Captin Tucker was sente with 12 men in to Potomacke Ryver to feche som of our Engleshe which the Indianes de- tayned, and withall in culler to conclude a pease with the great Kinge Apochanzion; soe the interpreter which was sente by lande with an Indian with hime to bringe the kinge to parle with Captain Tucker broughte them soe. After a manye fayned speches the pease was to be concluded in a helthe or tooe in sacke which was sente of porpose in the butte with Capten Tucker to poysen them. Soe Capten Tucker begane and our interpreter tasted before the kinge woulde tacke yt, but not of the same. Soe thene the kinge with the kinge of Cheskacke, [their] sonnes and all the great men weare drun[torn] howe manye we canot wryte of but yt is thought some tooe hundred weare poysned and thaye comyng backe killed som 50 more and brought hom parte of ther heades. At ther departure from Apochinking the worde beinge geven by the inter- preter which strode by the kinge one a highe rocke, The interpretour, the worde beinge paste tumbled downe, soe they gave in a volie of shotte and killed the tooe kinges and manye alsoe as ys reporte to the cownsell for serten. Soe this beinge done yt wilbe a great desmayinge to the blodye infidelles. We purpose god willinge after we have wedid our Tobaco and cornne with the helpe of Captn Smythe and otheres to goe upon the Waresquokes and Nansemomes to cute downe ther corne and put them to the sorde. God sende us vyctrie, as we macke noe question god asistinge. I praye comende me most kyndlye to Mr. Oxwige and tell hime that I hope at the comynge home of the shipes which I hope shalbe the firste that comes for Englande, he shall receive a good parsell of Tobacoe from me with good profet: praye forgete me not to all the reste of our good frindes yourselfe and your wyfe, my brother Richarde and his wyfe with your fatther in lawe and mother and all the reste not forgettinge my chillder whom I praye God to blesse and us all and sende us a joyfull mettinge. This in some haste. I leve you to the mersifull tuision of thallmyghtie in whom I reste Your loving brother, Robt. Bennett. Praye comende me to Mr. Browne and tell him that his boye is with me, for vittilles being scarse in the contrye noe mane will tacke servantes. Soe he shalbe with me untill I cane put thinges forthe. Thancke him for the cheese he sente me, but his boye made use of. Since Tho. Pope and Mr. Danell are gone to George Harison to live with hime untill the crope be in.

June 9 (?), 1623 Papers of Lord Sackville, No. 6204 Document at Knole Park, Kent Right Honorable The Kinge, the State, the plantacion, and my poore selfe, will all have cause to thank you for procureing this Commission. Expedition will nowe bee the life of it, That it may be putt into accion, by Bartholmew day, else this yeare will bee lost as the last yeare was; your Lordship hath tendered the importacion of the Spanish Tobacco to the Companie, they (as they doe all thinges els) applie it to the benefitt of a few, for want of a Stock. I make noe doubt but if this Commission be expediated, but there wilbe a Stock procured time enough to farme the Tobacco for the publique soe as the benefitt gayned shall returne to the good of the Kinge, and the plantacion. Good my Lord in all your grauntes that carrie profitt with them, use the name of the Publique; The word Companie governed by populer voices, is it that covereth all their secrett practises. And it is a shame that the Common weale of Virginia, dependinge on the Monarchie here, should be governed soe, as this little treatise here inclosed will show you. All the examples that I produce to expresse the injuries done, were for the most part in Sir Thomas Smith's government, because from it the planters have learned their inhumanitie and injustice which they nowe use, both against the new comers and adventurers, offeringe the same measure which hath bene measured before to them. But if I should call in question the present governors, whoe beinge not ignorant that the populer goverment doth directlie take away the power of the monarchie and shew what mischeife they have done by their profuse throwinge out libertie, amongst the planters, whereby they have made them forsake their former discipline, strength and vertue to defend themselves against the domestick enemie, and yet beinge fore warned of these thinges it should appeare that they did it knoweingely and wittinglie against the soveraignitie in England, extreame libertie beinge worse then extreame Tirranie, as it appeared by the troubles in Rome after Neroes death, and the Romans (when their estate was most populer) never punishinge their governors more for anie fault, then the neglect of discipline; this might make our governors nowe as much to bee blamed as the former weare, but I delight not to bee an accuser, unles necessitie enforce it, although all the remainder of my estate sent into Virginia is nowe lost therby.

And but of a claye mould &amp; yet §&amp;§ the ayre good and wholesome. And §Also about those places§ good quantities of cleared ground? about those two Townes: but all the land generallie is ouergrowne wth great Timber Trees so that there is little or no land fitt for §present§ culture but what is §what§ by industrie is cleared of the wood or either by the Colony §English§ or th by th'Indians. 4.The fortifications antientlie vsed were by Trench and Pallizado wch now are all gone to ruyne and diuerse blockhouses made of Tymber great Tymber built vppon passages all and the for scouring the Pallizadoes: all wch are now gone to ruyne. 5.The lands where the Colonyes §Townes§ are seated §doe not for ought is knowne§ affoord not stone for building nor limestone for Mortar. But there are good store of Shells about Elizabeth Citie wch will make very good lyme and may by water be easilie transported to the seuerall planta?ons 6.In most places and ?ticularlie about Henrico &amp; Charles Citie the Sodds are §very§ good to fortifie wthall especiallie if they be cutt in the sedgie ground wch is so full of Rootes that it bind? the earth close and keepes it from falling in peices 7.It is very necessarie to rayse new workes especiallie at Henrico &amp; Charles Citie wch by reason of their situation may be stronglie fortified, and are most co?odious for habitation in regard of the wholesomnes of th' aire, access of Shipping, &amp; store of cleared ground? [2] but it is not knowne that there are men of experience in the Countrie fitt to direct those workes. 8.There is good store of earth fitt to make brick almost in euery place; And heretofore much Brick hath ben made in the Contrie And it were would exceedinglie both strengthen and beautifie the plantacons if they §people§ were enioyned to make all their building? thereof 9.This is a very good direc?on And it would much exceedinglie both strengthen and beautifie the plantation if one Towne were some convenient number of houses were built §together§ of Brick and enclosed wth a brick wall that might deserue the name of a Towne: one of these at Henrico (wch is the fittest place of all) and another at the place now called Charles Cittie: But this must be ?formed at the publi? charge for the poore miserable people that are now there doe are doe onlie worke for themselues &amp; their ?ticular owners and are so miserablie poore that all they can rayse by their priuate labour is hardlie sufficient to find them Corne to preserue them from staruing, and to plant some Tobacco to find them clothes: So that vnles there were some vntill there be some reasonable nomber of men wch maynteined only by §at§ the charge of the Companie only to imploy their tyme to worke for §in§ publi? workes, it is there is small hope that the planta?on will be brought vnto any good pass: For as the case now stand? if a man be taken from his priuate labour but for a day or two he it turnes to his great preiudice and he hath reason doth not wthout reason repine at it seeing he take hath no meanes to susteyne himselfe but his owne what he getts by his owne industrie &amp; 10.The 10th 11th &amp; 12th are so good and full that direccons, as nothing can be added vnto them but only to be wished they were putt in execution 13.It is most fitt for his Matie to appoint the §cheife§ Gouernor, and if §the§ such Gouernor§ dye then the Counsell there by pluralitie of voyce to elect one to succeed him vntill they haue his maties pleasure be knowne either for confirming §of§ him that shalbe so chosen, or for appointing some other 14.The s? thing? were §may§ (if so it seeme good to his Matie) be left to the care of the Gouernor and Counsell here, who may vppon all occasions as the matter is of more or less waight aduise wth the Aduenturers and Vndertakers and agree vppon §such§ Rules orders and direccons as may be the shalbe thought most behoofefull for the generall good and benefitt of [3] Answ [Touching the direc?ons giuen by his Matie concerning the Planta?on in Virginia 1.It is very necessarie that it be examined he whether the direc?on giuen for the releife of the Colony haue ben ?formed: for the last Shipp that went thither is now gooing thither carryes so many passengers that it is doubted the ?uisions wch she carryes will hardlie be sufficient for those pa men.

List of Records No. 554 After or very hartie Comendations Our last vnto you were by the Bonny Bess, by wch Shipp also the Lord? of his Mat? most Honobl Privy Counsell writt vnto you, both wch we hope you haue long ere this received; yet of or owne letters we heare inclosed send you the Copies: Touching the Comission we haue nothing to writt the proceeding? therein not haueing yet come to any conclusion that we know of, wherefore as til then we must be silent, so we hartely pray you in the meane time not to be moved wth any vncertain or partiall rumors wch yo shall heare, but to go on wth vnity, courage and constancie, in that great worke comitted vnto you; to the advancement whereof (we doubt not but) this Comission will in the end much conduce, according to the Royall intention of his Matie declared in the Institu?on thereof; vppon wch we are confident and so desire that you rest, being assured (wch by many admirable examples we haue found) that as this enterprise of the Plan- ta?on, hath beene cheefly in or inten?ons, so it is in the accepta?on of God, a work especially destined for his honor and service, and therefore shall in the end prosper and come to ?fec?on; In the hope whereof and the testi- mony of or owne consciences, to haue wth all sincerity of inten?on and indeavors ?formed the vttermost of or abilities, we are much comforted amid? those sorows wth wch we are deeply touched, vppon consideration of the mortallity scarcitie &amp; discomfortablenes, wch we vndrstand to be amongst you; for the first, and last, we can giue no other helpe then or humblest prayers to the devine Matie, nor other Counsell, then that wth true repentance and ?fect amendment of life, you labor to apease the wrath of God, that burneth so fiercely: But for relief of the scarscity and great want? wch by some private mens letters, sent home in the Abigall, was expressed to be in the highest degree of extremity: as soone as we had notice thereof from the Lord? of the Privy Counsell, although we were verie confident that err the supply could ariue from hence, you would be abundantly stored by a plentifull harvest, yet for the declaration of or tendr care and zeale for you, whereof not only the Lord?, but his Matie him- self (as we from them vndrstood) was in his Princely mind much solicitous; we procured an vndrwriteing of 7001 to be sent in Meal by way of a Maga- zine; as for all other Comodities we found by the vndrtakeing of private ?sons, you would be supplied even to su?fluity: of this supply of Meale, there goeth along in this Shipp the George about 40 hogshead? the rest imediatly follow in the Hopwell and Marmaduke, wth mr John Hart whom the Adventurers send ouer the Cape-Marchant thereof; but if the George ariue before his comeinge they intreat mr Blany to take care thereof vntill mr Harts arivall, and in case mr Hart should miscarie, they do consigne both this and the rest of the Meale that shall followe, to mr Blany, to be by him sould to theire best profitt, and the proceed thereof, together wth the account to be returned vnto them by the first. Two great difficulties we found in compassinge this kind of supply: the first a co?on hope, that the plenty of the New harvest, whereof through yor promises there was raised a generall confidence, would make it needles; the other, the extreme high rate that good corne doth here at ?sent beare, wch though it should come opportunely, would make it vnwelcome; yet hath the zeale of yor welfare, and feare of leaving you to any doubtfull extreamity, overcome all private interest, in the mind? of these noble and worthie Adventurers; wch as we wth much thankfullnes for yor sakes here acknowledg, so we think you bound wth all gratfullnes to accept, and to show and yeeld not only all due Justice, but all possible favor, vnto theire factors that a speedy and profitable returne of these Adventurers may be made them. Wee here inclosed send you the Roll of Subscription, esteeming the names themselues will effectually ?swade you, and the whole Colony, to conceaue of theire mind? as * * * and to endeavor theire iust desires, as we wish, by a full retribution: we haue * * * accompt of what it stand? in ? bushell, to be sent you, wch we desire you to make knowne to the Colony, and wth all that Tobacco doth not here cleare one wth another xxd. a pound, nor any likelyhood that it will mend in prize; wherefore we pray you first to sattisfie yor owne mind?, and then others, that by theire true valuation of Comodities, we here may be freed from those vniust and most vndeserved taxa?ons of oppression, wth wch we are scandalized, of selling Meale in Virginia at thirty shilling? ? bushell, because for xli of tobacco, when as truly by account offred vnto vs vppon oath, we are certaine that the Meale sent the last yeare stood in aboue 12s ? bushell, and the 1500 waight of Tobacco returned hither vppon that accompt by mr Blany is at this ?sent offered to be sould for 3s the pound, when the Custome, fraight &amp; other charges, together wth the wast, being deducted, there will not remaine at the most aboue 18d p?: so that the greatest gaine that can be hoped is 25 ? Cent?, a gaine to high indeed in a certaine and orderly kind of trade; but this is accompanied both by Sea and land wth so many hazard?, and is spunn out to such a length of time before the Store be returned, that none here wilbe ?swaded to adventure vppon those tearmes, in whom the desire of yor good, is not more strong then of theire owne profitt. As for the last yeares Magazine by how much the paine and loue in procur- inge was more extraordinary and the losse that hapned in the Su?er Ileand? the greater, by so much the more do we earnestly intreat yor assistance and favor to mr Blany if he shall need it, for the recovery of the debt? vppon that Magazine. wth the same care we recomend likewise vnto you that former Magazine sent in the Warwick, wch being of neare 20001 and two yeares time now past, there hath been by mr Blany returned not 2000 waight: wee are moved thus ?ticulerly to recomend these bussinesses, considering, that although the interest be of private men, yet the conse- quence is of most publique good, or evill, to the Colony: Besides in these two there is due from you Sr Francis Wyatt, and you mr George Sandis a ?ticuler and especiall care, in regard that as vppon yor faith and security, the last yeares Magazine was sent; so the first that went along wth you, was in the greatest part adventured vppon confidence that yor su?intendent care should not be wanting to cause a due and profitable returne; wherefore in the Adventurers names we very especially recomend them vnto you. And although they do no way suspect the integritie of mr Blany, yet being much, and iustly as we conceaue offended that he hath not at least sent home the account?, wch by how much the returnes were the slacker and poorer ought to haue beene don the more exactly &amp; fully they haue besought vs to desire you to require of him a ?fect account, of what he hath sold, what he hath remaninge, and what Tobacco or debt? are in his hand due vnto them vppon these account?, wch accompt? they desire may be deliured vnto mr John Hart, who is to return wth them, and the good? themselues, wth the first opportunity: but of these thing? theire private instruc?ons and Comissions will further advise you; we haue desended to this ?ticuler at theire instant request, in regard that they suppose that this or publique reco?enda?on wilbe a warrant vnto you, wth lesse offence, for ?formance of strict iustice where it shalbe needfull in the recoverie of debt?: and on mr Blany it imposeth a necessitie not to spare any since if he would he cannot; wch conduceing so much to the end wch he faithfully promised the benefitt of the Aduentures, we conceaue he cannot but be gladd of; and we haue willingly therefore thus donn; besides as it is or desire, so it is the Aduen- tures offer that both theire account? in Virginia and here, should be opne and knowne of all, that ye fairnes and sincerity of theire Inten?ions might be evident by the smalnes of the gaine they proposed vnto themselues, and the constancie of theire loue in the continuance of Supplies after so many and great losses. The Adventurers that sent the Maid? desire likewise or recomenda?on of the bussines vnto mr Pountis, from whom they hope the full return this yeare, wch we earnestly desire, that it may in the same, or some other profitable maner he readventured. The ffurr-Adventurers by the wick- ednes of the Captaine and Mariners is quite ourthrowne; wherefore we desire the Addition of yor care, in the Glass, and Shippwright?, that thereby some ?te of amend? may be made if possible; for the last it was the most costly and chargeable that we ever vndrtook and therefore, we most especially recomend it vnto you all, and in ?ticuler vnto mr George Sandis. And whereas mr John Ferrar besides his large Adventure therein is engaged 2001, therevppon we cannot but add or publique request vnto you, since both his mind and the benefitt it self were so publique, that the proceed of theire labors wch we cannot thinke but to be good (howsoeuer much empaired by the losse of so many principall men) may be carefully collected and returned to him by the first. This, and the rest of these bussinesses, we haue thus ?ticulerly and largly touched now, not that we doubt yor best endeavors of iustice, care, and favors, would haue beene otherwise wanting, haueinge beene so often for- merly recomended vnto you, and in theire owne nature deserving it so much: but that we think it or dutie wth as much care to solicitt the retri- bution from you, as we did wth desire importune the Adventurrs from hence for you. The advancement of Staple Comodities, we haue so often and so largely written of, that we haue now nothing to add, but that exept there be some speedy ?formance, by the settinge vpp of some better Comoditie then Tobacco, neither can we hope for the encrease of the Plantation, nor may you there already expect subsistance, so vilde will the prise of that weed be vppon the great glutt? of the next yeare, wch as we assure or selues will bring in foure times the quantities, will likewise abate aboue half the prise. The Vines and Silk are in yor owne powers powers to effect, and we hope a good entrie hath beene made into them, according to yor promise, whereof if we may see some [29] fruite as we hope to do this returne, it wilbe a grreat repaire not only to ors and yor credi[tt] but to the honor of the Plantation, wch hath much suffered in the long delay of these so ?mised work?, that not only the Maligners of this Plantation, but even diurs frend? and well willers therevnto seeme to stagger in an vncertainty of belief, either of the Cuntries fittnes for them, or of the sincerity of yors and or intentions for the accomplishing of them: but we wish and hope that some reall proofe thereof returned from you, shall iustifie both, in assurance whereof, we do not desire you to begin, but to continue in that you haue begunn, and in an effectuall maner to prosecute them; by a generall setting them vpp in all convenient places, by a strict ?serving of the Mulberie trees, that they be not wasted (wherein we are informed there is great neglect;) by an exact and strict account, of the ?formance of ors and youre Comand? in those point?i by the encouraging those that are forward herein, and punishing them that are backward; and lastly by all possible meanes that may conduce to the speedy and full effectinge, of these two great workes. And whereas the ffrenchmen are they on whom, in greatest part, the progresse of these depend; we especially recomend them vnto yor care and loue, desiringe that theire want? of apparell and other necessaries, may by you be supplied to the full, out of the Companies Stock there; and whereas there covenanted times do shortly expire, we pray you so to deale wth them, as they may be ?swaded to continue, if not for ever yett at least so long, vntill theire skill and knowledg in those thing? may be deriued into such numbers of or people, as may be sufficient for a large imployment in those work?. And in this thing we pray you to vse yor best care and wisdomes considering that it will not be easie, if these men return discontented, to procure others from theire cuntrie, neither is it indeed possible to the Company now extreamly in debt, to be at so great charge for the sending anew of others, as these men came to; wherefore we earnestly pray you, not to lett the occa?on and meanes in yor hand? to slipp away, wch if you do we know no possibility of repairing it; yet would we not haue them by violence, or any vniust meanes deteined (wth wch Gods blessing will not go along) but by faire and gentle ?suations, and by the offer of so beneficiall covenant? vnto them, as they may rest paid wth, and you be certainly able to ?forme: for as for vs here at home, although we are not out of hope (haueing verie iust and due ground therefore) in convenient time to raise a reasonable Stock of money, yet till we may see it effected, we thinke it not honorable vppon vncertainties, to engage or certaine faith, for payment? in this kind; wherefore we pray so to contriue it, as theire satisfa?on from hereafter may arise from Virginia: And because vppon or contract wth them, there is and wilbe a great Su?e due vnto them, we very earnestly desire the vttermost of all youre endeavors; and in ?ticuler the care and fidelity of mr George Sandis, for the sending home of mies, wch we pray you wth all care and constancie to prosecute by all good courses both of warr and policie, so farr as may stand wth iustice and truth, for howsoeur they are worthie to receaue it, yet are you to worthie to vse any false dealinge, and we desire that yor proceeding? may be so faire as may not only be free from the fault, but any iust ground of suspi?on. Concerning the sending home of the Sassafras as last yeare in the Abigall, where it had come fraight free, it would haue been profitable, so now on the contrarie, it would be of damage wherefore we pray you not to go on that course, but to find some other way toward? the dischargeing of the fraight due vppon the Abigall, the account whereof we here send you, being not a little grieved, that you did not last yeare ?forme what we had vndrtaken, being as we conceaue most easie to haue beene donn, but we pray you that amend? may be now made and we thinke it equitable that they who last yeare should haue alon ?formed it, should now more liberally contribute vnto it. Yor vndrtakeing? to build a forte we much comend, and much long to heare what progresse you haue made therein; we pray you what you haue so well begunn, may be constantly ?secuted vntill it be fully effected, and that no difficulties whatsoever cause you to neglect it. Itt doth not a little greve vs, that we are not able to ?forme that supplie of yors ye Governor and Treasurors Tenant?, wch we promised, and you iustly expect; or failing therein hath beene and is through those accident? wch we neither could foresee before they came, nor can now through them so freely dispose of thing?; we pray you therefore rightly to waigh the occa?ons, wth yor damage, and to beleeue or solicitousnes to make you amend?, is litle lesse then yor owne desires; and or hopes are that before the next Spring we shall sattisfie both. In the mean while, those Tenant? that belong to the Company, wch were vnder Capt Nuce his Co?and, we pray you may be directed and employed in the most beneficiall maner for themselues and vs; And we are content in reward of Capt Nuce his service (as also [30] for her owne vertues sake, whereof we haue heard good Co?enda?ons) to bestow vppon mrs Nuce his widdowe, the profitt of those mens labors this present yeare, that did belong to her husband? office if he had lived; wherefore we desire you that she may enioy them, and we do not only think her worthie of iustice in all other respect?, but of all favor that you can shew her; So wth or prayers to God for the guidinge and directing you, in all yor waightie affaires, that it may be to his glorie, and yor owne good; We bid you hartely farewell. Given in a great &amp; generall Court held for Virginia the 6th of August 1623 and ordered to be sent in the name of the Company, to the Governor and Counsell of State in Virginia. pag: 30 Postscript: By this Shipp the Hopewell you shall receaue three great Bibles, two Co?on prayer book? and Vrsinaes Cathechisme; being the guift of an vnknowne ?son for the vse of those Churches that most need them.

List of Records No. 563 A Proclamation against stealing of beast? &amp; Birds of Domesticall &amp; tame nature. By the Governor and Captaine generall of Virginia. Forasmuch as the healthfull and prosperous estate of this Colony, depend? vpon nothing more, then the plentifull encreasing and ?serving of all sort? of Beast? and bird? of domesticall or tame nature, whereof there haue of late beene farr greater store secretly stolne and wasted by lewd and ill disposed persons, then in former times; to the great losse and dis- couragement of many Planters, and to the no smale ?iudice of the Coleny it self. And howsoeu9 heretofore the Stealing of some of these, hath not beene prosecuted as ffelony and punished wth death as according to the lawes of England it might haue beene, vppon wch remissies men haue more ?sumed: Yet now the necessitie of the time requiring or living nearer together, and in greater bodies (and so the more exposed to these mischeifs) hath moved the Governor and the Counsell of State to order and decree, and absolutely resolue in these cases to proceed most strictly and exactly, according to the lawes of England, aswell against all con- cealors and accessaries, as against the principall? themselues. And to the end that all men may know the danger of the law in these cases (though ignorance of the Law excuse no man) they haue thought fitt to publish the same, wch is, that whosoevershall steale any Beast? or Bird? of Domesticall or tame nature, that is to say, Horses, Mares, Colt?, Oxen, Kine, Calfes, Sheepe, Lambs, Goat?, Kidd?, Swine, Pigg?, Hens, Geese, Duck?, Pea- cock?, Turkeys, or any of like sorte the law adiudgeth it ffelony and punishable wth Death, if it be found by the Jury to exeed the value of twelue pence: otherwise if it be found vndr that value, the parties so offend- ing are to be corected at the discretion of the Magistrate by whipping, or the like punishment. And though in England the vallue of some of these tame thing? is farr lesse, so as the stealing of them is often found (in favor of life) but petty Laseny and so toucheth not the liues of the offendors: yet here they are of farr higher rates, by reason of theire scarscitie, and there- fore wilbe found punishable wth no lesse than Death.

use given, made, held, granted or confirmed, and, by the said name, give, grant, demise, let, dispose, assign and alienate their goods, chattels, lands, tenements, and heredita- ments whatsoever to any person or persons whatsoever at their will, the same Nicholas ffarrer [et al.—the same 24 names, "free men", etc., "and other free men", etc.], say that before the aforesaid time specified in the aforesaid information, to wit, the twenty-third day of May in the seventh year of the reign of our said lord the King who now is of England, etc., our same lord the King who now is, by his letters patent in due manner completed, sealed under his great seal of England and produced in the court of our said lord the King who now is, bearing date at Westminster on the same twenty-third day of May in the seventh year of his reign of England, etc., aforesaid, reciting by the same letters patent that since, at the humble supplication and petition of divers beloved and well affected subjects of our lord the King himself intending to found a colony and to make a habitation and plantation of divers of the people of our same lord the King in that part of America commonly called Vir- ginia and in other parts and territories in America, either pertaining to our same lord the King or which had not been possessed by any Christian prince or people, within certain metes and regions, our same lord the King by his former letters patent bearing date the tenth day of April in the fourth year of his reign of England, France, and Ireland, and the thirty-ninth of Scotland, had granted to Sir Thomas Bates, Sir George Summers, and others, for the quicker accomplishment of the aforesaid plantation and habitation, that they themselves should divide themselves into two colonies, one of them consisting of divers knights, gentlemen, merchants, and others of our lord the King's city of London, called the first colony, and the other of them of divers knights, gentlemen, and others of the cities of Bristol and Exeter and the vill of Plymouth and other places, called the second colony, and had given and granted very many and divers privileges and liberties to each colony for their quiet settling and good ruling in the same, as by the same former letters patent then more fully appeared, for that divers beloved subjects of our said lord the King, adventurers and planters of the aforesaid first colony, who before the time of the completion of the same letters patent of the aforesaid date of the twenty-third day of May in the seventh year of the reign of our same lord the King had engaged them- selves, in moving the business of the same plantation and with the help of God had intended further to prosecute that business to a happy issue, then lately had humbly prayed our same lord the King that, in respect of their great expenses and of the risk and danger of the lives of very many of them which they had exposed to dangers and risks in the investigation and plantation of the country aforesaid, our same lord the King would deign to grant to them a further enlargement and explanation of the aforesaid grant of privileges and liberties, and that such councillors and other officers should be appointed among them to order and direct their businesses as were prepared and willing to adventure with them and also whose dwellings were not so far distant from the city of London that they would not at convenient times be ready and prepared to afford counsel and help as occasions required, our same lord the King, cordially desiring the effective prosecution and happy success of the afore- said plantation, and thinking worthy of praise their desires in the same business to progress more eagerly in the accomplishment of a work so excellent and pleasing to God and useful to the realm of our lord the King, of his special grace, certain knowl- edge, and mere motion, did for himself, his heirs and successors by his same letters patent give and grant and confirm to

Autograph Letter signed, with seals List of Records No. 596 Sr yu give me often cause to iterate my thanks, for you care of my busines. I have written to yu in a letter apart, touching the rumor of my debts: wch I pray yu speedily communicate to so manie of my assured frends as yu shall think fit, Mr Keightley, Mr Barbor, Mr Wheatley, &amp; if yu please Sr John D?vers, &amp; som others: who I trust will control that false rumor where they meet it. It is plain that it wrought on the Knight at Fan- church: And I conceive H. H. was made the instrument. It would much trowble me that it should woork also on my frend G. B. then whom I thought I could have none more assured. Neither will I think otherwise till I heare from himself: wch as yet I have not §doon§ this Term. And till then I forbeare my answer to yor brother Nicolas: wch I presume he will not misconceive of. It were hard &amp; not discreet, to presse a man necessarily absent, to pay in all his debts on a sodain: wch beeing impossible, must break out into mischief. And verily an enimie, were better then such a suretie: But I will never interpret an hastie woord to his woorst. There shall no man sustain losse by me, nor trowble by suit: Of this be assured: Neither will I use credit longer, then of necessitie. And now to my busines. The 22l.. wch yu have received from the Pordages, is to be thus disposed of: Fortie shillings to yor self, for the half moneth over: §&amp;§ the 20l.. to yor mother, wth an addition of 10l.. more from Mr Kay: who (I speak it to yor self only,) hath had my money in his hands a good while, &amp; som of it (viz 51l..) these 4 moneths: a parcell not yet by him acknowledged: But so much I perceive, both by my Receivor Mr Hardwick, &amp; my Bailie Richard Waind, in their severall letters. The provision wch I made was timelie enough: I needed not have trowbled anie man, had I been delt wth as was fit. The next payment is of my Bond to Sr Nicolas Tufton, for 207l.. 10s.. on the 24th of this moneth: wch must needs be discharged: for so I promised. But his use of the monie is not till the last of the Term. Toward this, after the 10l.. paid to yor mother, there wilbe in Mr Kays hands of the 250l.. paid to him this Term by Mr Hardwick, but—118l.. 3s.. 4d.. Then that other 51l.., paid §at York§ to his use in the beginning of August last, I presume he will not denie. In Mr Cuffs hands of 30l.. 12s.. 6d.. wch he received of my Rents, there is now remaining only 3l.. 3s.. 9d.. And thus much is readie: wch cometh in the whole to—172l.. 7s.. 1d.. wch wanteth of the due Sum 35l.. 2s.. 11d.. Toward this there is 20l.. in the Town allreadie, sent up by one Mr Binks: who hath written to me that in the end of the Term, he wilbe there himself wth the Rest of my monie due from his charge: wch I count cannot come to so little as 30l.. more: There is also now with me one Mr W. Kay my Tenant, who is indebted to me very neer 100l..: toward wch he hath brought up about 80. firkins of Butter: the proceed whereof in monie is to be for mee. I am also written to very confidently, that Sr Ed: Stanhops Rent of 40l.. 6s.. 8d.. wilbe paid there this Term. And wch I had before forgot; there is remaining in Mr Hardwicks hand, wch he writeth shalbe readie 6l.. 4s.. All wch put together, (&amp; I make no great dowt but within these Ten days it will all, or very neer all come in;) would beside that Bond, discharge also my other bond of 103l.. 12s.. to Sr Nicolas Tufton, due on the 26th of this moneth: &amp; also my interest of 27l.. to Mr Abdie &amp; Mr Godscall: wch is all that this Term I desire to pay: My Baylies also advertize me, that there wilbe paid in at York, in the end of this moneth to be returned to Mr Ro Ray 160l.. more or thereabout. So that had I but a frend there, who could &amp; would spare me so much for the tyme as to make up those paiments, it should be thankfully requited wth the *one of dowble as much more for a tyme as long, or else wth the interest as the partie should desire. The cares of these particulars I have divided to som other of my frends, Mr Barbor, &amp; Mr Cuffe: yet it contenteth me also that I have likewise imparted them to yu.. who I knowe are desirous that all my busines should prosper, &amp; wilbe assisting wth yor good woord &amp; encouragement.

Before December 7, 1623 Papers of Lord Sackville Document at Knole Park, Sevenoaks, Kent A FORME OF POLISIE TO PLANTE AND GOVERNE MANY FAMILIES IN VIRGINEA, SOE AS IT SHALL NATURALLY DEPEND ONE THE SOVERAIGNETYE OF ENGLAND. Whereas we aswell by our Letters Patentes beareing date at Westminster the 10th daye of April in the 4th yeare of our raigne, as by diverse other Letters Patentes since that time graunted, have given licence unto diverse of our loveing subjectes named in those severall Pat- entes, to conduce and conduct severell coloneys of our loveing subjectes to abide in America, within 34 and 45 degrees of the equinoctiall, with diverse preheminences, liberties, and au- thorities as by the sayde Patentes appeareth, And whereas wee knoweing this derived author- itie from us, to bee the efficient cause and the speciall meanes wheareby wee shall attayne the endes proposed to ourselfe for the undertakeing of the sayde plantacions, did give likewise to- geather with our first Patent certayne Articles and Instructions, theareby settleing downe our forme of government for the governeing of the sayde severall plantacions fitted at that time to those poore beginninges, and promiseing farther that as the Plantacion should encrease within the degrees aforesayde, Wee, our heires or successours, would ordayne such farther instruc- tions, lawes, constitutions, and ordinances, for the better rule, order and governement of such as shall make plantacion theare as to us our heires and successours shall from time to time bee thought fitt and convenient, limiteing our selves onely to frame them in substance conso- nant to the Lawes of England (1) This preamble, be- inge the difinicion of that wee intend to doe and framed to the attaineing of our last end, wee maie terme the contract of this our marriage, whereof I have wrytten a treatice handling everie worde of it, and shewinge that the object (to witt) To plant and governe and the subject manie fam- ilies in Virginea, and the end to which the efficient, that is this pattent and authority wee have from the kinge, should bee or- dained, which is to cause the plantacion naturally to depend on the sovoragnenitye of England. Theis being the esscentiall and for- mall differences, I hould the worke to bee truelie defyned. Yf then the end bee it that must teach us the meanes to conduce to it, and that the right ordaineinge of the effi- cient bee the principall meanes to attaine our end, then the question wilbe quicklie descyded whether it bee not better to authorize one sett forme of govern- ment both heare and in Virginia framed to the attaineing of our end, and soe leave the lawes to bee ordained accord- inge to that forme, or ells that the adventur- ours here should give lawes and government by populer voyces to the planters in Virginia as if they were their tenantes or servantes. The said planters being aswell free subjects to the kinge, those that venture theire lives aswell as theire goodes, and those that must hould the plantacion to England, if Aristotle's rule houlde that, that right which works most to the attaineing of the politick End must be preferred, this question is by it descyded see the word polycy. And whereas wee have since contrarie to our first proceedeinges beene induced by severall Letters Patentes dated ... to ordayne and institute severall orders of governementes, in our southerne and northerne plantacions now tearmed Virginea and New England, therein applieing our selves to the desires (and as wee feare the private endes) of the adventurers heare, which layeing the groundes of their governement accordeing to their private interest and severall joyntestockes, have governed our free subjectes in Virginiea as if they were their servauntes, Wee knoweing thearefore, that thease severall formes of governementes doe breede distractions, as well amongst the adventurers heare, as our loveing subjectes the personall planters, and understandeing that the joynte- stockes of the Southerne Plantacion (whereon their governement heare by voices was founded) is now spent and gone, and the plantacion dothe subsist onely of the ould planters now made free of severall private collonies, planted by Patentees, and of diverse publique servauntes, planted by the Collections and Lotteries, And that the plantacion is now soe strong that it is able to defend it selfe and fitt to put one the face of a commonwealth, Wee (being the politicke father of the whole and not lookeing one [on] particulars in respect of it) considering and knoweing that the perfection and happi- nesse of a commonwealth, lyeth not soe much in the spaciousnesse of it, but first and principally in the governement, consisteing in the mutuall duties of commandeing and obeyeing, next in possessing thinges plentifully, necessarie for the life of man, doe professe that next and im- mediately after the honour wee shall doe to God in converteing of the infidells to the knowl- edge and worshippe of Him, we intend wholely the good of our subjects: first to the planters and adventurers, then to the planted, which wee would have soe cherished that they may prove planters themselves, and to that end endeavoureing to cause both England and Virginea, to endowe each other with their benefittes and profittes that theareby layeing aside force and our coactive power, wee may by our justice and bountie marrye and combinde those our provinces to us and our soveraignetye in naturall love and obedience, Wee will make this marriage our politicke and last end, to teach us what are the meanes that conduce to it, and to give both measure order and end to them. To which purpose not suffering any one to growe to greate, for feare of shaddoweing and hindering the rayes of our Majestie to shine over all, Wee will give to each planter advaunce- ment in the governement, accordeing as hee shall give farthorance thereto. In regard thearefore this our soveraigne and uniteing power (and the facullties theareof takeing theire roote from our majestie in England) is to spread it selfe amongst many aswell differing in condition as severed in distance and place, Wee (findeing that nothing canne reduce this many into one againe but forme) doe ordayne one setled and imoveable forme, to governe all the plantacions within the degrees aforesayde, which forme being maturely deliberated, ever one and the same, soe as wholely intendeing the end, it shall worke noething but good theareto, wheareby yt shall not onely serve as a medicine to cure all the malig- nities that the plantacion doth naturally bring with it, by reason of the distance of the place, but it shall alsoe by waye of right and interest procure us apt instrumentes for the form to worke by, and prepare matter of apt condition for it to worke one [on], soe farr forth, as if wee laye the forme aright, to matter soe capeable of it, wee may conclude that the properties of the forme must of necessitie followe. The matter thearefore whereone our forme must worke being the people and the place, which are to bee distinguished and divided, and our soveraigne faculties limited to them by funda- mentall lawes and order, Wee will first give lawes and order to the people and then we will appoynte them their places, fortifiecations, and manner of spreadeing. The reasons why this force is not to bee used is sett downe in the treatice of Difinitio chap.— The tretyse on the word Remidys. The reason why the forces and soveraigne faculties should not bee put into one hand, reade the said treatice uppon the words Governe and forme. Reade the treatice up- pon the word Policie. Theis bee the true prop- erties of the efficient cause, which in our case will onelie bee effected by a settled forme that must prepaire apt in- strumentes and matter of apt condicion for it to worke on, perticuler formes being united and determined by theire certaine perticuler mat- ter, see the treatice on the word forme. First thearefore that God maie the better give a blesseing to our endeavours, wee doe strictely charge and commaund all our presidentes, councelles, magistrates, patriotes, governors, and ministers within our sayde severall collonies, respectively within their severall limittes and pre- cinctes, that they with all diligent care and respecet, doe provide that the true word and serv- ice of God and Christian faith bee preached planted and used, not onely within everie the sayde severall collonies, but alsoe as much as they may amongst the savage people, which doe or shall adjoyne unto them, and border uppon them, accordeing to the doctrine, rightes, religion, and eclesiasticall forme of governement now professed and established in England. And because wee knowe that where Moses and Aaron agree not there religion will not onely bee scandalled but the soveraignetye must needes goe to wracke, therefore wee doe ordayne that whoesoever hee shall bee that shall refuse to bee governed by our eclesiasticall government estab- lished, he shall bee heald and esteemed as a resister of our soveraigne power, commaundeing all our administers of justice, whome it shall concerne, not to suffer any person or persons to remaine or abide within our sayde plantacions, whoe shall professe any doctrine contrarie to oures, or shall attempt to withdrawe any of our people inhabiteing or which shall inhabite within any of the sayde colonies and plantacions (or any of the naturalls bordering one them) from the same governement or from their due alle- geance to us our heires and successours, which persons soe often offendeing shall bee aprehended and imprisoned, untill hee shall throughly re- forme himselfe or otherwise where the cause shall require it be banished Virginea and sent to England heare to receave condigne punishment, for his or their offence or offences. And because wee are informed that some of the former governores both heare and in Virginea have contrarie to their patent, and our Royall instructions which tyed them to make their lawes consonant to the lawes of England, framed and caused to bee printed a certayne tyrannicall booke of governement, which being sent into Virginea, and noe other supplies of foode or apparrell sent either with them or within 3 or 4 yeares after them, wheareby many of you our subjectes, being forced to breake them for wante of foode and necessaries have misereablely lost their lives or bene brought into slaverie, and whereas this giveing life to lawes is one of the highest poyntes of our soveraignetye given us from God to benifitte not to destroye our sub- jectes, wee shall hould our selfe guiltie of the injurie done if wee should not see it extreemely punished. And this being done in the face of our majestie what may wee hope for soe farr of [off] if it bee not narrowely looked unto. Being therfore most jealous of our honour in that kinde, wee doe straightely chardge and commaund that noe instrument of our soveraigne power shall dare to encroach uppon any parte of our soveraignety, further then they shall bee war- ranted by the councell of state, or by thease our orders and lawes now sett downe, uppon payne of hightreason. And to the end this lawe shall bee the more strictely kept wee will give the goodes of such offendoers to the publique treasurie makeing the publicke both judge and jurie of this offence as will after appeare. Moreover because wee are fullye perswaided that wee canne noe waye better attayne unto thease our end designed then by planteing of many private colonies, severed by distance and place, Wee therefore doe especially chargde, commaund and ordayne that all planters of what condition soever they bee, shall enter their names and subject themselves under the government of some one coloneye or other, to bee governed accordeing to the rules and orders by us now sett downe uppon payne of being taken for rebbels and outlawes. And wee doe further charge and commaund all our presidentes, councelles and magistrates, within their jurisdictions, that onely the offences of tumultes, rebellions, conspiracies, mutinies and seditions, such as shall come to that hight, that they shall prove dangerous to the state theare, togeather with murders, manslaughters, incest, rapes, and adulteries, togeather with such offences as wee by thease our lawes and orders, shall make fellonie or treason, to bee committed in those partes within the precinct of the degrees before mentioned, and noe other offences, shall bee punished by death without the benifitte of clergie, except in the cause of manslaughter in which clergie is to be allowed. It followeth now that we sett downe thease our orders, degrees of councellers, magistrates, gov- ernors, and all under officers belongeing to this our forme, which falls out, first to devide all our adventureours into two orders, severing such as are free of our soyle and trade onely, from them that are citizens and free of our governe- ment. This severing our de- grees accordinge as every one appropriates his freedome to him- selfe fundamentally by purchase must naturally take awaye all conten- tion aswell for equall liberty as for riches and consequently lottes founded on a rethmeti- call equallytie, for every one will labour to main- taine the propriety of his freedome in his de- gree according to his right as well as his goodes and landes. And Cicero in his Offices saith that thoughe by the instinct of nature, men were drawne into sotiable assemblies, yet the better to save the propriety of their goodes was the funda- mentall end that made them fynde out heades, governours, and presi- dentes of citties, the mouthe of equall lib- ertye therefore must needes bee stopped, and this maintenance of theire degrees will im- moveably fixe the forme of the collonie, and it will bee a greater greife for anie cittizen to have a note of ignomynrie layed uppon him to bee suspended from his de- gree, or suncke a degree lower than it was by the lawes in printe to bee burnte throughe the tongue, whipt or made gallislaves, by this meanes we maie avoyde all corporall punishement for free- men except it bee where the case deserves death, and this will breede in the planters the more noble spirittes. Of the first order there are likewise 2 sortes, servauntes that haveing served out their time, and tenauntes that have estates in dependensie of their masters and landlordes, togeather with freedome of trade, but have noe shares. The second sorte are such, whoe goeing one [on] their owne charges they gayne a share, and like- wise freedome of trade but are not citiezens till they have not [?] carryed over 2 men. The second order of adventurers are such whoe appropriateing unto themselves their freedome, their landes and their degrees by purchase, they communicate either in the choice or participa- tion of councells and magistracies and them wee call our citiezens devideing them into 5 degrees. The first degree is the patriot or patrition, they are such as are first named patentees in the particular plantacions of colonies, cities, and corporations, thease shall bee such as haveing good estates in England they shall carrie or drawe over with them to the number of 300 men as their parteners and adherences of whome they must bee protectors and for whose good abeare- ing they must bee pledges. The second degree are such as are admitted to bee of the order of governors by the patriot, whose name being joyned in the patent, the power of cheife governeing those colonies, if they bee thereunto elected shall be graunted unto them. Thease must likewise have estates in England either in land, or money in banke, and they must carrie over, or send, as many men, as the patrition of the colonie and they canne agree to have their names soe put in. The patrition may alsoe at any time after admitte as many into the colonie as hee please, they bringeing men to him to encrease his colonie. The 3rd. degree are such as shall bee maiores and aldermen in the foresayde citties and corpora- cions, and they shall carrie over sixe men. The 4th. degree shall bee common councellors, and they shall carrie over foure men. The 5th. degree are commoners, and they shall carrie over two men. And if any one shall committe any act wheareby his life and goodes shall bee forfeited to us, though his life bee pardoned hee shall bee suspended from his degree till hee hath brought over a certayne number of men, accordeing to the quallitie of his first degree, to restore him to his sayde degree agayne. Moreover wee ordayne that of all thease 5 degrees, the eldest sonne onely shall bee of his fathers degree and the younger shall bee of the degree belowe it except they canne rayse them- selves by carrieing of of men. And further wee ordayne that the meanest servaunt that goeth (God soe blesseing him and his endeavours, that hee canne purchase and [an] estate in England or compasse to carrie over or drawe over with him of his friendes and adherences the number of 300 men) he may become a lord patriot which is the greatest place the commonwealth canne beare. Now for the choice and election of our officers, magistrates and governours, wee must beginne at the lowermost degree, sc: the commoners that carrie over 2 men they shall choose out of them- selves the burrowehoulders, surveyours of the high wayes, and such like officers. And out of them that carrie foure men they shall like- wise choose their common councellers, church- wardens and such like officers. The common councellers shall choose their aldermen and shreiffe out of them that carrie 6 men. The aldermen shall have a maior by turnes except some greate disabillitie happeneth and then the next in turne shall be maior. The Maior and aldermen shall choose their governour either out of them that bee admitted to bee of the order of governours by the patrition, or the patrition himselfe. The maior and aldermen alsoe of [each] severall corporation shall have power to choose out of their corporation one of the order of governours or the patrition himselfe to bee of the provinciall councell, which councell being all chosen out of the patritions and the order of governoures in everie province, and consisteing of 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, or 15, they shall have a monethly president by turnes, whoe haveing 2 voices, hee shall for his moneth call and breake of [off] all assemblies, and untill the councell of union bee compleate, wee give them the same power, which wee doe give to our sayde councell of union, makeing all theire decrees to stand as lawe, till they are disanulled by us, by the gen- erall parliament in Virginea or by the sayd councell of union, when it shall bee compleate and in force, accordeing to our order now sett downe. This riseinge order, the lowermost orders chooseing their govern- ours out of the upper- moste, will necessarilie suppresse popular lib- ertie and keepe the soveraigne faculties and the commaund of the forces aloft in these feof- fees handes that our forme shall put them, soe as frameinge all the un- der degrees in a depend- ensye on the heades of the colonies, whose or- der haveinge the same authoritye, nomber of forces, manner of seate- ing and fortifying each one of them that the other hath, whereby they wilbee brought to an equallitie. Theire jealousye one of each other will by maintaine- ing that equalitye keepe anie one either from usurpinge further au- thoritie or by increase- inge the strength and nomber of his colonie then our forme doth give him, and thus the com- onweale consisting of the persons not of the place, wee by gaineing the affections of theis in- strumentes by theire private intresses and es- tates in England, give- ing them such sufficient power as shall make it a commonwealth able to maintaine it selfe by itselfe soe farre forthe onely as it shalbee un- yted by us their sover- aigne. Soe frameinge the government that it shall give all men both liberty and meanes of riseinge to the greatest places and honours therein, whereby they will receave such con- tent that they will all strive to maintaine it in the same forme wee shall now settle it, wee maye for theis reasons give them the elections of their owne governors, at which all free sub- jectes doe naturally de- sire. This councell of union being the most soveraigne councell wee will tearme a Syncretisme or councell of union with the councell of England and this councell shall bee chosen onely out of the patriotes of everie province, by a component number of electours chosen out of the order of governoures which are not patritions, one out of everie particular corporation, which electors shall bee chosen by the maior and aldermen the major haveing the casteing voice, and thease electoures shall choose, 4, 3, 2, or 1, out of everie province as necessitie shall require. This coun- cell shall have 3 monethly presidentes, by alternate changes which untill wee have councellers wee will shew the manner of it by letters thus abc aec ahc alc aoc acf abo abf abi ahm apb abd def dhf dlf dof dbf deb dfg dei dem dep dec deh ghi gli goi gbi gei gim ghe ghm glp gbi gbf ghk klm kom kbm kem khm klh kmp klp khc klf kli kmi nop npb ncp nhp nlp nep nel noc nof noi nom noa Thus the councell being of 15teens, if you order them in this sorte the same 3 men shall not in 5 yeares space meete togeather to bee presidentes, whereas if they were to take their circularie courses, without changes, they should meete once everie 5 moneths The groundes and rea- sons of theis severall counsells why wee make three presidentes of this Syncretisme or councell of union, and why they take their courses by changes according to theis letteres sett downe are theis. Genoa hath three presidentes, soe likewise had Marcelles which is commended by Cicero to be the best commonwealthe that was in his time, in the worlde. Wee nominate them monethely, be- cause offices of greate power amongst equalls must not contynuelonge, and the shorter they are the lesse they maie enter- prize against the state. Arist. pol. li. 2 et 3. Wee give them theire turnes because mutuall preferment equally be- stowed by turnes dothe preserve and defend citties and common- weales; Arist. pol. li. 2. Three presydentes be- cause of the odd nom- ber, three is beste, two beinge as much in pro- porcion to one as 8 is to 4, soe as althoughe to dispute and trye and ex- amine a cause, the even nomber is to bee pre- ferred before the odde, yett to conclude and give sentence the nom- ber of 3 imployes by necessitye a concludeing of it, either all 3 con- senting to it, or ells two to one, which is suffi- ciente authoritye to car- rie the cause in question. This fault therefore that is not unjustly laid up- pon arristocracies that they are two longe a determyneinge the busy- nes of the common wealthe, whereby the monarchall forme is farre preferred before it, will by this meanes be taken awaye, this nom- ber of 3 addinge more authoritie to the decree then the voice of one doth, that was not for nothinge that there was sixe severall magistrates in Rome at one tyme consisting of Tryumbers. Reade in the booke termed the jeometricall motion, to which I re- ferre them that desire to bee better instructed herein. This allowance and lym- itacion of a dictatour is onely in cases of ne- cessytie because des- perate diseases must have desperate reami- dies, poysons expeling poysons when the body of the state and coun- cell is rent and torne in peices into factions which deades and de- stroyes the power of it, when the armye abroade mutynies or is distressed by being invyroned, be- seiged or caught in some straight, then and not tell then must it be cured with this onely and extreamest last healpe of nameing a dictatour, whose word governing all, the mag- istracies being sup- pressed, the lawes made sylent, hee must not bee called to an accoumpt for anie thing hee shall doe, by the councell there. Thus the sworde beeinge put into the handes of some one brave and austeare co- maunder, whoe resolves and executes at an in- stant wee cannot expect that the resolucions that come from a councell can bee soe suddaine, nor cann the councell execute ought but by such an instrument no more then the head can worke withoute handes, but this wee must bee sure of, that he that is soe chosen must bee well affected to the state heare, he must bee an austeare gover- nour, whome the people are afraide of, his time lymitted must not bee too longe. The presidentes being thus ordered their 3 voices or two of them shall conclude all causes that shall bee controverted by equall voices and not con- cluded in the bodie of the councell, the eldest counceller of which presidentes shall summon and breake upp all assemblies, the number of this councell must bee 7, 9, 11, 13 or 15 at the most but in the minoritie of the plantacion 3 may serve without any presidentes, the elder counceller of the 3 to summon and breake of [off] the assemblies. And our will and pleasure is that (besides the oath of our supremacie which all our subjectes there shall be sworne to once everie yeare at the least) there shall bee a particular oath framed, for all thease councells to take, viz: that all their decrees shall bee made aswell for the uniteing of Virginea to the crowne of England as for the combindeing of the members to the whole, and that they will to their uttermost power en- deavour to prevent all usurpation of encroach- ment uppon our soveraigne authoritie whatso- ever. Reserveing therefore to ourselfe our most high absolute and perpetuall power of com- maundeing and controuleing all, that thereby our commissions and writtes of justice may spread themselves over everie person, and in everie place through our whole dominions there, we doe graunt that this soveraigne councell, shall have authoritie to unite in commaund, and to appoynte the number of the forces, puteing the power of commaundeing them into one of our marshalls handes as cheife, to all by turnes, or to each one severally as occasion shall require, giveing them our sayde councell likewise au- thoritie to proclaime warre and make peace with the naturalls of the cuntrie, to taxe tributes as- well for a treasurie for England as for Virginea, to dispose of the treasurie in Virginea as the councell in England have of the treasurie in Eng- land, To make contractes with the king or com- panie in England and consenteing with them accordeingly to rate the prizes of comodities, which shall bee sent hither or thither, to ap- poynte the places where the forces and colonies shall bee planted, to condemne and pardon, to banish, to confiscate, to proscribe accordeing to the laws ordayned, To call magistrates and governours to accompt, and in case of necessitie limiteing his time shorte and the place certayne to institute any one man that shall have soveraigne power as the dictatoures in Rome, and all this their authoritie and all thinges they have done theareby shall bee firme and of force till it be disanulled by us and our councell in England. This councell of union cannot be compleate, till there bee 3 provinces. In the meane time the provinciall councell shall serve the turne, wee giveing them the sayde authoritie to excercise and use within their owne provinces. Now in regard the active and groweing quallitie lyeth in the well foundeing of private families, and collonies, wee (as a spurre to industrie, sheweing that the heades of thease colonies are sparkes derived from our hereditorie monarchie) doe give and graunte unto them and their heires for ever, the hereditorie commaund of the soveraigne forces, limiteing them to use them onely in their owne collonies and in the wastes adjoyneing to them, except they bee authorized to use them farther by the soveraigne councell of union, and to the end they shall onely em- ploye this our sword and forces to the sup- porteing of our soveraignetye and the maine- tenaunce of our justice theare, Wee will give them for the reward of their service thease titles and honoures followeing. The degree it selfe because wee cannot give them better names, they shall bee called Patriotes or patritions, when they are 300 strong and planted abroade then shall they bee tearmed knightes patriotes with the title of Sir. When they have attayned to bee 600 strong, at which number wee (in- tendeing everie planter and servaunt to bee the father of a familie) doe stente the colonies that they shall not exceede above soe many families (or that anoether colonie hath issued out of them) our will and pleasure is that their sonnes and heires shall bee then knightes patriotes and they themselves shall bee Barrons and tearmed lord patriotes, their wifes and other children takeing their honoures and places accordeingly. In time of peace they shall bee and have the authoritie of our leiuetenauntes of sheires in England, to appoynte the commaunders of our men at armes, see them trayned, to looke to their armes and watches. In time of warre they shall bee charged with what number of men the councell of state shall thinke fitt. The patriot must bee allowed his leiuetenaunt aswell in cases of disabillitie, by nonage or im- potencie, or in their abscence either about the busines of the state theare, or about their private busienes in England, but these leiueten- auntes shall bee chosen by the order of aldermen out of the order of governoures the better to give the sayde order of aldermen content. And whereas the patriotes are the principalest ringleaders and greatest adventurers, which carrie and drawe with them their freindes, kindred, followers and adherence out of their naturall countrie to a place soe farr remoate, to be protected governed and cherished by them, Wee doe there- fore will and commaund all our sayde patriotes, loveingly carefully and cheerefully to performe this their trust. And wee doe ordayne that after admonition for being churlelish and negligent in that kinde, they shall bee noted with a note of ignominie, if they shall not endeavour the helpeing and protecteing any of their foresayde adherence, by all lawfull meanes they may, and this wee charge as well all our presidentes councells and marshalls to looke carefully unto, the rather to drawe the Indyans to the like dependencye. And wee doe further ordayne that from the time that the patriot shall bee planted abroade, his estate of inheritance in England, togeather with his honoures titles and inheritance in Virginea, shall bee soe united and made one to him and his heires that he shall not sell the one without the other, and that sale to bee made by the consent of our councell of union in Vir- ginea and our Virginea councell in England, or the most parte of them meeteing at their generall courtes and not otherwise. And if it happen that the patriot doe dye leaveing noe heire male of his name then shall it goe to the female and their heires. And the eldest daughter of the patrition, and the heires that shall challenge by the female side and their children shall beare the patriotes sirname, if they will inherite the sayde honoures and landes, which if they shall refuze that then the nexte of the kinde either by the father and then of the mothers side, takeing the patriotes adopted sirname shall enjoye the sayde inheritance. And because wee knowe howe dangerous it will bee to the state to suffer thease greate honoures and inheritances, to bee conjoyned either by com- binations, leagues, and marriages, wheareby some one familie may growe monsterous in the state, thearefore wee doe establish and ordayne that noe person planteing or inhabiteing within any of our provinces within the degrees aforesayde shall make any leagues, combynacions or contractes either by worde or writeing, or confirmeing them by oaths, offensive or defensive, to the mainetenaunce of any faction whatsoever, uppon payne of forfeiteing their goodes and lives as fellons, and to prevente the combindeing and conjoyneing of thease honoures in one house by marriage wee doe further ordayne that such eldest daughter or heire female as shall marrie with any patriott, or the heire of a patriott, shall disinable herselfe from inherriteing her fathers or predecessours patriotshippe thereby, except shee marryeing of a husband soe inamored with her that he shall sell or give away his owne partiotshippe and soe shall take the sirname of his wifes auncester, he may by that meanes inable himselfe to inherite her honoures and estate and soe by marryeing the inheritrix of the patriot, hee will bee accompted a kinde husband, and that will be his portion. The principall intent of frameing this lawe being that noe one subject shall either by purchase or any other meanes unite the forces, theareby to inable himselfe to bee stronger then any of his order. But to the end that love may bee mayntayned, and that theise degrees may not estrange the upper orders from the lower, wee wish that the heires and eldest sonnes of the upper orders may marrie with the daughters of the lower orders, soe to rayse their wives fortunes. And that the daughteres of of the upper orders being heires may marrye with the sonnes of the lower orders, makeing choice of the most vertuous, soe as vertue may advance both men and woemen to marriages, and that all degrees may bee thereby bound togeather in the bonde of love that none may be scorned but the scorner. To this end alsoe, although wee would not have you imitate the Irish in their wilde and barbarous maners, yet wee will commend one custome of theires unto you, which is that the poorer sorte sueing to gett the nurse- ing of the children of the lordes and gentrie, and breedeing upp in their minoritie as their owne, this breedeing, together with their custome, doth begett anoether nature in them to love their foster children and brethren, as if they were naturally bread of the same parentes, and they are accompted most vile and base that shall neglect any good oportunitie to shew their thankefulnesse and love thus begotten and bread betweene the riche and poore. And because wee will give all furtherance of the spreadeing of thease newe collonies wee doe thearefore ordayne and appoynte that all such ser- vauntes that shall be carried at the carge [charge] of any adventurer or planter, both those servauntes that are soe carryed over and their ser- vauntes, with their servauntes servauntes, shall bee tyed to plante in consorteshippe with their first masters, and shall rise and remove with them to plant a newe colonie when their foresayde masters shall bee enabled by our forme thereunto. which shall bee after hee hath gayned and [an] estate in England and is able to drawe over or carrie with him 300 men, leaveing the collonie hee was first planted in 300 strong or up- wardes. The next magistracie is the governour, him wee ordayne after the death of the first patriott to bee annuall by election, but dureing the life of the first patriott hee shall bee governour and afterwardes his heires shall bee honoured as head of that order but shall not governe unlesse hee bee theareunto chosen. The governours charge shall bee to see the lawes, decrees and orders aswell in the publique governement of the colonie as in the private families observed. hee shall controlle all men for breach of manners and discipline, first giveing them private admonition and afterwardes publique if they perscever in their misdemeanour. Hee togeather [with] the maior, the shreife, the churchwarden, and one commoner chosen by the rest of the commoners, the governour haveing the casteing voice, they shall have power to indite for breach of lawes, and to suspend from degrees for breach [of] manners accordeing as in their discretion shall be thought meete. The next order that wee ordayne is the maior and aldermen, togeather with the shreife, all which 3 orders in matters of triall of life and death, wee ordayne that they shall bee tryed either by the councell of state or the provinciall councell, the jurie that tryeth them being to bee of their owne ranke and order, and in case where there are not soe many to bee founde, they shall bee supplied out of the order and ranke next beneath them. And wee doe give as well to our provinciall councell as to this degree and order the jurisdiction over all persons and degrees under their order, they haveing some one learned in the law to direct them. And wee doe ordayne that both our sayde severall councells and the sayde maiour and aldermen, shall have full power and authoritie in theire jurisdictions to heare and determine as well all capitoll as criminall causes, which in the precinctes of their severall colonies or corporacions in manner and forme followeing (that is to saye) by twelve honest and indifferent persons, as neere as canne bee of the plaintifes and defendantes rankes and orders, then the sayde juries to bee chosen indifferently out of both their orders, which juries are to be returned by the marshalls, for the provinciall councell, and by the shreifes for trialls in corporations, thease jurours being sworne uppon the evangelist shall accordeing to their evidence to bee given unto them uppon oath, and accordeing to the trueth in their consciences either convicte or acquitte the persons accused and tryed by them, or shall trie causes for matter of right, betwene the plaintife and defendaunt, guided by their consciences and by evidence one oath delivered to them, wee giveing authoritie to the provinciall councell and to the maiour and alder- men, in either of their jurisdictions respectively to repreeve and put of [off] execution of any one adjudged to dye, but wee will graunte noe power to pardon death, to any but to our greate Councell of State. Furthermore for the ordering of our under orders in thease our corporations wee doe ordayne that everie alderman shall have his severall warde devided to them accordeing as their number of citiezens encrease, and everie one must have a common counceller under him as a deputie whoe must ap- poynte under them everie tenne men a taskemaster chosen out of the commoners, or of the best laboureers, thease must worke in the head of their file, and giveing them good example must direct and over see them. And the taskemasters and common councellers must weekely relate to the governoures, whoe loytereth and whoe taketh paynes, and they must be rewarded or punished accordeingly. Thease taskemasters and common councellers in their wardes, must alsoe take care of all sicke persons, and they must complaine of masters that abuse their servauntes, in suffering them to want either foode or apparrell. All thease thinges must bee cer- tiefied to the governour and hee must see it amended, for they and the whole colonie as a bodie politicke, must make good to the state there and heare all the covenauntes that the patriot, the governour, aldermen, one common counceller or one commoner or 3 of them of the sayde colonie of which the patriot or governour must bee one, shall undergoe to any ad- venturer that sendeth servauntes thither, or any trades men that shall trust them with wares, for such colonies as are raised there, they shall give warrant under the seale of the colonye, before 5 of their councell there. And the councell there sendeing their letters of credence to the councell heare, they shall binde the colonie whome the letters concerne to performe all covenauntes that they shall undergoe. Thease covenauntes must bee acknowledged and sealed heare before the Treasurer and his deputie and foure councellers, and then they must stand as a statute to binde and make lyable all the goodes and persons of any personall adventurers in the sayde colonies, the arest of them or their goodes to bee made either heare or theare. The like shall bee done for all collonies that shall bee raised heare, certificcate being made by the councell heare, of their warrauntes acknowledged in courte, and this shall binde all their goodes and persons theare to bee aunsweareable to any seasure that shall be made for not performeing the covenauntes signed and sealed as aforesayde. This assureance as well of their owne goodes they adventure as all the goodes of that colonie wherein they adventure, will give such satisfaction to adven- turers, that shall either have sonnes, brothers, or kindred that they meane to doe good too, that they shall neede onely to lend them their adventurers for, 5, 6, or 7 yeares, as the colonie and they canne agree, and then they may have their moneys repayed. Moreover because where the busienesse of the commonwealth is left to manye, there everie one putteing it of [off] noething is donne, therefore our Councell in England nominateing 9 persons (whome they shall thinke meete) to us, wee will make choice of 3 of those 9 to bee principall magis- trates planteing them in each province one, which shall have power to see each magistrate, counceller patriot and governour to execute their office, to see the lawes and orders observed, and to execute the decrees of our councells as our shreifes doe in England. And thease being capeable of the generall commaund of the forces throughout their severall provinces when the Councell of State shall put the sword in their handes, they must onely have power to censure indite and suspend, but hee must have noe jurisdiction. Thease 3 magistrates having soe good alloweances as the plantacion will afforde them, they shall settle their estates in England and have noe estates in Virginea, everie one haveing certayne men allowed them for their guard by the collonie, And houldeing their places for a time limited by us and our Councell in England and removeing them from province to province as wee shall thinke meete. Thease wee appoynte to bee our marshall governour, and are to take their directions, both of take- ing upp and layeing downe the sword accordeing to their commissions by the councell of state in Virginea graunted and giveing ane accoumpte of their actions to the sayde councell, at their comeing out of the feilde. Furthermore wee considering that this greate power given amongst our magistrates councells and governoures may (as wee have formerly shewed in the lawe provided against the abuses of the sayde soveraigne power) prove to bee the undoeing of our obedient subjectes that are to live under it and bee commaunded by it, And soe may turne to the ruine of the com- monwealth, Thearefore it concerneing the whole bodie politicke aswell as everie particuler member, that it may bee the better looked unto, and the more severely punished, wee doe ordayne a Syndex or magistracie, framed out of the 5 orders or degrees, 3 a peece out of everie order, that shall soe often as the generall parlament meetes have power to enquire, examine, trye and adjudge (as neede shall require) all the greate councellers either of the state or of the provinces, the patriotes, the governours, or any other that shall have the administration of justice within any of our sayde provinces or collonies. And whichsoever of them shall bee found guiltie of oppression or the encroacheing farther uppon our soveraigne power then to him or them or [is] limited by thease our orders, or warranted by our councell of state, they shall have power to punish them accordeing to the lawes, either with losse of life, goodes or banishment. The goodes of which offendoures, wee will bestowe one [on] the publique, whoe haveing caught the wolves and stripped them shall have the fell for their paynes. Noe scentence must passe in this magistracie under 10 voices, none of death under 13een. This magistracie must continue dureing the time of the Parlament. Everie counceller or magistrate that shall bee ques- tioned by this magistracie, must stand 8 dayes subject to this inquisition and triall, in which time it shall bee lawfull for any man to accuse him, and after wardes being acquitted he shall have a certificate under the handes of thease magistrates, certiefieing his integritie in his place, which may remaine by him as a merke of honour to him and his posteritie. To choose this magistracie, there must bee a provinciall parlament called, one out of each order of the 5 orders in everie corporation, which being mette and the orders sorted and severed by themselves, they must write everie one his name to whome they give their voices, and then the partie out of everie order which hath the most voices must stand as choosen for this magistracie. Thease magistrates shall bee called the Protectoures of the commonwealth dureing the time of their magistracie. To the purpose thearefore that wee may forthewith have thease our orders lawes and forme of governement, put in execution, wee doe first charge and ordayne that all our councellers in Virginea shall perswade and pre- pare first and especially the ould planters and all other adventurers that are planted there and have servauntes, to devide themselves into consorteshipps of 30ties or 50ties to bee principall men in thease our par- ticular collonies, and that they planteing themselves as neere one to the other as may bee, will prepare houses for certayne other planters or serv- auntes that shall be sent to them, of whome they shall take charge, they being payed aswell for those their houses as for their undertakeing the charge of servauntes, by them that shall enter or adventure into con- sorteshippe with them. And that such our councellers, as have estates in England or Ireland and such other of the planters as canne procure 300 men to joyne with them, to bee suretyes one for each other that within 7 yeares they shall purchase estates in England, to such a value as shall bee thought meete. Thease shall be allowed to bee patriotes. And wee doe farther will and charge our councell in England that they give furtherance to all such as shall bee soe consorted, to supplie them with planters that haveing estate heare may bee either patriotes or of the order of governoures. And to cause adventurers that will onely send servauntes thither to joyne with those ould planters, giveing them reward for their paynes, and for such hundredes as are now planted onely with tenauntes or servauntes, to cause the ould planters that are freehoulders to joyne and plante with them, and likewise to send to them patriotes and gov- ernoures that have estates in England, to plante amongst them, that the ould planters may both helpe to instruct them and keepe them to their laboures. And the colonie may bee aunsweareable, both to the state for their allegeance and to the adventurers for their adventures and that they will not graunt any farther patentes heareafter to any other but such as shall bee enabled by this our forme to take them. And in regard that our planters in Virginea may bee the better furthered by the companye in England wee doe ordayne that everie collonie after it is 300 strong shall appoynte 3 deputies of their principall adventurers whome they best trust, resideing in or about London or Plimouth, whereof one of them being nominated to bee the principall shall bee authorrized to bee present at all consultations with the councell of Virginea and New England, to consulte uppon the election of officers belongeing to the courtes there, and about contractes with the King or companie about auditeing the accomptes. The whole order and classis of thease men, being tearmed the preconsulters, shall have a negative voice to staye and hinder all thinges that shall bee prejudiciall to the planters in Virginea giveing in their names, their consentes or their denialls for the matter questioned in writeing, the other two deputies shall bee as agentes and factors to buy and sell the goodes transported and returned to and from Virginea. An wee doe further charge our councell in Virginea, that in the interim whilst thease thinges are doeing, they will send out certayne flatt bot- tomed vessells to discover to the southward where the best places (most especially for health) are to plant one [on], and that they will likewise prepare long and large vessels flatt bottomed, like those they tearme flutes in the Low Countries, that in transporteing our men they may laye drye in them till their houses are made or built. For the seateing and ordering thease severall plantacions because they require a good judgement uppon the veiue of the place (there haveing beene either none or verie slight discoveries in that kinde), wee must leave it to the wisedome and judgement of you our councell in Virginea, but wee knowing the manye inconveniences that doe heape themselves together both uppon the plantacion and the governement in our planteing in grosse, which noething but a potent domesticke enimye should enforce us to, And considering that the naturalls of the cuntrie are soe weake, that the strenght and largenesse of the cuntrie is soe greate, soe as by the fortiefieing of the mouthes of the rivers and keepeing the center and middle province of the plantacion strong, And knoweing that the devideing of our forces in soe strong a cuntrie will bee a principall meanes not onely to encrease the strenght of them by our retireing fightes from one collonie to the other, tyering, debillitateing and anoyeing an assayleing enimie and draweing them to all places of disadvantage, but alsoe to bee a speciall helpe to the attayneing of all other our defined endes, Wee doe ordayne therefore 3 provinces, a southerne, a middle, and a northorne province, planteing our collonies in them, accordeing as wee shall finde the rivers to lye, planteing not above 2 collonies one one river, One at the falls to make bridges to coste the cuntrye, and anoether not farre of from the mouthes of the sayde riveres, and they being noe farther of [off] in distance one from the other but that they may second one the other in 3 or 4 dayes by land, which manner of planteing and seateing them, will not onely bee and [an] impulsive cause enforceing by necessitie the continuance of the governe- ment by us now ordayned, but alsoe and [an], especiall meanes of gayneing healthie places to plant one [on], a meanes to enlarge our dominions, a meanes to encrease our navie, a meanes to discover the comodities of the cuntrie, a meanes to make tame and civill the Indyans, a meanes to make our commaunders the better agree, a meanes to keepe our collonies from generall mutinies and oppresseing each other, a meanes to keepe them from makeing leagues and aydeing each other agaynst the soveraigne councell, a meanes to ballance one province and collonie by the other, a meanes to make them joyne against anyone that shall rebell against the generall governement, and finally a meanes to make the patriotes greate within their owne collonies and wastes adjoyneing to them, thus planteing them and equalling them in number, seateing, ordering, and fortiefieing them, our religion, discipline, governement, eclesiasticall and civill, the ordering of our families, and the tying of the naturall Virgineanes all to coheare accordeing to our forme, everie thing will bee soe united and made one in dependencie, as the essence and being of it shall naturally depend one our soveraignetye. Now because wee will shewe you that the duties of commaundeing and obeyeing are mutuall, haveing hitherto endeavoured to winne you to a loveing obedience of thease our lawes and orders sett downe in this forme, as wee intend wholely for your good and advauntage, wee by waye of retributeing our love for your obedience doe promise that heareafter if you shall either finde out there groweing, or plante there any commoditie that shall bee of necessarie use in any of our dominions, that then payeing us our customes and impostes, and being able fullye to supplie us with the sayde commodities, you shall have onely the bringeing them in. And because wee knowe that this spreadeing and groweing quallitie doth necessariely require a publique groweing stocke, in performance of this our promise, wee doe give unto such as shall desire to plant estates in England, the sole importation of tobaccoe, that you may plant estates aswell in England as in Virginea, wee doe enjoyne you that if by restrayne- ing it that it come not two fast into England, and by keepeing it in banke heare, it shall prove worth 4 or 5 pounds, yee shall bee payde halfe of it in Virginea in commodities and servauntes at easie and reasonable rates, and the other halfe shall remaine in banke in England, in good handes (you receaveing 6 in the hundredth) to imploye as you shall thinke meete, The surplusage proffite above 4 or 5 being imployed as a treasurie for the publique. Wee will order that there shall bee servauntes and cattle equallie sent to the collonies, the benifitte of whome they shall have the 4th. parte of it for takeing the charge of them. And because wee doe knowe that a sett and frugall habite is the best meanes to advance a groweing commonwealth to the one that yee may banish superfluitie and that everie degree may bee knowne by their hab- bites, wee doe charge and commaund you to sett downe amongst yourselves certayne frugall and inchangeable fashions, for each degree to weare, giveing to the ould planters some noate of honour to distinguish them from others. And that this may bee the better donne, wee doe ordayne, that there shall bee a megasine for the publique, the stocke whereof shall bee raised out of the ould debtes and the fines of such as have abused the governe- ment, which stocke shall still bee upheald and increased as the plantacion increaseth aswell by the benifitte of retourne of commodities, as by one 4th. parte of the publique servauntes labours, by and [an] increase of the 4th. parte of the cattell, and by a rent to bee reserved out of the landes where the publique servauntes shall bee planted, when they are once made free tenauntes. We haveing thus not provided you a meanes to plant estates in England but put you into the waye how it shall bee donne, our busienesse will bee soe to order the seateing, fortiefieing and the manner of the spreadeing of your collonies, that it maye bee for your healthes, and strengthening of you, soe onely, as you may not strengthen yourselves against our publique state. And because soveraigne seates are onely to bee used where the person of the soveraigne hath his continuall abydeing, therefore wee doe ordayne that noe colonie shall bee planted one [on] the mouth of any navie- gable river, where the channels maye be commaunded or shall take any soveraigne seate naturally strong to commaund both sea and land, but shall leave the mouthes of all the riveres to bee fortiefied in that manner the state shall thinke fitt, onely with small fortes bastions or bullworkes that maye contayne 20 or 30tie men a peece, to handle their ordinaunce to beate and commaund the channells. But because prepotencie is the principall thing that you must all take heede of, dwarfes and gyantes never agreeing well togeather in one familie, ranke or order, wee will leave this to your cares whome it doth most especially concerne to looke unto it, willeing and commaundeing you that noe peece of grounde within the degrees before limited, shall bee taken and fortiefied, by any our subjectes the planters theare, but first a commission shall bee directed to certayne surveyoures some of which shall bee well experienced in fortifiecation, a record being kept of the names of the commissioners, togeather with the condition of the place, the quallitie, quantitie and manner of the forti- fiecation by them all owed to bee made, that not onely thease commis- sioners if they shall connive and suffer such fortes and places of advauntage to bee taken and fortiefied may receave condigne punishment therefore, but alsoe it may make all such planters as shall fortiefie contrarie to the alloweance of the state to bee unexcuseable, which offence accordeing to our lawes of England, wee doe ordayne that it shall bee fellonie. Now for the manner of the fortiefiecation that they may bee all equall, wee will and commaund that there shall bee one sett forme for all, and that citties bee fortiefied with bricke and stone walls onely, not of any greate thickenesse, but battalemented one the toppe, flanked without and tarrased within more for comelynesse then strenght, planteing them either uppon easie and accessable assentes, or else one levell groundes, by small rivers as farre from marshes and ill aires as may bee, not suffering any to fortiefie within gunneshott of the banke of any greate navigable river, neither one collonie to plant one both sides theareof that they may not annoye either those that plant above them, or such their neightboure collonies as shall abutte againste them, but wee would have them plante one [on] such small riveres as are fordeable, and wheare bridges may bee made to passe them, there they shall plant one both sides, if the riveres bee not the boundes bettwixte two collonies, in which cases none of the sayde collonies shall plant within gunne shotte of them, the fisheing being common to both. One [on] thease riveres if wee shall plant our townes in the middest, our wastes and commons next and our cuntrie villages last, makeing them soe strong as they maye bee sufficient defences agaynest the Indyans, and the placeing those villages in and [an] orderlye distance one from the other, everye planter that is but of 2 or 3 yeares standeing will knowe his station, the manner of the fortiefiecation and buildeing aswell as the Romans knew their campe. But for the manner of spreadeing and devideing our collonies, wee will take example by King Alfridde whoe first devided Eng- land into several sheires or sextions and appoynted over everie sheire and [an] earle to commaunde his forces theare, which sheires hee alsoe devided into lesser partes whereof some bee called Lothia [lathes?] of the Saxon worde, which signiefieth to assemble, others he tearmed hundredes, because those that commaund over them, had jurisdiction over a hundredth pledges, others the tearmed tytheinges, soe named because there was in each of them ten persons, whearein each one was suretye and pleadge for the others good abeareing, and whatsoever hee was that was not of creddite to bee receaved into one of thease tytheinges hee was either subject to the marshall law, or else committed to prison and there made worke like and [an] idle droane. if this course bee now taken in Virginea and that the Indyane within the wastes adjoyneing to the collonies, were by your gentle usage drawne into thease polliticke orders, whereby each collonie should have their propper Indyans beelongeing to them, whoe seeth not what greate benifitte would arise to the plantacion theareby.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CDXVIII. Captain John Bargrave. Copy of a Letter to the Lord Treasurer Middlesex1 1 This copy is in Sir Nathaniel Rich's hand. It reads in some minor points as though he had misread the original. It has been compared with Additional MSS. 12496, fo. 454, and differs in some important particulars. The document in the British Museum is addressed to the Lords of the Council instead of to the Lord Treasurer. Differences are indicated in the footnotes following. Still a third text, addressed to the Lord Treasurer, is No. 6157 of the manuscripts of Lord Sackville preserved at Knole Park, Kent, and printed, under the heading, "Captain John Bargrave's Pro- posals", in the American Historical Review, XXVII, pp. 511–514. It seems to be a later version than the one here printed (running to "seventhly" in the early paragraphs instead of "sixthly"), yet is endorsed by the Lord Treasurer's secretary as received December 7. Early December, 1623 Manchester Papers No. 402. Additional MSS. 12496, fo. 454 (Caesar Papers) Document in Public Record Office, London; also in British Museum List of Records No. 604 Right hob?e after 10 yeares service in the warres in the summer time, and at my study in the wynter, whereby in some measure I informed my Judgment in publiqu[e] buisinesse, and 7 yeares since now latelie spent in observing the abuses of the Virginia Company, and studdying the meanes to rectifie them, being forced and necessitated to be an earnest follower, and studdyer of the same by losse of my Estate, I may now Claime to my- selfe the right of being Maister in that art, Challenging all others that shall oppose what I write, and makeing it good that it is impossible for any one (that shall newly enter into the buisinesse) to be able to setle this Planta?on. I will take this proposi?on for the ground of my maister- peece, and proue by right reason (wch Plato saith is the ground of pollicie) That honors, liberties, and freedomes, togeather wth returne of profit, or- dered to the Workeing of our pollitique End?, would plant Virginia, and worke those effect? wee all aimed at. From this ground I raise these 6 head?.2 2 These entire paragraphs preceding are omitted in Additional MSS. 12496. 1.First I vndertake to show the meanes to draw a sufficient Nomber of men that haue good Estates here, to plant in Virginia, wth their persons &amp; good?, and to Cause the planters in Virginia to plant Estates in England. 2.Secondlie so to seaver and divide the facultyes of sov9aintie, and the Co?aund of the forces amongst those men so estated that they shall never meete vnited in power, but to advance our politique end of holding the Planta?on of §to§ England. 3.Thirdlie by makeing vse of the naturall strength, and largenes of ye place, so to marshall those men, as they shall not onelie make the Plan- ta?on to spread, and growe, to find out the best Co?odities, and inlarge the King? Dominions, but they shall secure it both from forraine Enimies, and inable it to give lawes to the Domesticke Indians. 4.Fourthly, the imploying of those men there to make the best &amp; sud- dainest returnes hither. 5.Fiftly the mannageing and ordering those returnes so, as they shall not onely supply and mantayne the Planta?on wth apparrell and necessaries but it shall make a publique stocke and Treasurie, that should increase as the Planta?on increaseth. 6.Sixtlie and Iastlie the dooeing of all theis thinges by way of right and Interest to the mantenance of Justice, and peace, and to the Honor of God, our King, and State. All theis quallityes being treated of in five seu9all Treatises are lastlie Composed into one forme wch may aptlie be tearmed militarie Intendencie by Tribe, it being a way not onelie to plant Garrisons without pay, but each Garrison bringing wth it a Certaine Revenew to the Crowne, it shall tie Virginia as fast to England as if it were one Terra firma wth it. The hint? of it I had from Charles the 5th, and if he himselfe or King Philip his sonne, had vsed the like policie in the West Indyes, low Coun- tries, Millaine, Naples, and the rest of his provinces to Mantayne his Soveraigntye there, he had not spent so many [2] Millions to keepe Garri- sons as he hath done, neither would his provinces be so readie to fall from him as now they wiebe if his plate fleet should faile him. When I shall see the Companie incouraged, and the Comission goe for- ward, so as the delinquent? being knowne to ther King from honest men, a stocke may be gayned out of th' abuses of the Government, and that this forme be setled, I doubt not but to procure 8 or 10 Gentlemen that shall haue 7 or 8000li ? An? revenew to goe as Comissioners into Virginia, to setle it, and to be the head? of the first Colloneyes; and all they shall demand of his Maty is, that he will grant them the wardshipp of their heyres if they shall dye in their seruice now at their first goeing. And if his Maty will but grant me releife out of the Imployment of the said stocke, I will vndertake on payne of my life, that what is wanting to per- forme the buisines, the Planter shall supplie, and when this is done I may glory in the worke and bragg that I haue helped the state to meanes, shewed them the way and helped them wth Instrument? to Conquer and keepe in subiec?on to England a State that may grow to be as great an Empire as the King of Spaynes, the distance of place no way hindering it, to the honor and inriching of or King and State &amp; to the releife of Thou- sand? of poore people.1 1 This paragraph is omitted in Additional MSS. 12496. The reasons given in the following paragraph are summarized only. I euer said and so I exprest my selfe in my Articles two yeares since at the Councell boord, that if the buisnes wth the Company were not tenderlie handled, that till this publique stocke was gayned, and this forme were framed, and setled by the Company, we should beginne at the wrong end, and it would hinder the worke; this takeing away of the Patent being a device of the delinquent? (like some other they haue formerlie vsed) hath so madded the Company, that whereas there is 80 Articles put in against the former Gou9nors, 15 of them being against the Accompt?, and but 3 examined they let all goe now at sixe and seauen, and2 2 From this word to the word "partlie", third line following, is omitted in Additional MSS. 12496. will medle no further; and that there Cannot be a more pleasing thing to the delinquent? any one may see it by some of their earnest following it. For my part I neuer durst seeke to take away the populer Government here, partlie because the deliverie vp of Patent? doth weaken the Confidence that Patentees should haue in3 3 From this word to, but not including, the word "Company", second line following, is omitted in Additional MSS. 12496. them, and the Patent now granted being to the Company, Con- sisting of the Adventurer, and Planter, and the Gou9nment being now in the Company here, if the Company will by Consenting to this Forme, transferre the Gou9nment to the Planter (to whom of right it belonges) there is no necessitie that the Patent must be delivered, partlie because there must by necessitie be such Correspondencie betweene the Planter in Virginia, and the Adventurer here, that the Planter must make noe lawes to bind the Estates of the Adventurer, but he must Consent to it either by himselfe, or some other; for otherwise no man will adventure. Partly because the Consent of all the Parties interested to the forme will make it the more firme, and ?petuall, partlie because all Changes of Gou9nmt should be insensible, gentle, &amp; [3] easie. Partlie because this Consent by voices doth make many adventure that otherwise would not, Partly because I made a doubt whether the King would take the name of the Planta?on as §a§ worke of his owne till he saw it was able to subsist and defend it selfe against forreyne and domesticke power. Partly because vnder the name of the publique (wch is the King? in right of his Sou9aintie) all the benifit of the publique land? &amp; seruant? will returne vnto him though he be no more seene in the buisines then form9lie he hath beene. Lastlie the planta?on being divided into petty Collonyes of 300 in each one, if those Collonies shall nominate 3 Adventurers here, two of them to be their Agent? to doe their buisines, as the Comittees doe now, and the third to preconsult and make Contract? for the Planter wth the King or Company, the whole Classis of those preconsulters haueing a Negatiue voice; theis will pruent all wrong done to the Planta?on, and there will nothing remayne but the very name of the Company. The Company feares that this takeing away the Patent before the abuses were examined was hatched at Alderman Johnsons house at Bowe, at the King? being there, that the King is now prest to it by Sr Thomas Smithes Freind? of the Bed Chamber, and all is done to Conceale the falshood of his Accompt?, and the grossenes of their Gou9nment from his Mat? knowl- edge1 1 In Additional MSS. 12496, instead of the lengthy statement from this point, Captain Bargrave prays that the Company be commanded to make good their complaints before the Commissioners and that a committee be appointed to examine and amend the form of government. . They feare likewise that Sr Tho: Smith, Sr Samuell Argoll, and Alderman Johnson standing Cleare in the King? Eyes, and the Gou9nment being framed, That they may doe wth the Planter and Adventurer what they list, all their privildges and right? being taken from them they wilbe made their Gou9nors who haue beene the principall aba§u§sers of them, and this that side bragg? of. Some of the Comrs also answearing Peti- ?oners that it is to no purpose for them to medle any further, being the King hath declared himselfe to take away the Government from the Company, and to put it into the hand? of twelve Councellors, that may right their causes. The way to right all wilbe the setting forward of the Comission, the forceing the Company to make good their Complaint?, the nomynating a Comittee from the board, or otherwise to examine, and approue of the forme of Gou9nment that shalbe tendered to the Company, and when they shall see that Justice is done, this stocke is like to be gayned, and that this forme of Gou9nmt wch the King and State doth presse on them is no such Bulbegger as they need to be afraid of, but framed according to right, tending to the good of all parties interested, for the Companies ease, and to take away the blame from them, If any thing miscarrie for want of Government, the order of the forme placeing the same men in the Gou9nment wch they themselues would C choose if the Gou9nment should remayne in their hand? and they being by the said forme to haue their adventures secured to them by the whole Collonyes, wherein they shall adventure, and that this is all the hurt that is intended to them; I make no doubt but the States and the Companies End? meeting in one and the same thing, they will imbrace it, and the buisines will goe well forward. I know (my good Lord) that in Cases of necessitie all states &amp; states men, instead of following straight wayes to Compasse their end? [4] are forced to follow more oblique and Crooked, the greatnes of the future good recom- penceth the present ill. So Licurgus although his pollicie was Aristo eraticable §call§ Aristocraticall, so iust, as for it he was (of the Oracle) tearmed beloued of the God?, yet notwithstandinge he being necessitated to set vp his Gou9ment by Conspiracie, and force he was likewise Compelled to Choose all his first Councell out of the Conspirators; by this rule of necessitie Romulus (as Livie saith imitating other founders of Co?on Wealthes) to draw people to his new built Cittie, erected an Assilum, or Sanctuary for Outlawes, men indebted, and discontented ?sons. Junius Brutus likewise in the desperate Case of the Citie of Rome, after the battel of Canne was forced for want of men to set at liberty all the prisoners indebted, and to discharge their debt? on Condi?on, that they would serue the State; although in theis Examples wee in our necessitie may intreate Connivencie, and helpe for some industrious Gentlemen indebted; and decaying in their Estat?, by whose industrie the States turne may be serued, and their falling houses releived. This pollicy no question is tolerable and fitt, but that theis delinquent? seeing their leaudnes like to be discouered, should meet the storme in the force, and to avoid the obloquie of their offences should be suffred to Compound vnder hand, and vnder a Color of their loue to the Planta?on, and a desire to see the man- nageing of it, by Concealing their Wrong? done, should thrust all the dis- grace from themselues vpon others, it being a most sure rule that nothing makes a State more florish then a due administra?on of reward? and punnishmt?, this must need? be by the rule of state intollerable, and the more intollerable be because the State at this tyme both here and in Virginia, long? for examples in this kind, The limita?on of the soueraigne faculties amongst the Councell, and Magistrates in Virginia, wholy Con- sisting in the severe punnishment of all incroachment vpon soueraigne power, further then the forme giveth leaue, they therefore that shall robb the Co?onwealth of this example shall robb it of it selfe life1 1 Sic. Whereas therefore the foresaid Delinquent? takeing advantage on his Mat? Dec- clarea?on against such as did not make good their Complaint?, that they shall suffer the same punishmt (that the Delinquent? should) if their Com- plaint? proue not true, did thereupon by the King? direc?on Cause the Complaint? in the name of the Company to Cease, because such punish- ment Could not be inflicted vpon the Companie as might vpon private ?sons, whereby they did for a long time hinder the proceeding? of §the buisines before§ the Comrs, till such time as the boord did order it, that against such Delinquent? as were Instrumt? of the Company they might Complaine (it being but a device like this of takeing away the Patent) to hinder the proceeding? of the Complt?. If therefore his Mãtie will suffer a bill to be drawne in my name (I makeing choice of the Companies Articles, and proofes that shalbe laid in the said bill) and will Continew my pro- tec?on, and give vnto me the 4th part of what shalbe recou9ed, to recom- pence my losse; I will vndertake, skinne for skinne, that nothing shalbe laid against them but shalbe proued. And if the other partie will doe the like against Sr Edwyn Sandys, or any others of the Companie, the buisines wilbe by this meanes fully Censured, so prayeing for yor Lopps increase of honor I rest Your Lopps to Co?and John Bargraue [Indorsed:] A coppie of Capt Bargraues letter to my lo: threasuror.</field>

Your Maties: moast humble Commons, taking into carefull consideration, the greate wante of mony in this your Realm at this day; wherby Rents are unpayde, Contracts broken, Bonds forfeited, Marketts and Fayres much deserted, or unfrequented, the better sort impoverished, and the meaner (for want of meanes in the better) not sett on worke; extending, not onely to a generall Distemper amongst your Subiect? at home, but to the hinderance alsoe of Trade, and Traffique abroade; (mony being aswell the Mother as Daughter therof) And doubting, least the same wante, may in fyne alsoe redounde to the preiudice of your Maty: in Subsidies and other Dutys, graunted or to be graunted for the seruice of your Maty; and necessary defence of yr Kingdoms: they haue thought fitt, to present one prince to your Mate: princely regard one principall cause of this want, amongst diuers others, wch the streightness of tyme, doth exclude from exact ?and full? consideration. It is generally knowen, that the West Indies, are at this day almoast the onely Fountayne, and Spayne as it were the Cesterne, from whence Silver is deriued into all parts of Christendom. The cause of the greate Importation of siluer from thence into this Realme, hath beene for that Spayne having soe greate need of many English Commodities and being not able to Counterballance them wth their owne, they haue beene forced to make the acompt eeuen wth Mony. But since this Weede of Tobacho hath growen into request, they haue payde, us (as their Prouerb is) for all our Commodities wth Their Smoake: And the vayne of there siluer to us ward, hath beene in a manner dried upp, to the Loss of a Million and a halfe in mony in theese fifteene yeares last past. For uppon very full and exact examination, it hath very playnely and undeniably appeared, that what by vndersale of our Natiue Commodities to make ready mony ?for? of their Tobacho, what by the mony itselfe payde unto them for that weede, there hath beene lost ?losse? to this Kingdom of one hundred Thousand pound? euery yeare, which else would haue returned in mony from thence. And a miserable kynde of Trade hath been driuen wth that Nation, our Natiue Commodities being undersolde, and the forreigne ouerbought, and the Treasure of mony transformed into a Smoaking weed. Your humble Commons therfore, moast instantly craue of your Maty, that the Importation of Tobacho, may bee prohibited from all ?other? part? other then save your Mat? ?owne? Dominions, according to the Practize in like Cases in all other Nations, in fauour of the natiue Com- modities, and of their Naturall People.

      <field name="fulltext">CDLXX. Sir George Yeardley. Answer of Defendant to the Demand of Captain John Martin2 2 Written by a very careless scribe. February 4, 1624/5 C. O. 1, Vol. III, No. 36, I Document in Public Record Office, London List of Records No. 753 The Answer of Sr George Yeardly Knight Defendant to the Demands of Capt. John Marti[n] Esquire Complaynant whereby he requireth recom- pence of wrong? donn him. To the first, the said defendant saith that he never knew that Mr Whittakers had at any time any Corne of the said Complaynant?.3 3 Sic but saith that Mr Whittakers intestate he the said Defendant being then Deputy Governor of Virginia required one Thomas Hobson, who belonged to Mr Whittakers and was as his Sonne and Child kept by him in his life time, to take an Inventorie of all such good? and provisions as were then to be found in the said Mr Whittakers house and them to take into his safe custodie that if afterward? there did appeare any to whom the good? might more rightly belong he should be accomptable for them. and the said Defendant saith there was as farr as he remembreth found in the said house of Corne tenn barrell? of Eares which he verily beleeveth was the said Mr Whittakers owne Corne wch Corne was afterward? disposed of and spent by the said Tho: Hobson in the feeding of himself, Jarrett Hollock John Flood and one Ruben all of them servant? to the said Mr Whittakers. And saith further that after the arivall of Sr Samuell Argall who succeeded the said Defendant in the Government of Virginia there came into this Colony a sister of Mr Whittakers who made enquiry after the good? of her deceased brother but found that he left little of vallew behind him. at that time also was the said Complaynant here in this Contrie who no doubt if he had then complayned to Sr Samuell Argall and could haue made proof that the said Corne had any waise belonged vnto him he might then haue recou9ed the same. for the Corne was at that time very little thereof spent. if he did not then complaine or had nott iustice don him therein the said Defendant saith itt was no fault of his. To the second the said Defendant saith that he doth remember one Pope whoe served in his Shipp as Cooke enterteyned for that pourpose by James Brett Mr of his said Shipp and went also for England as he remembreth therin but whether the said Pope were servant to the Complaynant or was runn away from him the said defendt knoweth nott. and doth further protest and wilbe redy to be Sworne that the said Complayna[nt] never at any time to his rememberance spacke to the said Defendant of or concerning the said Pope nor that ever he so much as heard say that the said Pope was runn away from the said Complaynant. To the Third the Defendant saith that with his knowledg or by any Warrant or allowance of his there were never any kine or Calues taken from the said Complaynant to the vse of Mr Bargraue as he suggesteth and therefor the said Defendt deemeth the said Complaynant to be much mistaken in demanding allowance for any such kine or Calues from him the said Defendant. To the fourth the said Defendant saith that he was never acquainted that the Complaynant had hired any of Capt stallinges men neither did he ever heare say that the said Complaynant had hired any one or more of them but saith that at his arivall to be Governor of Virginia he found ridinge at Anchor in this River A shipp wch the said Defendt was given to vnderstand belonged to Sr Ferdinando Gorge Knight the said stallinge being Capt thereof wch said Shipp soone after the arivall of the said Defendant was by the negligence of the said Stallinge and Company belongeinge to her soffered to breake from her Anchors and in the night to runn a ground at a place called Bowiers bay the said Stallinge the next day came to the said Defendant and did intreat for help to gett of the said Shipp where- vppon the said Defendant saith he lent the said Stallinge the long Boat of the Diana with twelue of her best men to help of the said Shipp. but before they could gett her afloat they were forced to vnlade much of her provisions and good? and by the direccion of the said Stallinge to carry them on Shoar vppon the South side of the River and afterward? with great labor brought the said Shipp into Southampton River where the said Stallinge very negligently left her wth only a boy to poump out the watter. the said Shipp being extream leaky by reason of the great hurt shee tooke in ro?inge one ground at Bowiers Bay and he the said Stallinge tooke all the rest of the Marinrs and Company to row him and some others vp the river where in his way putting ashore at a place called Dancinge Point, he happned to be slayne after whose death his Company went vpp with their boatt vnto the said Complaynant? Planta?on the said Defendant being then aboue at Charles hundred bussied about the publique affaires of the Collony. the said Complaynant wrot vpp to him and certified him of the death of the said Stallinge and howe that his men and boatt weare at the said Complaynantt? [2] Plantacion wherevppon the said Defendt vnderstanding the misaccident of the said Stallinges Death and howe also that the said Shipp was left by him in doubt of perishing and that divers of the good? and provisions belonginge to her were left one shore by the said Stallinge in hazard of the Indians whereby Sr Ferdinando Gorge owner of the said Shipp might be much ?iudiced he the said Defendant forthwth in consederacion thereof gaue Warrant vnto Capt Georg Bar- graue and one John Damerin to take the said Stallinges men and boatt and to go downe to Ricoughtan and taking Capt Tucker, then Co?ander there to asist them to make a true Inventorie of all the good? and pro- visions belongeinge to the said shipp and also with the said Boat and Companye to fech and bring together all thing? whatsoeuer that belonged to the said Shipp and were by the said Stallinge left one Shore vppon the South side of the River at Newport? Newes or any other place and them to see laid vpp in som House or Store where they might be ?served for the vse of the said Sr Ferdinando Gorge of wch his proceeding? the said Defendant saith he gaue notice by letters vnto the said Sr Ferdinando intreatinge hime to appoint and send over some one whoe might receue them to his vse wch afterward? the said Sr Ferdinando did and gaue great thank? to the said Defendt for his care and paines takin therin and for that also the said Defendt had employd his owne people and boatt in helping to bring the good? together wch nott long after were dellivered vnto one Ellis Cornish substituted by the said Sr Ferdinando as doth appeare by a receipe vnder the hand of the said Ellis wch the said Defendt hath to showe And the said Defendt saith that the good? of the said shipp being one this laid vpp as aforsaid he gaue license vnto the said Shipp? Companye to dispose of themselues for there owne best profitt wher and in what place they thought good some of whom soone after shipped themselues for England others for Canada. one only whose name was Stoak? enterteined himself for the publique service of the Collony Moreou9 the said Defendt saith that he was nott at all acquainted that the said Complainan[t] had hired any one or more of them to serve him ether as his servant? or Teñnt? and saith that the said Complaynant did never give him any notice of any such agreement. nor did then or after require of him that they might fulfill any Conveñnt or agreement made. soe that he verylie beleeveth that there was not any Coveñnt made at all betwene the said Complaynant and the said Shipps Company. And further saith that if any such thinge were doune by the said Complaynant as to hiere into his service the said Shipp? Company for the plantinge of Tobacco at such a time when there Capt was newly slaine and the Shipp and good? like to be vtterly lost. that there was littell respect had by the said Complãyn[t] to the damage that might therevppon ensue vnto the said Sr Ferdinando Gorge in the losse of his Shipp and good? wch Shipp notwth- standinge that all the care was taken that the said Defendant could devise for the speedy sendinge to her succorr was sunke in the River ere the boat could get downe And the said Defendt forther saith that if any bargaine or agreemt had been made betwen the said Complaynant and the said Shipp? Company that had beene lawfull he doubteth nott but the said Complaynant would haue requyred iustice at that time that it might haue beene ?formed the wch thinge he never did ether by word or writting. To the fifth the said Defendt saith that soone after his arivall to be Gov- ernor having occa?on for the publique servic' to employ Ensigne Savage as an Interpretor he sent for him to the Complaynant at whose Planta?on he then lived and saith that after the said Ensignes returne. the like occa?on required the sendinge of him againe butt saith that1 1 Sic. was nott acquainted by the said Complaynnt that the said Ensigne was his hired servant nether did the said Complaynant require the said Ensigne to be sent home againe. nor did the said Defendt knowe that the said Com- playnant had any occa?on to employ the said Ensigne to go abroad in his Shallopp. and saith further that he did not vnderstand that the said Ensigne was servant to the said Complaynant or any man else but as a publique Interpretor. yet saith that if the said Complaynant had desired to haue made vse of the said Ensigne and had acquainted him the said Defendt therewth he beleeueth he should have beene redy to haue showed him curtisie therein for at that time and afterward? the said Defendant did vnto the said Complaynant many speciall fauors wch. as he thinketh the said Complaynant wilbe redye to acknowledg one among the rest being the lending of him Corne when both he and his people relied very great necessitie. And saith [3] further that he knoweth not nor doth beleeue that the said Complaynant had at that time whilest the said Ensigne was employed by the said Defendt for the publique servic' of the Collony any intent to send forth his Shallop? one tradinge for that his Cropp must haue spoiled one the ground in the absente of his people. To the sixth the Defendent saith that the said Compla?ant was sent for to James Cittie by the Generall Assemblie who writt him a very curteous letter to that effect the Copie whereof the said defendt hath to shew theire desier to comune wth him as by the iornall of the generall Assemblie will appere was for that he sent from his planta?ion two Burgesses to sitt in the Assembly and to haue theire voices there in the makeinge of lawes and orders for the good and peaceably gouerning of the Collony vnto wch lawes they the said Burgesses would nott assure the said Assembly that the said Defendt or any of the people that lived vnder his Comand would be obedient vnto, but that he the said Complainant wold notwistanding any lawes that should be made there, govern and Comand by the authoritie of his private Pattent and strictly stand vppon the privileges thereof, vnder the prote?ion of wch said Pattent it was well known to the Assemblie that there lived at his plantacion diu9s bankrout? and indebted ?sons wth others of evill fame wch said ?sons the said Complaynant had and hath diu9s times protected against the authoritie of the publique officers of this Collony and would nott suffer them to be arrested for theire debt? but hath Comanded the sayd publique officers to de?te his teritorie, threatninge them otherwise to lay them Neck and heeles. wherof the said publique officers haue complayned to the said Defendt as he will be Sworn and could haue otherwise more strongly prooved if the said officers were now allive. by wch the said Complaynant oppo?cion and resistance. the Cape Marchant of the ould Magazine hath beene forced to stay for the dept? of the said Magazine, as himself beinge now here is able to wittnes. Another reson of the Generall Assemblies sendinge for the said Complaynants to Comune wth him might be and was concerninge an outrage done by some of the said Complaynant? people to Certaine Indians in the Bay wth whom wee were in league and peace. in takeing away by violenc' from them a certain quantitie of Corne at wch act it semed to the assemblie the said Complaynant1 1 Sic. conive,1 and Complaint bing1 thereof made to the said Defendt by Opachankan, whoe also was Complayned vnto by the Kinge one the Eastren shore to whom those people and the foresaid corn belonged, that sattisfa?on might be made the said Assemblie thinking the same but reson resolued to moue the said Complaynant therein. To the seventh the Defendt saith that vppon the Day of the massacre the said Defendt going vpp in his shipp toward? flourdien hundred and the tid takeinge him short about Capt Sandrs his planta?on he manned his Shipps boatt and went one shore to search if anny of the people might haue lyen wounded whome he might haue saved and recovered. but serchinge the ground and findinge none it groweing toward? night he retired to his Shipp purposeing to send downe his boat? the next day to haue saued the Corne wch lay in Capt Sandrs his howse with any other good? wch might haue benn found of worth to haue beene brought thenc' the necessitie and danger of the Defendt one planta?on nott ?mitinge at that time his longer stay there. but the next day he had certaine newes that the houses and all thing? else therein were burnt. he also saith that he doth nott know of any thinge that was brought thenc' saue some poulterie from the roust at one Taylors howse a dweller there, together wth a Sow wch he the said Defendt gaue vnto the Mr of his said Shipp vppon his request there of as also one Chest wherein as neare as he can remember was about sixty waight of very ill condi?oned Tobacco wch he the said Defendt bestowed vppon the Marriners pourposing to pay for the said Sow and Tobacco wch he the said Defendt might as he thought well doe in regard the said Capt Sandrs dyed indebted to him the sonn1 1 Sic. of Eighteen pound? starlinge as will appere by a bill of the sayed Capt Sandrs hand wch the said Defendt hath to show he saith also that the Marriners did throw som smale trompery in to the boat thing? of litle or no vallew the Indians hauinge caried away all other thing? as it should seeme by there strowinge of old Chest? and barrell? about the feild but weather there were at the sayd Capt Saundrs Planta?on any good? at all belonging to the said Complaynant the said Defendt saith he knoweth nott nor did he see or ?ceue that anything was brought thence by any of his people saue one yong Calf wch dyed in the Shipp and [4] Was throwne ourbord before he got vpp to Flourdieu Hundred And farther saith that if the said Complaynant can proue that any thing was by him the said Defendt or by any other wth his allowace brought thence he wilbe ready to make ?sent sattifac?on for the same to the right owners thereof. Moreover the said Defendt saith that he hath heard that non of the good? of the said Complaynant were at the Planta?on of the said Capt Sandrs butt were lefte by him the said Complaynant at his de?ture for England in his owne dwellinge houses wch were about A mielle distant from the said Planta?on And where the said Defendt saith that neither he nor any of his people ever came at that time or since the Massacre and therefor the said Compla?ant shall doe him wrong if he accuse him of bringeng any thing thence where neither he nor any of his Canne.1 To the [eigh]t the De[fendant saith t]2 2 Torn away. hat vntill this time he never heard of any such thinge but saith that he hath latly spoken wth Ensigne Chaplaine and then certified him of this demande of the Complaynant who told him the whole take his oath.1 that there was neu9 any agreemt made betwene him and the said Complaynant that tow kine should be delivered to the said Ensigne for sattifat?on of the said Complaynant? bond. and said that he never demanded any kine of Capt Saundrs nor did Capt Sanders at any time make proffer to deliu9 him any whereby it is not likely that the said Defendt did co?and Capt Saundrs the contrary. To the Nynth and last the Defendt saith that vntill this time he never heard of any such thinge but saith that Liueteñnt Peppett beinge now in this Cittie itt may please the Governor and Counsell to examine him there of.

      <field name="fulltext">CDLXXII. Virginia Company. Discourse of the Old Company April (?), 1625 C. O. 1, Vol. III, No. 40 Document in Public Record Office, London List of Records No. 758 May it please your Lops When last wee attended this Honourable Bourd, yor Lop required two things at our hands, to be presented this day in writing to yor Lops. proc. for settling Govermt 13 May 16251 1 In pencil. The first, our opinion touching the best forme of Gouernement, to be here established for ye affaires of Virginia. The second, an offer to be made for such a Contract touching Tobacco wth his Matie as might both vphold his former Revenue, and not be grievous to the Plantations. Concerning the former of wch proposi?ons, wee humbly craue leaue thus much to deliver wthout offence, that it came alltogether vnexpected to vs: who brought wth vs a strong &amp; confirmed resolu?on, not to entermedle any more in the busines of Virginia, so foyled &amp; wronged by the partie opposite, &amp; now reduced to extreame termes allmost past recovery and wherein all our former labours, cares, &amp; expences, had receaved by the practise &amp; procurement of these men, the vndeserved reward of rebuke &amp; disgrace. Notwthstandinge in due obedience vnto yor Lops Co?aund, whom wee haue allwayes found iust &amp; honoble, (and if happily some good may redound thereby to that now distressed and languishing Plantation, wch hath bin heretofore so deare vnto vs, and wch gaue so great hope of honour to this Kingdome, &amp; might haue bin in these tymes of warrly preparations, of so great vse &amp; service to his Matie, if it had bin so cherished &amp; strengthened by these men, as when they gayned the governemt, they pretended &amp; promised, wee wished and desired): Wee here present in all humblenes our deliberate opinion touching ye forme of Governemt now fittest to be established, for ye restoring &amp; reviving of that Plantation, if it be possible yet to be recovered. Wherein wee thinke it requisite, that yor Lops in the first place be truly informed, of ye state of that Colony, what before it was, and what now it is, according vnto ye best advertisements from thence received. The Plantation now in Virginia, began about ye yeare 1606 &amp; continued about Twelue yeares vnder the Governemt of ye selfe same handes, where- into it was first intrusted by the late Kings Matie, the most Royall founder of this Noble worke. The perticular carriages of this first Governemt, are too long, &amp; would bee too displeasing to yor Lopps eares. But in Generall such it was, as the now Earle of Mid?. then Lo: high Treasuror (being an ancient Adventurer &amp; Councellor for Virginia) informed yor Lops, sitting in Counsell the 5th of March 1622 when he told Ald?an Johnson, That in former yeares, when he ye said Alderman was Deputie, and the busines was in other handes, it was carried leaudly, so that if they should be called to an accompt for it, their Estates would not answere it. What his Lopp delivered as his owne Censure, was truly the opinion of ye whole Company of Adventurers here in England. And wth them doth ye Colonie concur[re], having the last yeare by theire Viceadmirall sent a writing signed by the hand? of the Generall Assembly, &amp; directed to his Matie, wherein having declared, the manner of those Twelue yeares Governemt, they conclude wth these words, full of passionat[e] griefe; And rather then to be reduced to liue vnder the like Governement, wee desire his Matie that Comissioners may be sent ouer with authoritie to hang [2] vs. Of this quallitie was the first Governemt. And answerable to the Forme, were the Effects, as ye Generall Assemblie having by oath examined the perticulers, sett downe in their Declaration directed to his late Matie. 1.For People then alive about ye nomber of 400. 2.Very many of them in want of Corne, vtterly destitute of Cattle, Swine, Poultry, and other provisions to nourish them. 3.As for Fortification agaynst a forraigne enimy, there was none at all, onely foure peeces mounted, but altogether vnserviceable. 4.There was onely eight Planta?ons, all wch were but poorely housed, and as ill fortified agaynst the Sauages. 5.Onely one old Friggott belonging to ye Su?er Ilandes, one Shallop, one Shippboate, and two small boats belonging to private men. 6.Three Ministers in orders, &amp; Two wthout 7.No Comoditie on foote saue Tobacco. 8.The Indians in doubtfull Termes. This as they report was the true estate of ye Planta?ons at ye Twelue yeares end. To wch being added the other condi?on of the Colonie, wch in other writinges they expresse; 1.That they rather lived or rather suffred vnder Martiall Lawe: 2.Vnder a most extorting Governour there, whome by 24 bundles of deposi?ons they haue accused of strange depreda?ons: 3.Vnder most oppressiue orders hence, to ye breach of all faith &amp; honesty: 4.Wthout comfort of Wiues or servants: 5.Wthout assurance of their Estates: 6.There being no Dividents of land laid out: 7.Wthout assurance of their Lib9ties, being violently deteyned as servt? beyond their Coveñnted tymes: Wee may truly affirme, that ye inten?ons of ye people then in Virginia, were no wayes to settle there as a Colonie, but to gett a little wealth by Tobacco, then in price, and so to returne for England. As for ye Adventurers here, the greatest part were long before beaten out as from an hopeless Action. In wch reguard there was fifteene thousand pounds deteyned of mens subscrip?on?, wch by no meanes they could bee procured to pay in; sundry of them alleaging in their answeres in Chauncery vpon their oathes, the misimployment of ye monyes, &amp; ill keeping of the Accounts. Those few that followed the busines, vpon some hope to reforme it, were (by the Governours here, for their owne perticuler ends as is conceaved, for to their private benefitt it was only sutable,) directed to bestowe their monyes in Adventuringe by way of Magazine, vpon two Comodities onely, Tobacco &amp; Sassafras, [3] matters of present proffitt, but no wayes fitt founda?ons of a future State. Soe that of a merchantlike Trade there was some probabillitie, at least for a while: but of a Plantation there was none at all, neither in the courses, nor in ye inten?ons, either of the Adventurers here, or of the Colonie there. In this Estate &amp; condi?on was the Action lefte by the First, to ye Second Governmt wch began in ye yeare · 1619 · by the choice of Sr Edwin Sandis for Treasurer. To whome ye yeare followinge succeeded ye Earle of Southampton. 1.Vnder whose Governemt? by Gods blessing, the Plantation, soe pros- pered, as by the end of ye yeare · 1621 · the nomber of people was encreased there, to be about Two thousand. 2.The number of Neat Cattle, besides Goates &amp; Swyne, Eight hundred. 3.The number of Housinge was propor?onably encreased, and the manner of building much bettered. 4.The number of Boates was Ten tymes multiplyed: And wch was much more, there were Fower Shippes belonging to the Colonie. 5.There were sent more then eight able Ministers. 6.With great care &amp; cost there were procured men skilfull in Sawing- Milles from Hambrough. 7.Vigneroones from Languedoch: In divers places of ye Colonie, Vine- yard? begunne, some of them conteyninge Ten thousand plant?: 8.Store of Silkeworme-seed sent: 9.And the Iron-workes brought after Five thousand pound? expences to that assured perfection, as wthin Three moneths they promised to send home great Quantities. 10.Many new Plantations were made: 11.All men had sufficiency of Corne: 12.§And many§ Great plenty of Cattle, Swyne &amp; Poultrie, &amp; other good provisions. 13.The mortallitie wch had raigned the two first yeares, (wch at that tyme was generall over all America) was at last ceased. 14.Soe that by this sodayne &amp; vnexpected advancemt of the Plantation in these thinges, together wth ye redresse of all former Grievances: Supplies of yong woemen for wiues, &amp; of youthes for servt? being sent them: 15.The bloudy Lawes being silenced, &amp; their Governemt ordered like to that of this Kingdome: 16.Provisions being made for ye mayntenñce of Officers, that they should not need to prey vpon ye people: And ye like done for ye Ministers: 17.The libertie of a Generall Assembly being graunted them, whereby they find out, &amp; execute those thinges, as might best tend to their good: 18.The estates of Land by iust Dividents being surely conveyed: 19.A Free Trade from hence for all sorts of people being permitted, where- by they were eeven to superfluity furnished wth all necessaries: [4] The Colony grewe into an opinion, that they were the happiest people in ye world: Wch meeting here at home wth ye experience of most Noble demeanor on ye Companies part, agaynst wch Envy itselfe could not finde any shadowe of Calumny or offence: the reputa?on of this Action grew to such an height, as not only the old Adventurers renewed their zeale of their first Loves, but great numbers of new came dayly in wth assurance to expend large so?es in the busines. And for ye Plantrs to goe in person, not only here at home Thousands of choise people offred themselues: but out of Ireland went divers Shipp, &amp; more were followinge: Three hundred Families French &amp; Dutch in the yeare · 1621 · made request to the State, that they might plant in Virginia: whither not long before, Condempned persons had refused to goe wth pardon of their Lives. The great amendment in this and in all other parts of this Action, made the Earle of Middlesex say at yor honoble Board, That in these latter tymes the Plantation by the good carriage had thriuen and prosppered beyond beliefe, and almost miraculouslie. This wee cannot but esteeme an honoble testimony proceeding from our most heavy Enemy, who had himselfe layde in or way soe many great Rubbs &amp; Difficulties, as hee might well say, It was by miracle wee ouer passed them. The first yeare, directly agaynst his Mat? ?res Pattents, and consequently agaynst Lawe, by the iudgement of the then Atturney Generall, exceedingly ouer burdeninge our Comoditie: The second yeare, to ye Kings great dammage, &amp; abuse of the whole kingdome, procuringe an vtter banishement of our Tobacco: And the third yeare, enforcinge vs to bring all in, onely to the enrichemt of his private freinds. But besides these, wee were continually struglinge wth a most malicious faction wthin our owne Body here, besides that vniversall sickenes abroad in the Colony men?oned before: Yet through all these Difficulties did wee wrestle by Gods blessing, wth the expence of lesse then fower &amp; twenty thousand poundes of the Publiq' Stock. For howso- ever yor Lops haue beene enformed, the very truth wch wee shall allwayes make good, is, that there was not receaved from the Lottaries in the tyme of this latter Governemt, any more then Twenty one thousand Seaven hundred Sixty six poundes, Nyne shillings Two pence. By the expence of wch so?e, together wth about Three thousand pounds receaued from the Collections, wee brought the Colony to those Termes wee haue related. And if in ye Declaration sent to his Matie the last yeare, the Colony haue made a right &amp; perfect Calcula?on, wee affirme vnto yor Lops that in ye first Three yeares of this latter Governement, the Company sent as many Shipps in Nomber, but of greater burthen; As many people in nomber, but much better provided, as were sent in the first Twelue yeares. Yet had the latter Governemt vnder Twenty fower Thousand poundes, and Sr Thomas Smith receaved above Three score and fifteene thousand poundes of publiq' Stock. Soe that wee [5] may truly affirme, through Gods blessing, wth a Third part of the mony, and in a fourth part of ye tyme, wee brought the Plantation to thri[ee] § foure tymes § the nomber of Men that Sr Thomas Smith lefte it in, and in all other parts incomparably better. The Planta?on being growne to this height by the end of ye yeare 1621 it pleased God in his secrett iudgement to giue leaue to ye enemies thereof, by many powerfull &amp; most wicked meanes, to bring it downe agayne to ye ground. The first Blowe was a most bloudy Massacre, when by the Treacherous cruelty of the Savadges, about 400 of or People were slayne; vpon the 22th of March 1621. The terror whereof wth the losse of much Cattle and other Substance, and a sodayne altera?on of the State of all thinges, so dismaide the whole Colony, as they allmost gaue themselues for gone. But then appeared both the love of the Company to the Plantation, &amp; their great abilitie to goe through therewith: when in supply of this Losse, and for ye encouragemt of the Colony, they did send that yeare to Virginia 16 Ships &amp; 800 people, and that altogether at ye charges of private Adventurers. For the publiq' Stock being vtterly exhaust the yeare before, was not able to contribute 500li. toward all this charge. But this cruell Tragedy of the Massacre, was seconded by Two other sharpe Calamities in ye very neck one of another: First Scarcitie in the Colony by being putt off from their Grounds prepared, together wth the losse of their season &amp; much seed; besides that, through the troublesomnes of those tymes, they could not freely imploy themselues in plantinge thereof, no not in those their scanted grounds, many Planta?ons being drawne into few places for their better defence. Wch pesteringe of themselues, did likewise breed Contagious sickenesse; wch being encreased by the Infection brought in by some shipps, there dyed that yeare of Mortallitie neere vpon 600 more: and the Colony passed much hardnesse in their victuall, by reason of the miscarriage of one of their Shippes, wch the Company sett forth wth aboue 500li worth of Meale and other provisions: But the Shipp being blowne vp wth Powder at the Su?er Islandes, the Provisions were lost, &amp; neuer came to Virginia Notwithstandinge these thinges were most grievous to the Company here; yett were they no wayes of Discouragement, but rather seemed to add heat to their former zeale: so as by the begining of the yeare 1623 there appeared in readines § &amp; preparation § to goe to Virginia, double that nomber of people, &amp; Adventurers, that any former yeare had carried. When on a sodayne the Plantation it selfe was by Captaine Butler in a certayne writinge Intituled, The vnmaskinge of Virginia, soe fowly disgraced, and the present miseries thereof so farr amplified aboue Truth, and the future hopes thereof so belowe all good meaninge drided &amp; villified by divers ill willers of the Action, especially some discontented members of ye Company, as the greatest part of the intended Supplies for New Plantations, gave over, as some of themselues will testify to yor Lops. [6] Yet notwthstandinge, the vnited Body of the Company, did even that yeare 1623 send out Eleaven shipps, stored wth supplies of victuall &amp; provisions: although by many cruell Encounters of the Opposites, they were sore hindred and deiected, directly wth Intention to make them abandon ye busines. But the welfare of the Planta?on, and the maynteñnce of their owne honour &amp; credite, did prevaile so wth the Company, that though wth the certainty of their owne extreame losse, they passed in the aboundance of Supply, not only the necessities of the Colony, but even the vnreasonable demand? of their Opposites: havinge in fower dayes space that was given them after the notice of the Colonies want, procured the vnderwriting of Fower thousand pounds Adventure: wch the Honoble Board of the privy Counsell was pleased wth much Noble favour highly to approve. As for the people that went that yeare in those Eleaven ships, the nomber was not aboue 260: and those procured not wthout difficulty, so much had the disgrace of the Plantation spread amongst ye Co?on sort of people: Neither could it be prevented by the Companie, although they vsed all possible dilligence: solliciting the Comissionrs then appointed by his Matie by a publiq' Examina?on of Captayne Butlers reporte, to cleare the truth. But they would by no meanes bee drawne therevnto. As for the Companie it selfe, their proceedings &amp; demeanors were soe opprobriously calumniated: as deprived them both of abillitie &amp; credite to doe any good herein: but wth much sorrowe to behold how sencibly and dangerously the good opinion of this Action decayed; so that divers Preachers of note in the Cittie that had begunne in this latter Governemt to pray continually for Virginia, lefte quite the remembrance of it; finding the Action to growe either odious or contemptible in mens minds: wch yet but a little before was of that esteeme, as divers on their death beds gaue great Legacies to the furtherance thereof: and even from the East Indies by way of Contribu?on, hath bin sent by the Factors and poore Marriners aboue 1000li §marke§ so farr was the reputa?on of this Action spread, by the prosperinge thereof vnder the latter Governemt, &amp; by their zealous &amp; sollicitous endeavours. Wch although by the continuall encrease of further suffringes, their Pattent being called in question, receaved a sore check: yet notwthstanding their owne Innocencie giving them courage &amp; hope that they should overcome all wth honour &amp; thankes of the State: there were Five shipps provided for this last yeare 1624 whereof one of them since the Companies dissolu?on, hath given over her voyage: the other foure haue proceeded, although wth much difficulty, in reguard that a great part of the Passengers that afore intended to goe, fell off. Whereby two of the Shipps wch had their Comissions from ye late Companie in May last, could not gett away till ye end of this last yeare, the other one in February, the other in March last. Thus haue wee given yor Lops a true Informa?on, both of the growth and languishinge of ye Virginia Planta?on, in these Five latter yeares [7] Governemt: wherein no encombrances, no calamities whatsoever could keepe it soe downe, but that it did yearely advance it selfe wth a most remarkeable growth, whilst the carefull Nurse and tender Mother the Company was permitted to governe it. Though contagion &amp; sword destroyed many people: yet whilst the nomber of new did doubly supply those that fayled, it cannot be said, but the Action was in a thriving, in a prosperous course; though not in a cleare or easy. Then began it to stand, when the Companie was troubled; to stagger, when they were disgracd and discountenanced; to sincke, when they were terrifyed wth affrightment of Dissolu?on; since wch tyme there hath bin nothing at all done towards the recovery or helping it forward, but much towards ye hindringe &amp; bringing it lower. The poore supply of People &amp; shippes that are gone, are but the remaynder of the late Companies cares &amp; loves. The setters out of the best of them doe affirme, that if they had not beene so farr engaged before the vnex- pected dissolu?on of ye late Companie, they would haue drawne back their Adventures &amp; People. When they shall arive in Virginia, they will not bring either comfort or supply to the Colonie: but only add to their Calamitie, to their greife. The first Shipp went in August, victualled only for Three moneths: the next in October: neither of them were arived the 25th of February last. Whereby they must needs come into Virginia in most miserable distresse. The other two went out soe meanly provided, that how euer short their voyage shalbe, they cannot but prove an insupportable charge to the Colony, much disfurnished by the victualling of divers shipps lately returned thence, and so ill provided by a deceiptfull cropp, wch seemed large, but proved scant, as wee dare not but acquaynt yor Lops. what experience perswades vs, That there is like to followe in the Colonie some great dis- tresse for victualls, except by speedy supply hence they be relieved. There is likewise in the Colony a most dangerous want of Powder, so great, as if the Savages should knowe the advantage they haue thereby, they might easily in one day destroy all or people. There is most extreame want of hose, shooes, &amp; all apparrell, even to a dangerous empeachement of their healthes: and that so generall, as the provisions carried in these late Shipps, will not as farr as wee cann learne, supply the Tenth part of their necessities. The want of such wonted supplies, will vndoubtedly much dismay &amp; deiect the Colony. But when they shall vnderstand of the Companies dissolu?on, for the continuance of whose Governemt and the Liberties they enioyed vnder them, they were most importunate suitors to his Matie, and that they are returned vnder those handes wch they so much abhorred: Wee doubt no possible meanes wilbe found to keepe the greatest and best part of the Colonie from imediatly cominge away. [8] For wee are credibly informed, that some of the chief?, haue allready by sellinge of their Estates, made prepara?on vpon the first notice of the change, to leaue the Country. But when farther they shall heare the newes of the late Contract, whereby all their hopes shalbe quite extin- guished, and all possibilitie of subsistance taken from them, wee cannot thinke that any will stay behinde that shall not bee kept by force. But howsoeuer it shall happen: sure wee are that by these altera?ons &amp; courses the mindes of the Planters wilbe filled wth such Jealousies &amp; sus- picions, as it wilbe a long while ere they wilbe reduced to a firme resolu?on of setting vp the Rest of their Lives, &amp; hopes, in the Colony: Which wth all humble duty wee are bold to say, hath bin &amp; will euer bee a disposition most pernicious to the establishing of the Plantation: And the overcoming thereof by the Company, Wee hold to haue bin one of the greatest services that they did. This wee conceaue to be ye state of the Colonie now in Virginia. Wch though they should be persuaded or forced to stay, yet wthout supply of others sent hence, they must needes come to nothinge in a very short space, although they had noe other enemy. As for adventuringe hence, what by the disgracinge of the Action it selfe, &amp; the vndeserved suffrings of the late Companie, the businesse is brought to such a stand, as seemes incredible: there being no prepara?on that wee can heare of not only of any Shipp, but of any man to goe to Virginia. Whereas co?only for divers yeares before, there were foure or five shipps in readinesse, and as many hundreds of men, at this tyme of ye yeare. So that even in that reguard also, the Colony will find themselues both in great discomfort, &amp; great danger. For although formerly they had no Forte on the Land to hinder a forraigne Enemy: yet especially in the latter tymes, there was such aboundance of Shipping cominge and goinge continually to Virginia, that there hath bin sometymes told Seaventeene sayle together in James River. Whereby besides that it was a continuall terror to the Natives, it would haue bin a difficult thinge to endamage the Colonie, wthout the power both of many Shippes, &amp; many souldiers. Weh was amongst divers others, a very mayne securitie &amp; encouragement, to perswade men boldly to goe to Virginia. But that and all other helpes being now foyled or much empayred, although the nomber of men be at least Three tymes as many as when wee vndertooke the Governemt; yet will wee Ingenuously yeeld, that equall thanks &amp; equall honour wilbe due to them, who shall now recover &amp; restore it to that prosperous &amp; flourishing estate, to wch by Gods blessinge or cares &amp; labours had brought it, vntill it was marred by them, who as appeares never loved it, but for their owne indirect ends, wch they haue industriously pursued. [9] Thus much touching the present estate of the Plantation, &amp; the late generall decay thereof. Wherein wee hope yor Lops will excuse both our playnes &amp; prolixitie, tending to no other end, but only to present vnto yor Lops viewe, the cleare state &amp; true nature of the disease; that so yor Lops in yor great wisedome may the better discerne &amp; provide the proper remedies. Towards wch, since yor Lops haue bin also pleased to require some preparative as it were of or opinions: wee will now humbly apply orselues to that considera?on, wthout wch, all the rest were but griefe &amp; labour. And here first wee are in duety forced to deliver vnto yor Lops, that the restoring, supporting &amp; readvancemt of that Plantation, wee hold to bee a worke, though of great necessitie for the honour, yea and service of his Matie, these tymes considered: yet wth all of soe extreame difficultie, that it is not to be rashly &amp; vnadvisedly vndertaken, but wth great circumspec- tion, care, &amp; prepara?on, with assurance §also§ of great assistance. For not to insist much, vpon the nature &amp; greatnes of the worke, so remote from the favourers, so vicine to mighty Maligners of it: and indeed fitter for the power &amp; purse of a Great Prince &amp; State, then of Private Adven- turers, and those allready exhaust &amp; tyred; the wounds wch since that great wound of the Massacre, it hath more lately receaved, from their handes whom it least beseemed, are still so wide &amp; bleedinge, that vnlesse his Matie, and yor Lops as deputed from him, shall vouchsafe to apply a Soveraine hande for the healing of them, wee are resolute of opinion, that it is impossible, the Plantation carried as formerly by private persons, should either prosper or long subsist: Those woundes wee conceaue are three First the generall disreputa?on of the Busines, (Reputation being a prin- cipall pillar of all great Actions,) &amp; that partly by some errors, neglects &amp; disasters, but principally by the late faction, though of a few &amp; small Adventurers, yet strongly &amp; strangely inanimated &amp; supported agaynst the great Body of the Companie: whereof in fine also by vndermining misin- forma?ons they haue wrought ye Dissolu?on; &amp; consequently lefte all both Adventurers &amp; Planters, in an vtter vncertaynty of their Rights, Titles &amp; Possessions: though promise was made that they should be re- assured to them, wch these men haue neglected to see performed. Secondly the great discouragemt of sundry not of the meanest both Ad- venturers &amp; Planters, some of them persons of honour, and others also of good quallitie: by whose cares &amp; labours, together wth their freinds &amp; purses, the Plantation having formerly receaved no small encrease &amp; benefitt, to the Planters great comfort &amp; content, (wch [10] they haue not forborne from tyme to tyme to declare): yet haue they by the vniust Calumnies &amp; clamors of these men, bin continually prosecuted wth all variety of extremitie, to ye rewarding of them with evill for their good deservings, and to the disheartining of all other, to succeed in like care &amp; industry. Thirdly the present extreame povertie &amp; consump?on of ye Planta?on, being for want of the accustomed yearely supplies, reduced to that paucitie of men, &amp; want of all sorts well neere of necessary provisions, that it cannot be restored, but wth an huge expence, no lesse allmost then to sett vp a new Plantation. Nowe touching the disreputa?on of ye Action, and the generall disheartin- inge of the Adventurers &amp; Planters, such especially as haue spared neither paynes nor expence, for ye recoveringe, supportinge &amp; advancinge the Plantation: Wee humbly craue yor Lops favourable patience, though wee somewhat enlarge our selues in this place, to present in part the Iniustice &amp; greaviousnes of those wounds to the honoble minds &amp; skilfull hand? of yor Lops: Seeing that in our vnderstandinge, the curing of them by yor Lops, may be a meanes to revive agayne the generally deadded heart? of both Adventurers &amp; Planters, &amp; to adde a new lustre &amp; grace to ye Action. Amongst the many glorious workes of the late Kinge, there was none more eminent, then his Gracious enclination, together wth ye propagation of Christian Religion, to advance &amp; sett forward a new Planta?on in the new world. Wch purpose of his continued till the last, manifested by his Mat? many publiq' &amp; private speeches by divers ?res of his, &amp; by his sundry Proclama?ons; so that their faults are farr the greater, who, as imediatly shalbe declared, did malitiously and cunningly pervert those Gracious inten?ons of his Matie by scandalizing ye Governemt as it then stood, as neither convenient here, nor likely there to advance the prosperitie of the Colonie; and by insinuatinge assurances, that they themselues would mayntayne that worke by better meanes. which his Matie conceavinge (as it was reason) they would not so boldly haue promised of them selues, being so great a worke, vnlesse they had had both knowledge, &amp; meanes to goe thorough wth it; did also belieue: &amp; so they became ye Vndertakers. And now, as it hath bin euer farr from or practize, and agaynst or present Desires, to fall vpon the persons of any men, where ye necessitie &amp; justice of ye cause doth not necessarilie require it: yet at this tyme it is impossible to cleere this pointe to yor Lops without [11] naming some of their persons, and perticularizing their Actions. About Six yeares agoe, when by reason of the apparent misprosperinge of the Plantation, and the fowlenes of the Accounts here, (the then Treasuror being Governour of Fower or Five other Companies, wch excused his neglect of attending this busines,) the Governemt of the Companie was translated from Sr Thomas Smith and Ald?an Johnson, into Sr Edwin Sandis, &amp; after into the Earle of Southamp- tons hands, &amp; their Deputies: it is notororiously knowne, how they, wth Captayne Argoll and other of their freinds, partly peradventure through discontent for being removed from their places, but principally through feare; (their Accounts, Depreda?ons, Piracies &amp; misgovernemt being now questiond before the Counsell and in the Companies Courts,) perpetually disturbed &amp; disgraced by seuerall wayes, both to his Matie &amp; to the world, all the present proceedinges of the Companie, to ye great disheartininge of the Companie here, and no small advantage of ye Colonie. And of this, and of the bad effect? of it, all our bookes, &amp; memories are full. But yet by Gods assistance, &amp; the vnwearied courage of the Companie, wee ridd out this storme. The next blowe, as wee had reason to belieue, proceeding by their vnder- hand raysinge of new spiritts, drawne to disturbe vs for their owne gayne was the bringing in of new &amp; seuerall projects concerning Tobacco: wch was for the instant the only co?oditie whereby the Planters mayntayned them- selues. And so vnder colour of advancing proffitt to his Matie sometimes (as hath bin before touched) wee were forbidden to bring in any Tobacco, sometimes to bring in but a small quantitie, and sometimes comaunded to bring in all. Wch varying directions, did so distract &amp; confound the Adventurers &amp; Planters, that it had in a manner ruynd the Plantation. But yet by Gods assistance, &amp; the constancy of ye Companie, wee ridd out this storme also. The instruments in this worke, that especiallie appeared were the then Sr Lionell Cranfield, Mr Jacob, and some others: to the extreame damage of the Company, enrichement of them selues, &amp; deceyt of his Matie: as was at large expressed &amp; offred to be proved in ye last Parliament. Thirdly, by the procuremt of that part, divers scandalous peti?ons agaynst the Company in generall, &amp; many in perticuler, did putt vs to much vexa?on &amp; trouble. But their accusa?ons were so false, that wee also overcame this Third assault. After this another stratagem was obtruded vpon vs, vnder pretence of freindship &amp; love to ye Plantation. The Earle of Middesex then Lo: high Treasuror of England, who in respect of his place was [12] to take into considera?on all thinges that had rela?on to his Mats revenue, did first pro- pound to Sr Edwin Sandis, &amp; afterwards to ye Ea: of Southampton, ye Lo: Cavendish &amp; Sr Edwin Sandis together, that the King, he knewe, had by Sr Thomas Smithes meanes &amp; Alderman Johnsons, and some great freinds &amp; instruments of theires, bin strangely possessed agaynst the forme of our Governemt, &amp; ye consequences of it: &amp; particulerly that they had made such advantage by traducing ye names of ye Earle of Southampton and Sr Edwin Sandis, that ye busines of ye Planta?on fared ye worse for their sakes. That he had allready in Generall spoken wth his Matie, &amp; assured him, that ye whispers &amp; rela?ons of those men, had an eye to their owne safetie, and not to the Colonies good; and that therevpon the King referred the whole considera?on of ye Plantation, and what was best to be done, to his care. Vpon this he propounded vnto those before named, that ye best way to engage the Kinge in his care of the Plantations, and to make it impossible for any hereafter to disturbe the Companie, as they had formerly done, was to thinke of some such meanes, whereby the proffitt of his Matie, &amp; the good of ye Plantation, might hand in hand goe together. And to speake truth, though those he spoke wthall, were at first very vnwilling to swallowe this guilded pill, as having heard of ye stile he vsed in negotiatinge other businesses of this nature: yet he was so full of protesta?ons in it, euer pretending our ? the Companies ? good, and wth all procured further inti- ma?on to ye Earle of Southampton, that no service of his could be more acceptable to his Matie then this now propounded: ? that ? Vpon these protesta?ons &amp; assurance, they engaged themselues to treat of a Contract betweene his Maty &amp; the Companies. In the making whereof, ye said Earle of Mid? remembred not his promised care of ye Plantations, but in truth from one degree to another, wrested vs to such condi?ons, &amp; such a rate, as was very dammeagle to ye Planta?ons. But vpon serious debate in many &amp; full Courts, vpon the whole matter wee were resolved, consider- ing the protection of the Colonies, &amp; fauour promised; and to be free from those frequent proiects that in former tymes had so much wronged &amp; dis- turbed vs, to accept an hard bargayne: conceavinge that though it were not so good as wee desired, &amp; was fitt to haue bin offerd; yet by it wee should bee in a better case &amp; way of benefitting the Plantations, then formerly wee were. And so in Michaelmas terme 1622 this Contract wch began to be treated of in Easter terme, was concluded by the subscription of the Earle of Middlesex his hand, and by sending the Company word, that that day the § whole § Counsell board had given their assent therevnto, wch was the first tyme the Companie vnderstood that they had heard of ye matter. [13] The Contract thus concluded, a great Tempest arose, by what secrett cause &amp; vnderhand procurement, wee may guesse, but cannot affirme. But in a Court of the Company vpon the 4th of December followinge, one Mr Wrote Cosen Germane to the Earle of Middlesex (discontented also that hee was passed ouer in the election of Officers,) did wth a passionate &amp; blastring speech, inveigh agaynst the Contract, &amp; the menaging thereof wth Sallary; agaynst the proceeding in the Treaty of it, as that it had bin vnduly and vniustly carried, that men had bin overawed; and that it had bin procured to private ends. Whereof not being able to make any shadowe of proofe, &amp; persisting still in his violent &amp; contemptuous demeanor, vpon a full hearinge, he was thrust out of the Companie; and vpon that ioyned himselfe to Sr Thomas Smith, Alderman Johnson &amp; that opposite party, &amp; drewe also wth him Two more of his Companions, and so now made shewe of a formall party agaynst the Company. But for all this wee still mayntayned the reputa?on of or proceedinge. The next of or troubles in order, (proceeding from what secrett cause, that wch followes will give yor Lops more reason of coniecture, then wee will now affirme,) was that this opposite party then attayned to about 25 in nomber, had some secrett encouragemt or other given them, directly to oppugne the Contract; wch, as is before declared, was so formally made: And gaue some reasons in writing agaynst it to the then Lord Tr?r; who receaving them, gaue the Company first suspi?on of double intelligence &amp; indirectnes in his dealinge. But howsoeuer, the Earle of Southampton, the Lo: Cavendish, Sr Edwin Sandis &amp; some other, being called by the Earle of Middlesex to his Chamber at Whitehall, then thought, that they had given such answeres to them, as that his Lop rested satisfied. But his Lop after, speaking wth ye Ea: of South'ton and the rest before named told them, that they that had aopposed, were a clamorous Company, and that to make the busines goe current, it were best that their objections &amp; or answeres should be heard at the Counsell table. And vpon hearing there of their accusa?ons, and or answeres, the Earle of Middlesex, who assumed the chiefe knowledge &amp; care of that busines, did in ye close of that hearinge vse the words formerly rehearsed, Of the leaud carriage in former tymes, and of the latter in a manner miraculous recoverie. A greater testimony of or integritie &amp; their guilt, could not be given. But as the sequell will manifest, &amp; as wee haue since found in other of his Lops proceedings, he meant to loose nothing by those word?. [14] Howsoeuer it was, &amp; whatsoever wee suspect, not intending now to dive into those miseries; from that day forward, to ye Conclusion of this busines he professedly made himselfe the patron to that side, &amp; enemy to the Com- pany; for wch wee appeale to yor Lops better knowledge. Afterward? about that Contract were divers meetings before the Lord?, where it was principally inveighed agaynst by Sr Nathaniell Rich, speaking against the iniustice &amp; vnconscionablenes of it; protesting that he had euer sold his Tobacco for Fiue shillings a pound one wth another, and that euery pound cost him Two shillings six pence in ye Su?er Islands: and now to give a Third away ?to the King? &amp; peradventure ye price not to be much higher, was agaynst Justice &amp; Conscience. And here by the way, wee humbly craue leaue to say thus much, that his Conscience now serues him in this new Contract, to force ye Planter &amp; the Adventurer to sell their Tobacco, the best sort for 2s 4d and the second sort at sixteene pence a pound. But vpon that former Demonstrative Argument of his, though it were so fully answered as nothing could be more, yet the Earle of Middlesex tooke his ground to condemne the Contract he had signed, as hurtfull to the Planta?ons; and to comaund the Companies to thinke of propounding a better &amp; to to bring it ?in? writing wthin Two daies: Wch was accordingly done: and therein shewed, that ye hardnesse of this Contract, was not by the Companies proposition, but by his Lops pressure. And therefore vrged what had bin offred to his Lop at the first; that his Matie would be contented wth a fourth, &amp; not require a Third of or Tobacco. To wch in great scorne his Lop replyed that take Two pence out of Six pence there would remayne a Groat. But the last Parliament sawe that his best invention, was by adding 3li to 40s to make vp Five pound. But in conclusion that Contract was dissolved, &amp; a comaund laid vpon the Companies by his Lops procurement, to bring all or Tobaccoes in, vnder colour that Three pence custome was abated; Whereas in truth, by his admitting also of all Spanish Tobacco vpon Sr John Wolstenholmes motion, wee could not vent a third part of it here: and so by computa?on, in respect of the quantitie vnvented, wee paid neere double as much as before: Wch was his only favour to ye Plantations. The Contract thus dissolved, as publiq'ly damageable, by the incourage- ment of the Earle of Middlesex, &amp; industry of ye Five and twenty before men?oned, (that so place might be made for this [15] Latter Contract, so privatly beneficiall, for so by the effect it hath appeared): the Governemt was now likewise to be questiond and altred, or else they compassed not their end?. Which to bring about, these two wayes were vsed: First a peti?on was delivered to his Maty by Allderman Johnson, in the name of the rest, inveighing agaynst the latter Governemt, &amp; magnifying the former. And in the end, desiring a Comission to examine the proceedings of thi§e§s§e§ last Fower yeares This Peti?on was by the Company at large answered to his Maty, &amp; wee ioyned in ye point of having or Actions examined by the Comission: but wthall thought it iust, &amp; desired, that their Twelue yeares Governemt before might bee also examined: Wch accordingly was ordered. The second meanes vsed by them, was to rayse vp Captayne Butler, who hasting from the Su?er Ilandes to Virginia, where he stayed but a few weekes, vpon his returne delivered to his Maty, a Paper called The Vnmasking of Virginia. The substance of wch was, first the dispraise of the Country, &amp; making of it an vnfitt place for any English Colony; &amp; next, scandalizing the Governemt of it, both here, &amp; there. What concerned the Colonie, was proved to be false by Forty witnesses: who chaunced to be in Towne then, &amp; had bin often &amp; long in ye Colonie: And was endeavored to be mayntayned by him by two meanes only: one by practizing to gett the hand? of Two men vnto it, to whome he owed mony &amp; deferred payment: who when they heard it read in Cort, protested that they never saw what they sett their hands to, and that Capt: Butler told them it was to a Paper, wch he would shew the King for the good of the Plantation: and desired ye Companies pardon; for whatsoeuer was there said was false. Secondly he would haue made it to haue bin better believed, by a forged ?re wch hee brought to Sr John Bourchier from his daughter Mrs Whittakers: who knew it was not her hand1 1 In pencil. . This was alleadged at ye Counsell Table: &amp; Capt' Butler answered, that shee was sicke, &amp; dictated it to him, and he wrote it. But since, both shee &amp; her husband being come ouer, they bothe forsweare it, &amp; say it was none of her doinge nor direction. But howsoeuer, by those meanes the opposite party thus farre obteyned their ends, that by the Defamation, and this trouble ensuinge, a very great nomber that intended to haue gone ouer, were discouraged. [16] But yet for all this, the Companie knewe their cause to be so iust and iustifiable, that they did not abandon it: but prepared themselues to give divers charges before ye Comissionrs, agaynst divers of ye partie opposite; &amp; professed themselues ready to make their owne defence whensoever they should be charged. But whilst the Comission sate, farther to discourage vs, first of all or Bookes, &amp; after ye Minutes of them were sent for away from vs: that none of the ?res that then came from Virginia were to be seene by vs, being all seazed on by the Comissionrs. But touching the rest of ye Cariage of that Comission, because it was at large delivered in Parliament, &amp; offered to be proved, if further proceedinge in that businesse had not bin forborne vpon a ?re written to ye house from his Matie wee will now to yor Lops say only this; That whatsoever was brought by vs concerninge Accounts, Depreda?on, misgovernement, &amp; diuers other crimes, agaynst perticuler persons, was by this Comission, (especially directed by the Earle of Midd,) shuffled of for all the tyme, till the Comission was even at ye end, and nothing done vpon them. And on ye Contrary, whatsoever could be gathered out of the fragments of ?res from discontented persons in Virginia, concerning ?either? the place or governemt was diligently collected by them, and receaued by the Earle of Middlesex, as a great testimony agaynst vs; and would not take those other ?res for proofe wch wee euer guided orselves by, and came from the Governour and Coun- sell there. And lastly some three days before their Comission ended, they putt vs on a sodayne to answere to 39 Articles, or else they would take them pro confesso. This they thought for vs impossible to doe. But wee deceaved their expecta?on; and they could not find in the least perticuler, any iust ground to make any report agaynst vs. By all this, the Earle of Middlesex and that partie, perceaving ye Companie would not be beaten off a good cause; there was a practise to try whither wee had rather part from the busines, or from our mony. Wherevpon wee were called before the Counsell agayne, and there that side as compassion- ate affecters of the Plantation, vrged the want of Corne &amp; other necessaries there, and that they were like to perish for want of provisions. The Earle of Mid? replyed it was a matter of so great importance, &amp; concerned the liues of so many of the Kings Subjects, that if ye Companie would not presently take order for sending Supplies, the State would call in their Pattent. Wherevpon ye Companie conceavinge that if they did send supplyes, their Patent would not [17] be taken from them, vnderwritt to a Roule; (though they knewe ye necessitie was nothing so great,) foure thousand and odd pounds, wch was paid and sent; and those Gentlemen that before seemed so zealous subscribed Twelue pound?, and paid it not. Vpon wch comparison wee leaue it to yor Lops to iudge, wch party was the true father of this Child. This then not succeeding according to their desires, certayne obscure persons were found out by the Earle of Mid?, to be sent into Virginia, as Comissionrs, for these two ends, as wee haue since found. First to sifte out what they could agaynst the forme of or Governemt here, &amp; there; &amp; next to persuade the people to become Peti?oners to his Matie for a newe. Wch suceeeded not according to their expecta?on. For by the Colonies Peti?ons, answeres to those Papers that had bin delivered agaynst them here, &amp; divers other remonstrances to his Matie from a Generall Assembly there, they shewed the misery wherein they lived, or rather languished in Sr Thomas Smithes tyme; and their happy estate in this latter Governement: concludinge that if his Maty intended to alter the Governement, &amp; putt it into the former hands, their humble suite to him was, That Comissionrs might be sent ouer to another purpose before declared. The writinges themselues will manifest this more at large. These Comissioners thus sent to Virginia, the Earle of Mid? &amp; the rest were not idle in further distractinge the Companie here at home. And about Michaelmas a mo?on was made to the Companie, to give their assents for surrendring their Pattent, &amp; altringe the forme of Governemt; &amp; a newe one was proposed: Wch according to order they takinge into consid- era?on, wth duetie refused: rendring also in writing the reasons of their refusall. Wherevpon a Quo Warranto was directed by the Earle of Mid? suggestion, for the calling in of their Pattent. In the meane time, to affright men, both from cominge to, &amp; much more from speakinge in Courts, mens words were there carped at &amp; complayned of; and their persons by the Earle of Mid? prosequution, were vpon quick hearinge sent to prison. Yet for all this the Comp9 stood to their owne Justifica?on, &amp; defence of their Pattent. Now Mr Atturney, according to ye duty of his place, &amp; instructions given him, vrged ye misgovernemt of the Companie, &amp; consequently ye ruyne of the Plantation. To wch point wee were willinge to ioyne issue. But afterwards in or reply to his pleadinge, wthout further enquiry of the former allegation, advantage was taken vpon or mispleading, &amp; in fine wthout any further ground that wee knowe of, the Patent was in Trinity terme following Condemned: But for any thing that wee haue yet seene, no iudgment entred. [18] Yor Lops by the perticulers before related, do see by what courses wee were reduced to this extremitie. One thing yet wee thinke most necessary to adde; It hath bin said by many, &amp; perticulerly by some principall persons of the opposite partie, that ye Dissolutions of these Planta?ons was part of the Count of Gondomars Instructions: And certaynely wee found his activenes in negotiatinge here, such, that in bringing about his owne ends, he could create here instruments of orselues agaynst our selues. Wee say not that he &amp; other Spanish Ministers practised thus amongst vs. These two only perticulers, wee craue leaue to offer vnto yor Lops Judgemt?. When Sr Samuell Argoll some six or seauen yeares since, was vehemently complayned agaynst, by Padre Maestro, and the Spanish Secretarie then here for Piracie, agaynst the Kinge of Spaines subiects in ye West Indies: he no sooner came home from Virginia, &amp; appeared an Opposite to ye present Company, who question'd him for divers misdemeanors, and amongst others for this, but the heate of the Spanish accusa?on did presently cease. Our second observa?on in this; Yor Lops cannot but remember, wth what extreame earnestnes the Count of Gondomar, and afterwards Don Carlo di Coloma, inveighed agaynst Capt9 Butler whilst he was in ye Summer Islandes, about ye Spanish wrack. And so violent were they about it, that ye Lo: Steward, now wth God, and the Lo: Chamberlaine, were entreated to come on pur- pose to the Su?er Islands Company, about that busines. And a Comission was directed by the Lords of the Counsell, to examine the truth of the cause in ye Su?er Islands. Wch Captaine Butler having bin forewarned of by some freinds of his, lefte his Governemt before he had leaue, and before the arivall of the Comission: Having first there endeauoured to alienate the minds of the people from the forme of Governemt here. But he was no sooner come home, &amp; delivered to his Matie The Vnmasking of Virginia before spoken of, but there was an end of Don Carlo Di Colomars prosequution. Wee haue related the particulars; &amp; make no application. As for ye late Comission, wch hath succeeded in ye place of the Companie; if wee might haue seene the busines seriously taken into the Graue cares, &amp; prosequuted wth the Noble paynes of those most honoble personages, whose names are inserted in the sayd Comission: wee should haue hoped to haue seene some good effect [19] befitting their great &amp; eminent worth. But whilst their more weighty Affaires haue hindred them, the businesse hath bin principally carried only by those persons, that were the chiefe Opposers of the late Comp9, For although there be named divers worthy Gentlemen, &amp; Cittizens likewise, in ye Comission: yet as wee vnderstand, the most of them haue forborne altogether to appeare at any meetinge. Wherefore when either in or wordes or thoughts, wee complayne of any proceedings of the late Comission; wee allwayes except both all ye persons of Honour, &amp; indifferency: and onely intend those others, whose stomacks were so great, as they durst vndertake the overthrowinge of the late Companie; and yet their harts so narrow, as they haue not dared to adventure all of them during these Nyne moneths, as farr as wee can learne, one five poundes to ye advancemt or subsistance of the Plantation. By the publiq' ?res of ye Gouernour delivered them in July last, they vnderstood of ye extreame want of Powder in ye Colonie: and were often told from vs of the great danger that might ensue thereby. Yet did they neglect ye sending of any in the first Shipp, or in ye Second: but about Christmas, &amp; since in March, they haue sent a small quantitie, obteyned by his late Mats guift (as wee heare) out of the Tower. 31 July 1624. Sol. Gen. to Con- way for powder for Virginia out of 2 in store1 1 Manuscript illegible, but it may be—"but answered that she was sick". This did not ye late Company: who vpon notice of ye Massacre, did by the first shipp send 42 Barrells of Powder; for halfe whereof the Officers having disbursed the mony, are yet vnsatisfied. Whereas all the Fower shippes now sent, were prepared in ye Compañstyme; these last Comissioners callinge in the Comissions graunted them by the late Company, made them take newe as from themselues; that so they might glory vpon anothers founda?on: But whilst they thus hunted after windy ambition, hindringe the two first Shipps from takinge a faire winde; they haue bin the causes of all the lamentable calamities &amp; distresses, wch in so long voyages must needs befall them. The principall scope of his late Mats Comission to them, as wee vnderstand, was, that they should finde a better forme of Government for the Planta?ons advancement; and therein is especially promised the conserva?on of euery mans right. Intentions worthy the wisedome &amp; Justice of so great a Prince. But as farr as wee can vnderstand, these Comissionrs haue done nothing towards either of these ends: But quite contrary to ye second. [20] By an vnknowne Contract, wch themselues will not so much as declare, much lesse are able to defend; they haue sought to share amongst them- selues, twice as much vpon euery mans goods, as they will leaue to the Owner thereof. And although they say only three of them are Contractors yet wee cannot belieue it; having observed the ends of some of them for many yeares, to haue constantly bin bent to the compassinge of some such advantage, as they haue now by this bargayne gayned. It is constantly reported that they haue liberally given that wch was not their owne, to those who haue no right thereto; as namely the Colonies Mine to Sr Samuell Argoll, &amp; Mr Woodall surgion to Sr Thomas Smith. But this &amp; all their other proceedinges are kept in great secrett: wch breeds suspi?on that they haue not bin good; else why doe they fly the Light? This is cleane contrary to ye vse of the late Company: who did all thinges in publi?: wch was a cause of §as§ great satisfac?on, as this of Distaste. And as in this, so in all other thinges do they proceed cleane contrary to all right in or vnderstandinge. They publish their Intention of imployinge Sr Samuell Argoll &amp; Captaine Butler for Governours agayne in the Plan- tations: agaynst whome the Colony hath professed open enmity. How they should make ye Colony encrease by these meanes, wch will bring home most of them that are there allready, wee cannot imagine. Neither are Sr Thomas Smith nor Alderman Johnson fitt or likely men to revnite the late Companie, or to drawe them on to any thinge for ye Plantations advancement: since as the whole world knowes, the late Companie haue not only allwayes conceaved extreamly ill of them, but in the yeare 1623. putt vp publi? accusa?ons agaynst them, of very dan- gerous Consequence. As for ye Colony, yor Lops haue formerly heard their like opinions. Nor cann ye late Companie conceaue, Mr Wrote, a fitt Instrumt to sett forward the busines; whome they though vnworthy to bee of their Societie. Nor that those who out of pretence for New-Englands good, haue truly wronged Virginia, should now runne a right way for the behoofe thereof. Nor in su?, that those who haue §little or§ no interest in ye Plantation, should be so sencible of it as were fitt. In wch number wee accompte Sr Nathaniell Rich; whoe to our knowledge hath not aduentured any thinge for the good thereof but contrary wise hath been so prpo perpetuallie a hinderer, &amp; disturber of the Action, that the body of the Company, ad- dressed a Peti?on of Complainte, to the last Parliament, crauinge iustice against him, for his iniurious &amp; most vnworthy practises. [21] Nor that they that meane not to adventure any thinge, wilbe able to persuade others to doe that wch themselues forbeare. Nor that euer they will do ye Adventurers of ye late Companie right, in matters of their Estates; that haue so violently endeavoured to do them wrong in their Honors &amp; Reputa?ons: hauing intended as themselues wright, a Reforma?on &amp; Correction of the Originall Court bookes of ye late Com- panie then possessed by them, if they could haue gott into their hand? certayne copies of them wch Mr Nicholas Ferrar late Deputy had at his owne charges caused to be transcribed. But before their seuere order came to him, he had delivered his copys to the Earle of Southampton: who sent the Comissioners word, that he would as soone part wth the evidences of his Land, as wth the said Copies; being the evidence of his honour in that service: so by this meanes haue the Originall Courtbookes yet escaped purging: And wth all duety wee humbly beseech yor Lops, that they may hereafter be protected from it: And that howsoeuer yor Lops shall please for the future to dispose of the Companie, that the records of their past Actions may not be corrupted &amp; falsified. As for their resolu?ons of orderinge the busines, wee cannot say any thinge, because wee heare nothinge, and wee doubt they meane nothinge. For all that wee heare tends only to nothing. They dislike the sending of nombers of men. They professe the reducinge of all tradinge to a Joynt- stock or Magazine: wch courses in or iudgements tend directly to the subversion of the Plantation, at least to ye appropriatinge of it to them- selues which to haue bin the mayne end of some of them, ye late Counsell &amp; Companie for Virginia, haue vpon strong presump?on bin long agoe induced to belieue: and therefore haue now thought themselues bound to declare it, that yor Lops in yor Noble wisedomes may make such due pre- ven?on as shalbe fitt: humbly beseechinge that this perticuler examina?on of their Actions &amp; persons, may not be interpreted to proceed from private spleene, but only from a sincere desire of ye Plantations advancement. Wee doubt and feare, that wee haue wearied yor Lops wth ye large relation of the proceedinges of these men, wee meane the partie opposite to the late Companie &amp; Colonie. Whereby as they haue laid all kind of Dis- reputa?on vpon the Action, and made that in ye estima?on [22] of the world vilde &amp; contemptible, wch before was held worthy, beneficiall, &amp; honourable: so by their manifold &amp; incessant practises, to wrong &amp; oppresse, to defame &amp; disgrace, by vniust &amp; vnworthy aspersions &amp; contumelies, (&amp; that by word &amp; writing ouer all ye kingdome) the innocency of men zealous for the good of Virginia, for no other fault saue only for their love of right &amp; iustice; they haue bredd a great disheartninge &amp; discouragemt of many the most forward &amp; most constant Adventurers, whose industry also &amp; labours have bin of great vse to ye Plantation. All wch being wearied out wth their mallice and iniuries, and loath to spend more of their lives in so vnthankfull a service, are humble suitors vnto yor Lops, that they may be spared from all farther employment in this Action. And that if these men will now at length apply themselues seriously to ye busines of of ye Colonie, both wth their paynes &amp; purses, wch they haue hitherto spared, and vndertake (wch they owe to his Matie &amp; ye State) the repairinge those ruynes of the Plantation, whereof they haue bin the chiefe cause and instruments: the Governement thereof may, as it is, be continued in them, giving fitt securitie for so great a debt &amp; duty. For wee protest vnto yor Lops, vpon our truth &amp; fidelitie, that if his Maty may be served, the Colony secured &amp; cherished, iustice duly administred, mens rights &amp; states preserved, innocent men not oppressed, and malefactors not protected &amp; rewarded; wee shalbe so farr from envying the glory of their Governement, that extinguishing for euer the memory of all their former iniuries, wee wilbe ready to doe them all fitt service that they shall require. By this wch hath bin said, yor Lops will easily perceaue, that obedience to yor comaund?, and a desire that ye Plantation (if possibly) may yet subsist, is ye end of or labour: not that wee intend, or haue any enclina?on, to encomber our selues, wth a busines so vexed &amp; perplexed; but only ayme at what may bee to the good of it, though to or owne trouble. But if yor Lops in yor wisedomes, shall not thinke it fitt to putt it into their handes: or that they, wth such caution as may be reasonably desired, shall not adventure to vndertake it: Wee then will notwithstandinge, in expres- sion of or duty to his Maty and the State, in respect of our ancient &amp; present love to ye Plantation, and for the speciall benefitt that may succeed to this Kingdome by such a place of securitie &amp; retreate in America; (the wont [23] whereof, as by experience in many particulars may be demon- strated, was in the late Queenes tyme the overthrowe of most of or voyages sett out for the West Indies) for these reasons wee say, wee shall endeauour or best, but dare not vndertake, to restore what these others haue ni allmost destroyed. But yet that, vpon such condi?ons, as wee hold most necessary for the effecting of so great a worke, that is, some impediments to bee removed, &amp; some encouragements to be given to it. It hath bin a great errour, for any to imagine, that the persons of these men, who haue of late thus opposed the Companie, were either in nomber considerable, or in adventure to be valued any way at all, to further or advance the prosperity of the Plantation: but rather on the contrary, great impediments to the faire proceeding of it: And therefore whereas the late Companie, haue by the vniust practises of divers of these, and some of them vnworthy persons, suffered so much in the reputa?on of their persons &amp; actions, aswell by private calumny, as also in some publi? proceedings agaynst them: Wee shall for that cause most humbly desire, that ye Actions &amp; passages of or late Governemt, may be brought to an vpright examina?on, before this Honoble Board: and that being found, as wee assure ourselues they will, to haue bin most iust, &amp; euer tending to ye Plantations advancement, wee may then haue iust repara?on from those, by whome wee &amp; the Plantation it selfe haue bin so much wronged: That the like dangers may be hereafter prevented, by discouraging others from the same attempts; and that wee the late Company, being restored to the integritie of or reputa?ons, may bee the better enabled to goe on wth ye Action, for ye tyme to come. Nowe in reguard of the extreame distresse &amp; poverty, that by these late practises of ye Colony is reduced vnto; and by reason of ye disability, &amp; vnwillingnesse of Adventurers, being so extreamely discouraged, and who haue allready wasted a great part of their tyme, and no small part of their estates, in supportinge this Plantation: as also in reguard of the great danger that may be feared from a forraigne enemy: Wee shall most humbly desire, that his Matie would be pleased, to yield vnto the Plantation, some such moderate supply, as after the late Massacre was promised in the last Kings tyme; Namely, the settinge out of Foure hundred able men, at the vol- untary charges of the seuerall shiers of this Kingdome, proportionably to be rated. And besides for ye present [24] pressing necessitie, to give vs some such reasonable proportion of Munition &amp; Powder, as in reguard of these tymes may be thought convenient. These difficulties &amp; impediments being eased or removed, wee come now in the last place to present our humble opinions, touching the best forme of Governement to be here established for Virginia; wherein wee humbly offer to yor Lops considera?on, whether it may not seeme requisite, that a Companie be agayne erected of Adventurers &amp; Planters for the governinge &amp; menaginge of the affaires of that Plantation. In the waginge whereof, wee haue divided our thoughts into these three branches: If his Matie should be pleased himselfe to vndertake the Plantation, and the charge thereof to be defrayed out of his Royall Treasure; or otherwise at the Generall charge of the Kingdome: Wee hold it out of question, that the fittest Governement of the Action, were by a select Counsell of Honoble &amp; able persons, to be ordayned and appoynted by his Matie, as is vsed in like cases in some forrayne Dominions. But if the burden &amp; charge must be borne by the Adventurers and Planters themselues: Wee hold it necessary in that case, that ye Governmt thereof be also co?ended by his Maty to them, incorporated as before into a Legall Companie: yet so, as to be assisted &amp; advised by a Councell to be appoynted by his Maty &amp; bound by oath vnto him; and they also to haue refference in all causes of greatest &amp; extraordinary importance, to his Matie himselfe, or to the Lords of this privy Counsell, from thence to take resolu?on &amp; direction, as was formerly instituted, and in the latter times also practised. And this is agreeable to ye co?on vsage of the world, &amp; in perticuler of this Nation: experience having manifested, that men are difficultly drawne to adventure any great matter in these Actions, in ye ordering of wch they haue no voice or interest. For as for this late third way of Governement, by an absolute Comission, disprovided of other meanes, saue what should be raysed from ye Plan- ta?on experience hath taught, that it cann worke no great effect, the hearts of all the Adventurers being turned away from the Action, &amp; ye Plantrs there in great part, vpon the bare feare &amp; forerunning rumour of this Comission, resolving to come away &amp; desert the Plantation. Howbeit if such of ye Comissioners themselues, as formerly enioyed or partaked, &amp; now affected this Governement, would haue opened their owne purses, as was promised to his late Maty, for the support of the Plantation; [25] it might perhaps haue bin continued on for some longer tyme: Whereas now all men avoiding to adventure vnder them, &amp; they not disposed to give example in that kind, but rather to agitate and frame Contracts, whereby themselues might growe rich, though wth the penury &amp; consumption of the Generall Planta?on: the Colonie there doth wast by hasty Degrees, and will suddaynly come to nothing if speedy, remedy be not provided. Now if yor Lops shall thinke good to approve of or humble opinion, (wch wee in all duty submitt vnto yor Lops maturer iudgements,) and that ye Companie be reerected by his Mat? ?res Pattents &amp; vnder his great seale, as it formerly was: then doe wee further presume to offer vnto yor Lops considera?on, these few perticulers here ensuinge. First wee hold it requisite, that this new Pattent should contayne ye same priviledges &amp; Li?ties, the like orders &amp; directions, as were in the former: yet wth this, that if there appeare in ye former graunts, any thinge inconvenient, as preiudiciall to his Maty, it be reformed: Secondly, in reguard ye Colonie, taking all ill pleight at ye beginning, doth still runne only §on§ in plying only Tobacco, notwthstanding ye great charges wch the Companie was at, in the tyme of the latter Governement, for ye setting vp of better Comodities, as Silke, Wynes, Iron, materialls for shipping, and others: that his Matie would be graciously pleased, con- tinuing the Custome vpon Tobacco, to remitt the custome of all other com- odities for certen yeares; wch wee suppose would be a matter of very small losse to his Matie, aboundantly to be recompenced in ye yeares ensuinge; and yet a great meanes to drawe the Colony to those better courses, wch no orders of the Companie could yet euer effect: And likewise, that ye Customrs be restrayned from extorting Custome of goods transported thither for mens perticuler provisions, &amp; not by way of Merchandize, as the Law requires. Thirdly, that in this Pattent there be declared a nullitie of all the proceed- ings of the late Comissioners; having bin vpon iust caase soe extreamly distastfull both to the Adventurers &amp; Planters. Fourthly &amp; lastly it is desired, that his Matie would be graciously pleased that this new Pattent be confirmed by Act of Parliamt, if ye Lords &amp; Co?ons wthall so thinke fitt. And this wee hold requisite for two important reasons: First wee suppose it will greatly encourage the Adventurers &amp; Planters, [26] by giving them assurance of ye continuance of this Planta?on, and of their seuerall estates &amp; possessions in ye same: the iealousy wch hath bin bred by the late Quo warranto, being not otherwise possibly to be removed. And this encouragemt would be greatly encreased, if by his Mat? Royall authoritie, wth consent of Parliament, bothe Planta?ons might be annexed to ye Imperiall Crowne of this Realme, according vnto ye comendable pollicie of some other great Kingdoms. Secondly by meanes of this Act, the New Company may be inabled to recover ye Debts due to ye former Company, either vpon Accompt or otherwise; as also to haue restitu?on by a legall course for the great depre- da?ons done vpon ye Colonie. A matter tending greatly to the support of ye Plantation, as also to ye reestablishing of ye good Governemt of ye same. And this is our humble answeare vnto your Lops first proposi?on. [half a page blank] [27] For the second Considera?on, lefte vnto vs by yor Lorpps, namely con- cerning an offer to be made, for such a Contract towchinge Tobacco, wth his Matie, as may both vphould his former Revenue, and not bee greuious to the Plantations, wee say thus. That vnles in yor lorpps wisdome§s§ those Condi?ons by vs formerly propounded bee yeilded vnto, wee cannot treate of this buissines; for wee co?e not as Contractors to make a bargaine for our owne priuate lucre, but wth an ey[e] only to the publique benifitt of the Plantations, as farr as it may be without preiudice of his Mat? proffitt; wthout any reseruation of secrett?, as in the last Contract were pretended: For in a publique bargaine, betwixt his Matie and his people, the most cleere, publique, &amp; direct pro- ceeding? will euer receiue the best interpretation. Wee cannot in our vnderstanding? conceiue, that any proffer though neuer soe greate, cann be for his Maties aduantadge, but rather the contrary, if it so presse vppon the Plantation, that the Planter shall not be able to liue with comfort by his labour: And so others be discouradged, from further proceeding?. A greate reuenue peradventu[re] maye be raysed for a yeare or two, but if the Plantation decaye the revenue cannot last: And thus it had beene, if the last Contract had gon on; though the immense gayne had come to the Contractors themselu[es] &amp; not to his Matie. But now for ourselues, it is true A Contract was formerly treated of betwixt the Company, and the Earle of Middlesex, but as hath been before read vnto yor Lorpps though it were then extreame hard, yett it is nowe impos- sible, by reason of the worse case the Plantation stand? in nowe, then it did then, principally occasioned by the discouradgement? giuen to the Company. Wee acknowledge vnto yor lorpps, that the bestowinge banishinge of all Spanish Tobacco, will much redound to the Plantations benifitt, and his Mat? losse: but withall, wee conceaue that if there were no Tobacco in neither of thei[s] Plantations, itt were better for his Maty to loose seauen or eight thousan[d] Pound a yeare Custome by the not importation of Spanish Tobacco, the[n] to hinder the importation of 100000li a yeare in money, wch this Comodit[y] did, as was cleerely manifested to the two last Parliaments. [28] Howsoeuer, wee intend not vppon the Condi?ons in the former paper mentioned; to make a meane &amp; contemptible offer to his Matie but such a one, as wee conceiue in truth, for the Kings proffitt, to befall as large, &amp; more certayne then this last; and more then at any tyme really came into the Exchequar by this Co?oditie. Profferinge soe much, as wee thinck the Planta?ons can possibly beare &amp; subsist; and goinge as high nowe at first, §as§ we shall euer be drawne to yeild vnto. And doubt not, but that yeildinge vnto his Maty after the first yeare, 10000li certayne, and 3000li a yeare more by Custome, in all 13000li per Annu9, it will be thought more then sufficient from these nowe languishinge Plantations. For in this bargaine the Summer Iland? as well as Virginia are vnderstood to be com- prehended. And so wee are confident, that wee haue given yor Lorpps full satisfaction, to this second proposition, namely, concerninge the offer for such A Contract to be made wth his Matie towchinge Tobacco, as maye both vphould his former reuenue, and not be greiuous to the Plantations. The perticulers followe. That the sole Importation of Tobacco, into the Realmes of England, and Ireland, be graunted by his Mat? Letters Pattents vnder his greate Seale, to the Companies for Virginia &amp; the Su?er Islands. That his Matie, by Proclamation inhibite all others, vnder payne of con- fiscation of their Tobacco, and his Mat? highe displeasure. That likewise the plantinge of Tobacco in England and Ireland, be for- bidden by the saide Proclamation vnder a greiuous penalty. In Considera?on whereof, the Aduenturers, &amp; Planters of both Collonies, wilbe content, that a fourth parte of their Tobaccoes (wch shall yearely come home) shalbe sett aside &amp; sould for publique vses, and out of ye proceed thereof shalbe First payd &amp; dischardged the Custome, due vppon the whole Quantitie (wch shalbe brought home,) wch Custome, shalbe after the rate of iijd ? pound, as nowe it is rated and wilbe ye full Custome that can be requyred, although the Tobacco should be sould after the rate of 6s ? pound. [29] Secondly out of the §proceed§ of the saide fourth parte, there shalbe farther yearely payd vnto hi[s] Maty by waye of thanckfull retribution for his gratious fauors—10000li. The whole remaynder of the proceed of this fowrth parte of Tobacco, shalb[e] First, for the defrayinge of the chardges of menadginge and ordringe this Contract. Accordinge as the Company shall thinck good to proportion itt. And the Surplus, whateuer it bee shalbe bestowed (in such manner as the Companies shall finde most fitt) for the supporte &amp; aduancement of the Plantations. And because it is doubted, that in regard of many difficulties, wch are allwaies in the settlinge of newe buissinesses, the proceed of the fourth parte, for ye first yeare, may not amount to soe much as the propor?ons aboue. Itt is therefore desired, that for ye first yeare his Matie would be gratiously pleased to allowe out of ye proceed of ye saide fourth pa§r§t[e] First, as much as shall defraye the Custome, then 6000li more toward? the vses aboue expressed, and then to accept of the remaynder that shalbe, although it should proue 10000li. But in case it should proue more his Mãtie to haue only 10000li and ye rest to be bestowed as is afore expressed. That the Tobacco to be brought in be consigned in one hand, vizt of such officers as ye saide Company shall appoynt. And that the saide Company haue the sole menadging of the saide sale of Tobaccoe. That the Aduenturers of each Plantation shall not be bound to bringe in any greate[r] Quantities of Tobacco then themselues shall thinck good. It is lykewise desired, that for recouery of all such debt? as shall from tyme to tyme growe due to ye Companies by occasion of this Contract, the saide debt? may be assigned ouer vnto the kinge, when &amp; soe often as need shall require. They likewise desire that there maye be inserted in the Contract, a Graunt &amp; Couenaunte from his Matie against the grauntinge of lycences to Retay- lers of Tobacco: Soe that ye Sale thereof may remayne free as hetherto it hath done. That his Matie be pleased to take a strickt course for the preuenting of all vndue bringinge in of Tobacco by other meanes. That all confiscations and other penalties vppon this Contract be deuided into three part?. The one parte to his Mate vse, the other to ye Com- panies, the third to the Informers.

Wheras Capt John martin formerly recomended by your Lor??s. and lately nominated by his maties Comissioners to be one of his Counsell in Virginia, hath proved him selfe altogether vnwoorthie of either, as is evident, yf your Lor??s shalbe pleased to pervse them, by many depositions and other ?ticulers, in so much as we haue benn forced owt of ye service wch we owe to his matie &amp; this Countrey, to suspende him from the Executione of his place, wherin we proceeded accordinge to the awthoritie formerly given, And ratified by his maties Comissione, and the Comissioners order, To whom we affoorded all respect and favor, not wthstandinge his many delinquencies from his first entrance into the lande, vntill they grew to soe great an excess as was dangerous to his Maties service, and extreamely preiudicyall to the Colony, and we humblie desire that this may be accepted as our iuste excuse. We haue vnderstood from one of his maties Comissioners for virginia, that his matie is highlie incensed against us for punishinge one Edwarde sharples, who beinge farr aboue his qualitie and condicione after the death of mr Secretarye, into whose service at his ernest request, he was first receaued, admitted to wright vnder us as a Clarke, and sworne not to deliuer any copies of our wrightings wthowt leaue from the Gouernor, He contrary to his oath and dwtie, had vppon a secrett practice, delivered our papers wch greatly concernde us, comitted to his charge, for wch his perfidiousnes and periurie, he was sett one the Pillory and lost a peece of one of his eares, though his sentance was to lose them bothe, wch hath been so misreported &amp; aggravated to his Matie, as other thing? also hath benn, as a bloudie and barbarous Acte, and we threatned wth such fowle and iniouryous tearmes as yf we were below the Conditione of ffreemen, We humblie desire Your Lor??s that we may not tread as vppon thornes, in all our a??ons through the malice of our traducers, nor be subiect to theire violent insulting?. Lastlie we are humblie to offer to Your Lor??s consideratione the desperate estate of this Colony, by the late ?nitious contract wch hath diverted his maties royall intentions and bountie to this Colony in grauntinge us the sole importacione of Tobacco, (wch well ordered, would certainely and suddenly advaunce the Plantacione, by the presente inhablinge us for woorkes of woorth and continuance, but by convertinge the benefitt therof to theire privatt and inordinate lucre, hath giuen the Colony the greatest blowe that euer it receaued, And wthowt spedie redress, will proue incur- able, and cause this noble and hopefull Accone to be deserted, The effect? wherof begin to disclose themselues in our scante &amp; miserable supplies, at moste inconscyonable rates, and in the generall discoragement of the whole Colony, And we may not be silent, that some whom his matie hath appoynted Comissioners for those affayres, are contriuers &amp; favorers of this Contract, [14a] Contrary to theire duties and the trust ymposed vppon them by his matie, and some of them alredie by theire divininge and tryumphinge vppon those miserable wantes that we are alredie falen into, shew they well enoughe vnderstande the inevitable ?nitious conse- quences of the Contract, wch will, as they say, make us rather to be pittied then expostulated wth all.

Thus humbly desiringe your Lor??s to take our innocence into your Honor? patronage, and that accordinge to the Coustome of the former tymes We may nott be Condempned before we be harde, and that the Colony may nott fale whilst it is in our Charge by the sinister practice of others, wch frustrate all our endevers we humbly take our leaues, And rest and remaine James Cytie the 15t? of June 1625.

We haue had many royall assurances of his maties greate care and favor to this Plantatione &amp; we returne our humblest thanks vnto his Highness, yt (not wthstandinge the revokinge the former Pattent) he hath gratiously ?mised, not only to confirme, but to enlarge wth ample priveleges ye private interest? of Adventurers &amp; Planters. It is trew there hath been a late decrease in ye progress of Adventures and supplies sent hither, butt in other respect? ye Colonie was in a hopefull waye &amp; in as good a Conditione as ever, howsoever his matie hath benn informed the Contrarye as appeers by your L?es to our noe smale preiudice. We haue to our vtmoste habileties endevered to discharge that trust imposed vppon us by his matie in his late Comissione, but we hope that we shalbe shortlie eased of this burthen, ye Comissione beinge only for the present, in ?ticuler, Sr: Francis wyatt doth render all humble thankes to his matie that he was graciouslie pleased to dispence wth his service, in grauntinge leave at his choyse, to retourne, Although at our ernest request?, and his zeale to the Actione he is Content to staye a little longer, the arivall of a new Gouernor, wch we haue longe expected. It is no new thinge to us to be wronged by the defamatione of malitious rumors, wheras this concerninge Capt Haruy may match any in falshoode, and we desire that the awther therof, yf it cann haue any, may be noted wth ye infamye of a slanderer, and we wounder that such a rumor should goe vncontrolde, when mr Porye one of his maties Comissioners was present at the fynell conclusione of that busines, and coulde haue certified the Contrarie. We had by the laste shippe sente a generall muster wherof we now sende you a copie wth additions of the distances of the severall Plantationes, How they haue been since awgmented, you shall know by the next generall muster, wch we intende, god willinge to take after ye next harvest We haue wth these retourned you ann Accoumpte of wt land?, goodes, serv- ants, Tenants, howses, boates or shipps, are any waye belonginge to the Compeny, and wt belong? to ye Offices stated by the Compeny, as farr as we coulde learne by oath or otherwyse. Concerninge the depts and the moytie of the labors of the Compenys Tenants, mr George Sandys now returned hath brought into us an ac- coumpte, wch we heerewith send you. That transactione made by the Compenye to the Gouerner and mr George Sandys was in ?te of Satisfactione of theire ?mised meanes, a dwe dept, and not a gifte, And to haue it wrested from them, vppon the revokinge of ye Pattent, we accoumpte it a greate oppressione consideringe his maties gracyous ?mise of preservinge ye ?ticuler interest of every man, other alienatione we know nott of. We hope yt no man doupts but yt it was necessarie to enioyne ye Planters to finde men towardes ye erectinge of a Blockhowse, though it fayled in suc- cess, through many misaccidents, easier to Censure, then to haue pre- vented, the five pounde of Tobacco ? pole was not imposed, Lest a volun- tarie contributione of such as had been at no charge conceringe the same, to ease the burthen of others, of wch little hath been gathered, The tenn pownde of Tobacco was also a volutary gift of ye Countrey, and ye charges allowed uery necessary, nether could it be expected, consideringe our troubles, but yt they should haue been much greater, Howsoeuer ye Cla[m]or of some suborned calumniators may haue moved you to cale it a pretext, And we hope that ye free Acts of the Countrey shall not be farther ques- tioned to the preiudice of any man. The accompts therof as much as haue benn receaued we haue heerwth returned. The fower pownde of Tobacco ? pole was given by ye Countrey to mr Powntis Conditionally yt he receaved the money and solicyted ye cause of the Countrey, wch faylinge, the Countrey conceives yt it must in iustice and equitie retourne to themselves, as ye trwe ?prietors thereof, Besides as we vnderstande, there is like to be suite about ye recovery of the two hundred pownde by mr Pountis his Executor, wch although we doupt not, when the case shalbe trwlie knowne, will appeere to haue no Couller of law or conscyence, yett in the meane tyme it is necessary yt ye saide Tobacco should remane as a securitie to those yt stande engaged, wch is ye generall desire &amp; resolution of ye Countrey. The marchante was never enforced to take Tobacco at three shillings the pownde nor did they allow us aboue twelue pence a pownde at the moste as the Comodities were worthe in Englande, Butt we fownde it absolutlie necessarie to sett some bounde [t]o the sea of theire Covetousnes, that would else haue overwhellmed all, although the penaltye of theire daylie faylinge were never exacted, and since, They haue taken more libertie to them selves vppon this new order, The wch haue beene inhaunsed so intoler- ablely, as yf it contynue but a yeere to an ende, the Colonie will vtterly be ruyned, neyther see we how it can be redrest, except the late ?nitious contracte be overthrowne, wherin we doupt not of your vttermost asist- ance, as the most important service you can do to his Matie for ye vpholdinge of the Colonye. [13] Mr Blany [&amp;c (on next page)] mr Blany never medled wth the disposinge of the maides, But mr Pountis by whose death the accoumpts are left much intangled &amp; perplexed, many in ye list mentioned, wch haue made payment and most of ye rest pretend the like, of wch yett we haue not had tyme to examine the prooffs, That of the Shipwrightes and the glass woorkes geuen in by mr George Sandys we heerwith send you, the death of one of ye princypall woorkmen, an other beinge subiect to the falinnge sicknes, and many defects wch render the woorke vnservable, Hath moved us to Cond[e]scende to the importunate suite of the glass men of returninge for England, wch woorke so longe, as there was any hope, was supported by mr George Sandys to his great charge and hinderance, We haue taken Cautione of them to be at ye disposall of the Adventurers till the expiratione of the tyme of theire Covenants. The accoumpt of Suthamptone hundred, we refer to Sr: George Yardley who is now retorninge for England who alleageth yt it was a dwtie belong- inge vnto mr Pountis, vnto whom he resigned all the estate and accoumpts of yt Plantatione, when that socyetie first appoynted him Threar, but since he harde of his death he hath dilligently enquired into the state therof, and wilbe redie to acquaint you, how it standeth at present.

Not- wthstandinge these irregularities, the substance of the newes they bringe is soe ioyfull and welcome, as after many discomfortes and perplexities, hath revived the hart? of all men namely yt it hath pleased God, to place in the Royall Throne, our gracious Souerainge Charles (whose happie Raigne God of his mercy longe Contynue over us) who not only in pietye, iustice, and wysdome treads in the stepps of his Royall father of famous memory, butt in his affectione and favor to this hopefull Colony, not only by contynuinge ye favors formerly granted, but by addinge and enlarginge them, and takinge the care therof, amidst ye multiplicytie of his great affayrs, into his more neere and specyall Consideratione, wch gives us assured hope that our peticyons, formerly exhibited, shall haue a favorable admittance &amp; such order taken therin, as may best conduce to the advance- ment of the Plantatione, wch as it is noe lesse to be Cherished in the fflorish- inge tymes of peace, then necessary to advance ye enterpryses of warr, Soe it well agres wth ye fortitude and magnanimytie of his most excellent Matie (wherin he emulates the glorie of his renowned ?decessors, to ?secute and give ?fectione, by his Royall favor and bountie to this Honorll Accõne, We humbly therefore desire you to make remonstrance to his gratious highnes, That not only we are vtterlye vnfortified against a forren Enymie, wch we are now allways to expect, but our store of powder and munitione (of late soe scantlie supplyed) is soe extreme shorte as is not sufficyent to secure our Plantations against our Domestique Enymies much less for defence againste Invasione, prosequtione againste the Treacherous Salvages (and the last supplie of powder sent in the Elzabeth (wthowt wch royall bountie of his Matie we could not haue subsisted) cam in so late in Sommer, as the tyme of preparatione for Cuttinge downe the Salvages Corne was paste, And since no additione beinnge made, we cannott vnfurnish our selves of any for that soe necessary service, wch surcease of ours, owt of meere necessitie, gives the Salvages an hope of our inclynatione to peace, of wch they are infinitlye desirous wherby it is probable, that they will plant great quantities of corne in knowne places, soe as yf suplyes of people powder and munitione com in in tyme, we may haue fayre oper-tunitie to revenge theire former Trecheries, wch we haue, and ever shalbe most willinge to ?forme wth our Vttmost abilities although we hope yt some course wilbe taken to ease the Countrey of that greate Charge. About the middle of July last arived Capt Jones in a Spanish ffriggott wch he had taken the west indies vnder the Comissione of the States, as he pretended, graunted to Capt Powell from whose Consort shipp he seperated himself, and putt in heere for reliefe, his vessell beinge very leakey and theire victualls spent. She brought in noe pryze, but some few rawe hides wch by necligenc laye suncke in the shipp and were spoyled, him self dyed shortlie after, and since his death, there are rumors risen contrarie to theire first examinations, of mutyneis &amp; disorders comitted by Joanes and some of his Compeny against Capt Powell, of wch perhaps we may haue more light from England or the lowe Countreys, accordinge to wch, we may the better know how to ?ceed, since we conceave the substance of theire Act? against the Spaniards are not now to strictlie to be questioned.
