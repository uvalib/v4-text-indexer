      <field name="fulltext">Introduction. IN RESPONSE to the invitation of the authorities of the Virginia Agricultural, Mechanical and Tobacco Exposition, the Board of Supervisors of this County appropriated a sum of money for the purpose of making a creditable display of the county's resources at the Exposition, and appointed W. H. Seamon, of the Miller Manual Labor School, commissioner, with full power to collect and arrange the exhibit, and to publish a pamphlet descriptive of the resources of the county. Acting under this authority, we respectfully offer this book to the intelligent public as an accurate, though incomplete, account of the many advantages and inducements, both natural and social, offered by the county to the man of moderate means, as well as to the wealthy, for securing a comfortable home in a prosperous and enterprising community. The materials for this have been collected and prepared under many difficulties, of which the chief, perhaps, has been a lack of time, in consequence whereof several articles have necessarily been omitted. We take this opportunity of expressing our obligations to the following, who have with many others aided and encouraged our labors in various ways—Hon. John M. White, H. M. Magruder, Esq., Mrs. E. C. Harrison, L. T. Hanckel, Esq., Prof. Wm. M. Thornton, Capt. C. E. Vawter, J. W. Porter, Esq., Hon. John E. Massey, Prof. F. W. Massey, Rev. Wm. Dinwiddie, George W. Clarke, Esq., John S. Patton, Esq., D. H. Harmon, Jr., Esq., and D. P. Powers, Esq. To Mr. Wm. H. Prout, the community owes much. For without his enterprise and liberal public spirit it is doubtful if this pamphlet would ever have been published. The Editor,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fourteen Reasons. A FEW reasons why Albemarle County, Va., should be the choice of the immigrant. First. Its unequalled climate, neither too warm nor too cold. Further South ice cannot be gathered for use during warm weather: further North the feeding season is too long. Southern suns are too hot for the greatest diversity of crops; Northern, too cold. Second. It is a section with a minimum of fatal diseases. It is a well-known fact that English Life Insurance Companies require no additional premium from their patrons on their removal to this locality. Third. It is central, near the sea coast with great and increasing facilities for transportation, North and South. Fourth. Lands are cheap. Fifth. It is a section with the greatest capabilities of self-support, having minerals, timber, materials for fabrics and with unexcelled water power for factories. Sixth. It has great diversity of soils, thus allowing the farmer to engage in almost any branch of agriculture. Seventh. Its soil is deep and susceptible of a high state of cultivation answering quickly to manures. Eighth. It is well watered with natural springs. Ninth. It has a variety of valuable mineral waters. Tenth. It is well timbered. There are but few farms which do not produce sufficient timber to supply fires, fences and buildings. Eleventh. Public schools in every community protected by the Constitution of the State. Twelfth. Its advanced schools and University are of such a degree of excellence as to be patronized by all parts of the country. Thirteenth. The Miller Manual-Labor School maintains and educates the orphaned children of citizens of the county. Fourteenth. Its taxes are less than one per cent. per annum. W. Gordon Merrick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Historic Albemarle. THERE has never been a serious attempt to write the history of Albemarle; the notices scattered through biographies, gazetteers, &amp;c., are but broken lights of our county history; yet none of the Piedmont counties has so luminous a history; and that of the tidewater counties surpasses it only in the particular that theirs opens at an earlier date and with a more stirring prologue. There was less war— less of the sudden surprise and stealthy ambush so usual at Jamestown—but a more general interest in the affairs of the country, a more enlightened statesmanship, and a better political philosophy. The first act of our great historic drama had closed at Jamestown, and the scene had shifted westward toward the mountains, leaving its stage in ruins by the James; that persevering essence of history, the development which is usually called the growth of civilization, was gradually bearing the people forward to the point at which they would become weaned from the mother country; in the mountains an apostle of liberty had been born in 1743, in time for his intellect to mature before the mother country should lose the touch of nature which made the parent kingdom and the infant colony kin; when, in 1744, for reasons of church as well as of state, the county of Goochland* * Goochland had been formed from Henrico. was dismembered by an arbitrary line drawn from the fork of the James to the Louisa county line on the one hand, and from the same point "direct to Brook's Mill," thence to Appomattox river on the other. All of the old county of Goochland situated north of this line was named Albemarle after the titular governor of the colony of Virginia, William Anne Keppel, Earl of Albemarle. He never resided here, though it would have suited him well to do so if Horace Walpole may be credited:—"It was convenient," wrote Walpole, "for him to be anywhere but in England. His debts were excessive, though ambassador, groom of the stole,* * First Lord of the Bedchamber in the household of the King of England. governor of Virginia and colonel of a regiment of guards." The Albemarle of 1744 embraced all of what is now known as Albemarle, Buckingham, Amherst, Fluvanna, Nelson, and a part of Appomattox. "In 1769," writes Mr. Jefferson in his brief autobiography, "I became a member of the Legislature by the choice of the county in which I live." The Albemarle which the young Virginian represented had been contracted until it was co-extensive with the county of Albemarle as now defined, and the present county of Fluvanna. While Virginia then was as unlike the Virginia of to-day as can be imagined, still the growing settlements toward the Blue Ridge were invaded by the arts of peace which came from the eastern part of the colony. Occasionally a copy of the first Virginia paper crept into the scattered community. It was a dingy sheet; its small space was filled with the advertisements of the Williamsburg tradespeople and a queer mixture of personal and foreign news; and yet it was the link that bound them to the metropolis; it suggested gay scenes in the Appollo at the Raleigh, and was treasured a great deal more than the ingenious flotsam and jetsam now known as the daily paper. In the first half century of its existence, Albemarle county, if the voice of history is the voice of truth, was chiefly engaged in the production of patriots. Lord Dunmore's removal of the deposits of gunpowder from the magazine at Williamsburg to the English sloop Madeline, produced no more excitement anywhere than here. Dr. George Gilmer's oratory aroused his countymen. A company of 119 volunteers was soon organized of which he took command. It marched to Williamsburg to tender its service to the Colonial Committee of Safety, reaching Walker's Grove (Williamsburg) July 11, 1775. Lieut. Gilmer was the grandfather of the late Governor Thomas Walker Gilmer, and was the first of 208 to sign a document (now the property of the Virginia Historical Society) renouncing "allegiance to George the Third, King of Great Britain, his heirs and successors." Thus the annals of the revolution and of the trying days of disorganization immediately succeeding, are pregnant with meaning. It was not a time when the dreams of the Sans-Culotte could be popular, nor were the spirits of that heroic period such as would embrace his philosophy of disorganization and annihilation. "It was a very great race and faced peril without shrinking, down to the very boys and girls; and what the long years of the future will remember is this heroic phase, not the treaties and protocols of American history."* * John Esten Cooke. During the second half century, no longer disturbed by the throb of war drums, the people devoted themselves to gathering around them the resources and luxuries of refined life—to the establishment of that patriarchal, feudal existence in which broad acres and a host of retainers are important factors. At the height of this system the country gentleman united in his person the planter, the legislator, and the scholar and philosopher. The bowers of the Phillises, Belindas, &amp;c., were not neglected, and the country dances were invariably attended, even by such men as Jefferson, who confessed that he knew the delights of frolicking with a fine girl. Thus the county had made steady progress in its first century; population was gradually moving further westward, where one of the eminences was crowned with a great university—a light set so high that it has been seen of many since then. It had grown also in material wealth. In less than a century what was little more than a wilderness was transformed into a populous and cultivated district. So great was the development that in 1840 there were in the county— neat cattle, 15,000; sheep, 21,000; swine, 35,000; wheat, 327,000 bushels; rye, 117,000; Indian corn, 712,000; oats, 216,000; potatoes, 29,000; tobacco, 2,409,000 (pounds); capital in stores (merchandise), $302,000; capital in manufactories, $261,000; pupils in school, 786; slaves, 13,809; population, 22,924. The first court for Albemarle county was held February 8, 1744, with Joshua Fry as president, and five associates, one of whom was Peter Jefferson. Where the court sat cannot be determined with certainty, for the records of the county covering that period have been lost; still the evidence preserved seems to show that it was at "Mrs. Scott's plantation at Totier." It is certain that subsequent courts were held there. The quarters were contracted and inadequate, and the next year, May 23d, 1745, Samuel Scott proposed a little speculation: he would build the courthouse at his own expense, provided he would be allowed to place the edifice on his own land. The court did not object to this scheme, provided Mr. Scott would give bond with good security for &amp;500—which was done, and the courthouse, stocks and pillory were erected near the James river, on what is now the southern border of the county. For sixteen years the present hamlet of Warren, or some spot near by, was the county seat. When, in March, 1761, Buckingham and Amherst (the latter embracing the present county of Nelson) were cut off from Albemarle, the courthouse was left on the extreme southern edge of the county; and it became necessary, as an act of justice to the people of northern Albemarle, to locate it more centrally. Milton was then the largest town; there a great many Scotch merchants had settled and were selling to the whites (as well as to the Indians who passed en route to Williamsburg to visit "the great father.") Their goods were, of course, imported from England. It would have seemed but natural for Milton to become the county seat, especially as Fluvanna was then a part of Albemarle. But there lived at Castle Hill at that time a shrewd and able gentleman in the person of Dr. Thomas Walker, who owned a large tract of land which enabled him to take advantage of the opportunity to speculate in town lots. He offered a site for the courthouse; the offer was accepted, and the courthouse was built. In those days of union between church and state it was not inappropriate that the high priests in the service of each should meet in a common temple, and it is true that they did: for the courthouse was in the early history of Charlottesville the only public place of religious worship. Dr. Walker gave the land on which the courthouse now stands in good faith, but it is a singular fact that a legal transfer was never made. The statutes show that it was represented to to the legislature that fifty acres of land contiguous to the courthouse of Albemarle were laid off into lots and streets for a village, which, it was asserted, "could be of great advantage to the inhabitants of the county if established into a town for the reception of traders," and the general assembly passed a law "establishing these fifty acres into a town to be known as Charlottesville." The fifty acres were soon divided into a hundred lots, each of which sold for &amp;3 or $15, or $1500 for the entire town. The courthouse was built on its present site, and a tavern was soon one of the attractions of the place. It is uncertain just now whether the "Eagle" or the "Swan" was the first tavern—both were famous in their day, and one of them had for landlord no less a personage than Jack Jouitt, who conveyed to the Legislature at Charlottesville intelligence of Tarleton's approach. The Swan was situated at the corner of Park and Jefferson streets while the Eagle occupied the site of the present Farish Hotel. The Swan has disappeared altogether. About these old hostelries clustered many local traditions. The days of the Revolution drew on, and found Albemarle more thickly settled. The people had imbibed all the ardor for freedom so well portrayed to us in the persons of many of its citizens who then stepped from obscurity into the full light of history. Charlottesville had been founded, but was a mere hamlet still, though "famous," as may be gathered from Anburey, one of the British officers quartered here with the Saratoga troops. "This famous place we had heard so much of," he writes in his "Travels," (a rare book), "consisted only of a courthouse, one tavern and about a dozen houses, all of which were crowded with officers." The soldiers camped "in a wood near the town." This wood was on the farm of Mrs. George Carr. The road leading out of Charlottesville towards the northwest is to this day called the Old Barracks Road. This excellent redcoat writes a few sentences about the want of food, but fills many with sorrowful plaints about the want of decent drink. "Many officers," is his lugubrious confession, "to comfort themselves, put red pepper in water to drink by way of cordial." But all of them did not resort to pepper and water. "The officers drank freely of an abominable liquor called peach brandy, which, if drunk to excess, the fumes raise an absolute delirium, and in their cups were guilty of deeds which would admit of no apology." Albemarle of to-day can offer our English cousins a tipple which even a British officer would not pronounce as bad as that "peach brandy," nor a red-coated dragoon compare with the pepper and water his ancestors drank "to comfort themselves." Here the blood of the vine is shed to some purpose, and the vintage is not inferior to that . . . . . . whose father grape grew fat On Lusitanian summers. Charlottesville occupies no small place in the annals of staging in Virginia, and it is to be regretted that some Virginia Dickens has not given eternal life to our Tony Wellers. One line of stages ran from Washington by way of Warrenton and Orange to this point; another from Fredericksburg by Orange and Gordonsville; another from Richmond—in short, there was direct connection "by coach" with every important point in the State. Albemarle has been the home of many distinguished people. Jefferson lived at Monticello with Monroe (at Ash Lawn) for neighbor; Thomas Mann Randolph at Edge Hill, Wilson Cary Nicholas at Warren, the present home of Mr. John Coles; Thomas Walker Gilmer at Mount Ayr, Andrew Stevenson (Minister to England) at Blenheim, Meriwether Lewis at Locust Hill, Gen. George Rogers Clark, "the Hannibal of the West," a few miles east of Charlottesville, near Pantops; William C. Rives at Castle Hill, the home of Mrs. Amélie Rives-Chanler; Judge Hugh Nelson (Minister to Spain) at Belvoir — indeed, the list is too long to be printed here. Joshua Fry also resided for a time in the county. To this illustrious roll should be added the name of Dr. Thomas Walker, the founder of Charlottesville; and that of his distinguished son-in-law, William Wirt. For Wirt was built the house now known as Rose Hill (a mile north of Charlottesville) which is now occupied by the Misses Craven. It is a neighborhood legend that Mr. Wirt often rehearsed his orations on the quiet and unfrequented banks of the Rivanna near Pen Park. It is a curious fact that Wirt's old law office was sold and moved from the premises of Rose Hill to the nearest county road, and is now occupied by a colored family. John S. Patton. [Extract from Martin's Gazetteer of Virginia, published in 1836.] Piedmont Virginia. This section is as healthy as any portion of the world, the water is excellent and plentiful throughout; the lands fertile, producing in abundance all the staples of the State; easily recovered when exhausted, and always susceptible of high improvement by judicious management; the farms are smaller than in the Tidewater district; the people are industrious and intelligent, and from James River to the Potomac perhaps are the best farmers in the State. Mr. Jefferson pronounced that portion of this section which lies under the Southwest Range of mountains, to be the garden spot of America; and General Washington, when written to by Sir John Sinclair to recommend to him some spot for a residence in America, after passing in review the whole Union, pronounced a residence somewhere on the eastern side of the Blue Ridge, between the Potomac and the James, to combine most advantages, and be the most desirable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monticello Home Life. Life in Albemarle has flowed so smoothly that we have no wonderful deeds of heroism to record amongst her daughters. The earnest army of men which has gone forth from her alone testify to the faithfulness and wise rule among the mothers! who have developed and strengthened minds and characters, which have marched forth to shape the destinies of a nation! This work, done so quietly and effectively, has developed no heroines, no great authoresses amongst us. Two of Albemarle's daughters have been called on to represent the United States at foreign courts. Mrs. Wm. C. Rives represented us so gracefully and acceptably at the Court of Versailles, that the good queen Amélie bestowed her name on, and "stood sponsor for the Democrat's daughter." Of Mrs. Andrew Stevenson it was said that "no foreigner was ever received as much in the family circle while resident at the Court of St. James." Her mental endowments and cultivation caused her society to be sought, but the gentle, cordial sympathy of her manners opened to her all hearts. For the mothers of the present day we would draw a lesson from an example of the past, an example showing what a mother busy with many cares and varied duties may yet achieve for the advancement of her children. In the family of Mr. Jefferson's oldest daughter, we have such an example. Martha Jefferson was born in 1773, losing her mother in 1782; she was taken to Paris by her father in '83, and her education completed in the school of the Penthemont, under the charge of Catholic sisters. The last year of her school life her education was presided over by the good Abbé Edgeworth, who accompanied Louis XVI to the scaffold, and strove to console the royal family in the sad days of their imprisonment. Judging from the school girl letters and from the braids of hair and other mementos which lie before me, school girls in 1788 were very much like those of 1888. Returning to America in 1788, Martha Jefferson was married in 1790 to Thomas Mann Randolph. Mr. Randolph had just finished his education at Edinburgh. Life now begun for these young people in the retirement of the country and amidst the ceaseless round of duties devolving on owners of large land and slave property—no idle life, as all Southerners can testify. Added to these were the cares of hostess and mother of a growing family. The early days of Mrs. Randolph's married life, she employed all her spare time in keeping up her education. The hours when the nurses' meals threw the children on her charge, were utilized in studying Italian verbs. Constant reading and the careful improvement of the little moments, enabled her even amidst the seclusion of Edge Hill to keep abreast with the literature of the day, and to fit herself to carry on, unaided by governesses or masters, the education of her six daughters—only one of these daughters, and she the youngest, ever went from home to school. Whether at Edge Hill or in Washington, or in the constant coming and going of guests at Monticello, the education went on uninterruptedly. The cultivated father and mother raised around their family an atmosphere of mental activity, which inspired each one to improve "the shining hours." Books did not engross the household, although the dome room was fitted up as a study and school room; the hall was often called in requisition for the dance. Mrs. Randolph's household duties were shared by her daughters, each taking her turn to carry the keys. Needles were not allowed to remain idle, and each did her own work, even to making dresses. And there were no bolder horsewomen in the country than were these five sisters of Monticello. Nor did their education ever cease. Exiled from the home at Monticello, in society in Washington, Boston or Paris; in the burning heats of Cuba, or following a husband's fortunes to China, still the education went on. Such unceasing perseverance resulting in more varied attainment than is often met with. Mrs. N. P. Trist (the fourth daughter) congratulated herself at the age of eighty that she could at last read Don Quixote in the original, a feat rarely attempted even by a Spaniard. Nor was this influence confined to the daughters. The oldest son's (Col. Thos. Jefferson Randolph) only educational advantages (beyond those of the home circle) consisted in what he acquired at an "old field school," one year under the highly educated but eccentric Englishman, Ogilvie, in Milton, and a six months' course of anatomical lectures in Philadelphia. Yet dying at eighty-three, he left few men behind him with the same amount of general knowledge. Dr. Benjamin Franklin Randolph, another brother, who successfully practiced medicine in this county for fifty years, showed this thirst for knowledge. His varied reading made him a constant referee in mooted points. The youngest son, Gen. George Wythe Randolph, entered the United States Navy at thirteen; this to most boys would have meant the close of his education. With only two years at the University of Virginia, one of which was devoted to the study of his profession, he never flagged in his efforts for scholastic attainment; he died at fifty-one a learned lawyer and a ripening scholar, attributing his success in life to the love for books acquired at his mother's knee. No one can adequately appreciate the value of this home culture, save those who have themselves been teachers. The weary hopelessness of arousing a mind allowed to lie dormant! To cultivate ground, which has never known plow, or even rain or dew, is an easy task compared with this. And in view of the much that can be done, and all that is so often left undone, we would urge the young mothers of the present day to earnest work at self-culture. Let them not weary themselves over sewing machines, and lay more stress on the adornment of the minds than the bodies of their children; so may they live in the memory of a grateful country, and after ages rise up and call them blessed. Mrs. E. C. Harrison.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Physical Albemarle. Topography. ALBEMARLE COUNTY lies close to the geographical centre of the State of Virginia, and is the fifth largest county in it, having an area of 755 square miles. It lies mainly in the noted Piedmont region of the State, a region famous for the fertility of its soils, the abundance and excellence of its waters, the beauty of its scenery, the salubrity of its climate, and the intelligence and hospitality of its citizens. The western portion of the county lies in the Blue Ridge and the eastern in Midland Virginias. These three regions are natural divisions, marked as well by decided differences in the character of the soils as by natural boundaries. The average elevation of Midland Albemarle above tide is about 300 feet; it is a rolling plain with some hills rising to 500 feet. In the Southwest Mountains which constitute the natural boundary between Midland and Piedmont Albemarle, there are some peaks as high as 1800 feet above tide. Piedmont Albemarle is about 400 feet in the eastern part, rising to 1000 in the western where it merges into the Blue Ridge, which at Jarman's Gap rises to the height of 3161 feet above tide. Between the Southwest and Blue Ridge Mountains, there is a chain known as the Ragged Mountains with a few peaks 2000 feet above tide. The James River flows along the southeastern boundary of the county and receives Rockfish, Hardware and Rivanna rivers, which with their tributaries Mechum's, Moorman's and Lynch rivers and Doyles', Buck Mountain and Buck Island creeks, rising in the western part of the county, flow towards the southeast, draining the county thoroughly. These small streams are always well-filled with good water, derived from the large and numerous perennial springs dispersed everywhere throughout the county, and falling rapidly in their courses, furnish at many points excellent motive power for various forms of machinery. Only a small portion, however, of this natural power is now used in these days of steam. There is much diversity in the nature of the soils of the county, in consequence of the great variability in the rocks from whose decomposition the soils are derived. In Midland Albemarle they are most commonly of a grayish color, and being derived principally from slates are light, but quite fertile under good cultivation. Along the eastern and western borders of the Southwest and Greene Mountains, the soils are of a deep red color, owing to the presence of large amounts of Titanium oxide and the occurrence of minerals of the Hornblende and Epidote groups in the rocks from whose decomposition the soils are derived. These soils are very fertile, but are heavy when wet, do not retain moisture, and are, therefore, apt to suffer during a protracted drought. East of this belt, and south of the Hardware river, the rocks are of the Mesozoic age principally, and the soils are mainly chocolate colored. These are of the best, perhaps, in the county. In Blue Ridge and Piedmont Albemarle we find alternating grey and red soils. The red soils which usually are derived from the decomposition of epidotic and hornblendic rocks, and those of the grey soils derived from feldspathic rocks, are notably fertile. Alluvial bottoms are as common as the creeks and rivers; are of good depth, easily worked, seldom overflowed at seasons when growing crops could be seriously injured, and are very productive for small outlays of labor. Between Moorman's and Doyle's rivers, in the Whitehall district, the underlying Archæan rocks have been largely covered with the detritus of these streams, brought from the Blue Ridge. The detritus consists of much fine material, in which are imbedded rocks and bowlders showing the action of running water. These soils are very productive, and this is one of the finest localities in the county. Fertile as the soils of Albemarle naturally are, many of them have suffered from insufficient working, due, no doubt, to the changed conditions of labor and to the large areas which have been, until recently, worked by individual land-holders. The farms are now being subdivided, resulting in their improved working, and in yielding a correspondingly larger return for the labor expended. W. H. Seamon. Climate. ALBEMARLE lies far enough to the south, and is sufficiently well-protected from cold northwest winds by the Blue Ridge Mountains to possess a mild winter climate, while in the summer its elevation and proximity to the mountains temper the sun's heat so that it enjoys quite a reputation as an agreeable summer retreat. In winter there are but few cold spells, not long or intense enough to cause any suffering in the lowliest cabins, but enough to furnish sufficient ice for summer's needs. It is not unusual to play, with comfort, such outdoor games as croquet up to and beyond the middle of December, and the writer well remembers having seen the dandelion in full bloom, in the fields about the University of Virginia, during the Christmas holidays. Albemarle has always been exempted from the ravages of the terrible cyclones and tornadoes that have done so much damage in other parts of our country. The county enjoys a mean annual temperature of 55°, the minimum of winter seldom falling lower than + 10. The mean temperature of the months of June, July and August is about 72° F., and of December, January and February about 35.8°. The annual rain fall averages 45 inches, and is well distributed throughout the year. The following table, compiled from the meteorological observations of James Wearmouth, Esq., made at the University of Virginia, shows the two extremes, giving, perhaps, the best possible idea of the nature of the climate: 1886. 1887.

H. Seamon. Geology. FOWEVER interesting the details of the geological structure of this county may be to the scientific person, the scope of this publication only permits a general description of the formations recognized. There are but two ages certainly represented—the Archæan and Mesozoic. Some sandstone west of the Southwest Mountains is so much like the Potsdam sandstone, found west of the Blue Ridge in adjoining counties, that it is not improbable that it belongs to that epoch. Of the two formations certainly represented the Archæan is the most extensive; the Mesozoic being confined to an area roughly bounded, on the west by an irregular line beginning at Howardsville, extending north-easterly, and gradually diverging from the eastern foot of the Greene Mountains to Hardware river, which it crosses at the plantations of Messrs. Moon and Barksdale, quickly retreats towards the south, by a very roughly defined line to near the north-western part of the town of Scottsville, from thence south-westerly to the James. Its western border is marked by a very coarse conglomerate, which most likely rests upon the underlying Archæan rocks throughout the Mesozoic area, for it comes to the surface at many different points throughout this region. This conglomerate is very properly called a "bowlder conglomerate," being made up of fragments of the common Blue Ridge rocks, large rounded, or angular, such as epidote and hornblende schists', green quartzites and fragments of the Potsdam sandstone. It is extremely hard and difficulty is experienced in attempting to secure specimens, even with a sledge hammer. Besides this conglomerate there is a finer-grained one in which are white particles of quartz, feldspar or calcite embedded in a brown matrix. A brown sandstone of varying degrees of induration and texture is also found; in some localities it possessess a texture and appearance that make it valuable for building purposes. At several points, within this Mesozoic area, Diorite of igneous origin lifts itself to the surface, always at the axis of the anticlinal folds. Near Glendower Mills there is a ledge of slates, variegated in color, but not cleaving well enough to be valuable. A mile west of Glendower, on the Porter's Precinct road, an impure limestone is found. The strike of the Mesozoic is about N. 25° E., varying but little locally, the dip is most commonly towards the south-east, and amounts to about 25°. No fossils have been reported from this formation. At the period when the James was breaking its way through the Blue Ridge, the locality now occupied by this Mesozoic area, was most evidently a bay, into which the river carried and deposited the debris, produced by erosion, coarse at first, afterwards becoming finer, and these, by consolidation and induration, were converted into the conglomerates and sandstones of the formation. The remainder of the rocks of the country belong to the Archæan. Two periods being recognized — the Laurentian and Huronian. There being no uncomformability nor fossils in the strata, the division is based entirely upon the differences in the rocks. The granitic rocks and gneisses, diorite (bedded) and mica schists are considered as Laurentian, while the slates and other schists are most usually considered to be Huronian. The strata of this age have been frequently and so closely flexed, and their tops so much eroded as to render it almost impossible to accurately determine their connection and relative superposition. The strike of these rocks is about W. 32° E., varying locally to a slight amount. The dip is always towards the S. E., except along an east and west section passing through Dudley's Mountain, where there is an anticlinal fold in the Mica schist. The Blue Ridge is mainly made up of a series of metamorphic schists, greenish, blue and black in color. Concretions of epidote and other minerals are frequently found in the schists, giving them a curious mottled appearance. The Ragged Mountains is composed of a species of granulite, the quartz possessing a waxy lustre and bluish color, due to being filled with microscopic crystals of Titanium oxide. This rock varies much in composition, weathers unequally, and hence gives to the mountains the appearance which justifies their name. The range east of the Virginia Midland railway, in which are Dudley's, Appleberry, and Lead Mine Mountains is made up of mica schist and some bedded Diorite. The Southwest Mountains are are made up of metamorphic schists, like the Blue Ridge, and some granitic rocks and quartzites. The Greene Mountains, towards their southern part, become very slaty, and in some localities the slates are so highly impregnated with iron oxide as to appear to be fairly good micaceous hematite. East of these mountains there is a succession of slates, sometimes hydro-micaceous in character and usually soft. In the debris of Moorman's river, which rises in the Blue Ridge, Potsdam bowlders are so frequently met with as to lead to the belief that Potsdam S. S. is to be found in situ, on the eastern slopes of the Blue Ridge; and in Black Rock gap, in which a tributary of Moorman's river rises, there are found, near the summit, masses of Potsdam embedded in the soil as if they occupied their original place. These masses are usually detached from each other, their strike and dip being different for each mass, points to the belief that they have been moved down the mountain from their original position. Their position may be accounted for by the following facts: The Potsdam formation lies upon the western slope of the Blue Ridge, forming a range of mountains which are usually of a lower height than the crest of the Blue Ridge. But, north-west of Black Rock Gap, in Rockingham county, there is a peak, surmounted by the Potsdam sandstone, higher than the crest of the Blue Ridge at the Gap; this peak is connected with the crest by a long slope, and it would be only a matter of time for the Potsdam sandstones, propelled by action of frost, &amp;c., to work their way down and over the crest to the eastern slope of the Blue Ridge. W. H. Seamon. Minerals. ALBEMARLE county possesses deposits of iron ore, slate, soapstone and building stones, which have been and some are now, worked with profit. Besides these, there are deposits of graphite, zinc, and clay, which may develop in the future and become valuable. In addition to these minerals of industrial importance there are found specimens of galenite, gold, quartz of different varieties, including the amethyst, orthoclase, albite, oligoclase, muscovite, biotite, amphibole, asbestos, epidote, chlorite, serpentine, pyrolusite, psilomelane, rutile, pyrite, chalcopyrite, azurite, göthite pseudomorphic after pyrite and others. Iron Ore.—Specimens of red and brown hæmatites and magnetites are found abundantly at many localities, but have been worked at only three localities. The largest known deposit is near Stony Point, not far from the Virginia Midland railroad, at about ten miles north of Charlottesville. A track runs from the Virginia Midland railroad up to the mine, though it is not worked now. The ore is a brown hematite with some specular. Averages of numerous analyses, give— Metalic Iron 55.00 per cent. Silica 5.00 per cent. Phosphorus 0.16 per cent. Sulphur trace. Six shafts have been put down varying in depth from 50 to 180 feet. The width of the vein varies from 4 to 6 feet, and it has been traced by shafts for a distance of a half a mile. Ore of the magnetic variety was taken from Cook's Mountain, near North Garden, several years ago and shipped to the North. This, and a deposit one mile south of Covesville, belonged to and were operated by a Pennsylvania company, which ceased its operations several years ago for unknown reasons. The Covesville deposit is larger, perhaps, than the North Garden, but is injured somewhat by the Titanium oxide which it contains. Specular ore is frequently met with along the James River, between Scottsville and Howardsville, and at some localities, as at Mrs. Scruggs, it appears to be in large quantity. Mr. George W. Clarke, a gentleman who takes great interest in the development of this county, had samples of this ore analyzed abroad, and the great metallurgist, Prof. Siemens, in speaking of it, pronounced it as quite valuable for conversion into steel by the direct process. Analysis of this ore gives— Peroxide of Iron 91.10. Protoxide of Iron 1.10. Phosphoric Acid 0.03. Sulphuric Acid 0.07. Siliceous Matter 7.20. Water 0.50. Total 100.00. Metallic Iron 64.63. Slate.—Slaty rocks are abundant in Albemarle, and in the neighborhood of Slate Hill church, which is about 7 miles south-east of Charlottesville, a deposit of this valuable material has long been worked. The Albemarle Slate Company has operated the deposit very successfully for a number of years, and now employ 75 persons in the manufacture of slate pencils; their sole product at present. There is a vein of slate so soft and free from grit as to make the finest quality of slate pencils known in the trade. Adjacent to this property lies that of L. W. and A. D. Cox, which is larger and contains a greater variety of valuable slate than the other. It is not operated at this writing but will be before the end of the year. At both these deposits valuable slate for manufacture into mantels, window caps, sills, coffins, &amp;c., is also found, and both companies are arranging to manufacture these goods. Building-Stones.—The brownstones of the southern part of the county have never been utilized, although in some places their quality is such as to indicate valuable properties. A greyish sandstone occurs west of the Southwest Mountains. It has been quarried at several points near Charlottesville, and used in the construction of the Brookes Museum and Chapel of the University of Virginia. From the results of the practical tests thus made, there can be no doubt as to the value of these deposits. A soft, bluish, black schist has been worked near the gasworks of the city of Charlottesville, being used for paving, curbing and building purposes. Though so soft as to be easily sawed, it proves quite durable on exposure. Soapstone.—A valuable deposit of this material is worked near Hardware P. O., about 4½ miles from North Garden station, of the Virginia Midland Railroad. The quarries here were first opened in 1883, and in spite of a destructive fire, and other impediments, the company has overcome all obstacles and is now doing a large and profitable business. Sixty to seventy-five men are kept constantly employed in the quarries and in preparing the rough goods for shipment to New York, where they are finished and placed upon the market. It has no superior for fireplaces, register borders, laundry tubs, sinks and bath-room fixtures, it being non-porous, acid and fireproof; and as it is a large absorbent of heat and a slow radiator of it, it is much used for heaters and radiators in the public and private buildings of the East. Graphite.—A belt of slate passes through Charlottesville in a northeasterly direction, which contains considerable graphite, or black lead, and at Hardware P. O. there is so much of it in the slate as to give it a probable value for the manufacture of crucibles. Graphite of good quality is found in the northwestern part of the county, at Shifflet's Hollow and at Mr. Naylor's, about one half mile north of Wesley Chapel on the Nortonsville road. These deposits have not been developed enough to form any definite idea as to their value. The mineral occurs as a vein in a decomposing feldspathic rock. It is found amorphous and also in crystallized aggregates composed of long, narrow prisms, apparently of a monoclinic habit. Analysis of the two varieties of the Naylor Graphite show— Crystals. Amorphous. Carbon 90.799 74.645 Ash 6.555 19.195 Moisture 2.646 6.160 100.000 100.000 The large amount of ash shown by the amorphous variety was due to some mechanically adherent mineral silicates. Clay.—Clay for the manufacture of building brick is quite plentiful and of good quality. No china or firebrick clays are worked. Near the Tilt Hammer road in Turk's Gap, and near Christ church in the Scottsville district, there are deposits of fine clay worthy of examination, for the manufacture of queensware. Zinc.—On the eastern slope of what is known as Lead Mine Mountain, there exists a vein of mineral which, during the war, was operated by the Confederates for lead. The shafts which were opened then, and the buildings which sheltered the operatives, have all fallen in, and it is only with some trouble that specimens of the ore can now be secured. Zinc blende is more abundant than the Galena, and the reputation of the deposit has no doubt been injured by calling it a lead mine, for there is but little lead there. In 1883 the writer collected an average sample from the "dump" and submitted it to analysis, with these results: Pts. in 100. Zinc Sulphide 48.22 per cent. Lead Sulphide 4.65 per cent. Calcium Fluoride 17.75 per cent. Iron Sulphide 2.92 per cent. Insoluble Silicious Matter 25.24 per cent. Silver (two-thirds ozs. to ton). Copper and Arsenic traces. 98.78 There is good reason to believe that this, and other undeveloped mineral resources of Albemarle, may one day become as valuable as other deposits more favorably situated. Limestone.—At Buckeyeland creek, on the property of Mr. Frank Glimer, and elsewhere in the same locality, there is an impure limestone, which has furnished agricultural lime on burning; containing, as it does, from 70 to 80 per cent. of calcium carbonate. It is surprising that the farmers of that neighborhood do not take advantage of the opportunity to improve their farms by use of this most valuable fertilizer. Mineral Springs.—The mineral springs of the county are chiefly of a chalybeate character. That of Fry's Spring, about one mile from Charlottesville and the University of Virginia, amongst many others, enjoys a considerable local reputation; an analysis, by R. D. Bohannon, made in the Laboratory of of the University of Virginia, under supervision of Prof. Dunnington, shows it to be an excellent water of its class. One imperial gallon contains— Carbonate of Iron 1.010 grains. Sulphate of Lime .490 grains. Sulphate of Soda .640 grains. Chloride of Sodium .260 grains. Chloride of Potassium .030 grains. Silica 1.320 grains. 3.840 grains. W. H. Seamon. Forestry. ALTHOUGH Albemarle can in no sense be considered as a lumber producing county, there is still standing in its forests a considerable quantity of white oak and yellow pine, and other varieties of less value, of such size as to furnish enough lumber for building purposes. Good pine is sold at from $8 to $12 per 1,000 square feet and other varieties proportional to their relative values. Besides the larger growths, there is a much larger quantity of second growth timber now large enough for fencing and fire-wood, and, if not improperly managed, there is sufficient to supply the lumber necessary for the growth of the county, and for all demands of the farm. Tan bark is being taken from the forests in great rapidity, particularly in the Blue Ridge region, where, at the present rate of cutting, the supply must soon be exhausted. It is a great pity that of the vast amount of lumber cut down for this purpose, only the bark is used, and the growth of centuries is ruthlessly cut and permitted to rot, inflicting needless injury to the future citizens of the county. The time is not far distant when the people will have to rise and prevent further desecration of this favored county, and require new trees to be set out where one has been cut down. According to the Census Reports of 1880, 158,985 acres of the 424,424 of the county's area are covered with timber. This estimate is about correct for the present year, to which should be added 21,000 acres of old fields, now occupied with scrub pines and oaks of from 10 to 15 years growth. The Umbrella tree, Magnolia Umbrella, is very common along the cool branks of streams in the Piedmont district. Its light and soft wood makes excellent pumps. The White Wood, or as it is most commonly called in Albemarle, the Poplar, Liriodendron Tulipifera, attains perfect growth, and is everywhere met with, furnishing excellent lumber. The inner bark of its branches and roots possess medicinal properties of value in intermittent fever. Astmina Triloba, the Papaw or Custard Apple, is found along the banks of streams, but is nowhere abundant. Tilia Americana, the Linden tree, is rarely met with away from the cool hollows in the Blue Ridge, near Moorman's river, where it attains its full size. Besides being a beautiful tree well adapted for ornamental planting, its lumber is highly prized for cabinet work. When reduced to pulp it is valuable in the manufacture of paper. In Europe, an infusion of the flowers, buds and leaves of the various species of Linden is much used as a remedy for indigestion and nervous disorders. Ilex Opaca, the Holly tree, is occasionally found in the forests, always alone. They having evidently sprung from the seeds dropped in the passage of migratory birds. The Sugar Maple, Acer Saccharinum, is like the Holly only occasionally met with in the natural state. But the Red Maple, Acer Rubrum, is common, though not abundant in any locality, as it is so widely distributed it would appear that it is an excellent tree to cultivate for lumber, being much valued in cabinet work. The Box-Elder or Ash-leaved Maple, Negundo Aceroides, grows along the streams in the eastern part of the county. It is readily recognized by its peculiar ash-like leaves. Its timber is soft and well adapted for the manufacture of paper pulp. Its sap contains a small amount of saccharine matter, and yields, on evaporation, a small amount of maple sugar. Rhus Typhina, the Stag-Horn Sumach, attains the height of 12 feet and a diameter of 2 to 3 inches along the roadsides. Large quantities of its leaves are gathered and shipped for the tanner's use. Rhus Venenata, called the Poison Elder, is found in the wet parts of the county occasionally. It is exceedingly noxious when brought in contact with the human body. Robinia Pseudacaia, or Common Locust, is common, grows vigorously and attains maturity when left to itself. No attempt is made to utilize its valued timber. The Honey Locust, Gleditschia Triacanthos, is found occasionally in the woods in the eastern part of the county. In other portions of the county it is more frequently met with along the roadsides, where it has escaped cultivation. It is said that good beer can be made from its fruit. The Red Bud or Judas tree, Cercis Canadensis, from its oriental namesake from whose limbs Judas is said to have hung himself, is widely distributed through the forests and frequently attains a diameter of 18 inches. Its wood is not only beautiful in color and susceptible of a high polish, but shows a beautiful wavy grain, giving it, when polished, the appearance of a piece of watered silk. It is worthy of being made into veneers for the manufacture of furniture. Prunus Americanus, the wild plum, is not a stranger to the lover of nature, and attains in a few instances at least the remarkable diameter of 24 inches. Prunus Pennsylvanica, the wild red cherry, is occasionally met with; its timber, though sometimes used, is much inferior to that of Prunus Serotina, the wild black cherry, which is common. Spirea Opulifolia, the nine bark, is a shrub attaining the height of ten feet, easily recognized from the peculiar manner in which the layers of its bark separate. Pyrus Augustifolia, the Southern Crab apple, is sometimes met with. Its sour fruit is not utilized, no doubt from the rareness of its occurrence. Cratœgus Coccinea, the Scarlet Fruited Thorn, is found along the eastern slopes of the Blue Ridge. The June berry, or as it is more commonly called in this locality, Wild Currant, Amelanchier Canadensis, is found everywhere. Its beautiful white flowers appearing before the leaves in early spring gives to the woods a fresh appearance that is most pleasing to the eye. Its hard and dense heartwood furnishes excellent blocks for the tanner. The Witch Hazel, Hamamelis Virginica, is found in the mountain hollows. Liquid Ambarstyraciflua, the Sweet Gum, is found between Hardware river and Buckeyeland creek. The wood of this tree when seasoned is exceedingly well adapted for cabinet work, being equal in beauty to walnut. Cornus Alternifolia, the Swamp Dogwood, is found along the Rivanna river, while the Flowering Dogwood, C. Florida, is known everywhere in early spring by the four white conspicuous leaves of its involucre. The wood of the latter is well adapted for turning. When cut in early spring there exudes a yellowish-red colored sap resembling blood to a slight extent. The Tree of Heaven, Ailanthus Glandulosa, has escaped from cultivation, and is in some localities very common. It is a rapid grower, and as its timber is very durable and possesses much strength, it should be encouraged. Nyssa Sylvatica, the Sour or Black Gum, is common, adding great beauty by its scarlet leaves to the forests in the fall. Its timber is very compact. Viburnum Prunifolium, the Black Haw, with its white cymes, lends beauty and fragrance to our woods. The Laurel or Ivy, Kalmia Latifolia, is common in Piedmont and Blue Ridge Albemarle. Its close grained wood is susceptible of a high polish and much prized for turning work. Rhododendron Catawbiense, the Rose Bay, is found only near Col. Duke's farm in Sugar Hollow. Diospyros Virginiana, the Persimmon, is common. The timber of this tree is valuable for shoe lasts and spools, and would make excellent axletrees. Fraxinus Americana, the White Ash, is not abundant now in the county, though it is well adapted to the soil and climate, as shown by a few magnificent specimens of this beautiful forest tree. The Fringe Tree, or Old Man's Beard, Chionanthus Virginica, is easily found in June along our streams, and may be recognized by its fringed white flowers. The Catalpa tree, Catalpa Bignonioides, is frequently found in the natural state, having in most cases escaped from cultivation. Its timber is of value for fence posts and rails. Sassafras Officinale, the common Sassafras, is very abundant along fences and in old fields. The oil obtained from its roots is valuable, and its manufacture is worthy of some attention in this county. It is not an unhandsome wood, polishes well, and as it does not permit vermin to harbor near it, it possesses properties well fitting it for chamber furniture. Ulmus Fulva, the Red or Slippery Elm, and Ulmus Americana, the American, or Water Elm, are found along the streams, Ulmus Alata, the Winged Elm, is met with in the swampy portions of the eastern part of the county. The Sugar Berry, Celtis Occidentallis, occurs along Moorman's river, and elsewhere. The wood of the Red Mulberry, Morus Rubra, is worthy of attention, for veneers, it having a very fine satiny grain susceptible of very high polish. Platanus Occidentallis, the Sycamore or Button-Ball tree, is found everywhere, though no effort is made to utilize its lumber, which makes splendid tobacco boxes. The White and Black Walnuts, Juglans Cinerea and Nigra, are found in the rich soil along the small streams. Very few trees are now standing large enough for timber. As the Black Walnut grows so well in this county, it is one of the best for planting, and as they attain in 20 to 25 years development sufficient for timber, their planting could be made a source of large revenue. Carya Alba, the Shell Bark Hickory, is found only along the Blue Ridge, and there of large size only in the remote hollows. Carya Micro Carpa, the White or Small Fruited Hickory, is quite common in Piedmont, where its closely appressed bark distinguishes it readily from the Shell Bark. Carya Tomentosa, the Red or Mocker Nut Hickory, is the most common member of the genus Carya. Attaining large size, its timber is valuable for many purposes. Carya Porcina and Carya Amara, the Pig Nut and Bitter Nut Hickories, are occasionally seen. The Oaks are well represented by the following species: Quercus Alba, White Oak; Q. Obtusiloba, Post Oak; Q. Bicolor, Swamp White Oak; Q. Prinus, Chestnut Oak; Q. Prinoides, Yellow Oak; Q. Rubra, Red Oak; Q. Coccinea, Scarlet Oak; Q. Tinctoria, Black Oak; Q. Nigra, Black Jack Oak; Q. Falcata, Spanish Oak; Q. Palustris, Pin Oak; Q. Phellos, Willow Oak, and Q. Ilicifolia, the Bear Oak. Of the above varieties the most common are the Black, Scarlet, Post, Chestnut and White Oaks. Q. Princides is but rarely met with, but always of the size of a tree. The Chestnut Oak is being rapidly used by the "tan bark" gatherers. It is a great pity that these, the noblest of our trees, are most sacrificed by our citizens. Castanæ Pumila, the Chinquapin, is very abundant as a shrub, and occasionally met with as a small tree. Castanæ Vulgaris, var Americana, the Chestnut tree is extremely abundant. The fruit is gathered and sold to shippers. Its wood attains perfect development, and for fence timber it has no superior. Fagus Ferruginea, the Beech, with its umbrageous shade, is found in the Piedmont district. Carpinus Caroliniana, the Water Beech, and Ostrya Virginica, the Iron Wood, are found along most of the mountain streams. Betula Lenta, the Cherry Birch, is common in the Ragged Mountains, and found elsewhere in the county. It is better known locally as Mountain Mahogany. Betula Nigra, the Red Birch, is frequently met with along the streams east of the Southwest and Green Mountains. Alnus Serrulata, the Black Alder, is known along every stream where, as a shrub, it forms dense thickets. The Black Willow, Salix Nigra; White Willow, S. Alba, and Silky Willow, S. Sericea, are also very common along our streams. Populus Tremuloides, the American Aspen, or Silver Maple, as it is frequently improperly called, is found occasionally along the Rivanna river and near the Nelson county line. Amongst the Pines, Pinus Pungens, the Table Mountain Pine, is one of the most interesting. Pinus Strobus, the White Pine, is found most commonly in the hollows of the Blue Ridge, where the saw-mill men are closely following, so that it will soon be very rare. Pinus Rigida, the Pitch Pine, with its rough and dark bark, is most commonly known as an Old Field Pine. Its resinous wood is of little value. Pinus Inops, the Jersey Scrub, is also well known. The Yellow Pine, Pinus Mitis, once very common, is disappearing beneath the devouring teeth of the circular saw. Pinus Toleda, the Loblolly, is found occasionally in the eastern part of the county. Tsuga Canadensis, the Hemlock, attains a diameter of three feet along the head waters of Moorman's river. Thuya Occidentalis, the White Cedar or Arbor Vitæ, is only found as a very small shrub, but the Red Cedar, Juniperus Virginiana, occurs abundantly enough to be shipped north for the lead pencil manufacturers. W. H. Seamon Agriculture. IN SOIL, climate and accessibility to market, Albemarle county possesses advantages unsurpassed by any other county in our State. Intersected as it is by two great lines of railway, with still another on its southern border, connecting it with tide water in one direction and giving us easy and rapid communication with the great markets of the country; its great advantages in that respect are only equalled by the general adaptability of its soil to that diversified agriculture which brings the surest and best rewards to the cultivator of the soil. All of the cereals, with the exception, perhaps, of barley, and all of the grasses common to the temperate zone, flourish well. There are no better wheat and corn lands than can be found in Albemarle. Extending as it does, from the apex of the Blue Ridge to the lowlands bordering on the James River, almost every character and quality of soil can be found, from the sandy lands and rich alluvium of the rivers to the rock-made, inexhaustible red lands which characterize so large a section of Piedmont Virginia. It is capable of producing abundant milk, corn and wine; and with such capability would, in all ages, be regarded as a most promising section of country. No section of country possesses greater natural advantages for the varied productions which the necessities and comfort of our race demand. That king of all the cereals—wheat, can be successfully produced. Corn—the farmers mainstay—thrives everywhere, in the hands of the skillful cultivators; and while the yield of oats may rarely equal the products of more northern and humid climates, yet as fine fields of that grain are harvested in Albemarle as anywhere in the Middle States. Large sections of our county are eminently adapted to grazing, and the cultivated grasses always flourish, on large areas, under the care of the intelligent farmer. As tobacco planting yields in importance, as a staple crop, and grasses are cultivated in connection with cereals, it will be found that our red lands will be rapidly improved. The present writer has seen in Albemarle county as heavy yields of hay as the most favored lands in the best dairy sections of New York can produce. Stock-raising and dairying is successfully pursued here, and it can be indefinitely expanded. Fruit-growing is now an important interest, and is yearly attracting the attention of wide-awake farmers who begin to realize that diversified production is safer than a reliance on one staple crop. Our orchards have long been celebrated for the excellence of their fruit; and our vineyards, now covering hundreds of acres, not only supply hundreds of tons of table fruit for the markets of the country, but supply two prosperous wine-cellars with the fruit from which the famous Virginia Claret wines are made. All in all, there is believed to be no more favored section of our country for the production of all the fruits common to the temperate zone, and its accessibility to all the most important markets adds greatly to the value of this locality for this important branch of agriculture. J. W. Porter. Stock-Raising and Feeding. IT IS not claimed that Albemarle is a cattle county par excellence, but stock-raising and feeding has a prominent place in the general farming practiced by the best managers. The advantages for this business are the same as those specified for dairying, except that it possesses two additional: 1st. The prevalence of garlic or wild onion, a disadvantage to the dairyman, is, from its very early and rapid growth and nutritious qualities, a blessing to the cattle and sheep raiser; awakening from its dormant state, begun the previous July, as soon as the frost is out of the ground, it brings into vigorous action the material for rapid plant growth stored in its ripened bulb, and in fields where it is thickly set, gives a carpet of green in February, and though it may be killed to the ground by a subsequent freeze, persists in its rapid growth on every warm day, and gives cattle a good bite in March. Many a farmer who failed to secure a sufficiency of provender in the fall, has been indebted to the wild onion for the salvation of his cattle and sheep the next spring. This rapid growth is maintained, though with decreased energy until late in May, by which time the other grasses have so far advanced that the onion may well be spared. It is true that animals taken directly to the slaughter house from an onion pasture, give meat of a bad flavor, but by keeping them twenty-four to thirty-six hours on other food, this disappears entirely. On farms where the onion abounds, the cattle are generally sent to the pasture the last of March, or early in April, thus shortening the winter feeding by several weeks, and to these farms the butchers generally go for their early fat lambs and veals. The second advantage is that on the Blue Ridge and its spurs, on the Southwest Mountains and the Ragged Mountains, there are large areas of very cheap mountain land, which, as soon as the trees are deadened and undergrowth killed, turf over with the rich blue grasses and white clover, and from the coolness and absence of flies, resulting from elevation, make the best of summer ranges. These mountains are so interspersed through the county that most farmers, who make cattle-raising and feeding a prominent part of their system, own a mountain pasture, easily accessible from their farms. On these the young stock spend the summer, while the farms, relieved of the burden of pasturing them, are enabled to produce the larger crops of hay, corn and other produce. There has been established at Charlottesville by Messrs. Burnley, Smith &amp; Burnley, a monthly cattle sale, where graziers dispose of their feeding animals and stock up with young cattle, and farmers buy such as they want for stall feeding and sell their fat beeves. These sales are well attended by buyers and sellers, and a considerable number of horses, cattle and sheep are bought and sold each month either at auction or by private sale, greatly to the convenience and advantage of those who raise or fatten cattle in the county. There are several fine herds of thoroughbred cattle in the county, one owned by W. J. Ficklin, who is the son and successor of the late S. W. Ficklin, whose reputation as a breeder of fine horses and cattle was second to none in the State; another of Shorthorn is owned by Warner Wood, Esq., whose farm is near the University of Virginia. This gentleman recently sold the largest and heaviest pair of steers ever raised in the State. They were grade Shorthorn, bred and fed on Mr. Wood's farm, near the University. At three years old the pair weighed 8,000 pounds (I think) and when sold a few months ago weighed 8,300 pounds (I believe). It is said they were purchased for the purpose of being exhibited for pay, to the people of other sections, as curiosities in the mammoth cattle line. Major R. F. Mason, whose farm is near Charlottesville, has some fine Holsteins. There are numerous other high-bred animals of different breeds scattered through the county, and owned by various farmers. Owing to the early introduction of the Shorthorns by the late S. W. Ficklin, and his active exertions in disseminating them through the county, the cattle are for the most part good grade animals and well adapted for feeding into first-class beeves, and it is a growing practice for farmers to feed a lot every winter on ensilage, hay and grain, stalling them at night in cheaply constructed stables, where they are well littered and the manure carefully saved. This practice gives a home market for much of the produce of the farm, and the manure with which to improve it at the same time; and is found to pay well in the long run. The increased value of the animal, after four months of judicious feeding, will generally pay $20 per ton for the corn consumed, $10 to $12 per ton for the hay, and $3 to $3.50 per ton for the ensilage, leaving the manure to pay for the labor of feeding and use of the stable, &amp;c. If the buildings are well arranged this labor is very light, as the cattle are allowed to run, in the day, on a sod field, where they have access, usually, to spring water, and can pick over coarse forage, straw, &amp;c. Cattle, suitable for feeding, cost, in the fall of 1887, 2½ to 3 cents per pound, live weight, and sold in the spring of 1888, when fat, at 4 to 4½ cents per pound here. A good average gain on 1,000 pound steers, from four months winter feeding, is 200 pounds; thus a good 1,000 pound steer cost in November, thin, about $30; in the following March, if well handled and sold, he brought from $48 to $54. The practice of putting up ensilage for winter feeding is becoming very common, and engines and cutters can easily be hired by those who do not care to incur the expense of buying the machinery for filling their pits. The Revenue Commissioner's books show that 10,344 head of cattle were listed for taxation in 1887; adding a fourth for cattle not found by the Commissioner, and for young cattle and beeves, and we have 12,900 head as about the true number of cattle kept in the county. These are worth about $260,000. There has never been a case of pleuro-pneumonia or other contagious disease in the county, and the only infectious ones that have ever troubled us have been outbreaks of Texas fever, from infected cattle being ignorantly or carelessly brought in amongst our healthy ones, this always disappeared with the first frost and never reappeared unless freshly imported. With more knowledge, and the exercise of more care in this matter, we have not had a case of this now for many years, and our cattle have been exceptionally healthy. Live stock in 1880 (U. S. Census): Horses, 5,897; Mules and Asses, 636; Oxen, 986; Milch Cows, 4,834; other cattle, 7,617; Sheep, 10,832; Swine, 20,302. H. M. Magruder. Dairying. THIS county offers great advantages for dairying, chief among which are:— 1st. Its numerous springs of pure, cold freestone water, which, with their running streams make it difficult to lay off a 30 or 40 acre field without including running water within its bounds; and afford on every farm a choice of locations for a dairy-house, where an abundance of that first requisite, pure cold water, can be had. 2nd. The great variety of nutritious grasses, either indigenous to the soil, or which can be readily produced; amongst which grow, spontaneously, the blue grasses (poa compressa and pratensis) and white clover on the hills; herd grass or red-top on the bottoms, and ceap grass and foxtail, almost everywhere; while orchard grass, red clover and timothy are easily produced, with a proper preparation, on both hills and bottoms. These very best of pasture and hay grasses do so well that our farmers have not troubled themselves to propagate the new and foreign grasses of which we read so much, and whose seeds have been so generally distributed by the United States Agricultural Department. 3rd. The rolling, undulating surface causes an almost entire absence of stagnant, impure water, or unsavory marsh grasses, which so often injuriously effect the quality of dairy products from cows running in the pastures. 4th. The comfort of the cows is greatly promoted by the plenteous shade afforded by the numerous detached trees and wood lots, which good taste, and, perhaps love of personal comfort, caused our ancestors to leave in suitable spots when clearing away the forests. 5th. The mild short winters, during which the thermometer falls to zero not more than once or twice in a decade, and in which the dairyman must be ready to fill his ice-house at the first two-inch freeze, or he runs the risk of having to do without this almost indispensable accessory during the next summer. And yet with ordinary diligence, and by selecting a suitable location for an ice-pond, our octogenarian farmers will tell you that they have never failed to secure a sufficient supply of this planter's luxury and dairyman's necessity. The mild temperature of the winters renders much less costly stables necessary than are needed in the Northern States, and the cows are generally allowed, except in very stormy weather, to run during the day in a lot where they can pick over cornstalks, &amp;c., and have access to wheat straw and plenteous spring water at its normal temperature of 55° to 60°. That this climate and mode of treatment is good for them is shown by the fact that there has been no epidemic or general disease among the cattle of Albemarle in the recollection of the oldest inhabitant. Pleuro-pneumonia and all that class of diseases are only known to us by name. 6th. Its nearness and convenience of access to good markets. The city of Charlottesville and the University of Virginia, both in the centre of the county, consume in the shape of fresh milk the product of the largest dairies which are in their vicinity. The smaller and more remote farm dairies produce butter which meets a ready sale to regular customers at these places, at prices ranging from twenty to forty cents per pound, according to season and quality; hence there is but little shipped out of the county, in spite of the exceptional facilities for so doing afforded by the numerous trains on the two great thoroughfares of travel, which bisect the county, and the railway, which skirts its entire southern border, placing the markets of Washington 4 hours distant, Baltimore 5 hours, Richmond 3 hours, Norfolk 5, Lynchburg 3, and the Virginia Springs from 3 to 5 hours distant. The prices for butter are low in all these markets in summer, but contracts for a regular supply of fresh cream are readily made at very remunerative prices. The dairies too remote from the stations to ship cream, find winter their most profitable season, as the demand is brisk for choice fresh butter at from thirty to forty cents per pound from October until June. While the abundant supply of hay and corn ensilage that can be easily and cheaply secured, make the feeding of the cows a comparatively easy matter. The product of a dairy of good common cows fresh in the fall, will average about three-fourths of a pound of butter per head per day during these eight months of good prices, if well fed in stalls, night and morning, on hay and ensilage, sprinkled with a mixture of corn meal and wheat bran. The ratio, allowing cost for the bran, and a liberal price for the corn, hay and ensilage, will be worth about seventeen cents per head per day, leaving the manure, and from five and a half to thirteen cents a day profit on each cow, besides giving a home market for the corn and provender. And most important of all, a means is thus afforded for improving the land and increasing its capacity for carrying cows, and at the same time returning a fair profit to the farmer. With cows of the butter breed, more butter could be made from the same feed and a larger profit realized. Take the Edgmont farm, of 300 acres arable land, as an example of what can be accomplished by this system, with the common native cattle. When the present owner moved on, about seven years ago, it was so run down and unproductive that only by close economy and the help of some bought forage, were five horses, two cows, ten young cattle and a few sheep, kept the first year. The owner went into dairying and beef feeding, only buying a few tons of bran, and feeding everything made on the farm except wheat, carefully saving and applying all the resulting manure. He has, from this farm, comfortably maintained his family of six, educated four children, paid a debt incurred for stock and implements, and run the farm up so that he keeps twenty cows, forty head of young cattle, sixteen or eighteen horses and colts, a few sheep, feeds fifteen or twenty beeves every winter, and still has often a surplus of grain and hay for market, because the crops of these outrun the increase of the stock and the feeding capacity of his often enlarged stables. And yet this branch of profitable farming is comparatively ignored. Except on the farms that furnish milk to Charlottesville and the University, winter dairying, as a systematic business, hardly exists; and, except in a casual way, no butter is shipped from the county where the markets are best, and a large part of the county supply is even brought from abroad. The prevalence of onion or garlic in our lands is alleged by many as the reason why they do not go into dairying. While this is a serious disadvantage, it is not in reality as great a one as it would seem. The garlic makes an early and rapid growth, which ceases about the last of May, when the button appears and the stalk becomes tough and woody, so that well-fed cows reject it. If, then, the cows are kept in a lot and fed green rye, clover, &amp;c., until June 1st, they will do nearly as well as if on pasture; while the grass will make such vigorous growth as to afford plenteous pasturage during any dry June weather, and by having its roots well covered will not be apt to receive injury from the hot suns of July and August, as is often the case when the pasture is grazed too bare and close. An ample supply of clover and rye can be secured by keeping a small lot, near the cow-lot, well manured and sowing it in alternate sections with rye; followed with clover, an acre of good rye, cutting to begin when the heads appear, should give twenty cows one good feed a day for a week or more. More skilled dairymen, more cows, and more care to secure the best butter breeds and strains, would prove a great advantage to the dairying interest of the county, as it would make coöperative butter and cheese establishments feasible, and thus by a division of labor increase productions and profits. Milk sold in 1880 to Butter and Cheese Factories, 24,305 gallons; Butter made in 1880, 222,186 pounds. H. M. Magruder. Sheep-Raising. ALBEMARLE county is finely adapted to sheep-raising. The large long-wooled breeds—Cotswolds, Leicesters and Lincolnshires—attain to fine sizes, and produce heavy fleeces upon the rich and luxuriant grasses of the Piedmont portions of the county; while the finer and medium wool breeds—Merino, Southdowns and Shropshiredowns—thrive well in those portions of the county where the grasses are less luxuriant, and crosses between the long and short-wool breeds thrive and do well in all portions of it. With proper attention, the improved breeds of sheep may be made to weigh from two hundred to two hundred and fifty pounds gross, and to yield fleeces weighing from twelve to sixteen pounds. The writer has verified the correctness of these statements, and in a few instances exceeded the above weights both in mutton and wool. The medium temperature of the climate enables the breeder to have his lambs come early in the season, and, with proper care, to save them; thus securing the advantages of early market, and, consequently, of good prices. While the medium temperature of the climate is no inconsiderable advantage, there are others that will appear to the intending settler as very important—such as pure water, fine soil, and a cultured, moral and religious citizenship. But few industries make better returns or insure larger profits, in proportion to their cost or outlay, than sheep husbandry; and one notable advantage which it possesses is, that it can be engaged in by men of limited means and small farmers, as well as by capitalists and large farmers, and presents an inviting field to both the utilitarian and the amateur. Number of sheep in the county in the year 1880, 10,832; spring clip of 1880, 42,789 pounds. John E. Massey. A Fruit-Growing County. LYING on the sunny-side of the Blue Ridge, which shelters it from the cold northwesters, and gives it a winter several degrees warmer than that of the great valley beyond the mountains, Albemarle, with, its diversified surface of hill and dale, presents every possible variety of soil and situation for fruit-growing. The foothills are the natural home of the apple and the culture of this fruit has long been a leading feature. The apple, which is acknowledged, on both sides of the Atlantic, to be the best in the world, the Albemarle Pippin, has its special home here, and will not thrive elsewhere. And even here it only reaches its highest excellence on the mountain side. Taken from the mountain side into the red lands of the valley and it becomes an inferior fruit. Not only the Pippin, but most other varieties of apples, are vastly improved by growing them on the mountain sides. The peculiar light soil on the Blue Ridge and its outlying foothills, kept constantly fertile by the decomposition of rocks furnishing potash, which is so necessary to all fruit trees, and perennially moist by numerous springs, yet thoroughly drained of stagnant moisture by the rock débris, furnishing a soil unequalled for the successful culture of the apple. These mountain sides, worthless otherwise, except for sheep pastures, are, therefore, as valuable as any lands in the county. The favorite market apple of Albemarle, except the Pippin, is the Winesap, though it never brings the price which the Pippin does, yet the almost unanimous opinion of growers is that it is the most profitable apple grown here. Flourishing in great perfection along with the pippin on the mountain side, it is not so fastidious as to its location, but will grow and bear well in all situations. Some of the finest Winesaps I have ever seen were grown on red land which had been so reduced in its surface fertility that hardly a weed or spear of grass grew in the orchard. The tree roots evidently penetrated into the virgin subsoil, which the skim plowing of a century had not touched. The possibilities of the apple culture in this Piedmont region are immense, and the profits greater for intelligent culture than in most other localities. The Albemarle Pippin commands in the orchard from $2 to $4.50 per barrel. The parties who buy these apples for export to England scour the hills of Albemarle every autumn, so that it is usually easier to buy these apples in Liverpool than in any American city. Last fall (1887) Pippins sold on the trees at $4.50 per barrel, the buyers furnishing barrels, gathering and packing them. I doubt if the orange groves of Florida present an equal source of revenue. And yet the lands on which these apples alone will grow can be had for a mere trifle of $5 to $10 per acre. A barrel of apples can be shipped from Charlottesville to Liverpool for $1.17. To the fruit-grower who does not choose to give the profit to the shipper, who buys up the apples, can ship his own fruit, usually at a large profit over the price generally paid in the orchard. Apple culture in Albemarle must prove a great source of wealth to those who pursue it in an intelligent manner. Along the base of the Blue Ridge and immediately adjoining the slopes where the Pippin thrives, there is a narrow belt of quite level land, on which the culture of the peach could be made very profitable. Nowhere, even in the famous orchards of Eastern Maryland and Delaware, have I seen finer peaches than grow in this part of the county. The level character of the land immediately at the mountain foot, and its fertile character, render it peculiarly adapted to the peach and pear. Further from the mountains, the streams flowing from this elevated plateau have cut deep, warm valleys, and the surface of the land becomes too broken for extensive peach culture, since the constant cultivation essential to the success of the peach tree must result in such washing of the steep surface as would permanently injure the land. On the level plateau at the base of the mountain this is not the case. This land, though sheltered by the mountains, is too elevated for fruit to be injured by premature blooming, and being in the midland belt of the mountains is exempt from the late spring frosts, which sometimes injure fruit in the lower valleys. An intimate acquintance with and practical experience in peach culture in the peach-growing section of Maryland leads me to say that in my opinion the plateau at the foot of the Blue Ridge in Albemarle ought to be the site of the most profitable peach orchards in the State. Those who are growing peaches in this section are doing well. Albemarle peaches go into market two to four weeks ahead of the great Maryland and Delaware orchards, and our early fruit reaches the northern cities at a time when there is little competition. The present season (1888), with the prospect of an enormous crop in Maryland and Delaware, our Albemarle peaches up to the last of July brought an average of $6 per bushel. Later than this the large canning peaches come in, and if the price of fruit at the north falls too low for shipment, they can be canned here just as profitably as in Maryland; and evaporating houses can be built and run just as cheaply here as there. With an experience of thirty years in peach culture, I had rather take my chances for profitable culture of this fruit in the locality named than in any other location with which I am acquainted. And yet these lands can be bought for less than one-fourth of the price of the peach lands of Maryland and Delaware. The cherry thrives everywhere in Albemarle and the cultivation of improved varieties is profitable. Most of those who have paid any attention to the cultivation of improved cherries have made the mistake of cultivating the light-colored varieties of Biggareau cherries, like the Elton, &amp;c., here called wax cherries. These are very fine and usually bring a high price, but are only adapted to a near-by market, since they get bruised and spotted in a few hours transit. If the dark-red and black sorts of fine size were grown the returns would be much greater. No fruit is more easily grown than the cherry. Some cherries, like the Early Richmond, can be profitably planted along fence-rows, and thus occupy land not cropped, while their roots would have the benefit of the cultivation of the adjoining lands. The bottom lands along the mountain streams are in my opinion the finest strawberry lands in America. These bottoms have a very deep soil, the deposit of many years of freshets, until now many of them are so elevated as to be seldom in danger of overflow. On these moist and fertile soils the strawberry thrives with the greatest luxuriance and beds retain their productiveness long after they would be exhausted in other soils. We have at the Miller School a bed which has yielded, the fourth year from planting, 5,000 quarts per acre, and does not seem to be run out yet. Strawberries from Albemarle would go into the Northern markets just when the Norfolk crop is getting worthless and before the Maryland and Delaware berries are ripe, and with the enormous productiveness of these bottom lands, the crop, with intelligent management, cannot fail to be profitable. The possibilities of the blackberry crop in Albemarle have hardly been dreamed of. In every mountain hollow wild blackberries of great size are very abundant, and with proper enterprise the wild crop could be made a source of considerable revenue to hundreds of poor people in gathering them. These things are better understood North of us, and in Delaware there are buyers of the wild fruit at every railroad station ready to take all that come. The cultivation of improved sorts of blackberries ought to be very profitable, since they can be grown on steep hill-sides facing the north where few other things will thrive. These large cultivated blackberries, such as Wilson's Early and Kittatinny, if nicely handled and shipped, in neat packages, will usually bring larger prices than strawberries—and the market is never glutted with them. Doubtless there are many sorts of the wild blackberries now growing among our mountains that would equal if not excel any of the sorts now cultivated if given the same attention. The stranger approaching Charlottesville by rail, will perceive that he is getting into the land of the vine. Hill-side after hill-side covered with grape vines attest the extent the culture has attained here. The great wine cellars at Charlottesville are a revelation to many strangers, who have not dreamed of the extent to which this culture has been carried here. Virginia Claret has attained a reputation, with competent judges, which places it ahead of the adulterated imported article, and the demand for it is constantly increasing. The Albemarle grapes are among the first to reach the Northern markets, and the early table grapes are sure to command remunerative prices. The prevalence of the rot, of late years, gave a temporary check to this industry, but the prospect now is that improved methods of training and the timely use of preventive applications will soon remove this trouble, and the hills of Albemarle will become more and more vineclad, and be a source of renewed profits to our people. An experience of many years in the best fruit-growing section of Maryland enables me to fairly compare the prospects of profitable fruit growing in Albemarle with that magnificent fruit garden, the Chesapeake and Delaware peninsula, and I am satisfied that for profitable market culture, Albemarle county can compete to her great advantage in growing all the fruit of the climate, with the possible exception of the pear, with any part of the peninsula. Our early peaches have the market almost to themselves, while the first of the good peaches, such as Early York, Mary's Choice and Crawford's Early will be placed in market while the Eastern Shore of Maryland peach-growers have nothing to offer but the miserable little Arnsden, Alexder's, &amp;c. The present season the Arnsden, from Albemarle, averaged $5 per bushel, while the first Arnsdens from the great Maryland orchards started the last of July at 40 cents per half bushel basket, while at the same date Crawford's Early, from Albemarle, was in shipping condition, and brought fancy prices. The opportunities for profitable peach culture here are very great, and there are many grand locations on the breezy foot-hills where the crop would be always exempt from danger from late frosts, when the crop in tidewater is wholly cut off. With the peach on the hill-tops and high table lands, the apple on the mountain sides, with grapes and raspberries and blackberries on favorable hill-sides, and strawberries on the rich bottom lands, the county of Albemarle ought to become the fruit paradise of Virginia. Her lands are good and suited to the purpose; they are now cheap, and only await the hand of enterprise to make them blossom for a rich and profitable harvest. F. W. Massey. Bees and Honey. WHAT blind Huber found out about bees, by years of patient and laborious observations and study, and much more than that, any intelligent person can now verify for himself in the course of a few weeks. In a word, every fact of importance, concerning the natural history of the bee, can be verified and studied in that short time by the aid of the invention of movable combs. By the use of honey-extractors the production of honey can be largely increased; by the use of Improved Smokers perfect control can be had of the fiercest bees, and comb foundation puts it into the bee keeper's power to keep the combs straight and beautiful, to control the multiplication of drones, and to stimulate greatly the production of comb-honey. In short, bee-keeping is now so much a science and a certainty that it seems strange that everyone who has a home, in a region productive of honey, should not engage in its production; at least so far as to secure for his own table an abundance of this—nature's own most delicious sweet. The introduction of Italian bees has also added greatly to the interest, the pleasure and the profits of bee-keeping. The writer believes he was the first person to introduce the Italian bee into Virginia. He remembers vividly the interest with which the express package containing his pure, tested twenty dollars Italian queen was received; the anxiety with which she was introduced to a black hive, whose queen had been removed; and the joy with which he looked on her first hatched golden-banded workers and beautiful drones; the interest with which, in his walks in the surrounding country, he would discover his Italian beauties around on the flowers for a distance of two or more miles from his apiary. It was amusing, too, to see the estimation held of himself by some of his neighbors, as a lunatic destined for the asylum at Staunton, because he had paid twenty dollars for a bee. And it was very satisfactory after five years to receive twenty dollars for one of his own queens from a neighbor who had made himself most conspicuous in ridiculing such folly. Then the pleasure there was in raising these golden queens, in mating them successfully with Italian drones, and in seeing their beautiful golden-banded workers, so gentle and yet so brave to defend their stores from robbers, and so much more industrious than the common bees. I never had a more fascinating recreation than bee-culture in all its details, and it is still a joy to me to take hurried snatches at it in the intervals allowed in a busy life. Other foreign varieties of bees have been introduced into this country, the Cyprian, the Egyptian, &amp;c., &amp;c., but the writer has not had sufficient experience with them to give an estimate of their value. But he is sure that the Italian is a great acquisition. Queens, too, can now be bought much more cheaply than when they were first introduced. Hives are also much cheaper and section boxes for surplus honey much more easily obtained. These sections present comb honey to the purchaser in its most attractive form. Extracted honey can be kept indefinitely and with far less trouble than comb honey. All pure honey will candy in the course of time, but it is easily restored to its original state by heating in a vessel of water to the temperature of 180°, which simply redissolves the crystals which constitute the candy. To many persons, however, bees are a terror. Yet with a pair of rubber gloves, a bee veil costing twenty-five cents, and a good smoker, the most timid may soon become emboldened. Let me show how little there is to fear. This occurred in my own apiary last winter: Seeing a swarm just beginning to come out of one of my hives, I ran to it, soon found the queen on the grass in front trying to rise, and imprisoned her in a little wire cage. Seeing my daughter standing in the door, I called to her to run to me. She came with a broad hat on, no protection for her face, and her arms bare to the elbow. "What do you want, father?" "Just hold this cage." In a short time the bees found the imprisoned queen, gathered lovingly around her, and the whole swarm settled on my daughter's hand and arm, a peck or more of them. After she had stood there with them until they all settled, and I had called out everybody near to look at the beautiful sight, I took her to a hive, made ready for them, and taking hold of her arm shook the swarm down in front, and in they all went happy in their new home, and my daughter received not a sting, though she certainly had a new sensation. Many parts of Virginia are favorable to bee-culture. White clover is perhaps our best honey plant, and most widely distributed. Red clover will grow everywhere with proper attention. South of James River "Sourwood" affords much beautiful honey, as do also many of our native trees, such as lindens and poplars. Catnip is a great honey plant and blue thistle promises to be equally good. Buckwheat often gives a supply, when most needed, at the close of the season. Piedmont Virginia is an exceptionally good honey region, especially the mountain sides. These having their flowers to mature in succession from the bottom to the summits, greatly prolong the honey season. Anywhere in this region with intelligent attention hives may easily be made to yield fifty pounds each every year, which even at ten cents a pound is a good return for the investment. Often the yield may be far greater than this. As to overstocking, inasmuch as the honey of each flower must be gathered in a few hours after its opening, it would seem could not occur till there were bees enough in a locality to visit every such flower. Half a million more people than are now engaged in beekeeping in Virginia might find delightful and profitable employment in it, if they be only willing to make their living in an honest, Scriptural way, according to the Word, which says: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread." Wm. Dinwiddie. Grape-Culture. THE VINE, like wheat, antedates historic records. The sepulchres and mummies of Egypt reveal both the fruit and the seed, and the latter have been found in the lacustrine habitations of Northern Italy. In Europe it is found growing and bearing fruit from the Tropic of Cancer to the Baltic Sea; while in North America it is found in native luxuriance, of different species, from the Gulf of Mexico to the Lakes of the North. In the Icelandic saga of Eric Raeda (Red) found in 1650 in manuscript, and the Kraelsefne saga, translated by Prof. Raffn of Copenhagen, in the beginning of this century, we find that those Icelanders made a permanent settlement in Greenland; and the sons of Eric the Red, followed up his expedition and must have reached the coast of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, near Martha's Vineyard, about the year 1000, and afterwards, when they found wild grapes in abundance, from which they named the land "Wineland" (Vinland). The knowledge of this was probably lost through the fearful pestilence which spread through Northern Europe in 1394 under the name of the Black Death, devastating entire populations. About the same time of this translation, that versatile genius, Thomas Jefferson, first attempted the regular cultivation of grapes in Albemarle county. He imported French vines and Italian Swiss vignerons, and planted quite extensively about Carter's Mountain, near his beloved Monticello. This was a failure. It is stranger that his investigating mind should not have suspected the cause of this and preceeding failures. We say preceeding, because the London Company in Virginia had made a similar attempt in 1630; William Penn had tried it in Pennsylvania, in 1633; a Swiss Geneva Colony in Kentucky, in 1790. All these were failures. Strange that this fruit, abounding in its native luxuriance here, and which, brought into Europe, from its probable original habitat, Asia, had "intertwined its tendrils with civilization and refinement in every age," should not be a success here. All these trials were made with the Vitis Vinifera of Europe. These, by ages of transplanting and abnormal culture, have probably become so enervated in root and foliage that they readily succumb to unfavorable climatic conditions, and their constitution is too weak to resist the assault of Phylloxera, a root louse, that for ten years past have laid waste millions of acres of French vineyards, reducing the yield of French wines from near one and half billion gallons in 1875 to some 700,000,000 gallons at present. From a large exporter, France is now an importer of wines for her own supplies. This too in the face of that persistent vigilance and continued efforts of the French Government, to uphold this most important of its agricultural products. As yet no remedy is found for this pest, save immersion, where practicable. Now, the planting of the Phylloxera-resisting roots of American grapes, on which are grafted the Vinifera, rests the hope of rebuilding their vanishing grape products. The same method is pursued in the new plantings of European grapes in California, where all are grafted on native roots. This Phylloxera louse abounds with our native grapes, and consequently those now in existence are those whose constitution was strong enough to survive its ravages: all others have disappeared. This pest, together with a tenderness of foliage of the "Vinifera" not adapted to the climate of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains, save in New Mexico and portions of Texas, was the cause of continuous early failure of grape culture. It was not till in the forties, that Nicholas Longworth, of Ohio, conceived the idea that this should be a wine-producing country, and to make it so, the native stock must be taken as a basis. This he encouraged most generously, searching for all favorable varieties. Developing the better, discarding the inferior. The Catawba was obtained from North Carolina, and is about the only one of that date still largely grown. A host of grapes then used have been cast aside and substituted by new varieties with better properties, either for table or cellar use. With proper cellars and vignerons he made wines in Cincinnati, Ohio, on a large scale, which subsequently resulted in grape-culture about Lake Erie, and extended throughout the country. Native Grapes.—Thus started, this new industry, with varying success, but steadily advancing, by the erection of proper cellars throughout Lake Erie region, in Ohio, Lake Cayuga, and other places in western New York, up to 1865, when domestic (American) wines demanded some attention from the wine dealers of the country. To the grape nurserymen in the United States from that day to this, too much praise cannot be awarded. Looking, it is true, to gain, they studied this most fascinating subject with a true devotion, as humble citizens, wholly unknown in the annals of grape-culture in Europe. Experimenting on the traditional system that the "Vinifera" (European grape) was a sine qua non for wines; they adopted a system of hybridizing to obtain strength from the native, and quality from the Asiatic descendant. The result is, that most of these experimentors enjoyed a life of delightful anticipation, devoid of realized funds, for the substantial comforts of life. Others similarly fascinated, continue in the course yet, abandoning the Vinifera mixture, devoting themselves to the improvements of intermixed stock. Though delighted in his day (30 years ago), Mr. Longworth would be amazed at the present results of his initiatory movement on behalf of native grapes. With the exception of his Catawba—immortalized by the melodious verse of our genial poet, Longfellow—his then best varieties have been discarded for other standard native grapes, numbering now over 400 varieties. New kinds are in vogue, producing wines, giving, satisfaction to the true European connoisseur. This vast variety of our native developed stock is not all adapted to the same or any one section, however perfect they may be in some given locality. This but corroborates the grape history of Europe, where the removal of a given variety to a different section or country results either in a total failure, or such modification in the properties of the grape as to make it practically a different fruit, the result of climatic influence: for example, the grape of Burgundy transferred to Bordeaux yields no more a true Burgundy wine. Albemarle Grapes.—With Thos. Jefferson's failure with his Vinifera as above stated, Albemarle county in the production of tobacco for transport, and raising corn and cereals to feed the negro slave, ceased to think of grape-culture. With the exception of a few scattered vines about country gardens, grapes were ignored, although its woods abounded with varieties of the Vitis Æstivalis, now recognized as the leading characteristic wine grape of the continent. Prior to this, the country gentry affecting style, followed their English ancestry, drinking at their homes, Port, Sherry and Madeira wines (so called). Later this habit decreased and the native Apple Jack, distilled from fine home-grown apples, and whiskey, usurped the place of wines entirely. The War.—With the little "sectional unpleasantness of 1861-'65," grapes were unthought of. Grapes and their product, wine, are reverently spoken of in the Bible as symbols of contentment, peace and social happiness. This unpleasantness between the sections of the union promoted neither of these triad conditions. Self-preservation, simple existence in barbaric aspect was the utmost of our efforts. After the War.—Albemarle county had escaped the actual horrors of a battle field, but bordering on these, it became the hospital and nursery for the wounded and dying, the sepulchre for the dead, the granary for the fighting soldier. The actual clash of arms ceased in 1865—the laborers are freed and rioting in unknown realms of so-called liberty. This was recognized property now confiscated by the conquering section. It means poverty and bankruptcy to the former master. With lands taxable and no labor; farming implements, working stock, cattle all devoured in the past four years of civil strife and no money, the people are at a loss how to produce means for existence. The superabundant lands alone are a burden; they are offered for sale at any sacrifice. This induces many from the Northern States and Europe to purchase and make their homes in this invigorating climate. Amongst these are Mr. W. Hotopp, purchasing "Pen Park" farm near Charlottesville, once the home of William Wirt, an orator and Attorney General of the United States. Grape Culture.—Mr. Hotopp (at the suggestion of an old Swiss, Sol. Seiler, who had lived here for long years before, and who knew something of viticulture from his native land, followed up here by garden grapes with a Frenchman, Mr. Alphonse, a teacher of gymnastics at the University of Virginia) conceived the idea that grape-culture would pay here as an industry. In 1866-'67, Mr. Hotopp planted out some grapes, with a view to shipping them for table use to some of the Northern cities. Not having studied nor being familiar with the subject, he planted indiscriminately different kinds, with Concord grapes in the lead. Fine luscious grapes in abundance was the result, and prices from shipping were more than satisfactory. Here was a new product of agriculture brought to light! Eagerly grasping for something more remunerative than corn, wheat, oats and tobacco, several Germans, who had settled here, planted vineyards, and some of the old settlers pulled out of the ruts of antiquarian traditions and embarked in this new pursuit. It grew successfully from year to year, until now it is estimated there are over 2,500 acres in vines within the county limits. Planting.—Climatically we occupy the latitude and climatic conditions of some of the most favored vine countries in Europe. The season is ample for perfect maturation of the best wine grapes, exempt from serious spring frosts and early frosts in autumn, with no excess of rainfall in the months of April, May and June, nor in the maturing months of July, August and September, seldom suffering from extended hail storms, a clear sky and dry atmosphere. The conditions primarily essential for successful grape-culture in perfection are combined here. The fact that the grape abhors wet, as Virgil taught, and still holds true, therefore a hillside is preferred to a low, flat location. The soil should be dry, calcareous loam, loose and friable, to facilitate self-drainage. Wherever there are any disintegrading rocks, that will be an advantage as a gradual feeder and mulch. Fresh lands preferable to those long cultivated. Trenching is the mode advocated for planting in France and Germany. With the expense and scarcity of lands, and cheap labor there, that may hold good—not so here. Plow deep and thoroughly, following with subsoiler to make perfect. Then land perfectly loosened and deeply plowed to eighteen or twenty inches, is preferable; the plants should be put out in the fall of the year, any time before a severe freeze. Spring planting is preferred by some, and often with equally good results; yet with ampler time in the fall and perfect settling of soil, fixing the rootlets when spring opens, the fall is deemed to be the best time as a rule. Planting should be in rows from eight to ten feet wide, and the plants from six to ten feet apart in the row, depending on the kind and its habit of growth. Small growing ones like Delaware may be planted 6 × 8, the Concord and Ives 8 × 8, but such as the Norton and Cynthiana should not be nearer than 10 × 10. The number required for an acre at above named distances would be 8 × 6, 907; 8 × 8, 680; and 10 × 10, 435. The plants should be first-class year old. Their cost will vary much as to kinds, times and places—from $20 to $75 per thousand prevails with regular nurseries. The first year the land is to be cultivated and kept clean, letting the young plants throw out one or two good shoots, no more. The second year this is repeated, cutting back to two eyes. Posts not smaller than 4 × 4 inches and 7 feet high, should be put in 2 feet this early summer, 20 feet apart, and one wire No. 12 stretched, to which the plant should be fastened taut, 2 feet above ground, to form a permanent stock, letting two branches grow above the wire to bear the fruit. The third year these two branches above the wire should be pruned back to four or five eyes on each side, and tied in a bowed position at the stem and extremity. Another or two other wires should be stretched, to which the summer growth is fastened during early summer, and the land cultivated and kept clean. Some do not bear fruit until the fourth year, and it is thought preferable that none should be permitted to bear much, if any fruit, until the fourth year. The cost of all this up to fourth year bearing, outside the land, should be from $50 to $125 per acre, depending on many surroundings and circumstances. What to Plant.—A difficult question. No locality will suit all grapes. A slight variation in soil, exposure, &amp;c., at but small intervals in space, adapts one kind of grape to a given spot, when two miles away this grape would not do so well, but another much better. The natural and ultimate destination of the grape is the wine vat, yet there are varieties popular and profitable, to a certain extent, for shipping. These should be attractive either to the eye or the palate, when perfect, combining both properties. The light-colored grapes excel in this respect. Of the large number of these now recognized as superior in quality, the finely pink-tinted, transparent Delaware has held the highest place in the New York market, for consecutive years, in price excelling the much larger bunched fine grapes of California. Of these, it must be borne in mind, that either the table market becomes glutted or there are a number of imperfect bunches which, if not put into the wine vat, are lost, and materially affects the profit derived. This county abounding, as it does, in a large admixture of iron in its soil, seems peculiarly adapted to highest perfection of red wine-grapes. This peculiarity is noted in the most favored claret-producing vineyards in France, the land of the finest light clarets. Many of the Labrusca species, such as, notably Concord and Ives, prevail here, making a good, sound, palatable wine. But the Æstivalis are unquestionably the finest native wine grapes in America. The Norton's Virginia (miscalled seedling) originated at Cedar Island, in James River, above Richmond city, and comes to the highest perfection in Virginia. Dense in color, abounding in tannin, it makes a characteristic wine of a heavy Burgundy nature. The Cynthiana, first brought from Arkansas, is so similar to the Norton that the two cannot be distinguished in foliage, seed or growth. It is claimed to make a finer wine, though that is questionable. The maturity of grapes for eating purposes opens generally about the first week in August, and for wine purposes they are gathered throughout September until as late as October tenth. When healthy and properly cultivated they yield a profit far exceeding that of any other agricultural product, when sold to the wine makers here at from $30 to $80 per ton delivered, while the finer table varieties pay still more, to the extent they can be shipped to the larger cities, all in easy reach by the diverging railways intersecting at Charlottesville. Although free from the effects of the scourge of Phylloxera devastating the fields of Europe, and the pourridie, a root rot, now making serious inroads on the Vitis in California, the grape is not exempt from all diseases. The black rot and mildew have of late years greatly affected the industry. These are two different though somewhat similar fungi. The mildew, long known in France, was there treated with considerable success by the application of sulphur. More recently the spraying of a liquid mixture of sulphate of copper, mixed either with lime or liquid ammonia, on the foliage has proved a perfect cure against this defoliaging fungus. Two years ago the black rot also made its appearance in France, and the government, with its vigilant protection of agriculture in all its branches, is seeking for a remedy. None has yet been officially reported. From present appearances (August, 1888) in a few of the local vineyards it is thought that the above named French mildew application is a promising preventive of the rot also, when spraying is early commenced and repeated at short intervals, May it not be that these two forms of fungi are so closely allied that the death of one affects the other, and a steady fight may gradually destroy them both? Oscar Reierson. The Wine-Making Industry. WINE," means the fermented grape juice. Unfermented wines do not exist any more than undistilled brandy. It has been in use in all ages and with all peoples of the globe, furnishing the elements of healthy stimulation, demanded by the human race in some form, as we learn from the most ancient records and can observe at the present time. Wines are to be divided into white and red, as to color, and dry and sweet as to their taste or sugar contents. Except for family use (and they more properly cordials than wine) no mercantile wines were produced in this county till about 1870-1, when Mr. Hotopp utilized his common house-cellar for converting his cultivated grapes, not shipped for table-use, into dry wines—red and white. As grape-culture extended, the late W. W. Minor, Sr., and Oscar Rierson procured casks, press, &amp;c., and made their grapes into wine, in an ordinary house-cellar, at Charlottesville. The two latter gentlement then procured the coöperation of other fruit-growers and formed the Monticello Wine Company, which was chartered in May, 1873. A good building was erected and properly furnished with all the necessary apparatus for the work, and placed under the charge of Mr. A. Russow. This structure, with its entire contents, was destroyed in 1881. It was replaced in 1882 by a larger and more perfectly equipped building, four stories in height, 44 × 100 feet inside measurement. The vaults of this building are fire-proof, and it is furnished with the best and latest appliances for the economic production and preservation of wines and brandy. This, with the now large wine cellar of Mr. Hotopp, together with a few smaller establishments, furnish, at all times, a safe and sure home market for the grapes raised in this and adjoining counties. The products of these cellars are of the highest excellence, and if they were allowed to acquire the "bouquet," that age alone can give, they would stand comparison with some of the noted wines of Europe. As it is, they are far superior to the average wine placed on the market. From the four to six thousand gallons produced by the Monticello Wine Company and Hotopp in 1873-4, the product has steadily increased to some 50,000 gallons annually by each; besides a goodly quantity, of two or three barrels to the family, made for private use by many of the grape-growers. In the beginning it was no easy task to find a market for these wines. Wines were not a general beverage. It was a kind of luxury indulged in by men of means, and these had acquired a real or fancied taste for European wines. They adhered to the prejudiced idea that America could make no good wines. Wine dealers shared the same opinion and even now wine importers boldly maintain such is the case. They are excusable, because they make larger profits of importations; or they buy a good native wine, put foreign labels on it and sell at imported prices. That there were good, sound meritorious native wines made, were acknowledged at the Vienna Exposition, in 1876, when a Missouri "Cynthiana" wine was awarded a first prize and this was followed by the award of a silver medal for red wines to the Monticello Wine Company, or the Paris Exposition in 1878, subsequently followed by two first-class medals at the Word's Exposition, at New Orleans, in 1884-5. But the Albemarle wines did not have to wait or rest their claims for merit on exposition medals. Fighting its way up hill, against long established prejudice, it gradually forced its passage into good society, gaining a recognition by the public of real intrinsic worth, till now it stands at the head of all native wines in all the large northern cities. It is a demonstrable fact that Albemarle County wines sell at a higher price to dealers and consumer than any wines made in America. Of course, it will be understood that we do not claim to have produced wines equal to the Grand Vins of France, the Rhine and the Hungarian Tokay. These are produced in but limited quantities, from grapes raised at particular points, and their price places them far beyond the reach of all except a few. But for sound, clear, pure wine of a grade generally used by the world and at prices of a popular standard, our wines compare favorably in every respect with similarly classed European wines. With the persistent efforts of America in producing higher-classed grapes, and continuous exertions to advance the qualities of wines, it is not improbable but that we may yet produce wines superior to the finest wines of Europe. The general character of the Albemarle wines may be briefly indicated as follows:— Catawba, made from the grape of that name, is probably the most extensively used of all American Wines. It has a strong flavor, and possesses less acid than the western wines of the same name. Its color is pale amber, like the Rhine wines, and it contains 13 per cent. of alcnhol, by weight. The Delaware is of a yellow color, fine flavor, great body and an alcoholic strength of 12 per cent. Claret is mainly made from the Concord grape, and for a light table wine is superior to the imported clarets. Its low price places it within the reach of all. Its alcoholic strength is from 9 to 10 per cent. Ives Seedling is a claret with some astringency, fine color, improving greatly with age. Its alcoholic strength is 10 to 11 per cent. The Alvey wine is made, to a limited extent, from the grape of the same name. It resembles, in character and flavor, the finer wines of Bordeaux. Cynthiana is considered the most characteristic of our native wines. It resembles the strongest Burgundy, very dark, great body and exquisite flavor, alcoholic strength 10 to 12 per cent. Norton's Virginia is another wine of a Burgundy nature, possessing decided medicinal properties. Its color is nearly black, very heavy and of strong flavor. It is known to be a preventive of intermittent fevers and other malarious diseases, as well as for chronic diarrhœas and summer complaints in children. It is fully appreciated in Europe as one of the best red wines of the world. Age improves it greatly. Its alcoholic strength is from 10 to 12 per cent. Clinton is a claret with wintergreen taste not liked except by a few. This taste disappears with age and is then quite popular as a claret. Grape brandy is produced from the juice of all these grapes of a high class. Its distillation is the old plan still pursued in Cognac, France. Hermann is a native sherry of good properties as a cooking wine, as well as a beverage for those partial to this class. Its alcoholic strength is 14 to 17 per cent., being nearly the same as that of the natural Sherry of Spain, ere it is fortified to 30 per cent. in the London Docks, from whence it is delivered to the consumer as pure. Oscar Reierson. What Albemarle Can Do. To show what can be done in Albemarle we publish the following sketch of Ellerslie, the home of Eolus: This farm is about eight miles from Charlottesville, and is on the eastern slope of Carter's Mountain. The lands now known as Ellerslie were originally taken up in colonial times by the Carters, and afterwards passed into the hands of Mr. James Ross, a wealthy citizen of Fredericksburg, Va. Mr. John O. Harris purchased Ellerslie, not then so named, in 1841. The farm, which consisted of 1,500 acres of land, was named by Mrs. Harris after William Wallace, the Knight of Ellerslie, whom she greatly admired. She imagined the two Ellerslies similarly situated. Captain R. J. Hancock married a daughter of Mr. John O. Harris, and at the close of the war took charge of the place. Then the stock, fencing and agricultural implements were not in the best condition—for Sheridan had passed through the country. Additions have been made to the place until now it comprises 1,800 acres of land, a merchant mill, excellent barns, stables, &amp;c. Every field and paddock is supplied with an abundance of pure water, while there is not an acre of marsh land upon the tract. In spite of the vicissitudes of war and other pestilences, the farm for forty-seven years has made its own corn and provender, not a dollar's worth of either being purchased in that period. Captain Hancock's adventure in thoroughbred horses began by the purchase of Scathelock, a son of imported Eclipse and Fanny Washington, of Major Thomas W. Doswell in 1871. The next year he purchased of A. Keene Richards the chestnut mare, War Song, daughter of War Dance and Eliza Davis. From these he bred Lizzie Hazlewood, Mib McGee, Blenheim and Mevlock. His ideal, however, was Eolus, the son of Leamington and Fanny Washington, and as soon as he could he exchanged Scathelock for him. Eolus is a dark bay, with a star and two white hind heels, fifteen hands three inches high and splendid in bone and muscle. He ran two mile heats over Pimlico course in 3:40, 3.39¼, 3.36¾, the fastest third heat and the best average three heats, with 118 pounds up, on record. From him and War Song he bred Eole, Eolist, St. Saviour, Eola, Eolee, Eolo and Eon; from Lizzie Hazlewood. Knight of Ellerslie, Thomasia, Charley Arnall and Charley Dreux. He afterwards made other purchases of brood mares. From Calash he bred Etha and Eolian; from Sans Souci, Souvenir, Souci and Sourire; from Ninon, Sam Keene, Eleve and Eleveur; from Grace Darling, Miss Grace, Diable and Diablo; from Tillie Russell, Charley Russell, Harry Russell, Eolite and Rustic; from Jennie Belle, Ada Belle and Michael, and from Vigiliene, Vigilante. The sales have been very satisfactory. Eole. 3 years old, sold for $4,500; Eolist, 2, $4,000; St. Saviour, 3, $12,000; Knight of Ellerslie, 3, $10,000; Eolo, 3, $6,000; Thomasia, 3, refused $4,000; Charley Dreux, 3, $4,000; Eon, 1, running qualities, $2,000; Eolian, 3, $2,000; Sam Keene, 4, $2,000; Harry Russell, 3, $1,400; Michael, 3, $1,200; Souci, 3, $1,100, etc. Eole while on the turf beat Long Taw, Getaway, Blue Lodge, Girofle, Lida Stanhope, Miss Woodford, Thora, Aella, Drake Carter, Glenmore, Bushwhacker, Parole, General Munroe, George Kinney, Iroquois, Monitor, etc. Captain Hancock is convinced that he was the best race horse of modern times, as he beat everything he was ever matched against except Hindoo, and he ran him to earth. No more race horses will be trained, and the stock business at Ellerslie will be confined hereafter to breeding and to annual sales of yearlings. The stud consists of three stallions and twenty-five brood mares. There is also on the farm a splendid herd of Shorthorns of the best blood and milking families, which were collected by Mr. Lewis F. Allen, editor of the American Herd Book, (an uncle, by the by, of President Cleveland); pure Cotswolds and Berkshires; in fact, everything on the farm is thoroughbred except work horses, even to setter dogs, Maltese cats and game chickens.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Educational Facilities. Free Schools. NO OTHER COUNTY possesses educational advantages equal to those of Albemarle. Its free school system has almost overcome the prejudices engendered by the great changes wrought by the war, and is rapidly attaining to that high standard of excellence and efficiency which has always characterized its numerous private schools for males and females. The public school system was organized in Albemarle county by D. P. Powers, County Superintendent, during the winter of 1870-'71. Fifty-seven schools, 38 for whites and 19 for colored, were opened with an enrollment of 2,268, and an average attendance of 1,443 pupils. The cost was $9,258.15. The average length of the term 4.52 months, and the value of the school property then owned by the county was only $114.62. In 1875 the number of schools had increased to 90, of which 57 were for whites and 33 for colored. The enrollment was 4,036, and the average attendance 2,136 pupils. The total cost was $21,061.70, and the average length of the term was 6.68 months. In 1880 there were 101 schools in operation, 62 for whites and 39 for colored. Enrollment 4,155, and the average attendance 2,539 pupils. The total cost was $21,958.11, the average length of the term being but six months. In 1885 there were 124 schools open, 77 for whites and 47 for colored, for which there was expended $26,215.13. The enrollment was 5,228, and the average attendance 3,169. The average length of the term was 6.32 months. During the session just closed, 1887-'88, 81 schools for whites and 50 for colored, making a total of 131, were in operation. The enrollment was 5,541, and the average attendance was 3,207. Although the schools in several places were severely interfered with by measles, the average length of the term was 6.1 months. $27,165.34 was expended for the work, $17,682.34 by the State, $9,483 by the county. The county now owns between sixty and seventy good school houses, and others are now in preparation for building. The value of the property has increased from $114.62 in 1871 to $25,000. In the city of Charlottesville and the town of Scottsville there are good graded schools, and in the country districts there are a number of schools employing two teachers. The average pay per month of male teachers is $34.50 while females receive on an average $27.50. Every community possesses a public school, which is patronized by all classes, the system deservedly increasing each year in popularity, as a consequence of the zeal and enthusiasm of the estimable ladies and gentlemen who compose the corps of teachers. D. P. Powers. Private Schools. THE ASSERTION that no county of the State surpasses Albemarle in educational opportunities is safely made. The necessity for good private schools was recognized by advanced and public-spirited men in the early days of the century. But the necessity for them was no greater then than now, when, in a larger sense than ever before, knowledge is power. With opportunities for correct training at every turn, parents and guardians can have no excuse for sending young men and young women into the world inadequately fitted for the duties which will be trying enough under the most fortunate conditions. An uneducated man may be strong and useful, but the chances are against his achieving as much as it would be his lot to accomplish with the advantages of thorough training. There have always been good private schools in Charlottesville. To speak only of matters easily within the memory of young men, Major Horace Jones conducted in this place an admirable high school for boys, at which many of our younger citizens received their early training. After Major Jones left Charlottesville there was what is usually described as a good opening for a private school of high grade. Whether it was this fact that led the Rev. Edgar Woods to establish the school at Pantops the writer cannot say; it was probably one of those fortunate cases in which the need and the supply meet. It was Wirt's opinion that Jefferson's intellectual activities were tinged with a sublime cast because of his exalted abode and the magnificence of the panoramic view that was constantly before him. It may, indeed, be more than a passing fancy; if so, the elevated position of Pantops (from which the place derives its name) is worthy of attention. In one sense it has always claimed attention. The eminence which the school crowns is just across the Rivanna river from Monticello. The view from Monticello has been the subject of the highest and most graceful eulogies; and yet in no particular does it surpass that always under the eye of the Pantopian. No section of Virginia can present a better record in the matter of equable climate and healthful surroundings. And Pantops is seated so high and dry in the midst of an enchanting landscape that no thought of malaria ever intrudes. All the inestimable advantages of perfect natural drainage and of pure mountain air meet here in a manner unsurpassed. As to climate, the location is indeed practically perfect. Lifted above the malarial districts of the tidewater country, it is at the same time sheltered by the Blue Ridge toward the North and West, and so escapes the rigors which make the winters of the Valley of Virginia longer and more trying. The objection sometimes urged against the location of schools for boys in town cannot apply here, for Pantops is two miles and a hal from the city. Some years ago Prof. John R. Sampson succeeded Mr. Woods in the management of the school. He had already distinguished himself in his deliberately chosen profession of teaching. Having accomplished thorough courses in the best schools and colleges in America, he went to Europe and spent four years in study at leading universities in Germany and France. While yet in Europe he was chosen professor of Latin and French in Davidson College, North Carolina. There he labored eight years, achieving a career of singular honor and usefulness. Learning that the school at Pantops would soon be discontinued and unwilling that the enviable reputation it had achieved should go for naught, he conceived the plan of purchasing the ample tract and making the school permanent. Resigning his professorship he returned to his native State, and went energetically to work to remodel the old building and put up new and substantial additions. He is now the sole principal of Pantops, and under his wise management the school has deserved success, and is being abundantly rewarded. In the eleven years of its existence this academy has received students from twenty States and one Territory of the Union, and from Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Japan and Siam. It is safe to say that no school in Virginia surpasses Pantops in the matter of equipment, and that no teacher brings to his profession more genuine enthusiasm than Prof. Sampson. Living near the University he gets the best of its graduates for his assistants, and the high rank taken at the University and also in the colleges by those students prepared at Pantops, attests the thoroughness of the instruction and the high standard maintained. The school building is heated throughout with steam, and the plan is such that every room has sunshine during the day Special attention has been given to light and ventilation. The institutions of the school are a Y. M. C. A., a reading-room, a well-equipped gymnasium, a base-ball club, a foot-ball association, and the "Pantops World," a paper edited by the boys. There is each year, in November, an athletic field-day. There can be no surer proof of the excellency of a school than the loyalty and devotion of its pupils. Pantops has been in large measures built up by the recommendations of its "old boys" and their friends. And after reaching manhood, memory but intensifies the warmth with which they speak of the kindness received in the home there, and every year but adds to the pride with which they bear the name of "Pantopian." For some years Prof. Brock, now a member of the faculty of Hampden-Sidney College, conducted a very successful school at the Midway building. When he accepted a professorship in the college just named he was succeeded by Mr. B. Boaz, who had been his assistant. Mr. Boaz is an alumnus of the University of Virginia, where he received the master's degree. His success has been of the decided order. The school relies chiefly on home patronage, as no provision is made for boarders. Dr. J. M. Page, who has just returned from Leipsic with his Ph. D., and his brother, Thomas Walker Page, have opened a select private school for boys near Keswick. It is their plan to limit the number of pupils to fifteen, to give their personal attention to each, and, in a word, to afford an ideal home school. These gentlemen are in every respect well qualified to accomplish their undertaking. There are many primary schools for small children throughout the county of which it is not necessary to speak. There is a decided sentiment in all refined communities in favor of the thorough education of the girls, and in this city and neighborhood there has never been a disposition to evade this beneficent social exaction. For this reason the female institutes of Charlottesville have always been generously patronized. To notice the oldest first, for there exists no other reason for precedence, the Piedmont Institute has had an active career of thirty-five years, a fact which, taken alone, sufficiently attests the great excellence of the school. The Rev. R. K. Meade and Mrs. Meade live in a handsome residence on Market street, and there is the seat of the school of which they are the principals. The grounds are extensive and handsome, and well suited to the purposes of a large school. The principals are assisted by competent teachers, and the various courses of the school are conducted with so much ability and integrity that the pupil is hopelessly dull who does not derive the most positive benefits. Another inevitable test of the merit of a school is the degree of popularity it attains. The Piedmont, proved by this standard, measures well up to the best schools in Virginia. Almost every year has witnessed an increase in the number of students until now the attendance is very large. It is a pleasure to commend a school so eminently deserving of praise and patronage. The Albemarle Female Institute is situated picturesquely on the suburbs of Charlottesville, and is well known far and wide as an excellent school for young ladies. The institute is one of the handsomest buildings for a young ladies school in Virginia, faces a splendid landscape of valley and hill, with a great range of mountains in the distance. It looks out upon historic ground and the associations are all elevating. Prof. Dickinson, who has charge of the school, has won and deserves much credit for the ability with which he has conducted this academy for young ladies. Among his letters from former patrons are to be found written testimony to the success of which mention is made above, for the praises of the school are sounded without stint. Prof. Dickinson is assisted by the most competent teachers, while the boarding department, over which Mrs. Dickinson presides, is conducted on the Virginia plan of abundance, well prepared. Sickness is of rare occurrence, indeed; but whenever a pupil falls ill the care bestowed on the patient is as unremitting as it is kindly. The graduates of these schools should be in the widest sense "sweet girl graduates," they are afforded every opportunity and incentive to become accomplished and attractive, and if they do not, their failure is due to their own indifference and neglect. It is a matter of congratulation that these schools propose and maintain honest and inflexible standards of scholarship and deportment, and are not, as too many female colleges are, merely the resort of young ladies seeking to "finish," but not to accomplish their education. The young lady who is graduated from these schools or receives their highest honor, has not merely spent a certain period under instruction, but has accomplished all that the principals avouch that she has achieved. The Miller Manual Labor School Of Albemarle. SAMUEL MILLER, the founder of the Miller Manual Labor School of Albemarle, was born in the county of Albemarle, Va., June 30th, 1792. In early life he received a good common school education, and then for a few years taught school near Batesville in his native county. But he soon moved to Lynchburg, Va., where with his elder brother, John, he went into mercantile business. He was a man of feeble constitution, was very dyspeptic and nervous, but he was careful in eating and drinking, and he attributed his long life to his having never used tobacco. About the year 1824, on account of ill health, he moved to his farm in Campbell county (five miles from Lynchburg), but he continued his mercantile business in Lynchburg in partnership with his brother until 1841, at which time his brother died, leaving to him the bulk of all his fortune, which amounted to about $100,000. It was stated by Mr. Miller that it was a cherished idea of his brother and himself to amass a large sum of money for the purpose of establishing in their native county a charitable institution for the education of poor children. After his brother's death, with their united fortunes, he moved on with a steady, unwavering purpose, exhibiting rare sagacity and mercantile ability to the accomplishment of this cherished dream of their youth, until he became one of Virginia's greatest benefactors. On the 1st day of April, 1859, Mr. Miller made his will, and by it established and richly endowed the Miller Manual Labor School of Albemarle. He also added greatly to the munificent gifts with which he had already endowed the Lynchburg Female Orphan Asylum. He subsequently gave $100,000 to the University of Virginia. In addition to all these gifts to the cause of education, he provided liberally for his relatives and those who had cared for him and proven true to him through long years of friendship. Mr. Miller died on the 27th of March, 1869, at his residence in Campbell county, Va., aged 76 years, eight months and three days, and was buried in the grounds of the Lynchburg Female Orphan Asylum, where a magnificent shaft marks the last resting place of the friend of the "poor orphan children" of his native county. Soon after Mr. Miller's death, his sole surviving executor, Mr. N. M. Page, of Batesville, Albemarle county, Va., entered upon the discharge of his duties, which he performed with untiring energy and strict integrity through long years of vexatious law suits, where hundreds of thousands were necessarily sunk in order to save the will. These suits resulted in an act of compromise passed by the Virginia Legislature, approved February 24th, 1874, to establish the Miller Manual Labor School of Albemarle as provided for in the twenty-fifth clause of Mr. Miller's will. The executor, Mr. Page, turned over to the "Miller Fund," as denominated in the will, stocks and bonds amounting to over one million of dollars, the income and profits of which were for the establishment and perpetual support of the Miller Manual Labor School of Albemarle. The Board of Trust.—This fund is held in trust by the Board of Education of Virginia. The following is the present Board, viz: Gen. Fitzhugh Lee, Governor of Virginia; Dr. John L. Buchanan, Superintendent of Public Instruction; Hon. Rufus A. Ayres, Attorney-General of Virginia. Secretary of the Board.—Hon. Frank G. Ruffin, Second Auditor of Virginia. It is the duty of the Board of Trust to hold the principal; to invest all bonds when they mature; to sell all bonds that may be of doubtful solvency, and to reinvest the proceeds of such sales in good bonds; to collect all interest when due; to hold the same subject to proper draft from the County Court of Albemarle to meet the expenses of the school; to make an annual report of the condition of the fund each year, describing in full the character of the bonds in which the principal is invested, giving all changes made during the year in the investment of the principal, giving the amount received from all sources for the income of the fund, and reporting all amounts expended of the income. This report, made by the Second Auditor to the Governor, is laid before the Legislature of Virginia, and is printed in two papers four times—one published in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the other in Richmond, Virginia. The report for January 1st, 1888, makes the following exhibit: Receipts on account of the income of the fund during the year 1887, $71.961 94 Balance in Treasury to the credit of the income Jan. 1, 1887 30,765 72 Total to the credit of the income 111,726 66 Disbursements by C.

There is a house and lot in Harper's Ferry, W. Va., owned by the Fund, estimated to be worth $3,000.00 It will be seen by the statement of receipts and disbursements on account of income, that there is in the treasury to the credit of the fund in cash for the maintenance and support of the School, December 31, 1887 26,696 72 And to the credit of the fund in the State Bank of Virginia a balance of principal of 186 48 THE GOVERNMENT OF THE SCHOOL. The school is managed and controlled through the agency of the County Court of Albemarle. The Court appoints "annually, two intelligent, respectable, and well-educated gentlemen," whose duty it is to select and employ, whenever necessary, competent and suitable teachers for the school (subject to the approval of the County Court), and to visit the school quarterly, examine into its condition minutely, and make written report thereof to the Court. Judge John L. Cochran, in 1874, assumed the duties which the law places upon the County Court of Albemarle. In July, 1874, he appointed as visitors, Col. Chas. S. Venable and Prof. Francis H. Smith, of the University of Virginia. Judge Hezekiah Taylor was elected to the office of County Court Judge in January, 1880. In July, 1880, he appointed Col. Chas. S. Venable and Rev. John T. Randolph Visitors to the school. In July, 1883, Col. Venable resigned and Prof. Francis H. Smith was appointed in his place. In January, 1886, Judge John M. White, having been elected to the office of County Court Judge, assumed the duties of the same. He appointed at the following August term of the Court as Visitors, Prof. Francis H. Smith, of the University of Virginia, and Mr. Thomas S. Martin, of Scottsville, Va. APPOINTMENT OF PUPILS. The District School Trustees of the respective districts of the county of Albemarle, select and designate the children of the county who come under the requirements of Mr. Miller's will for admission into the school. From this list, made and revised by the School Trustees every six months, the Court appoints the pupils of the school. It is to be noted that only children who are residents of the county of Albemarle can be appointed to the school. Moreover, they must be selected as coming under the requirements of Mr. Miller's will by the School Board of the district in which they reside before the Court can appoint them to the school. These pupils when appointed to the school are clothed, fed, taught and cared for wholly at the expense of the school. In October, 1878, the first pupils were admitted into the school. The school began with twenty pupils. It was then quite difficult to find children whose friends were willing to have them appointed to the school. In July, 1884, a paper in reference to the rights of girls to the benefits of Mr. Miller's gift was submitted by Prof. Francis H. Smith to the Visitors, and by them to the Court. After getting the opinion of some of the leading lawyers of the Albemarle bar, the Court at the August term, 1884, entered the following order—viz: "It appearing to the Court that the provision made in the twenty-fifth clause of Mr. Miller's will for the `education and support of as many poor orphan and other white children of Albemarle county as the profits and income of the fund therein devised will admit of or compass,' can be more effectually carried into operation by forming the school into two separate and distinct departments, and by the admission of children of both sexes; therefore it is ordered that the District School Trustees of the county, from and after this date, shall make the selections for appointments to the school from both sexes having the required qualifications, regard being had to the numbers to be admitted each year of each sex, and for whom separate and necessary accommodations have been previously prepared." In accordance with this order a department for the instruction of girls was organized under the authority and control of the Superintendent. Under this order the first girls were admitted in November, 1884. The following is a summary of the enrollment of pupils since the organization of the school—viz: Session. Entered. Discharged. Increase. Total on Rolls during session. Boys. Girls. Boys. Girls.

BUILDINGS. Their Cost, Equipments and Uses.—The first work was begun upon the main building in 1874. The architect of this building was Capt. A. M. Lybrock, of Richmond, Virginia. The front part, with central wing for dining-room and chapel, was completed by September, 1878. The south wing was built in 1881, the north wing in 1883, thus completing the building according to the original design of the architect. This building cost $140,000. Its equipments cost $60,000. In it are lodged all the pupils with most of their teachers. In addition to the lodging rooms there are in this building the study halls, class rooms, chapel, dining-room and kitchens. The machine shop building, completed July 1st, 1882, cost $30,000. It is used for instruction in mechanics. Its equipments cost $30,000. From it also goes the steam that runs the laundry, heats some of our buildings, and drives five engines used for various purposes in different buildings on the place. It also gives the light (Edison's incandescent electric) used in the buildings and on the lawns. The infirmary No. 1, cost $7,000, and is used for lodging for the employees. It is intended to be used as an infirmary only in cases of epidemics amongst the pupils. Such a thing has only occurred once in the history of the school. The infirmary No. 2, cost $5,000, and is used for the sick boys. In this building the chaplain and physician have their rooms. The laundry cost $6,000. Its equipments cost $2,000. In it is done all the washing and mending for the pupils. The stables cost $6,000, and are used for quarters for 40 horses and 50 cows. The silos cost $3,000, and are used for ensilage. The conservatory cost $2,000. Its equipments cost $500. It is used for instruction in floriculture. The chemical laboratory cost $2,000. Its equipments cost $2,000. The private residences for the officers of the school cost $20,000. There are in addition to the buildings named above several residences for the use of employees of the school, which are worth about $4,000. The farm is worth $30,000. Its equipments are worth $7,000. The buildings are all in good condition and are worth to-day their original cost. They are heated by steam. Edison's incandescent light was placed in the buildings in June, 1883. The cost of this plant was $10,000. From the above statement it will be noted that the value of the entire plant is about $360,000. COURSE OF STUDY. Primary Department.—In this department, which is under the charge of a lady principal, assisted by as many lady teachers as may be required, the pupils are taught reading, writing, intermediate arithmetic and primary geography. We have under the conditions of Mr. Miller's will, no entrance examination. Hence many who come to us must begin at the lowest point. Very few are able to enter above our primary department. As the foundation of all our work is here, it is necessary that the department be most carefully attended to. To this end a corps of most excellent lady teachers have been secured, who give their entire time to the instruction of these beginners. By them our children are taught with great care to read and spell correctly. They also are specially directed in writing. Before leaving this department they are able to compose letters quite creditable to themselves. They are also here well drilled in the first principles of arithmetic, and given instruction in the Primary Geography. Higher Department.—This department is divided into six classes, to each of which is given one year. The studies in these six classes are as follows—viz: Sixth Class. Arithmetic English History Geography House &amp; Farm Work Fifth Class. Arithmetic English History Geography Printing &amp; Farm Work Fourth Class. Alge bra. English Latin Botany and Physiology Farm Work and Shop Practice. Third Class. Geometry, Algebra. English Latin Chemistry Drawing and Shop Practice. Second Class. Algebra. Geometry. Physics Latin and German. Geology, Mineralogy Drawing and Shop Practice. First Class. Trigonom'y Mechnics Latin and German. Botany, Entomology Drawing and Shop Practice. English.—Our object is to impart a practical knowledge of the English language; to make the pupil acquainted with the leading facts in its history and etymology and practically familiar with the laws of composition and style. Pupils are daily exercised in orthography and penmanship. The former is taught always by dictation, the latter practiced for a stated time under the immediate supervision of an instructor. The study of English grammar, and of the history and analysis of the language, with the elements of rhetoric, is diligently pursued. Weekly compositions, or essays, upon assigned subjects are required of every pupil. These are submitted for correction, and returned the following week, with errors in spelling, grammar, or construction carefully noted. Geography and History form an important element in this department. One year is given to the study of Ancient, and one to the study of Modern History. While this is not long enough to study the History of even all the most important nations, a vigorous effort is made to instil a taste for reading. Latin.—The study of Latin by every pupil is required. Every pupil is thoroughly drilled in the accidence of this language by daily grammatical recitations, by written exercises, and by systematic reading. In the lower classes daily exercises are required, and every pupil is given a black-board drill to show that he understands the lesson for the day. In the higher classes longer and more difficult passages are given once a week, and the critical correction of these exercises, involving discussions of the nicest points of syntax, constitute a prominent feature. While we are not able in the time allowed to make a pupil a thorough classical scholar, every effort is made to give him a taste for classical literature and to make him familiar with the etymology and derivation of languages. Four years are given to the study of Latin. German.—The same method, as far as practicable, is pursued here as in Latin. Great attention is paid to the writing of exercises and to the acquisition of a thorough knowledge of grammar and syntax. Care is taken to impart a correct pronunciation, and pupils are practiced daily in written and oral exercises. While reading the different authors, special attention is paid to the idioms of the language. The course is occasionally varied with some book of current literature. Mathematics.—After completing Intermediate Arithmetic in our Primary Department, our pupils are given a careful and thorough course in Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, and Plane and Spherical Trigonometry. They also are given some instruction in Conics. This course, taken in connection with their book-keeping, drawing, mechanics, physics, and shop practice gives them a most substantial mathematical foundation upon which to build. Sciences,—Our students are carefully instructed in the principles of chemistry, botany, zoology, mineralogy, and geology, and in order that they may possess a knowledge of the only true "Scientific Agriculture," their attention is called, in the various parts of the course, to the application of the principles of the Natural Sciences to the improvement of the art of agriculture. All who pursue the study of chemistry work three hours each week for one session in the chemical laboratory, where they are required to repeat most of the class experiments, and are well-grounded in blowpipe analysis. Such as show great aptitude for it are afterwards taught quantitative chemical analysis. In the study of botany, the students are stimulated to collect the native plants, and learn, as far possible, the principles of the science by direct observation of nature. Geological, mineralogical, and botanical excursions are made whenever practicable, and the School now possesses as one of the results of the labor of these classes complete collections of the native woods, minerals and rocks and a large herbarium of Albemarle. Before graduation, students pursue a course of cryptogamic botany, in which they are encouraged to work with the compound microscope. Department of Practical Mechanics.—In this department instruction is given by the Director, aided by an instructor in wood work, one in iron, one in forging and foundry work, and one in drawing. To complete the course takes four years, one in wood work, one in forging and foundry work, one in iron work, and the last year in advanced work in one of these three departments. Fifteen hours per week is devoted to shop work through the entire time. Drawing is taught throughont the four years for seven and a-half hours per week, and in each year is allied to the branch of shop work that the pupil is taking. The first year is taken by the boys in the fourth class of our regular school course (the first class being the graduating class). Here they learn by a systematic course of exercises the use of the various hand tools and appliances used for wood work, the principles of a variety of joints used in construction, and how to make them. They also become familiar with the lathe and its tools and wood-working machines generally, such as are used in carpentry and cabinet work and pattern making. At the end of the year they are able to make articles of furniture, such as washstands, tables, etc. The second year in this department is taken by the boys of the third class. Here they are trained in forging and foundry work. They learn first in forging the use of tools on lead instead of on hot iron, which greatly facilitates the work of a beginner. It is not long before they can handle iron itself with a measure of skill. In foundry work, they also commence with alloys, etc., before moulding iron, though they later learn to charge and manage the cupola and to do a fair variety of moulding. The third year is taken by the boys of the second class in the Machine Shop, where they first learn the use of the tools, etc., by regular exercises. Before the end of the year they are able to construct different mechanisms, etc., of a creditable character. In the fourth year, having previeusly gone through all the departments, the student is required to make a specialty of one of them, and follow up advanced work in it. Drawing, as previously mentioned, is taught throughout the four years, and each year bears an intimate relation to that year's shop practice. It is begun with very simple free-hand drawing, and later on the use of instruments is gradually acquired. The drawing is never from plates, but from objects, either real or imaginary. In addition to this regular course in shop practice, etc., a time is set aside in each department for regular instruction of a more special character for those boys who on account of advanced age, or other cause, will be unable to graduate. The instruction in physics, mechanics, and electricity is also given in this department. The course in physics is interesting, thorough, and decidedly practical, being well illustrated throughout by careful experiments. In mechanics, which is made (as it should) to bear a close relation to manual training, shop practice, etc., the pupils are taught the principles, etc., involved in the various operations they are taught to perform. Electricity is taught in direct connection with the dynamos, storage batteries, regulators, resistance boxes, etc., of the electric-light plant, aided by a collection of electrical apparatus, and the pupils are required to become sufficiently familiar with them to manage them intelligently, and to make dynamos, motors, converters, etc. Farm Training.* * This plan will go into operation in September, 1888. —The sixth class will be engaged in farm and garden work every afternoon. The class will be divided into two squads, each in charge of a captain selected from one of the higher classes. They will be employed during the autumn in assisting with the planting and cultivation of the late garden crops, the gathering of vegetables, storing of winter vegetables, and growing and transplanting such vegetable plants as are kept in frames during winter. In winter they will be taught the feeding of cattle, and especially of young animals. In the necessary routine work, such as cutting feed and getting out ensilage, the squads will alternate with each other three days at a time. The effort will be made to make all the work done contribute to the manual dexterity of the boys, and to teach them that the thorough performance of work, which seems mere drudgery, will better fit them for more responsible positions. The fourth and fifth classes will work each three days in the week, and will be under the immediate personal supervision of the director of this department. The effort of the instructor will, with these classes, be to train them in a skillful use of all farm tools. This work will be less of routine drudgery than that of the sixth class, and while their labor will be utilized in the work of the farm and garden, the acquirement of skill in the use of tools, management of teams, etc., will be considered of more importance than the amount of work accomplished. At the same time the effort will be made to teach the great value of human labor in our American agriculture, and the necessity for such use of animals and tools as may enlarge the productive capacity of human labor. The boys in these classes will be taught, as opportunity offers, the handling of teams, methods of plowing for different purposes, the use, adjustment and care of farm machinery, planting crops, sowing grass seed, etc. They will also have lessons in greenhouse practice during winter and in the care of plants in frames. Book-Keeping.—Every boy and girl, at some period in our course of study, is thoroughly taught in single and double entry book-keeping. During this instruction, special attention is paid to their penmanship. Work in this department is given for seven hours a week during the entire term. Telegraphy.—A class of girls is taught for about seven hours a week during the year in telegraphy. At the end of the year they are able, after one or two months' practical training in an office, to do good work. Bee-Culture.—We have a well equipped and well managed apiary. The instruction given here each year to a few of our boys is both pleasant and profitable. Printing.—In a well equipped and arranged printing office the boys of the fifth class are given instruction in printing for seven and a half hours each week. Nearly all the printing needed for the school is done by these boys. Industrial Training in the Girls' School.—In addition to the instruction now given to the girls in book-keeping and telegraphy, a class is practiced in typewriting. Arrangements have just been completed for giving the girls a thorough and careful course in dressmaking. To this end a teacher has been employed, who has completed a course in this special line under one of the best instructors in this country. Training in other departments for our girls is being now investigated. LIBRARY. A well selected and constantly growing library is kept for the benefit of the pupils. The best newspapers and periodicals are also provided for their use. To this our pupils have daily access, and a taste for good reading is stimulated that we are sure will be of lasting benefit to them. SOCIAL TRAINING. Every effort is made to have our children trained to a happy home life here at the school. Their associations with the teachers are always pleasant and profitable. It is recognized by all officers that the great object of the school is to develop our children, mentally, morally and physically. The introduction of lady teachers into the school has had a most elevating and refining influence upon all the pupils. Their work with our smaller boys is showing most excellent results. Every pupil is trained to feel that this is his home; that every officer is his friend, and is here for his good. They are taught to be respectful and polite at all times, while they, by kind and courteous treatment, are made to feel free and easy in the presence of the officers. A special feature of the school is a series of entertainments, to which the pupils are invited in turn. The object of these entertainments is to confer a pleasure upon the pupils by affording them an agreeable recreation from the monotony of their daily tasks, to bring teacher and pupil together and promote cordial relations between them, and to cast about the latter a refining, social influence. The entertainments occur upon alternate Wednesday evenings, and to each are invited a certain number of pupils, the officers and the ladies of the school. On the appointed evening these assemble in the parlor; refreshments are partaken of, and the evening is passed in games, music and appropriate amusements. These entertainments have proved very successful, and, we feel confident, are destined to exercise a highly beneficial influence upon the manners and morals of the pupils of the school. RELIGIOUS TRAINING. The religious feature of the school is amongst the most interesting connected with it, showing that the best moral and religious influences are brought to bear upon the pupils. The entire school meets regularly in the chapel for worship, night and morning. This exercise consists of reading the Scripture, singing and prayer, occupying about ten minutes each time. The Sunday-school is opened—the entire school being present—at 9:30 A. M., each Sunday morning, after which teachers and pupils repair to their respective rooms, where the lesson for the day of the International Series is taught. Preaching in the chapel at 11:30 A. M. every Sunday morning. In addition to this, there is daily reading of the Scriptures, especially in the primary department, followed sometimes by questions and brief instruction to impress it upon the minds of the children. Among the boys there are two Y. M. C. A.'s, numbering together 140 boys. These meet every Sunday night. Much interest is taken in these societies. Nearly one hundred of the pupils are members of some church. Among the girls, there is a Christian band, corresponding to the Y. M. C. A. among the boys. An interesting Bible class, taught by the Superintendent and composed of the officers and teachers, meets in the parlor every Sunday night. CONDITIONS FOR THE ADMISSION OF PUPILS. 1st. Each pupil shall be fed, clothed, instructed and cared for in accordance with the provisions of Mr. Miller's will. 2d. They shall be governed and controlled by the Superintendent exclusively, assisted by the other officers of the school, in accordance with such laws and regulations as may be adopted by the Board of Visitors and approved by the County Court. 3rd. They shall remain at the school subject to its laws and regulations during the time that shall be determined by the District Board of School Trustees, unless dismissed in accordance with the laws and regulations of the school. 4th. The parents, or guardians, shall, upon their entrance into the school, relinquish all right or claim to control or govern them during the time that they shall be required, in accordance with the above conditions, to remain at the school. 5th. They are appointed by the County Court, subject to the condition that they shall not remain at the school after they are eighteen years old, save in case of unusual merit, when an exception may be made upon the recommendation of the officers of the school and the Board of Visitors. FINANCES. How Managed.—The managers, or foremen, are required to give written notice to the Superintendent of what is needed by their respective departments; and if it meet with his approval, the order is made from his office over his own signature. When the goods come to hand the bill (after rigid comparison with the original order and verification of the figuring by the clerk) is sent to the manager or foreman. He, on finding the goods to correspond with the bill, marks it "correct," and returns it to the Superintendent, by whom it is marked "approved," and passed on to the book-keeper, who classifies, arranges and lists all the bills ready for examination by the Judge of the County Court, to whom they are submitted once a month by the Superintendent. All bills that are marked "examined and allowed" by the Judge are then returned to the book-keeper to be prepared for payment, and to be properly posted in the books. The Judge grants a draft on the Second Auditor of the State for the exact amount required to pay the monthly claims, which sum is placed to the credit of the Superintendent in one of the banks of deposit in the county, and paid by his check to the respective parties in person, their receipts being taken therefor and held as vouchers to be exhibited with the books, orders and original bills to the Board of Visitors at their regular quarterly meetings. All claims against the school are paid directly to the parties to whom they are due, and that only by a check for the exact amount as certified by the court. No transfer of a claim, either by order or by assignment (except by legal process), is recognized by the Superintendent. Money due the school for work or sales of any kind is paid only to the book-keeper at his office, and by him credited to the proper department, his receipt being taken therefor. This money is deposited in bank from time to time during the month, and the sum thereof deducted from the amount of the draft on the Auditor for that month. OFFICERS OF THE SCHOOL. (As Appointed by the Visitors and Approved by the County Court.) On the 20th day of June, 1878, the Visitors selected C. E. Vawter for the position of Superintendent of the school. In August, 1878, Mrs. V. P. Means was selected for the position of matron of the school. In September, 1878, J. Roy Baylor, Jr., was appointed a teacher in the school. As the school advanced he was assigned specially to the department of languages. In August, 1879, R. B. Shepherd was appointed to give instruction in drawing and physics. He resigned in August, 1886. He is now professor of drawing in the Technological school of Atlanta, Ga. In August, 1880, E. G. Taylor was appointed a teacher, and was afterwards specially assigned to the position of book-keeper for the school. In August, 1880, W. O. Whitescarver was appointed a teacher and assigned specially to instruction in English. He resigned in August, 1883, and is now a civil engineer at Atlanta, Ga. In July, 1882, C. G. Taylor was appointed director of our machine shops. He resigned in July, 1884. He is now instructor in practical mechanics in the Michigan University. In August, 1882, W. H. Seamon was appointed a teacher and assigned specially to the department of chemistry. He now resigns to accept the chair of Analytical Chemistry in the School of Mines of the University of Missouri, Rolla, Mo. In August, 1883, T. U. Taylor was elected a teacher and assigned to the department of Mathematics and Physics. He also resigns to accept the chair of Assistant Professor of Applied Mathematics in the University of Texas. In August, 1883, W. B. Richards was appointed a teacher and assigned specially to the chair of English. He resigned in August, 1884. He is now professor of Mathematics in the School of Mines, Rolla, Mo. In August, 1883, Geo. A. Beck, one of the first graduates of the school, was appointed a teacher in the primary department. He resigned August, 1886. He is now a teacher in Augusta county, Va. In August, 1884, A. H. Davis was appointed a teacher and assigned specially to the department of English. He resigned in August, 1885. He is now a lawyer in Atlanta, Ga. In August, 1884, J. W. Calhoun, Jr., was appointed a teacher and assigned specially to the department of English. Upon the inauguration of the department of the school for girls, Mrs. I. Coleman was elected principal, and Mrs. J. W. Calhoun teacher. In April, 1888, Mrs. Coleman resigned and Mrs. J. W. Calhoun was appointed to the position of principal. In August, 1885, Miss P. S. Coleman was appointed a teacher in the girls' department. She resigned in August, 1886. In April, 1886, W. F. Massey was appointed director of the agricultural department. In August, 1886, S. Tompkins was appointed director of the mechanical department. In August, 1886, Miss M. E.

Miss Jennie Rodes, Miss Marion Glassell and Miss Lena Tucker were appointed teachers in boys' primary department August, 1887. Miss Rodes resigned in March, 1888. University of Virginia. AMONG the objects of interest in Albemarle county the University of Virginia must always occupy an important place. It is the intent of the present paper to point out the resources of this school of learning, to state what it is able to do for the young men of the State, and to describe what it is doing. PREPARATION. First in order comes the question which every young man who proposes to enter the University must answer for himself: Am I prepared to profit by the work of the University? How he should answer this question will depend on the work he desires to do there. If his studies lie in the academical department, then of the thirteen Schools which compose it, there are eight in which only the essentials of an ordinary common school education are absolutely indispensable. These are English, History and Political Economy, Modern Languages, General Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry, Mineralogy and Geology, Biology and Agriculture, Moral Philosophy. Of the remaining five, Pure Mathematics and Natural Philosophy require in addition an acquaintance with the elements of Mathematics, while Latin and Greek demand at least the rudiments of these languages; and the School of Practical Astronomy can be profitably taken only by students who have accomplished a tolerably complete course of Mathematics and Physics. In short it may be said that while the benefit of sound, mental training and accurate preparation is nowhere greater than here, yet no man of robust intellect and earnest purpose need turn away from the doors of the University in despair. She offers to all such ample fields of work suited to their powers, and makes abundant provision for the repair of their deficiencies. In the professional departments of Law and Medicine, the same remarks as to preparation can be made. But inasmuch as a certain maturity of mind is requisite for the proper grasp of these studies, it is not recommended that any student, however well prepared, enter upon them at an age less than eighteen years. In the department of Engineering the matriculate should be well trained in the elements of mathematics. EXPENSE. A second point on which mnch misapprehension exists is the cost of an education at the University. It is reputed to be an expensive school, to which only wealthy men can afford to send their sons. The most satisfactory answer that can be made to such allegations is a statement of actual facts. To academical students from Virginia the University offers all her facilities of labraries, apparatus and instruction in ten distinct Schools, embracing all the branches of science and letters, for a single matriculation fee of $25. This is the only charge, and is all that the school receives from such a student. To have sufficient guarantees of health among the young men, it has been found necessary to erect a hospital, provide a matron and a trained nurse, and have regular attending physicians. To support this hospital every student (except such as live at home) pays an annual fee of $7. This entitles him to free medical advice and nursing, and is an exceedingly modest charge for the services actually rendered. Such as it is, none of it goes into the treasury of the University; the whole amount being expended in the maintenance of the hospital. Including this we have for the University fees of a student from Virginia in the academical department— Matriculation, $25 Infirmary fee, 7 Total of University fees, $32 The living expenses of a student at the University are on the lowest estimate as follows: Lodging, $ 15 Board at $12 a month, 108 Fuel, Lights and Washing, 25 Total living expenses, $148 These depend on the market price of commodities in the the locality and can be reduced only by the provision of a diet inadequate in quantity or unsuitable in quality — a device which would be worse than the wildest extravagance. The fare provided at this price is plain but wholesome and abundant. More luxurious accommodations can be obtained at a corresponding increase of price. But the usage of the school is shown by the fact that of the 250 students resident within the precincts of the University during the last session, 120 or 48 per cent. lived at the Clubs at the rates above stated. Summing up the foregoing items we get for the total necessary expenses of a Virginian academical student— University fees, $ 32 Living expenses, 148 $148 The additional cost of books and stationery will be the same at the University as at other schools and varies with the courses taken. The amount of pocket money spent by the student will usually vary inversely as his success in his studies. A father can provide for his son no sharper spur to frivolity, no surer allurement to vice, than unrestricted pocket money. Few young men who take part in the literary and forensic activities of the student community can get through the session under $50; $100 should be considered a maximum. To sum up, a Virginian, in the academical department of the University, should have an allowance of $250 to $350 according to the price he pays for board, plus his expenditure for books, clothing and travelling. More money will do him harm. In the laboratory Courses and in the professional Schools the charge for tuition should be added. For those with whom severe economy is a necessity, it should be said that every year there are men at the University who meet all the expenses of college life on less than $200. FACILITIES FOR INSTRUCTION. In nothing has the University changed so greatly since its foundation as in the facilities which it offers for instruction. The original Faculty consisted of eight professors, three Literary, three Scientific, one of Medicine and one of Law; each in charge of a distinct School. At present there are four distinct departments. I. Literary Department with six professors and two instructors. II. Scientific and Engineering Department with eight professors and two instructors. III. Medical Department with four professors and one instructor. IV. Law Department with two professors. The Library consisted originally of 2,436 admirably selected volumes; to-day it possesses about 50,000. The Observatory was never completed and soon fell into ruins. To-day Mount Jefferson is crowned by an observatory building unrivalled for excellence of constructive details, and containing a telescope which surpasses in power and perfection that attached to any University in the world. The Lick Observatory has a merely nominal connection with the University of California. There was no Laboratory of any sort in the University for the training of students. To-day the Chemical Laboratory, the Physical Laboratory and the Biological Laboratory are each filled with appliances for illustration and for study and scientific research. The only Museum was a collection of curiosities. To-day the Museum of Industrial Chemistry exemplifies all the principal applications of Chemistry to the Arts, and the Museum of Natural History illustrates all branches of that subject. SANITARY APPLIANCES. On two occasions in the history of the University its doors have been closed by explosions of the malady characteristic of the Piedmont region—typhoid fever. The tragical story of these epidemics is made more pathetic by the fact that the wisest physicians of the day were profoundly ignorant of the causes of the malady and unable to prevent its recurrence. One of the great triumphs of modern medicine has been the detection of the causes and the discovery of the remedy. Acting upon this discovery the University has provided for itself a copious supply of the purest water, conducted in underground pipes from a mountain reservoir five miles distant; has put in a complete system of impervious sewers which convey all excreta and human wastes at once from the premises; removes all kitchen wastes daily from the buildings; permits no horses nor cattle within the precincts, and in all things exercises a scrupulous cleanliness. The result is, that since these precautions have been taken, no case of typhoid or dysentery has originated within the precincts of the University. Perseverance in them may be relied on to eliminate these two grave dangers to public health in this region. The situation of the University ensures it at the same time against malarial maladies. So that its sanitary condition seems to be as good as human care and foresight can make it. DISCIPLINE. In August, 1828, Thomas Arnold entered upon his duties as head master of Rugby school, and began those reforms in school management that have shed over his name the lustre of immortality. Ten years earlier, in August, 1818, Thomas Jefferson met the Commission, appointed to select the site and draft the plan of organization of the University of Virginia, and then laid down the cardinal doctrine upon which Arnold afterwards based his work—that "after a certain age fear is not a motive, to which we should have ordinary recourse in academical government, but that the human character is susceptible of other inducements to correct conduct more worthy of employ and of better effect." Upon this foundation stone the system of discipline of the University is built. Those futile endeavors to secure a monastic seclusion, those degrading efforts to practice an effective espionage over the students, which have been for centuries the opprobrium of collegiate life, were from the beginning discarded. The student is treated as a rational human being whose interests and desires concur in persuading him to reap the benefits for which he pays. He is encouraged to become the friend of his preceptors, and receiving their confidence to give his in return. His word is accepted as absolute truth, and testimony when given by him is always voluntary and not upon oath. Regular and orderly attendance upon his lectures, with satisfactory progress in his class work, is regarded by the Faculty as the index of upright conduct and sober living on his part. Any failure in these particulars brings the student at once under the attention of the authorities. He is first admonished by his professors. If no reform is made he is reproved by the Chairman and a report of his deficiencies made to his friends at home. If he is still obdurate he is required promptly to withdraw from the University. The penalties of dismissal and of public expulsion are reserved for such offences as drunkenness, dissoluteness and dishonorable conduct. What are the results of this government by influence? They are not perfect. But who has devised a system for the government of four hundred young men which gives perfect results! Yet the method of the University has rendered possible the introduction of the honor system in the examinations, in which each man is allowed to guarantee the honesty of his work by his personal pledge. It has established a reverence for truthfulness and personal integrity so great that no man who is known to have violated either the one or the other can remain a member of the University. And finally it has received the compliment of unacknowledged imitation (at least as to outward form) from those who have been its most interested and most unsparing critics. FRUITS OF UNIVERSITY CULTURE. If we enquire into the results of University training we find again the fairest answer in a simple statement of facts. Of the professors in the colleges, and universities of Virginia, 32 are Alumni of the University of Virginia; of 5 judges of the Court of Appeals, 4 are University men; of the judges of the Circuit Courts the University has furnished 7; and like results may be pointed to in every department of intellectual activity. During the past session (1887-88) of her 391 matriculates 242 were from Virginia; and of those there were 61 students of law, 42 of medicine, 16 of engineering, and 25 were teachers in the public schools of the State. Nor is it in Virginia alone that the results of her culture have been felt. In every Southern State her alumni occupy honorable stations on the bench, on the bar, in the medical profession, in the professoriate, in the pulpit. In her first sixty years she has educated wholly or in part 2665 lawyers, 2504 physicians, 688 teachers, 340 clergymen. Among her alumni have been 395 legislators, 179 judges, 62 congressmen, 6 governors, 2 cabinet ministers, 2 Speakers of the House of Representatives. Her children are her jewels! Railway Facilities. NO COUNTY in Virginia has better facilities for transportation. The Chesapeake and Ohio, east and west, and the Virginia Midland north and south, give every portion of the county; excellent facilities for shipping, while the southern limits of the county are served by the Richmond and Alleghany. The Chesapeake and Ohio and the Virginia Midland form a junction at Charlottesville, the centre of the county, (where is located the handsomest and best Union depot in Virginia), thus affording our citizens direct and competing through communication with the vast net work of railways which cover this country from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the Gulf to Maine. Our county roads are already in good conditions, but the work of improvement, which was begun years ago, will go on until our highways are unsurpassed. We are next door, so to speak, to all the good markets of the seaboard, and in the centres of dense population. Grapes and all perishable fruiis, gathered in the afternoon, can be placed on the stands in New York by 6 o'clock the following morning, and other markets can be reached with equal promptness. Express is received and forwarded by every passenger train; we have four mails daily from Washington and the north, and three each day from Richmond and from Louisville and the West. These facilities of communication enable the shipper to keep posted as to the conditions of the markets. Freight can be shipped via Virginia Midland to Washington, the shipper having the choice of routes from the national capital; or by way of Chesapeake and Ohio to Waynesboro, thence north by the Shenandoah Valley, or to Staunton, and continued north by the Baltimore and Ohio; or to Hanover Junction, and thence by the Richmond and Fredericksburg to Washington; or by the Chesapeake and Ohio to Richmond, and thence by York River road to destination; or to Newport News to the north and by water to New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Providence or Europe, or other foreign countries. Going west, freight will be sent via the Chesapeake and Ohio to Cincinnati, and thence by any route to other western cities. Going south and southwest, by Virginia Midland to Lynchburg, thence by Norfolk and Western to destination by way of Bristol; or to Danville and thence by Richmond and Danville to destination; or by the Chesapeake and Ohio to Waynesboro, thence by Shenandoah Valley to Norfolk and Western; or to Richmond and thence by Richmond and Danville and Coast Line to destination. A reference to any railroad map will at once show these advantages and substantiate our claim of superiority over other counties.</field>

B. WOODS. Its Advantages. CHARLOTTESVILLE, the county-seat of Albemarle, is the most populous, prosperous and progressive city in this section of the State. In speaking of Charlottesville, the first inclination is to revert to its past history; and this impulse is almost irresistible, for the record of its sons both merits and receives the praise and admiration of the whole country and points out a line worthy of emulation by all who desire to make a name for history or to do an act which will lighten the burdens of posterity. Great explorers, learned jurists and eminent statesmen and patriots have hailed from its ancient precincts, and the impressions they have left on the institutions of our country are destined to be as lasting as liberty itself. These things have their place; it is not here, however; and while they cannot be forgotten, yet for the present, at least, we must "let the dead past bury its dead," and in considering only questions of material progress and advantage, look alone to the prosperity of the future and point out the advancement promised us "if we weary not in well doing." Located at an elevation of four hundred and fifty feet; surrounded by the beautiful Blue Ridge and its sub-ranges of mountains, Charlottesville enjoys celebrity for its lovely landscape scenery. Its climate is dry and healthy, susceptible to no sudden changes, with sometimes a few days of severe winter weather, and only a short term of disagreeable summer heat accompanied, however, invariably with cool and pleasant nights. In order for healthfulness to be sure and perfect, the natural advantages of location and climate must be supplemented by abundant pure water and perfect drainage. Until lately the town was supplied with water by wells only, and the need of a better accommodation, in this respect, was greatly felt, but the want has now been met by the establishment of an unequalled system of water-works; leading from pure mountain streams, and furnishing a supply sufficient for the greatest demand. The site of the city is on ground undulating gently, yet sufficiently to afford a most excellent system of natural drainage. In view of these advantages, therefore, it is hardly necessary to say that the place ranks high for healthfulness, so much so that the city and surrounding country are usually well supplied, especially during the summer, with temporary sojourners, who come for rest and relaxation and with a view to recuperate their health and strength. In addition to this the superior educational facilities, together with the refinement and hospitality of its people, concur in making this an eminently desirable place of residence; and, consequently, among our population are numbered many, in independent circumstances, who, as strangers sought out this point as possessing all the attractions which unite in marking out a place as desirable for a home. This is an old town but a new city, having been chartered by the last legislature under a city government going into effect July 1, 1888; its growth, has always been healthy, natural and on a sound and steady basis. While our progress has not been artificial, neither has it, of late, been slow. In 1880 the population was 2,676, now it is 5,530 with suburbs of at least 1,000 more. Personal property in 1888 $ 585,260 Personal property in 1880 295,217 Increase 289,943 Real estate in 1888 1,216,012 Real estate in 1880 723,953 Increase 482,159 Our merchants, as a rule, are successful, many of them having accumulated comfortable furtunes. Their retail trade extends into six counties and the jobbing trade has also assumed considerable proportions; this, however, is a comparatively new departure, but the success it has attained is a guarantee of future progress. Manufacturing enterprises are also prosperous and increasing both in numbers and capital. The demand for houses, especially small ones, has kept far ahead of the supply, and as another sign of the times there may be mentioned among recent improvements and new enterprises—a street railway, electric lights, baking powder company, new gas plant, water works, ice factory, wire and picket fence company, sash, door and blind factory, bottling works, two new cigar factories, as well as many smaller enterprises, all of which are in successful operation. To show still further the natural growth of our city we publish the figures (in round numbers) of building operations for the past few years: 1885 96,000 1886 112,000 1887 150,000 And in addition to these sums, there has been expended for water works, street railway, new gas plant and electric light plant, nearly $200,000. The accomplishment of these results is not to be attributed to accident, the causes are adequate and well defined, and the powers which developed them are capable of distinct analysis and definite determination. The causes which operate to build up cities are both natural and artificial, the forces of nature are irresistible and they are moreover at work while man sleeps, and if he but supplies the intelligence and enterprise to subordinate and utilize them all the conditions of a high and complete developement are fulfilled, and where they are both combined in the largest degree, there the greatest results are found. The progress which Charlottesville has attained is to be attributed largely to the former causes; developement has never been forced, and new enterprises have not been started until forced forward by demand; and when it is considered that it has attained its present state of prosperity under these conditions, and that the community is now fully alive to the great advantages we possess and that man's intelligence, vigilance and enterprise is supplementing the wealth and opportunity that nature has so lavishly supplied, the future of our city is bright. The people are aroused by a spirit of enterprise and progressiveness, they are united in their efforts towards public improvement and are determined in a common purpose to co-operate with the favorable conditions which surround them, to develope the raw material, multiply the manufactories, add to the activity of trade and thus increase the aggregation of population, prosperity and wealth. Domestic capital as well as domestic enterprise is devoted to these objects, but encouragement and assistance is also largely sought away from home. Only a brief retrospect need here be given of those advantages which Charlottesville possesses to give it a place among the most favored cities of Virginia as a desirable location for successful business undertakings. Manufacturing is to be considered as among the most potent factors in developing the resources of a country, and it is with a view to this, therefore, that a consideration of our advantages will mainly be directed. Among the first and most important elements of successful manufacturing is a good supply of raw material, in easy access. The limits of this article forbid any detailed mention of the abundant resources with which nature has freely supplied our community; however, a careful perusal of this book will show that either in agricultural products, minerals woods or fruits, we have an abundant supply easily available and susceptible of profitable manipulation. Next in importance, doubtless, is the question of labor, and it may safely be predicted that the community which can give assurance to the manufacturer of satisfaction and freedom from trouble in this regard has a large advantage and offers a great inducement for the importation of outside capital and new ideas. In this respect, the outlook for the future must be mainly predicated upon the experience of the past, and when it is discovered that we have an advantage a reason should be sought which will explain it. A considerable proportion of our population is composed of the laboring classes. They are provident, frugal and ambitious; many of them own their own houses, and consequently are happy and contented in the contemplation of the reward of their industry and economy; and those who have not been so fortunate are emulating the example of their more successful neighbors. They are intelligent and easily trained to new vocations; reasonable in their demands, requiring only fair and honorable treatment, and when this is accorded them they freely share with their employers, if need be, the misfortunes of an adverse season; the results from these characteristics are that while other communities are harassed by strikes, lock-outs and dissensions, we know of them only by name. These attributes are to be applied to the white and colored laborers alike, and all grades should be included, from the skilled mechanic to those who carry the hod. While our community claims pre-eminence for these characteristics of the laboring classes, it is but fair to say, that they prevail, to a large degree, throughout the whole South, where colored labor is extensively employed and is to be traced to the civilizing and improving influences of former institutions, under which the servants and laborers, though slaves in name, Albemarle Female Institute, Charlottesville, Va. were really like members of the master's family, and were always ambitious of imitating and acquiring the refinement which they saw around them; and, although, these institutions have passed away, this is one of the good results which remain as a lasting blessing, especially to those in whom the qualities referred to have become so strongly rooted as to partake of the nature of instinct. The superiority of our white laboring classes is to be attributed to a very great extent to the educational advantages of our community. Education is the great civilizer of the world, and wherever it prevails in the greatest degree there its best effects are felt, and whether it be applied directly to a given individual or only indirectly to him from an observation of its cultivating and refining effects on his neighbors, its good results are apparent, and the fact that it is in the reach of all, even though it be not taken advantage of, tends to create a desire for self-improvement. The schools are free to the laborers' sons, and even the University of Virginia, which is located here, and is the head of our free school system, affords practically free tuition to any white, native or adopted Virginian, of whatever walk in life, who is sufficiently ambitious to undertake its arduous studies, and the sons of the laboring classes find themselves on equality there with the sons of any in the land. This institution has been the means of raising to eminence many of humble parentage, and the success of each such aspirant has awakened ambition in many a younger heart, and caused even the elders to "put their best foot forward." As an educator, however, still greater good results from the Miller Manual Labor School of Albemarle, and for the purposes now in hand it need only be said that this institution combines an advanced academic education with a practical mechanical training, both united with the advantages of moral instruction and home influence, under the supervision of skilled and efficient teachers; it gives free education, maintenance and support to the white boys and girls of Albemarle county. The requisite for their admission being that they are "poor." With these advantages the laboring classes of Albemarle county would be untrue to themselves if they could not boast of superiority in all respects over their fellows whose lot is cast amid more unfavorable surroundings. And these are cited therefore as some of the reasons why we claim superiority over other communities for our laboring classes, and not only do these things awaken becoming sentiments of pride, but they are looked upon as advantages enabling us to outstrip other communities in the race of material progress, and to acquire an eminence which cannot be attained by other places, on which providence and the acts of man have been less favorable in bestowing their blessings. The questions as to available raw material and labor being provided for the next important inquiry is as to facilities for motive power and in this respect Charlottesville takes rank with the most favored communities. Our situation is near the large and productive coal fields of West Virginia, so that this fuel is easily available in large quantities and at small cost. The superiority of our gas works has directed public attention somewhat in the line of using gas engines. At $1.50 per 1,000 feet, the cost of motive power, would be less than ten cents per hour, per horse power. This is the rate at which gas is sold to the consumers for illumination, to manufactures a more reduced cost could even now be guaranteed, and with any reasonable prospect of a demand such as would justify the production of a lower grade of gas for manufacturing purpose, greater reduction in price could be secured. The rapid development of the powers of electricity has been thought by some to justify the belief that by its application there will be wrought many revolutions still more startling than those which are already known—its use and economy for motive power is already well established, and our Electric Light Company are urging its adoption for manufacturing purposes. The proposition is already under consideration to apply it to the street car line, as well as for other purposes, and the adoption of electric motors is a project which is liable to be attended by rapid development and greatly encourage manufacturing enterprises. These sources of motive power, with the exception of cheap coal and wood, are mainly artificial, and such as other communities can compete in to some extent, but even in the matter of gas and electricity the question of cheap coal is an element of greatest importance, and one which enables us to have the advantage of other places where coal is more expensive. But passing from the artificial to the natural source of motive power, it is seen that our city is again blessed with an abundant advantage in this respect. Available water power is indeed a great criterion by which to determine as to the probable success of manufacturing undertakings—for not only does it, by being directly applied, furnish the cheapest source of power yet discovered, but also, by competing with other sources of power it causes their cost to be reduced. In an undulating country, such as ours, the course of the streams must in many places be interspersed with falls and rapids. The Rivanna River runs near the limits of the city for several miles, at distances varying from half a mile upwards. It is this stream that furnishes the power for the Charlottesville Woolen Mills (one of the most successful woolen mills in the country). For several miles the river and the line of the Chesapeake and Ohio railway take a parallel course, and at a point where the two diverge, some three and a half miles from Charlottesville, is the site of an old cotton mill, which in ante bellum times was successfully operated. The power at this point can nowhere be surpassed. It was formerly utilized by Thomas Jefferson, whose genius was not only philosophical but also extremely practical, and he recognized it as a situation valuable for industrial developments. The location still has the name with many of "Jefferson's old mill." This power which is now owned by J. Massie Smith, Esq., was surveyed in 1874 by an eminent hydraulic engineer, and its value cannot be illustrated better than by an extract from his report: "This property, located upon both sides of the Rivanna river, commands the water right of the entire stream. The water flows directly from the pond into the canal on north side of the river, with a cross section of twenty feet at bottom, thirty-two feet at water's surface and four feet deep. Having a grade of one foot to the mile from pond to the mills, the water slopes of the canal in cross section are one and a half to one. The difference of level between the surface of the water in Shadwell pond and surface of tail water at the mills is twenty and a half feet; deducting the draw at forebays and the grade from dam to mills leaves a head and fall of nineteen and a half feet for turbine wheel, and nineteen fee for overshot. The capacity of the canal is 400 horse power, and this susceptible of being increased to any extent commensurate with the heaviest demand. The amount of water afforded by the river is abundant also to furnish a like supply to a canal on south side of river with same fall as that obtained on north side." Further up the stream in an opposite direction from the city, are other falls capable of furnishing an almost equal amount of power—notably among them is "Hotopp's rapids,' at a distance of two and a half miles from the depot; in fact, the whole course of the river for many miles affords desirable mill sites, the only requisite being that the upper dams should be far enough removed from the lower to avoid the "back water," but no other points are specifically mentioned because we are now considering only such as are tributary and easily available to Charlottesville. Moore's creek, which empties into the Rivanna near the Woolen Mills, has its course for several miles at a distance from half a mile to a mile from the city. At some points it is already occupied by mills. Only one location will now be mentioned as possessing many preëminent advantages. On the road to "Monticello," at a point about half a mile from the depot in Charlottesville, there could be built a factory which would have the advantages of vicinity to the city and easy access over a macadamized road. The dam could be constructed at a point where the banks are high and steep, being no more than twenty feet apart, and then gradually widen out, making a natural bank for the confinement of a great body of water. The elevation above the mill site is so great that almost any amount of power which may be desired could be obtained. Cochran's Mill, Sinclair's Mill, Hartman's Mill and Maury's Mill, where the power is already occupied, will not be mentioned more specifically than to state that they are situated from one to two miles from Charlottesville, respectively, and that their power is capable of being very much developed. In this feature of the subject there remains but one more point to be mentioned. Among the material advantages of our city our system of water works is unsurpassed. The reservoir, covering thirty acres, is situated six miles from the city in the Ragged Mountains; contains 194,000,000 gallons, and is supplied by two streams of considerable size. The engineer who superintended its construction calculated that if these streams could be diverted and not a drop added to the supply of water it would take upwards of twelve months to run it dry. It is 156 feet from the bottom to the highest point of town, and the pressure in the city ranges from 75 to 90 pounds to the square inch. Comment on these facts is needless to show the amount of power which can be evolved by means of "water motors," some of them are already in operation, and the many advantages they possess are too obvious for detailed mention. Our excellent railroad facilities are elaborated in another part of this book, and need not be further mentioned here. Thus many of the advantages for material progress which Charlottesville possesses have been detailed; there are others which space forbids us to mention. Nature has done its part well for us—the retarding influences of former institutions have passed away, old prejudices have been numbered with the things of the past; in the swing of the pendulum of time the progress and development of the resources of the South have been behind, the limit, however, has been reached and the movement now is forward and onward; the old South is recorded in history, the new South is a thing of the present and the future; its progress and advancement are inevitable, all the favorable elements concur, the unfavorable have ceased to exist. History is said to repeat itself and this maxim is as true as history itself. In the past record of our country the tide of emigration was turned towards our beautiful and productive Southland. Instinctively almost its advantages were known and the whole course of progress, development and improvement was in this direction, and especially towards Virginia. Circumstances, which no longer exist, however, concurred to turn the tide and the "Great West" came into notice—the Great West, with its snow storms and its blizzards, its freezing winters and oppressive summers, where the struggle for existence is made harder than should be by the opposition of the elements! These things have had their effect and now the eyes of many are turned with longing anticipation of removal to the South. The West, the East, the North vie with each other in their efforts for enlightenment and information. All that is needed is that they should know the facts, and they are rapidly learning them. The desire of human nature to combine the most comforts and greatest happiness and contentment while fighting out the stern battle of life, is irresistible. With us the elements of this combination exists in their most perfect degree. We offer these inducements, and will say that we need immigration, our farms are too large, our population is too sparse, our resources are as yet undeveloped. There is room and abundance for all, we want new ideas of progress to encourage us in our developments, new capital, new industries; and all may be assured that they will find a welcome, what is known as "a real old Virginia welcome." Come and see for yourselves. We cordially invite your personal inspection. D. Harmon, Jr. Scottsville Township. THE large township of Scottsville occupies the southern portion of the county of Albemarle and reaches from the banks of the James river to within a short distance of Charlottesville. The town of Scottsville is situated on the north bank of the James, and whilst it is in the county of Albemarle, it is on the borders of Fluvanna, and Buckingham is on the other side of the river, both of these counties contributing to the trade of Scottsville. The Richmond and Alleghany railroad passes through the southern part of the county for over twelve miles, and takes the place of the old James river and Kanawha canal. The train service is very good, there being three passenger trains each way during the day. Scottsville is the starting point for the local traffic on the line and thus obtains greater accommodation than any place further from Richmond. The picturesque character of the country is well known, comprising mountain as well as river scenery, being in what is called the Midland section of the State, and it is much resorted to in summer by city people for its pleasant breezes and cool shades as well as its convenient distance from Richmond, only seventy-nine miles. Scottsville is situated in the centre of a district noted for many fine farms, its uplands and especially its river low grounds being unsurpassd in fertility by any in the world. All ordinary farm crops are produced with excellent success, grand crops of corn and tobacco, as well as timothy and clover, and grape-growing and orcharding have taken permanent hold in the district. The whole country is well watered, there being actually a spring in every field, and visitors rarely fail to notice the brightness and purity of the water. There are in Scottsville good graded and other schools, six churches, with several more in the country near—grain and grist mills, banking house, and all the facilities of a country town, including four mails in and the same number out each day, two being to Richmond morning and evening, one westward and one service north daily via North Garden, on the Virginia Midland railroad. For a considerable period before the opening of the Chesapeake and Ohio railroad, Scottsville possessed a large trade and was the shipping point on the old canal for all produce grown this side of the mountains as far back even as Staunton, and many will remember seeing wagon trains a mile long laden with wheat, corn or tobacco, and other produce destined for Richmond, and which rarely turned homeward until a goodly supply of groceries and dry goods had been bought in the then prosperous Scottsville. Her woolen mills produced goods of well known excellent quality, and the Confederate soldiers were largely supplied with clothing from its looms, but Sheridan in a raid laid waste the town and gave it a blow from which it is only now promising to recover. The James River Valley Fair was organized in Scottsville in the year 1883, and it has each year ever since been a great source of pleasure and profit to thousands of the people for miles around. Although the usual attractions of horse racing, games, music and public speaking have annually formed part of its programme, the fair has depended mainly for its success upon its exhibition of horses, cattle, sheep, poultry, fruit, vegetables, farm produce, ladies' work, both fancy and domestic, manufactures and other things usually forming part of this kind of enterprise. Under the stimulus of premiums offered by the association 100 to 103 bushels of corn have been raised per acre, and 35 to 37 bushels of wheat. Each year there has been a marked improvement in the farm produce exhibited, and the greatly superior quality of the corn shown last year bears ample testimony to the great benefit which is being wrought by the fair. J. L. Moon, of Scottsville, real estate agent, will cheerfully answer any information in regard to lands in this section. Moral Agencies. WE HAVE invited attention to our climate, soils, minerals, manufacturing opportunities, &amp;c. These advantages represent the strictly business features of life in Albemarle. There is another feature, perhaps the most important of all, to which the reader of this book of sketches is pointed—our settled society, our excellent schools, and our churches of every denomination, embracing all the faiths of devout Jew or religious Gentile. These churches are large, and to them and our Y. M. C. As. is due a large measure of the correct morality which distinguishes our citizens. Besides, there are five Masonic lodges, one chapter of Royal Arch Masons, one commandery of Knights Templar, one Odd Fellows' lodge, several lodges of Good Templars, Knights of Honor, Legion of Honor, Royal Arcanum, and numerous other societies. In short, the intending settler may be sure that when he comes to Albemarle he will not find himself in a wilderness or his lot cast among unrefined or irreligious people; nor will he be compelled to wait for the country to grow up.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">MONTICELLO WINE CO. This company was chartered and organized in 1873 by pioneers in grape culture in Albemarle county. Encountering the prejudices which prevailed against native wines—a prejudice not then wholly unjust, for a uniform standard of character and quality had not been fixed—it met with little encouragement. The Company struggled on (with the advantages of proper cellar facilities and experienced foreign manipulators) in an honest effort to make a full-blooded, honest grape-juice wine, with no admixtures or deleterious compounds, and has gradually worked its way up to a recognition of true merit. In 1878, at the request of the U. S. Agricultural Department, this Company sent, under the charge of that department, twelve bottles of their six kinds of wine for the international exposition at Paris, France. Other sections of the United States were represented there by pyramids of artistically exhibited wines, yet the final result was that seven medals were awarded to the still wines of the United States; of these the Monticello was the only one awarded a silver medal, the others being bronze—not one of which was obtained by California. Not to mention numerous awards by State and local fairs successively given this Company in open competition, it was, 1884-'85, at the New Orleans international exhibit with three cases sent at a venture, awarded two first-class medals. The true character of its wines and pure grape brandy is, probably, best illustrated by its public appreciation, by private consumers, who send their orders direct for these recognized to be pure, full-blooded wines. This company does not claim cheapness. It offers, at figures so reasonable as to be accessible to all, well-matured, pure fermented grape wine. Imported wine, of similar good quality, would cost double the price. It does not claim to produce the equals of the Grand Vins of Europe. Taking price and character into consideration, it does claim a quality at half the price of that imported, when of similar character. The white wines are Delaware, Sautern Nature; Dry Catawba, sui generis (see Longfellow's poem); while the red wines are Norton's Virginia, Burgundy character; Cynthiana, first-class among the red wines at the Vienna Exposition in 1876; Clinton, aged, a superior claret; Extra Claret, superior character; Ives Seedling, ruby colored claret; Virginia Claret, sound, plain table wine; pure grape brandy, three summers old. For an extended notice of the character and quality of these wines see pages 51-62 of this Handbook. Send for analyses and price list, and all orders direct to Company. Prompt attention and lowest figures according to quality. Address MONTICELLO WINE CO., or, OSCAR REIERSON, Sec., Charlottesville, Virginia.</field>
