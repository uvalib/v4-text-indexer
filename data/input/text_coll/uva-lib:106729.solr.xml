      <field name="fulltext">UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA RECORD Vol. 1 Charlottesville, Va., December, 1907 No. 4 The University of Virginia Record is published monthly, except July and August, for the purpose of disseminating information regarding the University, its organization, activities, and growth. The Record is intended primarily for the alumni and friends of the Institution and for the press of the State, but will be sent to any address upon receipt of the subscription price, 25 cents a year. Second-class postage rates have been applied for. Student Self-Help at the University of Virginia. Toward the end of last session (1906-7), President Alderman sent a letter of inquiry to each of the seven hundred and fifty or more men in college, with a view to ascertaining how many were making their own way through the University; by what means or methods they were doing so; and by what procedure on his part or on the part of others such men could be most properly and effectively aided. The following summary will give a fair idea of the conditions existing, as revealed by the investigation. Out of a total enrollment of 786 students replies were received from 347, or about 45 per cent. 1. a. Are you doing any sort of work that helps you to meet your expenses at the University of Virginia? b. What sort of work? c. What do you receive for it? a. 60 affirmative. b. Teaching and assistance, 29; clerical work, 7; preaching, 5; miscellaneous, 18. c. Of the 38 reporting amounts, the total was $11,780 and the average $310. 2. a. Are you living on money that you earned by your own labor before coming to the University? b. To what extent does this earned money aid you? c. By what sort of labor was it procured? a. 88 affirmative. b. Of the 36 reporting amounts, the total is $9,547 and the average $264. c. Teaching, 30; clerical work, 21; engineering, 9; farming, 6; business, 5; miscellaneous, 17. (Two or more kinds often reported by same student.) 3. a. Did you have to borrow money to come to the University? b. If so, to what extent? a. 59 affirmative. b. Of the 49 reporting amounts, the total was $16,720 and the average $341. 4. a. Did you have to ask for credit in the payment of your University fees? b. If so, to what extent? c. Do you expect to return this money by your own labor? a. 42 affirmative (not including payments delayed until further in session). b. Of the 21 reporting amounts, the total was $1,908 and the average $90. c. 28 affirmative; 3 negative. 5. Can you give your total estimated expenses for this session? Do not include in this item your traveling expenses and clothes. Reports from 291 students averaged $496. (Charlottesville students and married students omitted. Reports varied as to items included.) 6. Do you desire work next session and if so, what kind are you willing to do? 103 affirmative. Anything not conflicting with studies, 53. Assistant positions in connection with studies, etc., 27. Clerical or stenographic work, 10; teaching, 10; preaching, 3. 7. It is your purpose to make your vacation of financial value? 188 affirmative. (Graduates who stated they were entering upon practice of profession, omitted in count.) 8. Miscellaneous kinds of work done by students for self-help: a. While at the University. Agent for Collier's Weekly, sales agent, engineer, field work, work on College Topics, handling stereopticon, clearing cemetery, tending cows and horses, packing cigars, writing law notes, writing for magazines, farming, newspaper reporter, Y. M. C. A. work, miscellaneous kinds of work, 2; total, 16. b. Before coming to the University. Hospital steward, medicine, dentistry, druggist 2, time-keeper in Smelting Co., work in tobacco factory, rural mail carrier, U. S. deputy collector, chauffeur, sailing yachts, telegraph operator, express agent, osteopath, miscellaneous, 2; total, 17. A slight inspection of the foregoing summary reveals some rather interesting facts. Using the averages given as a basis of computation, the following totals are obtained. The 60 workers earned last year, $18,600 The 88 men earned before coming to the University, $23,232 The 59 borrowers borrowed $20,119 The 207 men who helped themselves by borrowing, by working here at the University, or by working before they came, helped themselves to the amount of $61,951; in round numbers, $62,000. If we conclude, as is quite likely, that some of the same men are found in two or more of the above classes, it only reduces the number of workers, not the total sum earned or assumed to be earned. Moreover, it is quite probable that a considerable number of students who were earning at least part of their own expenses, did not make any report:âare to be found among the 439 that did not reply to the letter of inquiry. Hence one may be safe in the approximation, that over 200 of our students last yearâmore than 25 per cent.âdid some kind of work either after or before they came here, or assumed obligations to be discharged after leaving here, in order to attend the University. All of this shows an encouraging situstion. It shows that many young men are still willing to tol for learning. It shows that the number of such young men that seek the University of Virginia is on the increase. It shows that the University of Virginia is no longerâif it ever wasâexclusively a "rich man's school"; though many rich men and many rich men's sons come here, and always will come, because of the attractions of scholarship, traditions, associations, and high honor that belong to the place. It shows that, as President Alderman said at the alumni luncheon in June, "the spirit of practical academic democracy is on the increase." All of this shows one thing moreâor at least makes us think it; that if more opportunities for self-help could in some way be afforded at the University, a still larger number of young menâyoung Virginians especiallyâwould come to help themselves. This is why the President has appointed a committee of six members of the faculty to take counsel and measures toward ways and means for student self-help; and this is why the question is one of vital interest to every thinking man in the State. Lawson and Dethier. Two of the numbers announced for the artists' music course for the session of 1907-8 have already been given, one on October 17, the other on November 19, by Dr. Franklin Lawson, the tenor soloist, and by Edouard Dethier, the Belgian violinist, respectively. Each rendered a program of unusually high character. All who heard them look forward with eagerness to the two remaining entertainments of the series; one on January 13, by Angelo Patricolo, the Italian pianist; the other on February 10, by Madame Maconda, the distinguished soprano. Secretary R. M. Price, who was recently obliged to spend some time in the hospital, is so far improved as to be able to resume the duties of his office. The University and Virginia. With a school of education recently established in the University; with the President and several members of the faculty making specialties of subjects and questions that relate to the public schools of the State; with a member of the faculty on the State Board of Education; and with an indefinite number of other good men in all quarters giving all possible aid and influence toward the co-operation of all educational forces in the State, it would indeed be surprising if the University and Virginia as a whole were not continually profiting more and more fully one from the other. To be brief and more particular, Profs. W. H. Heck and Bruce R. Payne are this session making a special and systematic effort to reach every part of Virginia they possibly can. Prof. Payne, giving his attention especially to the interests of academies, high schools, and colleges, goes out as frequently as his lectures will permit to confer with superintendents, principals, and the various officials of secondary schools. During the past month or two he has visited schools in Northampton, Southampton, and Albemarle counties, as well as others outside of Virginia. Since the middle of October, Prof. Heck, head of the Curry Memorial School of Education in the University, has made addresses in some of the leading towns and cities of Pittsylvania, Loudoun, Fauquier, Augusta, Orange, Appomattox, Albemarle, Nelson, Fairfax, and Roanoke. At present he is giving special consideration, in his addresses and conferences, to hygiene in the public schools. For want of time they cannot respond to all the invitations they receive; but they are nevertheless doing a telling work. Dr. Coles' Gift. Mention was made in the October Record of the gift of a Jefferson bronze bust to the University by Dr. J. Ackerman Coles of New York City. The bust, which is the work of H. Dan. Webster, a nephew of the orator, has just been received, and has been placed on the main floor of the Rotunda. The bronze, which is a striking piece of work, rests on a pedestal of dark green or black granite, constructed in the form of a modified Doric column, about four and a half feet high. The top of the bust rises to a height of about six and a fourth feet. In material, proportion, and general outlines this bust of Jefferson is similar to the bust of Cicero given to the University a few years ago by Dr. Coles. The two handsome pieces of art occupy related positions among the other works of statuary and painting in the library. The new dining hall, which has been made possible for the University through the wisdom of our State legislators, is going to be one of the handsomest buildings on the campas. It will afford accommodations for 250 men at one time, and will strengthen the democratic spirit among the students, while giving substantial protection to their bank accounts. It has long been needed, and it will satisfy many wants. University Teaching Staff. From statistics in the hands of the Secretary, it has been ascertained that the whole number of men at present on the teaching staff of the University of Virginia is 87, classified as follows: 30 professors, one associate professor, 11 adjunct professors, 30 instructors, and 15 assistants. This enumeration does not include the officers of administration,â the President, Secretary, Registrar, and Bursar,âthe two professors emeriti, the librarians and their assistants, or the licentiates in the several departments. Honors for Prof. Noah K. Davis. On October 10, 1907, the Atlanta alumni of Mercer University held a banquet in honor of our Emeritus Professor Noah Knowles Davis, whom they were properly pleased to call Mercer's most distinguished alumnus, and in whose honor a stirring song for the occasion was written. Dr. Davis was a member of the class of 1849. After serving some years as president of Bethel College, Ky., he accepted the chair of moral philosophy at the University of Virginia, where he taught men and inspired whom he taught; at the same time producing a series of textbooks in logic, psychology, and ethics that has probably never been excelled by any other produced in America. His last book, and the one he prizes most, is a life of Christâ"The Story of the Nazarene." At the banquet in his honor Dr. Davis made a speech, as did also ex-Governor W. J. Northen, class of 1853; Justice Beverly D. Evans, class of 1881; ex-Governor Joseph M. Terrell; R. J. Massey, class of 1848; and President S. Y. Jameson of Mercer. Benediction was pronounced by Rev. A. T. Spalding, class of 1851. The University Magazine. The University of Virginia Magazine, for the months of the session already past, has appeared in appropriate and tasteful cover, with contents well in keeping with its long established standards of excellence. Verse, fiction, essays, essays at drama, reviews, and easy-chair chats contribute information and entertainment in a pleasing variety. A series of articles of special value this year appears under the general title, "Some Charming Southern Towns." The first article of the series, a sketch of Charleston, South Carolina, appeared in October; and one after reading it is made to wonder whether the related sketches to follow can possibly surpass it. If they but measure up to equal merit with it, one should be well satisfied. Such articles as this, and such subjects as this, have right to belong to the permanent literature of our country, and entitle the magazine in which they have place to a high rank among our current periodicals. It is not difficult to understand therefore why persons outside of and away from the University find the University magazine worth their attention. While the University has no Department of Theology, nor any denominational affiliation, over five hundred of its alumni (over three per cent. of its total enrollment) have entered the ministry, chiefly of the Episcopal, Presbyterian, Baptist and Methodist churches; a large number of these have served or are serving as missionaries in all parts of the world. Eleven alumni have been made bishops of the Protestant Episcopal Church; one of the Methodist Episcopal Church; and one of the Reformed Episcopal Church. The recently established chair of Biblical History and Literature will afford opportunities for work that will doubtless by appreciated by a constantly increasing number. Calendar for December and January. December, 1907. Thursday, 12âBeginning of First Intermediate Examinations. Monday, 23âEnd of Examinations. Tuesday, 24âBeginning of Christmas Recess. January, 1908. Thursday, 2âEnd of Recess. Friday, 3âResumption of Lectures. The Annual Report of the religious work of the University for the session of 1906-7 has just been received from the printer. The neat pamphlet contains a cut of Madison Hall, lists of officers and committees, reports of the Endowment Fund, the Chapel services, etc. Copies may be obtained by enclosing stamp for postage to Dr. H. M. McIlhany. On the evening of November 14 President and Mrs. Alderman gave a reception at their residence to the professors, instructors, and assistants of the University, with their wives, as well as to a number of other persons of the University community and the city of Charlottesville.</field>
