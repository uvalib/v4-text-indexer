      <field name="fulltext">Fifteenth Annual Report On Historical Collections, University of Virginia Library, For the Year 1944-45 TO understand the pursuit of collecting historical materials, both manuscripts and imprints, four parties must be considered. They may regard their activities, under varying circumstances, as hard-headed business or a fascinating game. Certain parties may be intense rivals at one time, or loyal partners at another. Self satisfaction and altruism are often motivating forces that work hand in hand because, whatever the immediate gain or advantage, there is an ultimate cultural objective that cannot honestly be gainsaid. In this perennial pursuit is there a winner? And if so, are the cards stacked in anyone's favor? Of these four parties, the first is the individual or family whose books and papers have been inherited and perhaps added to by successive generations, but not purposefully "collected" in the usual sense of the term; instead, the manuscripts were "created" by the family and the books acquired more or less incidentally year after year. Such collections represent a primary source of supply of historical materials and the owner is usually a passive party in our game up to a certain point.1 1. The attitude and role of this party in relation to historical collecting by research institutions were discussed in the Fourteenth Annual Report on Historical Collections, University of Virginia Library, for the Year 1943-1944 (University, Va., 1944), pages 1-17. The second party is the private collector who, however he may have begun his acquisitions, usually develops some particular interest—historical, biographical, literary, or bibliographical—with refinements to suit his taste. If he has plentiful funds at his disposal and buys wisely, he may build up a notable library that will become recognized for its specialty. Numerous collections of the sort, it is true, have been amassed at relatively small cost, but private collecting of real significance has become steadily more expensive, and the appetite for rarities, once it is whetted, is not easily satisfied. The third party is an important factor in encouraging this craving, for he is the dealer in books and manuscripts and it is his business to stimulate the market. As middleman he has transactions with the original owner or inheritor of coveted treasures, with the private collector, and with the fourth party in the game, the research library. There is an elemental human trait expressed in all collecting activity, whether it be of buttons or blotters, of French coins or first editions. Man's acquisitiveness is asserted in innumerable ways and the joy of possession breeds the desire to add to what he has already acquired. The origin of one's particular interest in collecting may be entirely obscure or it may be readily explained; but if it involves the kind of objects that have enduring value and if their potential worth as a group is appreciated by the collector, he is not likely to abandon his pursuit as a passing fancy. He finds himself devoting increasing attention to the quest. Thoughtful consideration of its possibilities and varied experience in the game develop his sense of discrimination. Intelligent selection implies an understandng of both relative and absolute values in a field where for most items the competitive market functions in the usual fashion. For certain rarities, however, the intensity of restricted demand is as unpredictable as the highly limited source of supply. The inclination to seek the unusual and the unique evolves naturally from this process of selection. Yet it should be noted that such items are of most significance in relation to others within a definite frame of reference, and the intelligent collector develops more and more consciously a plan of acquisition striving for unity and completeness. If the game has involved some work, it is still most probably an avocation. As an end in itself, it has served a good purpose for the individual. Is this sufficient unto the day and the morrow? Let us consider first the private collector of books, his purpose, and what we are justified in expecting from him. His is a highly individualistic pursuit. If it is primarily a personal matter, the question may be asked why his private business or pleasure should concern anyone outside his own circle of friends and acquaintances. That it does so is of the very nature of the game; indeed, in many instances this interest from without is given encouragement by the collector himself. When the joy of possessing books becomes something more than a hobby and he sets a new goal for his ambition in terms of completeness or rarity, he seeks the advice of other persons to further his efforts. As his library develops into a collection of some significance, it becomes more widely known and may eventually be recognized as a cultural factor in the world of books and scholarship. The association of valuable private libraries with men of wealth has tended to overemphasize capacity to pay as the primary factor in explaining their evolution. There are nouveaux riches, it is true, who purchase assortments of books at a good round sum on the assumption that the "gentleman's library" makes the gentleman. This attribute of gentility is so falsely and yet so firmly fixed that some custodians of books, with only superficial knowledge about them, enjoy the title of librarian for its respectability. But the book is greater than the man, and there are few collectors who, once they become immersed in the game, do not take it seriously, in spite of accidental or indifferent beginnings. The genuine collector is a bibliophile. He may be a blind lover at times, but experience develops his critical faculty in determining what he wants and what it is worth to him. Whether his means be abundant or meager, the price he pays is not necessarily the measure of his passion nor at the same time a refutation of his sense of relative values. And these values cannot be expressed wholly in monetary terms. The bibliophile who exercises his critical sense becomes a connoisseur and improves his library accordingly. Although he may succumb to bibliomania at the same time, this enjoyable affliction tends to sharpen his wits even as it drives him on to gratify his craving. When the connoisseur has gradually assembled an important collection and begins to ask what use he can make of it beyond the personal pleasure of possession and appreciation of the merit of certain individual volumes, he finds himself on common ground with the scholar. Insofar as book collecting is an expensive pursuit, few scholars can afford to become great private collectors; but whether their own libraries be extensive or limited, most men of learning are concerned chiefly with the creative work made possible by research in such collections. Quite naturally the scholar is inclined to turn first to the library of the research institution for his material, but he has too frequently neglected to seek help from the private collector. The latter likewise needs the expert advice of the scholar. Indeed, the connoisseur may be a potential scholar himself. Even though he goes no further than the field of bibliography in relation to his own library, he can give his earlier efforts new meaning in terms of cultural values.2 2. See, e.g., the printed catalogues of the E. D. Church Collection (1907), the George Wymberley Jones De Renne Collection (1911 and 1931), and the Carl H. Pforzheimer Library (1940). The bibliophile of years ago acquired books chiefly, if not exclusively, because he enjoyed reading and re-reading them. They were the classics of his own country and of others in the ancient and modern world, and such other works as appealed to his peculiar interests. Their contents became a part of him; he cherished them for reading and only secondarily for consulting or taking account of their physical qualities. However, the activity of scholars in uncovering the past and the infiltration of historical consciousness into the minds of intelligent laymen inevitably bring about new interests and broadened standards of value in the world of books. Specialization in collecting follows new courses hitherto neglected or unknown. These are a reflection of discoveries or conclusions in research which direct attention to printed materials now highly appreciated for the first time. A specialized interest in collecting may develop from a shift of emphasis in historical writing and interpretation or even from notable current events which hark back to forgotten sources of the distant or recent past. The works of contemporary literary figures, for example, may arouse interest in writings with the same motif in an earlier period. The quest for books, like all other human occupations and diversions, is susceptible to fads, in imitation or emulation of a new subject or "point" emphasized by an influential collector. Some of these fashions are by-products of the general influences mentioned above, while others can be explained only as expressions of personal whims and mental quirks. Although some private collectors may be criticized for their superficial knowledge of the contents of volumes they have acquired, the intelligent bookman has a lively interest in something more than the contents. Typography, imprint, sequence of material, binding—the technical and artistic features of the book— require some consideration, if only because they have a bearing upon the price. It is not the pecuniary factor, however, that is of primary importance but rather a sufficient understanding of printing and bookmaking to appreciate what distinguishes the fine or unusual volume from the mediocre or run-of-the-mine. To do so depends upon some knowledge of the history of printing, a field which has been studied intensively as well as extensively during the past century. Private collectors provided most of the early incentive for this study with the material they had in their own libraries. The printer's name, place and date of imprint, and typographical details took on new meaning. Notable and representative examples of the evolution of printing from the period of incunabula to recent times have become great desiderata among certain collectors, some of whom proceeded to specialize in the choice imprints of a given printer or region or historical period. In the realm of books, printing and its allied arts may be designated as the universal subject, with innumerable ramifications in its influence upon the scholar, the collector, the printer and publisher, and the general public. There is a strong element of nationalism subconsciously expressed in much of the book collecting along historical lines. For whatever points they may be highly valued, books concerning great political and military events, statesmen and soldiers, are always in demand by their compatriots; only to a limited degree is this true in the case of belles lettres and writings in other fields. The growth of interest in Americana and the steadily broadening scope of that interest well illustrate this point. The rise of nationalism in the United States during the second quarter of the nineteenth century was accompanied by the first attempt to write the history of the young country from colonial days, and to preserve some of the early sources of more than local significance. The increase in national consciousness during the era of economic expansion after the Civil War brought forth a great tide of historical activity, evidenced in part by efforts of numerous individuals to collect Americana, at times with heated rivalry, to take stock of what was accessible, and to compile the data in useful form for reference purposes.3 3. E.g., the monumental Bibliotheca Americana begun by Joseph Sabin. Interest in the printed sources of state and local history ran parallel to this movement. Thus the way was partially prepared for the more critical assessment and acquisition of American imprints in the twentieth century. The activities of the private collector are to a considerable degree a measure of economic and social forces as well as of intellectual influences in a nation or region during any given period. The historian wants to know, in terms of individuals and classes, who assembled libraries, of what character, and for what purpose; what use the owner made of them or allowed other persons to make; and how the books influenced the collector. As one writer on the subject has observed, "We recognize two varieties of collector from all time: the one who confers his name on a library, and the other whose library confers a name on him."4 4. W. Carew Hazlitt, The Book-Collector . . . (London, 1904), page 88. In the latter instance that name is conferred not only because he has built up a collection of cultural significance but more so because he has given others access to it in order to increase the world's knowledge. To carry out this purpose has come to be regarded as a social responsibility almost more than a personal benefaction. The collector's desire to perpetuate his achievement is easily understandable and not unusual. When he gives his library to an appropriate research institution, he accomplishes this end most effectively, for the end thereby becomes a new beginning. And if it is not within his power to pass on his library intact to posterity, its dissolution and reversion to the market in lots or individual items provide pleasure anew for another generation of collectors. He who acquires books always with the idea of unity of the collection in mind develops the greatest library, whatever his principal and collateral interests may be. Books attain their maximum significance in relation to one another and a tome exceptionally rare is no exception to this general rule. These points are fundamental, perhaps not too obvious to warrant emphasis, and they are applicable to the field of manuscripts as well as to imprints. For the problems of intelligent collecting in these two fields are similar in some respects, though very different in others. The connoisseur-collector gives priority to manuscripts written by famous men or associated directly with historic events. The holograph which meets both of these conditions delights him most. He is especially attracted by the personal element conveyed in the letter or document handwritten, dated, and signed. The scarcity of the autograph of a less distinguished person may provide at times the chief incentive to the collector in striving to reach his peculiar objective. His specialized interest is of such a nature that he usually acquires manuscripts individually rather than in organically related groups; hence the product of his endeavor has an artificial character about it that the scholar deplores on several counts. The historian in his study of men and events also seeks certain manuscript records of special value, but they are important to him not as segregated rarities but in relation to innumerable other documents that have a bearing upon his research problem. A body of papers examined in their original order of arrangement may reveal more than the sum total of the individual items rearranged or divorced from one another. When their organic unity is destroyed the question of provenance is difficult, if not impossible, to determine. Unlike printed books, each manuscript, with few exceptions, is the only original and can seldom be replaced or restored to the proper location where it has the greatest historical value. Thus it is evident that while the private collector saves many manuscripts from destruction on the one hand, the nature of his selection often destroys some of their intangible worth on the other. This contradictory state of affairs is best illustrated by the most popular brand of collecting—autographs. A recent writer on the subject of autographs urges that collectors give due attention to unity and content of material because as custodians of historic treasures they have an obligation to posterity. This advice is all to the good as an effort to improve the quality of such collections and make them less fragmentary. He observes, however, that "the radical, the extreme always command attention,"5 5. Thomas F. Madigan, Word Shadows of the Great: the Lure of Autograph Collecting (New York, 1930), pages 44, 50. which is something less than the historian asks for in his research in manuscripts. Autograph collecting like book collecting has its fads and amusing bypaths, as shown in the zeal for complete sets of autographs of the signers of the Declaration of Independence— a fashion that prevailed during most of the nineteenth century.6 6. See Lyman C. Draper, "Autographs of Signers of the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution," Wisconsin Historical Society, Collections, X (1888), 373-449. Those sets which have remained intact contain some letters of great historical value, but the sets themselves are little more than curiosities today. It was a fashion which incidentally gave the Georgia worthy, Button Gwinnett, some posthumous national repute by reason of his excessively rare signature. To the private collector of manuscripts let us give sufficient credit where credit is due for what he has preserved within the limits of his individual interest and intelligence. What has been said above concerning the objectives of the most notable collectors of printed works likewise applies in the manuscript field and these collectors are often the same persons. In assembling their materials they develop a program embracing a subject or period broader than the great men and events pertaining thereto; and their chief purpose, like that of Henry E. Huntington or Tracy W. McGregor, has been to make the records accessible for productive scholarship and cultural advancement. The dealer in books and manuscripts has been designated as the third party in the game of collecting. He is both blessed and cursed for what he does and for what he does not. Although profit-making may not be his sole aim, he is a business man and surely he cannot remain in business if he operates "in the red." He will point out that the risks are great, the supply is uncertain, a large portion of the demand is variable, and the margin of profits depends upon a rapid turn-over of his inventory, some of which never actually becomes stock on hand. In performing his function (and service) as middleman he is often an object of attack, for someone is perennially advocating elimination of the middleman from our capitalistic society. The dealer is an elusive fellow at times, not found in his store regularly from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M. but turning up elsewhere as confidential agent, or advising a good customer on some forthcoming opportunity for purchase, or bibulously talking shop with curators of books and manuscripts behind the scenes of historical conventions. His best business is highly individualized. His stock-in-trade involves a mastery of detail. Even the most intelligent dealer needs many years' experience to establish his reputation not only as a business man but, like the private collector, as a connoisseur. In fact, some dealers are such bibliophiles that they succumb to collecting "for keeps" themselves. This mingling of commercial and cultural interests, of vocation and avocation, is also revealed in the bibliographical excellence of certain dealers' printed catalogues. In establishing and maintaining contacts with the sources of supply of books and manuscripts the dealer provides two services at a price. He saves great quantities of valuable material from destruction by the owners who in many instances are unaware of any other means of disposal, and he makes this material available on the market for buyers whose demands cannot be conveniently met otherwise. With regard to the service performed by preservation at the source, he may select for purchase only those items he judges to be marketable, whereas the representative of a research library would make a broader choice or take the collection as a whole; but it must be remembered that the dealer is engaged in a legitimate business and that institutions have never found a way of covering the field directly. Some of them use the dealer as agent in special cases, thereby acknowledging his usefulness. The private collector might prefer also to satisfy his desires without an intermediary, but generally he finds it necessary as a practical matter to rely on the dealer. There is nothing standardized about the prices of rare books and manuscripts. Figures are seldom quoted before sale because they are determined mostly by private bargaining or by competitive buying. Prices are announced in some printed catalogues, and records of what has been paid at auction are available in such compilations as American Book Prices Current. These serve as a convenient guide to estimated values of identical or comparable items offered for sale, but the amount offered or agreed to by the collector for a particular book or manuscript depends largely upon how much he is willing to pay in order to satisfy his desire. Here the dealer's knowledge of men and books and his experience with the peculiarities of the trade stand him in good stead in setting his price or in encouraging competitive bidding. The trend from broad generalized buying to specialized selection by his better customers works to the dealer's advantage in augmenting the value of the rarer materials. Except in times of economic depression this portion of the market is usually a dealer's market and the brisk trade he enjoys is an incentive to ferret out new sources of supply. In his relations with those persons who seek a market for their books and papers, the dealer finds that few such owners understand the highly individualized nature of the demand among his customers and its effect on the ultimate sale price. Generally he has the advantage of knowing more about the market than the owner, who for this very reason, may be suspicious of the price offered. He may feel that his situation smacks too much of "Let the seller beware," as the dealer seeks to widen his anticipated margin of profit. On the other hand, the dealer may be in the position of "Caveat emptor." He must be on guard against buying forgeries or facsimiles in disguise or documents from official files which the state can claim without cost, if they appear on the market. The reputable and experienced dealer, however, is not easily fooled. Nor does he desire that the customers to whom he sells should have to be mindful of the old "Caveat emptor" rule of trade. The best merchants of books and manuscripts, cherishing their reputation for fair dealing and their association with private collectors and cultural institutions, enjoy the intellectual stimulus derived from their business. Their returns are by no means measured exclusively in dollars and cents. The chief complaint of scholars and curators against the dealer is his practice of breaking up organic collections of manuscripts and offering them for sale piecemeal. The research value of such a body of papers is greater than the sum of its parts. When they are scattered, scholarship has suffered a loss which can never quite be recovered. The dealer may argue that, having acquired such a collection, he must make his profit, or that only after having failed to find a buyer for the whole has he proceeded to sell it in parts. It is true that he has saved something, even so—perhaps some documents of great historical significance, which might never have come to light except through his hands. He may also realize a greater total profit by disposing of them individually or in lots than by selling a collection intact. How much social or cultural obligation ought he feel as a counterbalance to the justifiable desire for economic gain? The research library is especially interested in acquiring collections intact, and accomplishes this end most effectually by direct contact with the owner. The dealer who runs into competition with an institution for favorable consideration by the owner of manuscripts can afford to make some concessions, or under certain circumstances withdraw from the scene, for the benefit of scholarship when the library is one of good repute in business matters as well as in intellectual standing. For who can discriminate more keenly among research institutions than the wise dealer? Likewise when he is called in as agent by the owner, it is within the bounds of propriety and cultural responsibility to give the first refusal to such institutons. Furthermore, they are the dealer's long-time customers who often buy other research materials, in small or large lots, which no private collector wants. There is another way of meeting the objection to the break-up of manuscript collections by the dealer, although he will challenge it vigorously. It consists of making photographic copies of the originals before they are scattered, so that unity and sequence of the collection are preserved in the photographic set for its maximum research use, regardless of the dispersion of the originals. Although the dealer maintains that production of photographic copies lessens the market value of the originals, it is doubtful whether substantial proof can be presented for this contention, especially in the case of manuscripts of unusual interest, in respect to authorship, content, or association. It is manuscripts in this class that always fetch top prices and spur him on in the practice of dispersal. Further light is thrown on this issue by the liberal policy, already widely adopted among libraries, of supplying other institutions with microfilm copies of rare books and manuscripts at cost. In spite of this growing practice (to some degree, no doubt, because of it), libraries continue to boast of originals in their possesison because of their rarity and scholars continue to consult them because of their intrinsic research value and appeal as originals. Perhaps the dealer is just a bit old fashioned in his attitude. The research library got into the game of collecting late, as the fourth party. With some exceptions, libraries until well into the nineteenth century tried to meet their limited needs with more limited funds and have always been grateful recipients of gifts that chanced to come their way. The greatest accumulations of books and manuscripts were owned by private collectors and scholars, who were the chief and almost sole customers of the dealers. Amid the rapid increase in auction sales during the decades after the Civil War most items on the market passed from one private library to another. This was a period of some famous sales (a prelude to more exciting opportunities in the next century), and the first occasions arose when libraries were able to participate to any great extent, by means of the bequests made by George Brinley and Joseph J. Cooke for this expressed purpose at the respective sales of their books in 1879 and 1883.7 7. George L. McKay, American Book Auction Catalogues, 1713-1934 (New York, 1937), including "History of Book Auctions in America," by Clarence S. Brigham, page 17. The wider use for their volumes in public institutions influenced such collectors as James Lenox and Lyman C. Draper in planning for the disposition of their libraries; while Ferdinand J. Dreer, in anticipating the gift of his collection of autographs to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, wrote that they constituted "substantial wealth, when in the keeping of a public institution, upon which drafts for information are always honoured at sight."8 8. A Catalogue of the Collection of Autographs Formed by Ferdinand Julius Dreer (2 vols., Philadelphia, 1890-93), I, viii-ix. This point of view became more widely held after 1900, as shown in the increasing number of famous private libraries given to institutions, along with funds for upkeep and expansion. Simultaneously occurred the steadily mounting interest in research and the need for a greater variety of basic materials. Thus research libraries appeared in the dealer's market in ever larger numbers as good customers. In the days when private collectors had the run of the market almost exclusively, the game was played with rugged individualism in the customary spirit of the time, and untrammeled competition paid off well to the dealer. During a long business career he would have the opportunity of handling some choice items twice or thrice as private libraries were broken up by the owners or their heirs. But the growing influence of institutions in the game has modified the conditions if not the rules somewhat to the disadvantage of the dealer. Wider recognition of the service of institutions to scholars and the public has resulted from efforts of librarians to encourage the use of their materials and from a better appreciation of the cultural benefits derived from permanent collections administered under an enlightened policy. Thus to some extent these libraries are in a privileged position with respect to the competitive market. Some persons will not bid against an institution, or at least against a particular one they hold in great esteem; others will buy for the library which they feel "ought to have" the material offered for sale. "Friends of the library," an idea that has grown in favor in recent years, provides a source of funds enabling the institution to purchase choice books and manuscripts when prompt action is essential. Librarians have been rugged individualists, too, and have enjoyed outwitting their professional competitors. Many of them, however, have learned (some slowly and reluctantly) the wisdom of cooperation so that the sum total spent by all yields more returns at less cost. They have gradually applied the trade association idea to their profession, notably in improving their special collections. They are more inclined to help one another, sometimes by abstaining from buying what the other fellow needs most, to improve or perfect some well known group of material. Since a swelling stream of manuscripts and imprints is flowing from the market into institutions to remain there forever, is the dealer playing a hopeless losing game? It is true that some of his most lucrative sources of supply have dried up, but it can scarcely be denied that others replace them. New materials are always being created and old ones rediscovered. The individual collector of such records we shall always have with us, as long as man is capable of this human activity. If the dealer finds it necessary to modify his business or develop new techniques, this necessity is common to all occupations at one time or another. However, his field of operations is so extensive and so productive that the end is not in sight; it is rather what he makes of it. We may conclude that the collecting of books and manuscripts is carried on with mixed motives that so often mingle personal satisfaction with social gain. The private collector's acquistiveness is often matched by that of the librarian who covets the object in view as a personal possession rather than as a means to the advancement of learning. The owner who wishes to sell and the dealer who promotes the sale may be interested only in monetary considerations. But you have to know something about the material to buy or sell it at an advantage. In the learning it takes on new meaning, especially in its relation to other books or documents. Thus when the game is played or the business transacted with this appreciation, cultural values begin to outweigh other factors; indeed, under certain circumstances even the desire for profit may be compromised. In this state of affairs no one is the loser, all factors considered. If the trend in collecting is inclined in favor of the research and educational institution, then the winnings are shared by all.

      <field name="fulltext">EXPLANATORY NOTES Each entry describes the papers of a single acquisition, all the manuscripts in such a group being usually the papers of the single individual or family whose name is given. The word "records" is added in the case of the papers of an organization, and "collection" for groups of manuscripts assembled by a collector from various sources. Birth and death dates of persons are given in parentheses following the name. Dates not in parentheses indicate inclusive years of the manuscripts, with an occasional added date in parentheses to show the period covered by the bulk of the material. Thus 1725(1900)-1928 means that while the earliest manuscript is dated 1725, the majority of papers fall in the period after 1900; 1805-(1850)1910 means that the body of the material ends in 1850, with a few scattered items up to 1910; and 1791(18401860)1902 means that the bulk of the papers fall between 1840 and 1860. The first ten issues of the Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library . . . are referred to, after the first citation as Archivist Report. In 1941 the series was renamed, for various reasons, the Annual Report on Historical Collections, University of Virginia Library. In addition to the usual abbreviations, "MS" for manuscript, "ALS" for autograph letter signed, etc., the abbreviation "incl." has been used for "including." Titles of persons have generally been omitted except when the first name is unknown. The numbers given at the end of each entry are accession numbers, included for their convenience as a finding aid in the Library. The names of depositors of manuscripts on loan to the University are not included; it should be understood that while the majority of such manuscripts are accessible for research, all are subject to such restrictions as the depositor has made, and none may be reproduced without consent of the owner.</field>
