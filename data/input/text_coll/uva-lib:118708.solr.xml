The Summer Quarter of the University is an integral part of the University Year, the courses in the College of Arts and Sciences being the same in character method and in credit value as in the other quarters. In the Department of Education many professional courses for elementary and high school teachers which are not offered in the regular session are given to meet certificate requirements. The Summer Quarter is divided into two terms for the accommodation of those who can give only six weeks to the work but who desire University credit. The First Term will begin June 21st, and will close July 31st, with lectures five times a week. The Second Term will begin August 2nd, and close September 4th, with six lectures a week. Students may enter for either term or both. A separate registration card must be filled out for each Term. The normal amount of work for college credit which a student may take, is three courses; but in a few exceptional cases, permission may be obtained to take four courses. In all cases an additional fee of $5.00 will be charged for each extra course. See page 20. The Summer Quarter is conducted for white men and women students as follows: Those desiring to absolve entrance requirements, elementary teachers seeking certificate or degree credit, high school teachers desiring certificate or degree credit, students just entering college desiring advanced standing, undergraduate students, pre-medical students and pre-law students desiring to meet entrance requirements, graduate students working for the master's degree or wishing to engage in research, school officials, supervisors and superintendents, and serious minded men and women who wish a wider knowledge of some special subject or seek broader general culture. ATTENDANCE.âA change from a six weeks' summer session to a full Summer Quarter was approved by the faculty and authorized by the Rector and Visitors in 1920 and its rapid growth has justified the wisdom of these bodies in establishing it. The total enrollment for both terms in 1925 was 2838. Deducting duplicates in the second term there was a total attendance of 2212 individual students. Of the total enrollment 2119 were from Virginia and 718 from 39 other states and countries. There were 1936 women and 902 men. Note.âIt is important that every prospective student read all the announcements from pages 12 to 39. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS.âThere are no formal examinations for admission to the Summer Quarter. Students are admitted to such courses as instructors find them qualified to pursue with advantage, but they should be graduates of accredited high schools or have had equivalent preparation. If a student wishes regular admission with a view to taking a degree, and does not expect to register in the regular session of the University, he should present a full statement with, as far as possible, official credentials of all work which he has done in high school or college. These credentials should be sent in advance to the Dean of the Summer Quarter. Suitable blank forms will be furnished upon request. LOCATION.âCharlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The sanitary arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about six hundred and fifty feet above sea level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete. The average monthly mean temperature from 1901 to 1911, taken from the records of the weather station at the University Observatory, was: June, 71.4; July, 76.8. There are golf links, swimming pools, and many other attractions for summer visitors. EXCURSIONS.âUnder the directorship of a competent guide, there will be excursions to neighboring of interest such as Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson; the Natural Bridge; Luray Caverns; the Grottoes of the Shenandoah; the battlefields in Virginia; and any other points to which a sufficiently large number may care to go. The proximity to Washington and Richmond and Old Point Comfort (three hours' ride to each) should make a visit exceptionally interesting. On designated clear nights parties will leave Cabell Hall at 8 o'clock to visit the McCormick Astronomical Observatory, where they will be shown the stars through the large telescope in the Observatory. To Luray and the Grottoes.âSaturday, July 17th. Special Excursion Train if two hundred or more go. Total cost, including railroad fare, entrance to both caves, and meals, about $6.50. To Washington.âSaturday, July 10th, returning late July 11th. Total costâincluding sight-seeing trips through public buildings, the City of Washington, Arlington and Mount Vernon, the services of a guide and chaperon, hotel bills and railroad fare, from $12.00 to $14.00. To Natural Bridge and Lexington.âSaturday, July 24th. An auto trip over the beautiful Blue Ridge and through the famous Shenandoah Valley. Cost about $6.00. To Monticello.âSaturday, June 26th, and other dates to be announced. Automobile round trip, including admission to grounds and building, $1.25. To Richmond.âA week-end trip will be arranged to suit groups desiring to visit this historic city. To Philadelphia.âThe annual meeting of the National Education Association will be held in Philadelphia June 27th-July 2nd. Leave of absence will be granted to students who wish to attend. Special excursion if sufficient number apply. Approximate cost, including railroad fare $35.00. ENTERTAINMENTS AND LECTURES.âA Musical Festival and other entertainments will be announced during the session of the Summer Quarter. The price of a season ticket is low, making the cost about the same as moving pictures. Among the attractions already engaged are: June 29th, Sophie Braslau, Contralto with Metropolitan Opera Company; June 30th and July 1st, The Devereux Dramatic Company in The Merrie Monarch and Romancers; July 5th, The Marmeins in their original Drama Dances; July 9th, Paul Fleming, Magician; July 12th, Irma Seydel, Violinist; July 22nd and 23rd, The Coffer-Miller Players in Love in Livery, and Sleepy Hollow. BOARD AND ROOMS.âBoard and room may be had at prices ranging from $7.50 per week, where several stay in the same room, upward, according to accommodation and proximity to the University, the average being $7.50 to $9.00 per week. Most of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the University Grounds. Two hundred and twenty-five furnished double rooms in the University dormitories will be reserved for women, in the order of application. The price for each term will be $6.00 for each person for the full term of six weeks for a double room. All checks for rooms should be made payable to E. I. Carruthers, Bursar. Every double room must be occupied by two persons. No reduction will be made for parts of a term. Applications for rooms must be accompanied with the full amount of the fee, which will be returned for good reason and room released if application is made before June 10th. No rooms will be rented to any person who does not register and pay the fee in the Summer Quarter. Rooms that are reserved will not be held later than June 24th. No room will be open for occupancy before June 18th. No transfer of a reservation will be allowed without written permission of the Secretary or Local Manager. Roomers must provide themselves with necessary bed clothes, towels, etc. Rooms will be in charge of Mrs. E. I. Carruthers, an experienced matron and chaperon. Residence, E. Range, Phone 271. Some members of the faculty will be located in each set of dormitories. No cooking allowed in rooms. The location of these dormitories in the University grounds and the social advantages resulting from bringing so many teachers close together make this arrangement a very desirable one and the rooms are eagerly sought. Application for dormitory rooms should be sent promptly with retaining fee. For list of boarding houses, rates, etc., see page 74 or write to Secretary Summer Quarter, Box 149, University, Virginia. No student will be permitted to room in a house not approved by the Administrative Board of the Summer Quarter. If the name is not on the approved list in the catalogue, inquiry should be made before accommodations are engaged. Students are requested not to accept rooms when prices quoted are in advance of those listed in the catalogue. When a room is accepted it is the usual understanding that it is for a term of six weeks, and a student is expected to pay for that time unless there is a definite agreement to the contrary in advance or it may be clearly shown that accommodations are not as represented. If accommodations are not secured before arriving, students should go immediately to Peabody Hall, where there will be listed the available boarding places still open. A guide will be at the station with the Summer Quarter badge to aid students with baggage; but not to designate boarding places. Students are cautioned against solicitors at the station or on the grounds and are advised to accept advice and directions only from official sources. Baggage.âTrunks and heavy bags should be left at the railway station until a residence is secured. There are two passenger stations in Charlottesville; all baggage should be checked to Union Station, Charlottesville. No check for baggage should be given to a drayman or transfer company without taking a receipt for it. APPROXIMATE SUMMARY OF NECESSARY EXPENSES The figures in the following tables may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of six weeks. Necessary expenses are reckoned as university and tuition fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. Three estimates are givenâa low, an average, and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundryâin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. If a student shares a room with another student, and practices the strictest economy, he may possibly reduce his expenses below the estimate.

W. Preston, will be open for summer students and will provide table board at very low prices. The average cost last session for three meals per day, including all transient meals served, was $24.00 per month. It is not necessary to reserve a place in the Cafeteria in advance. REDUCED RAILROAD RATES.âReduced rates on the round trip identification plan will be authorized from points on the Chesapeake and Ohio and the Norfolk and Western Railroads and from Southeastern territory with the exception of stations on the New Orleans Great Northern Railroad and the Winston-Salem Southbound Railway. The basis will be one and one-half fare for the round trip, minimum excursion fare $1.00, and tickets will be sold only to students and members of their families upon presentation of identification certificates to ticket agents at time of purchase of tickets. Ask your station agent in advance of your coming about rates. Tickets will be sold June 17-23, inclusive, and July 29, August 4th, inclusive, final limit of all tickets September 10th, tickets to be validated by the regular ticket agents of the Charlottesville terminal lines over which such tickets read before return journey is commenced. Application should be made to Secretary, Summer Quarter, Box 149, University, Virginia, for identification certificates. FEES FOR VIRGINIA TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.âTuition is entirely free to all Virginia teachers in all the regular courses, leading to certification. No student, however, will be permitted to take more than three courses without the payment of $5.00 for each additional course. To meet local expenses, a registration fee of $5.00 for a six weeks' term is charged. An extra fee of $5.00 will be charged for each graduate course. There are a few special courses offered to meet certain demands, for which fees will be charged to all who take them. The fee for each is designated in the catalogue. Small fees in laboratory courses will also be charged all students who register in them. Students from Virginia who are not teachers will be charged the same tuition as non-Virginia students. Virginia teachers Other Virginia students Students from other states First term Second term First term Second term First term Second term Tuition $ â $ â $15.00 $15.00 $15.00 $15.00 Matriculation fee 5.00 5.00 5.00 5.00 5.00 5.00 The term "Virginia teachers" includes those who are now teaching in Virginia or whose last teaching was in Virginia. The term cannot be construed as meaning any of the following: 1. Those who are now teaching in other states. 2. Those whose last teaching was in other states. 3. Those who are planning to teach but have not yet taught. Those who are planning to teach but have not yet taught, may be exempt from the $15.00 tuition fee, if they will sign a pledge to teach in Virginia in 1926 or, failing to do so, pay the fee. FEES FOR NON-VIRGINIA STUDENTS.âA registration fee of five dollars for each term and a tutition fee of $15.00 for each term will be charged each student who registers from outside of Virginia. This fee will entitle the student to enter any of the courses outlined in the catalogue (except a few special courses which are so designated). No student, however, will be permitted to take more than three courses without paying a fee of $5.00 for each extra course. See page 15. Note.âTeachers outside of Virginia are not limited in the choice of courses to the regulations under which Virginia licenses are issued, unless they desire to teach in Virginia and apply for a license issued in this State. In this case only State certificates from other states issued by a State Superintendent or a State Board of Examiners, and approved in advance by the Department of Public Instruction of Virginia, will be recognized as a proper basis for professional credit. Teachers from other states will receive credit for all work done in accordance with the certificate regulations of those States from which they come. Most Southern States accept the work of the University Summer Quarter for certificate credit or renewal. Medical Fee.âA small medical fee of 75 cents will be charged each person who registers each term, which will entitle him or her to free medical attendance by Dr. J. Edwin Wood, Jr., the Physician of the Summer Quarter, hospital phone, 548; residence phone, 820; office hours at the hospital 8:30 to 9:30 and 4:00 to 5:00. Sundays and holidays; 8:30 to 9:30 A. M. only. Greatly reduced charges, if it should be necessary, will be given at the University Hospital, under the following regulations: Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the Physician of the Summer Quarter; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, and for special treatment of the eye, ear, nose, and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of the student, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Any student sent to the University Hospital upon the advice and under the care of a physician other than the Summer Quarter Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. Late Registration and Transfer Fees.âStudents who fail to register on the days specified for the purpose must pay a special fee of $1.00. A fee of $1.00 is charged for each change from one course to another after registration has been completed, unless such change is officially advised. No auditors or visitors are allowed in classes unless this privilege is mentioned in the description of the course. All who attend must be regularly registered and enrolled. Refund of Fees.âStudents who withdraw within the period allowed for registration and changes in program will be reimbursed the full amount of tuition fees and half the laboratory fees, but no other fees. Students who withdraw after the time allowed for registration and changes cannot be allowed reimbursement for any fees. PAYMENT OF FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES.âThe Bursar does not cash personal checks, but will accept them in payment of the exact amount of fees, and they will be accepted at the cafeteria for meal tickets. Students should provide themselves with Travelers' checks, or New York Drafts, which may be obtained from their home banks, or Postal Money Orders. A Branch of the Peoples National Bank of Charlottesville is located at the University where accounts may be opened, if desired. TIME AND PLACE OF RECITATIONS AND LECTURES.âRecitations will begin in all courses Tuesday, June 22nd, at 8:30 a. m. There will be no classes on Saturdays in the first term except Saturday, June 26th. The length of recitation periods will be one hour, ten minutes of which will be allowed for transfer from one room to another. SUNDAY VESPER SERVICES.âExperience has shown that no Sunday service held here during the summer has been more attractive or more appreciated than the Vesper Service. The service begins at half past seven o'clock and, when weather permits, is held in the McIntire Amphitheatre. Otherwise in Cabell Hall. The service consists of community singing, a brief address followed by an appropriate musical program. General Assembly.âEvery evening except Saturday and Sunday, from 7:30 to 8:00 o'clock, a general assembly of students and faculty will be held in Cabell Hall. The program will be informal and varied, and will be musical, devotional, educational, or recreational. Assembly will be under the direction of a faculty committee, and will be led by members of the faculty and prominent visiting speakers. Convocation.âIn order to provide for the increasing number of students who complete the requirements for their degrees during the Summer Quarter, a convocation exercise will be held Friday evening, September 3rd; at 8 o'clock, when degrees will be conferred. Each applicant for a degree in the Summer Quarter must submit to the Dean of the Summer Quarter for approval by the proper Committee on Degrees, the program of work leading to the degree sought, not later than April 1st of the year in which the degree is to be obtained. If the Committee approves the program, it will be submitted to the proper faculty of the University for recommendation to the General Faculty and will be finally approved by the General Faculty at the meeting in June at which other degrees are approved. REGISTRATION IN PERSON.âFriday, June 18th, Saturday, June 19th, and Monday, June 21st, will be devoted to the registration of students. All students who can possibly do so should register on these days. Those who fail to register before June 22nd, will be permitted to attend classes, and register as promptly as possible at other hours. A delayed registration fee of $1.00 will be charged all persons after June 22nd. The Registrar's office, located in Peabody Hall, will be open continuously from 8:30 a. m. to 4:30 p. m. Students should consult freely with members of the Faculty in case of difficulty in choosing courses. No certificate will be granted to students who fail to register before Tuesday, June 29th, except a certificate of attendance. No student will be enrolled in any course without a registration card naming the course in question and properly signed by the Registrar and the Bursar. Registration of Suspended Students.âProbation or suspension imposed at the end of the regular session may be absolved by the successful completion of prescribed work in the Summer Quarter. REGISTRATION BY MAIL.âRegistration may be completed by mail to June 11th. For the necessary blanks, address, Secretary Summer Quarter. Box 149, University, Virginia. The following classes of students may register by mail: 1. Students previously enrolled in the Summer Quarter, or the regular session of the University. 2. New students who do not need advice on their program of work, or on a particular course which they wish to take. Registration by mail is intended only for those who know the program of studies which they may or should take. All such prospective students are urged to register by mail. This will avoid the great congestion on registration days, and enable the students to arrive a day or two later. Fees of those registering by mail should be paid at the Bursar's Office after arrival at the University. THE GENERAL LIBRARY.âThe General Library is open to the corps of instructors and the students of the Summer Quarter, from 9 a. m. to 9:30 p. m. The collection contains about seventy thousand volumes. All books withdrawn from the library must be charged at the desk. Usually books are lent for one week but there are exceptions, and the loan expires on the date stamped in the book. Prompt return not later than the date on which the loan expires is expected and borrowers will be fined ten cents for each day delinquent. Students are expected to give prompt attention to all communications from the librarian. THE HECK MEMORIAL LIBRARY.âThe Department of Education maintains its own library in Peabody Hall, named in honor of the first professor of Education in the University, the late Professor William Harry Heck. At present the library consists of several thousand well selected volumes covering most fields of Education, and files of national, state, and foreign publications. It also will be open from 9 a. m. to 9:30 p. m. REST AND STUDY ROOMS.âMadison Hall, the beautiful building of the Young Men's Christian Association, and during the summer session headquarters for the Y. W. C. A., will be open to students and Faculty of the Summer Quarter, from nine o'clock in the morning until ten at night. Students will have access to the current periodicals in the reading room. The other rooms will be used for rest, for study, for recreation, and for social gatherings. North of the building there are nineteen tennis courts which will be equipped for the use of the students. The Secretary in charge requests the co-operation of all and invites each student to make the Y. W. C. A. her "home" while at the University. THE NEW MEMORIAL GYMNASIUM.âThe new Memorial Gymnasium is situated between the athletic field and the University golf links, and offers facilities unsurpassed in any American university. The main exercise room is 180 by 96 feet, with a ten-foot running track gallery of twelve laps to the mile. There is also an auxiliary gymnasium 30 by 70 feet. The swimming pool is 30 by 75 feet, with a gallery for spectators. A general locker room provides for 1700 full-length steel lockers, with two shower rooms. There are also spacious locker rooms and baths for home and visiting teams as well as special rooms for boxing, fencing, and wrestling, and three handball courts. The administration wing includes offices for the staff, examination rooms and a large lecture room. STUDENTS' MAIL.âIn order to insure safe and prompt delivery of mail, every student should have all mail directed to, University, Virginia, giving always the street and number of his or her boarding place or the number and location of his or her room in the University. The local address should be filed at the post office promptly upon arrival. Before leaving, each student should file at the post office his or her forwarding address; otherwise, mail without return address which comes after the student has departed, will be sent to the dead letter office. TEACHERS' POSITIONS.âThe Appointment Committee of the Summer Quarter receives demands for teachers each year. This committee is glad to have well qualified teachers who are in attendance upon the Summer Quarter file their applications. There will be no charge for this service except a small registration fee of $1.00 to assist in the expenses of the Committee. REGULATIONS CONCERNING CREDIT.âThe instructor giving each course will keep the class grades and attendance, hold the examination and average the class grade with the examination grade, returning to the Dean of the Summer Quarter the general average grade of each student in each course. Absences or delayed entrance will be counted against the student. All examinations must be held under the Honor System. A report of each course completed with an average grade of 75 per cent. will be signed by the Registrar of the Summer Quarter and mailed to the student. Each student who wishes his or her report sent, should file with the registrar not later than July 17th, a self-addressed government-stamped envelope for mailing it. Credit Allowed by Other States Than Virginia.âApplication has been made to other Southern States for credit equal to that accorded by the Virginia State Board of Education. Credit is now allowed toward the extension of certificates by most of the Southern States. All persons wishing to arrange for credits with their respective school authorities should correspond with the Dean of the Summer Quarter. Entrance Credit.âWhere college courses in the Summer Quarter are taken to absolve conditions or to meet entrance requirements, no more than three units of entrance credit may be obtained in a full quarter. University of Virginia College Credit.âBelow are stated the conditions upon which credit in the University of Virginia may be granted for work done in the Summer Quarter. (a) The student must satisfy the entrance requirements of the University of Virginia and matriculate before he can receive credit in the College for any work done in the University of Virginia Summer Quarter. (b) The Dean of the College will accept the completion of the courses in the summer quarter in lieu of the entrance examinations in the same subject, provided that in his judgment the courses are equivalent to those required for entrance to the University of Virginia, and provided, that the certificate of courses completed be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned. (c) The Dean of the College will accept certificates of completion of summer courses in the University of Virginia, provided that such summer courses be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned as the full equivalent in character and scope of the corresponding courses in the University. All courses for which degree credit is designated in this catalogue have been approved by the professors concerned and will be accepted by the Dean for such credit as is indicated in the description of each course. (d) Students both men and women who satisfy entrance requirements will not only receive credit in the University of Virginia for college courses taken in the Summer Quarter, but the summer work is recognized by standard colleges everywhere, so that students have no difficulty in securing transfer of credits. (e) That graduate courses completed in the Summer Quarter if approved by the Committee on Graduate Studies, shall be credited just as if they were taken in the regular session; that residence work aggregating three summer quarters shall be considered as fulfilling the residence requirements for the master's degree. College Credit.âCandidates who desire credit for work done at other colleges, must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students, and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college, must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate, and must give his grades. The final validation of such certificates is effected by the successful completion of the courses taken in this university. In no case will credit be given on more than forty-five session-hours of work done elsewhere, and any candidate who receives this maximum amount of credit can count among the remaining fifteen session-hours required for his degree only the credit value of the courses he has passed as a resident student in the Summer Quarter. In every case the candidate must spend at least three full summer quarters in this University. REGULATIONS The Session-Hour.âAll courses are measured in terms of the session-hour as a unit. A session-hour is one hour a week throughout the regular session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week throughout the session of laboratory work, or five hours a week or five laboratory periods a week for a term of six weeks in the Summer Quarter. It is equal to two semester hours or three quarter hours. Maximum and Minimum Number of Session-Hours.âEach student may undertake each term courses aggregating three session-hours (with the exception noted in paragraph I. (I) A student may take four session-hours, provided he (a) has passed in the regular session at the college last attended courses aggregating fifteen session-hours, or (b) is in his graduating year and needs four session-hours for his degree. Exceptions to the above regulations will be allowed only by special permission of the Dean of the Summer Quarter and all of the professors concerned. Physical training is not counted in the maximum and minimum requirements detailed above. Grade.âThe grade of a student in any course is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Class standing in any course is determined by the regularity of the student's attendance upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercises) of the course, and by the quality of his work, as indicated by his recitation grades, written tests, laboratory work, etc. For passing in any course a grade of seventy-five per cent. is required. For certificate regulations, see page 28. Report of Grades.âA report of the final grade in each course pursued is mailed to each student as soon as practicable after the close of each term. The names of students who passed will be posted as soon as reported after each examination but no grades will be given out from the Registrar's Office. Transcript of Records.âAfter the original record is issued, a charge of twenty-five cents will be made for each transcript of a record. Remittance should accompany each application. Report of State Credits.âState credits and State certificates will be sent from the Department of Public Instruction, Richmond. Students who fail to get their certificates should communicate with the Supervisor Certification, State Board of Education, Richmond, Virginia. Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors, but only for sickness or like providential cause. Any explanation of an absence which a student has to offer must be made on the day of the first lecture attended after the absence. Absence from Examinations will not be excused, except for sickness on the day of examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, in accordance with above, is entitled to a special examination on a date to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge of the examination. Re-examinations.âA student whose grade in any course falls below seventy-five per cent. but not below sixty-five per cent. may, upon the written recommendation of the professor in charge, be admitted to reexamination upon that course during the first two days of registration of the following Summer Quarter. All applicants for re-examination must register and pay the fee of $2.50 on or before the first of June. The Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the Honor System. Its administration is entirely in the hands of the students through the Honor Committee.

Other officers by appointment. Six degrees are offered candidates for graduation in the regular session of the College. Two of these, the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science, are cultural; the Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, the name of which is inscribed on the diploma, the Bachelor of Science in Architecture, the Bachelor of Science in Commerce, and the Bachelor of Science in Medicine, are vocational degrees, designed for those who wish to fit themselves especially for professional work. Appropriate courses taken in the summer quarter count toward these degrees. No course offered by a successful candidate for one of the cultural baccalaureate degrees can be offered by the same candidate as part of the work credited toward the other cultural baccalaureate degree, nor can any work done to remove an entrance condition be counted for any degree. The Summer Quarter is an integral part of the University year. Courses in the College of Arts and Sciences as well as the Department of Education, are the same in character and in credit value as in any other quarter of the University. Degrees are conferred upon men and women upon exactly the same terms for work done in the Summer Quarter when the degree requirements are fully met. Sixty session-hours of undergraduate courses exclusive of physical training taken in conformity with the requirements published herewith, are required for the Bachelor's degree. Those who contemplate completing their degree requirements in the Summer Quarter should keep clearly in mind, in estimating the time that will be required, that the normal amount of credit which may be taken in one Summer Quarter is six session-hours. Candidates for a degree who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. This certificate must be acceptable both to the Dean of the Summer Quarter and to the Dean of the Department in which the degree will be obtained. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college and must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate and must give his grade. In every case the candidate must spend at least three full Summer Quarters at the University in order to meet the residence requirements. The Master's degree may be obtained by properly qualified persons in three Summer Quarters. In no case is this degree to be conferred upon any person who has not attended and done graduate work three full Summer Quarters or the equivalent time in the regular session of the University. All persons who are looking forward ultimately to taking a degree through summer work are urgently requested to file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter an official statement of their entrance requirements and work for which college credit is desired. Blanks for this purpose will be mailed upon application.

GRADUATE STUDIES Registration Graduate students of the Summer Quarter, new or old, are required each summer of their residence, if they wish to become candidates for the Master's Degree at this University, to register at the office of the Dean of Graduate Studies, Graduate House, West Lawn, who will advise them in regard to a program of studies. This registration should promptly follow registration at the Summer Quarter Office in Peabody Hall. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Admission to the Department.âFor admission to the Department of Graduate Studies a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank is required, for men and women alike. In order to become a candidate for a degree, the student must be advanced to candidacy by the Committee on Rules and Courses upon formal application as set forth below. Final approval of candidacy will depend upon the record made during the first term or quarter of residence. Advancement to Candidacy for a Degree.âAny graduate student who wishes to become a candidate for a degree must file with the Dean of the Department his application on a blank form to be secured from the Dean's Secretary. This application must include a proposed program of work arranged in accordance with the requirements for the several degrees as stated below, and must be accompanied, in case the applicant does not hold an academic degree from this University, by an official transcript of the applicant's academic record made out by the Registrar of the institution from which the baccalaureate degree was received, and by a catalogue of that institution, marked to show the courses of study pursued. The application will be submitted by the Dean to the Committee on Rules and Courses, who will consider it in conference with the professors concerned. The Committee will have the right to require that the applicant add to his program any courses, undergraduate or graduate, considered necessary to supply his deficiencies, or to enable him to pursue with profit the courses he has selected. When the program has been finally approved, the Dean will report to the applicant his advancement to candidacy for a degree. It should be distinctly understood that graduate degrees are not conferred merely upon the basis of the number of courses passed, or of the length of time spent in resident or non-resident work, but upon the basis of the quality and scope of the candidate's knowledge and his power of investigation in his chosen field of study. Candidates whose training and attainments are inferior cannot expect to secure a degree in the normal length of time estimated below for the respective degrees. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES. Master of Arts.âThe degree of Master of Arts will be conferred upon the holder of a degree of Bachelor of Arts who has fulfilled the following requirements: (1) The successful completion, in not less than one full year of resident graduate work, or three summer quarters, of the program of studies approved for the candidate by the Committee on Rules and Courses, as embodied in his formal application for advancement to candidacy. This application must be submitted not later than one week after registration. The program must form a consistent plan of work, to be pursued with some definite aim, and grouped around some one subject to be known as the candidate's Major Subject, the name of which will be incorporated in the body of each diploma conferring the degree. The program should be arranged in consultation with the professors concerned, and must be approved in writing by a professor of the candidate's Major Subject, who shall be designated by the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies, after consultation with the candidate. (2) The preparation and submission of a thesis, and an examination written or oral, upon the program of study, to be accepted as satisfactory by the professor of the candidate's Major Subject in the regular session of the University. A candidate who expects to obtain the Master's degree in three Summer Quarters shall select his subject for a thesis not later than the beginning of his second summer of residence. This subject should be approved by October 15 following. Two copies of the thesis, typewritten on paper of prescribed quality and size, and substantially bound, must be deposited in the office of the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies not later than May 15 of the year in which it is expected that the degree will be conferred. The back of the cover must bear the title of the thesis and the writer's name, and the title page must bear the words: A thesis presented to the Academic Faculty of the University of Virginia in candidacy for the degree of Master of Arts. (3) A final comprehensive examination, oral or written, after the acceptance of the candidate's thesis, conducted by the candidate's major professor and one or more of his departmental colleagues. Master of Science.âThe degree of Master of Science will be conferred upon the holder of a degree of Bachelor of Science who fulfills requirements corresponding to those stated above for the degree of Master of Arts. Graduate Work in Education.âGraduate work in Education leading to the degree of Master of Arts and Master of Science may be pursued in the Summer Quarter. Residence.âAs stated above, the Master's degree may be won by properly qualified persons in three full Summer Quarters of two terms each. In no case will a degree be conferred without resident graduate study during three Quarters, the equivalent in time of the regular session. Graduate students in the Summer Quarter are required to make their Master's degree in three out of five summers, after being accepted for graduate courses without conditions. Graduate students are advised to continue their residence, if possible, during one or more terms of the regular session. Courses, Session-hours, and Grade.âOnly those courses marked C in this catalogue may be counted toward the Master's degree. Not more than two graduate courses each term of the Summer Quarter will be credited toward the degree except by special permission of the Dean and the Committee on Graduate Studies. At least twelve session-hours of resident work, constituting a definite program of study and distributed over three Quarters, or six Summer terms, are required for the Master's degree. Terms devoted entirely to undergraduate study will not be counted in residence for the Master's degree. A graduate student's standing in a course is indicated not by a numerical grade, but by one of the following terms: Distinguished, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory. PRE-LAW COURSES For Admission to the Department of Law, in addition to the completion of an approved high school course of four years, or its equivalent, the candidate must present evidence that for at least two years he has pursued in a standard college courses leading to a baccalaureate degree, of which he must have successfully completed at least thirty session-hours. Applicants may, however, be registered as regular students on presentation of a certificate of the completion of 27 session-hours, and may make up the three additional hours before entering upon the work of their third year. All the required pre-Law courses are offered in the Summer Quarter. PRE-MEDICAL COURSES The requirements given below are strictly minimum requirements. Premedical students are advised to take more than thirty session-hours of college work, either by spending an additional year in college or by taking thirty-three or thirty-six session-hours during their two years as college students. Entrance conditions of any kind whatsoever are absolutely prohibited and no substitution can be allowed for any required subject. In addition to the high-school work specified above, a candidate for admission to the Department of Medicine must present evidence of the completion in a manner satisfactory to this medical school of at least thirty session-hours of collegiate work in a college approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association. A session-hour is the credit value of one hour a week of lecture or recitation or two hours a week of laboratory work throughout a session of at least thirty-two weeks, exclusive of holidays. The subjects included in the thirty session-hours of college work should be in accordance with the following schedule: Required Subjects: Session-hours General Inorganic Chemistry (a) 4 Organic Chemistry (b) 3 Physics (c) 4 Biology (d) 4 English Composition and Literature (e) 3 Other non-science subjects (f) 6 Subjects Strongly Urged: French or German, Advanced Botany or Advanced ZoÃ¶logy, Psychology, Advanced Algebra, Solid Geometry, and Trigonometry, additional courses in Chemistry. Other Suggested Electives: English (additional), Economics, History, Sociology, Political Science, Logic, Mathematics, Latin, Greek, Drawing. Credit not Given for an Incomplete Course. Credit can be accepted only when the student has a clear record on the entire course; for example, if the course in general physics is a six session-hour course consisting of 3 hours lecture and six hours laboratory weekly for three trimesters and the student passes on two trimesters but fails on the third, no credit for admission to medicine can be given for the portion of the subject passed, even though the credit value of this work is four session-hours. In all cases the student must have completed the entire subject for which he has registered. Deficiencies of this kind may however be made up by obtaining a clear record in the portion of the subject in which the failure has occurred, without repeating the entire course. All the pre-medical courses are offered in the Summer Quarter. VIRGINIA CERTIFICATES During the Summer Quarter courses are offered which will meet the requirements for the following certificates: 1.
