      <field name="fulltext">FOREWORD The University of Virginia was founded in 1819 by Thomas Jefferson. The celebration of its one-hundredth anniversary was delayed from 1919 to 1921 because of disturbed world conditions following the Great War. Prior to the Centennial there appeared the monumental History of the University of Virginia, by Philip Alexander Bruce, LL.D., the notable offering of a distinguished alumnus and historian; and coincident with that event was published a volume of poems, The Enchanted Years, contributed in honor of the occasion by poets of America and Great Britain. Shortly before the Centennial Celebration, there was shown on the moving-picture screen in Virginia and other states a series of important events and noteworthy scenes in the history of the University from the days of Jefferson and Poe to the present. The following pages set forth in order the proceedings of that historic occasion which covered four days, May 31-June 3, 1921. Most of the addresses delivered, a few representative greetings, and the text of the Centennial Pageant are included, together with a number of illustrations which will make more vivid to the reader certain memorable scenes. While the volume is primarily a record of the Centennial Celebration, it is in a larger sense an interpretation of the spirit of an institution through a hundred years of service to State and Nation.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Centennial of the University of Virginia THE FIRST DAY The opening day of the Centennial was devoted mainly to religious services. The first public meeting was held in Cabell Hall in commemoration of the religious contribution of the University. A somewhat more formal function, with academic procession, was the Vesper Service on the same day, followed at night by the Organ Recital, the first exercise in the new open-air theatre. The day's program was as follows: Tuesday, May 31st 11.00 A.M. Exercises in Commemoration of the Influence of the University of Virginia in the Religious Life of the Nation. Cabell Hall. Address by the Reverend William Alexander Barr, '92, D.D., Dean of Christ Church Cathedral, New Orleans. Invocation by Reverend B. F. Lipscomb, D.D., of Charlottesville The anthems were sung by the Albemarle Choral Club, directed by Arthur Fickenscher, Professor of Music, University of Virginia 6.00 P.M. Vesper Services. Cabell Hall. Sermon by the Reverend Henry van Dyke, D.D., LL.D., D.C.L., Murray Professor of English Literature, Princeton University. Invocation by Reverend George L. Petrie, D.D., of Charlottesville. The music was by the Albemarle Choral Club, directed by Arthur Fickenscher, Professor of Music, University of Virginia 8.30 P.M. Organ Recital, by Humphrey John Stewart, Mus.D., Municipal Organist of San Diego, dedicating the Amphitheatre, gift of Paul Goodloe McIntire ('79) ADDRESSES ON THE FIRST DAY RELIGION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA By William Alexander Barr, D.D. If by education is meant, in a general way, the enterprise of fitting the youth of a country, through the medium of definite and directed effort, to meet the issues of adult life in the most efficient and satisfactory manner:— then we may say that educational methods were known to the ancient world. Leaving apart such practices as obtained in behalf of the mental discipline of the young among the early peoples of the Orient, we find formal educational methods embedded in the very structure of the Greek and Roman civilizations. The Greek conception of the value of a man's life, in the most cultivated centers like Athens, consisted in an estimate of his fitness to be of use to the city-state. It was sought to effect this end through the study of art and literature and the systematic training of his body through the means of gymnastics. In the earlier history of the Romans we find the attempts at education much ruder and more insufficient, but as the empire grew in enlightenment and power it borrowed much from the Greeks and, in its riper civilization, developed a system of education. As however the Greek civilization was already decadent, it proved to be the form rather than the spirit of its culture which was taken over and the study of rhetoric and philosophy deteriorated rather than advanced under their course of development. When Christianity came into the world it confronted this decaying civilization and its adherents not only hesitated but definitely questioned the attitude they should assume towards the classical culture. Should they use what they found as a medium for their own education and development, or should the pagan culture be swept entirely aside as an evil thing and unworthy of those to whom the true light had shined? But as is readily understood, this question resolved itself. Christianity revealed at once its ability to transfigure all that it touched, so that the commonest things, when penetrated with its light, assumed a new beauty and a transcendent meaning. In a very real sense, then, it was able to change the so-called "profane learning" of the ancient world into sacred learning. From the first, too, Christianity in its contact with the things of the world, betrayed an inherent selective principle by means of which it was able to choose from the pagan learning all that was fine and noble and reject what was unwholesome and puerile. And thus it came about, in the process of time, that the little flock entered into its kindgom: the Christian church became the patron of education and scholarship and, under her guidance, great universities grew up all over the world. Centennial Medal The Christian university has represented the highest type of education as it has the best scholarship that the world has known. This eminence that has been attained by Christian scholarship it is not difficult to account for. That selective principle to which I have just referred accounts for much. From the first, and all along its history, it has chosen the best of that which was in the world and has shown the same wisdom in dealing with the investigations that scholarship has been making all along its path. This is particularly true of intellectual activity in the physical realm. With all that has come to it in the nature of discovery it has been able to sift out that which was of permanent worth and to reject that which was spurious or ephemeral. Its mission in the intellectual world has been to prove all things and to hold fast to that which was good. Out of the chaff it has perpetually sifted the good, the beautiful and true and to those it has tenaciously clung. Moreover, Christianity was destined to work out the loftiest ideal of scholarship because of its inherently progressive spirit. Just because it carried with it the touchstone for determining what was good and true, it could advance with perfect assurance upon all unexplored territory and thus perpetually extend its body of knowledge. It made the intellectual enquirer perfectly free. He felt himself in his Father's house where all things were his because he was Christ's and Christ was God's. So he can still always advance because he is freed from superstition and fear. His natural attitude is one of looking forward. His is an inheritance of promise, of hope, of expectancy. He is bidden to forget the things that are behind and reach forward to the things that are before. Thus he is equipped for the highest functions of scholarship in investigating, in testing, and in classifying and arranging. He works with his face towards the sunrise. He is thrilled not so much with what has been as with what shall be. He realizes that his is a flying goal. His is the inspiration of an abiding vision of the revelation of new truth, of the unfolding vistas of new fields of knowledge. But while the eager and fearless forward gaze has been the glory of Christian scholarship, it has preserved along with it a due reverence for the past and a just appreciation of its value to the present. And any so-called scholarship that would entirely break with the past and disregard its estimates must eventually become frivolous and fantastic. It is self-evident in any specific department of intellectual discipline, as in mathematics for example, that the profoundest genius of the world could make no worthy contribution to the advancement of the science if he declined to treat with the findings of the past and undertook to build up for himself the whole fabric from its foundation. Even if one possessed the necessary faculty, life is all too short for the accomplishment of such a task. It is in accepting the results of the past that one makes true progress in the present. The same thing is true, of course, as to scholarship in general. It is by picking up the standard where our predecessors have dropped it that we may hope to carry it some distance towards the heights of victory. The best scholarship is then wisely conservative as it is fearlessly progressive. It reflects that the present has its roots in the past and that it must always be interpreted in the light of that past. The face is indeed turned to the future, but all the while the feet are planted firmly upon the past. So long then as scholarship is Christian it will be characterized by true conservatism. In this it only profits by its earliest lesson, that we press most effectively towards the future prize as we cherish the precious inheritance of those who have wrought in the light that shines in Him who lived and died for men. It is this Christian scholarship that has found its expression in the universities that have existed over the world for hundreds of years, and it was for the advancement of Christian scholarship and Christian education that universities grew up in this country. Indeed the oldest of our universities had their beginnings as denominational colleges. It was chiefly for the training of their own ministry that they were brought into being. Thomas Jefferson, however, entertained a broader conception of what a university should be. He thought it should be carried on under the auspices of the state and minister to the educational needs of all the people without regard to any religious distinctions whatever. In his proposal for a university, he aimed no blow at any religious influence that might be fostered by it. The blow was at sectarianism only: at the religious tests and shibboleths which he conceived as obstructing the most effective work of an educational institution. Surprise has sometimes been expressed that there should have existed at any time, among the people, the impression that the University of Virginia was irreligious or even non-religious in its character. But under the circumstances it could hardly have been otherwise. Jefferson was known to be liberal in his religious views and, a hundred years ago, Liberalism carried with it the suspicion of practical unbelief. A hundred years ago, moreover, impatience with sectarianism was easily interpreted as a want of sympathy with the Christian Faith itself. The founder of the University himself complained of the report that the influences of the institution were opposed to all religion and called it a calumny. Let us believe, however, that it was through no vicious motive that such charges became current, but through a misunderstanding of the freedom and toleration which were contemplated in all matters of religion. As a matter of fact we know that so far as concerns the religious influence of this institution, from its very inception the wind has always blown in a single direction. In his plans Mr. Jefferson himself suggested that there should be space for a building to be used for religious worship under what he called "impartial regulation." In the meantime two of the best rooms in the main building were to be set apart for the purpose. Here then, at the very outset, he not only revealed his sympathy with religious influence, but set the stamp of his approval upon the provision by the state of a place and equipment for religious worship. As a matter of fact such an engagement was entered into by the state. It was fulfilled in something of a round-about way, providing first for a room in the building and later, in lieu of the permanent provision of a building, making a fixed contribution to the expenses incident to maintaining stated services. Mr. Jefferson insisted only that the whole affair of the religious activity of the University should be wholly voluntary. Religious services were to be sustained by free-will contributions and no one was to be compelled to attend such services. All was to be left to the individual conscience. But it must not be overlooked that he went out of his way to say that every reasonable influence might be exerted to persuade the young men to avail themselves of these privileges which would "instil in them the principles of virtue." While on this subject let me take occasion to say that by this time it should be known far beyond the confines of this university that Mr. Jefferson expressed the hope that the various religious bodies would establish theological seminaries in the neighborhood. In this he thought of the benefit they might derive from the use of the University library as well as its courses and scholastic functions; as also the mutual uplift to be realized through the interpenetration of the faculties and students. This suggestion was but another indication of that shrewd practical sense that marked the great statesman. The Presbyterians of the North know only too well the advantage that has inured to them through the long affiliation of their seminary with Princeton University. In the same way, Union Seminary in New York profits immeasurably from its proximity to Columbia University and its terms of reciprocity with that institution. And who can doubt that if this suggestion had been heeded there would have grown up here a great community to shed luster incalculable upon the church, the state, and the general cause of education? But while this hint was not acted on, his general religious attitude became rooted in the consciousness of the institution. Under any circumstances, in its past history the University of Virginia could never have been anti-Christian or even non-Christian. It was essentially Virginian and Virginia has been a Christian commonwealth. Indeed the whole Southern people were practically a Christian people and out of Christian homes and Christian churches came the men who thronged its halls. But be it repeated once again, from the beginning there was no attempt to discourage religion, but only to make it free. In this respect the earliest wishes have been realized. Throughout the whole history of the religious activities of the University of Virginia they have been a free-will service. The earliest devotional exercises of which we hear are the prayer-meetings that were held in the various pavilions of the faculty. The University was formally opened in 1825 and these prayer-meetings must have been inaugurated, if not at the opening, at least in no very long time thereafter. But the matter of regular religious services at the University became a growing concern with the members of the faculty and three years after the formal opening, that is to say in 1828, they made an appeal, not as an organized body but as individuals, to the pastors of the several churches in Charlottesville. The latter consented to arrange a system of weekly services and accordingly, in the same room in the rotunda that was used for lectures in law, mathematics and languages, these pastors, so far as we know, faithfully fulfilled their agreement as best they could with very inadequate provision. As time went on, however, those most interested felt that the system was inadequate to the needs of the institution and determined upon the voluntary support of a chaplain who should give all his time and strength to a University ministry. He was called for a period of one year when he was obliged to give place to a representative of a denomination other than his own. Up to the year 1837 they continued to use the same room in the Rotunda. But in that year, upon the vote of those interested, one of the professors drew up a petition which set forth not only the desirability of a building suitable for religious purposes, but also declared that this poorly equipped room could accommodate not more than half of the student body. For some reason this petition failed of presentation to the Board, but it is supposed that its contents became known. At all events during that year the south-east room of the Rotunda was converted into a chapel. From the year 1833 to that of 1848 chaplains continued to serve each for a single year. They were carefully taken in order from the four denominations of the State, that is to say from the Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian and Episcopal. In the latter year the term of service was made two years instead of one. So these four churches supplied the chaplains in order down to the year 1896. In the fall of that year the chaplain-elect conducted one service which proved his last as well as his first: he was overtaken by death in the following week. This unexpected issue was the occasion for discontinuing the old system. In that year it was abandoned for another. When one considers what must have been an inherent difficulty in finding good men who were willing to fall out of line in their own churches to accept the chaplaincy for so short a term, it is surprising that the system yielded results so satisfactory through the long period of sixty-three years. Few mistakes appear to have been made and these not of great moment. On the whole they formed a long line of intelligent and consecrated men and in not a few instances their high character and gracious influence abide to this day as a delightful tradition in the life of the University. For many years the beautiful church on the lawn, erected by voluntary contributions, has stood as a monument to the service of the chaplains and the free-will method of religious endeavor in this institution of learning. But the history of the progress of religious worship in this university cannot be appreciated without reference to a particular movement which had its rise as early as 1858. I refer to the organization of a branch of the Young Men's Christian Association. That was a year in which the religious feeling was greatly quickened among Christian communities over the world. This had extended to the churches in Charlottesville and had been much felt among the students of the University. Previous to this epoch there had existed an organization among the students known as the "Society of Missionary Inquiry." The avowed aim of this society was not only the cultivation of the Christian graces in its members, but also the furtherance of genuine missionary activity. So for a number of years prior to the formation of the Young Men's Christian Association, student prayer-meetings, initiated and maintained through their own efforts, were held regularly on Sunday afternoons: a Sunday school for white children and one for negroes were kept up in the college buildings and the students went out into the Ragged Mountains, to the county Poorhouse and other places to conduct Sunday schools and teach religion as occasion might offer. The society under which these activities went forward, rather seemed to regard itself as a branch of the work of the college chaplain, feeling responsible to him as its head and looking to him for approval. But for a considerable time it had been felt that the various religious activities might be better coördinated and the avenues for usefulness multiplied by the organization of a college branch of that fellowship among young men which was already becoming well known in the life of many of the larger cities of England and America. It was in the early summer of 1858 that several meetings were held with this interest in view and in the opening of the ensuing college year, the first college branch of the Young Men's Christian Association was launched. That it was indeed the first has, I think, been conclusively shown in the paper of Dr. Hugh McIlhany on the subject which was published some years ago. In the case of the rival claim it was found that the society in question became a part of the Young Men's Christian Association only in recent years. For many years it was but a college religious society such as existed in numerous institutions. But at this place it was formally determined to take the first step in this direction. The constitutions of the Associations of London and Boston were secured and with them as models the constitution of this branch was carefully drawn. The object of the Association, as stated in this constitution, was "the improvement of the spiritual condition of the students and the securing of religious advantages to the destitute points in the neighborhood of the University." Its organization seemed to prove effective from the first. It provided for a "standing committee," consisting of twenty members at the least. These were selected from the various boarding houses of the University and, in the words used by the Association itself, they were expected to "exert themselves to interest their respective districts in the objects of the Association and labor to induce all suitable young men to connect themselves with it; to endeavor to bring their fellow students under moral and religious influences by securing their attendance at prayer meetings, and also to take in charge all contributions for benevolent objects." The early history of the Association shows remarkable prosperity. In no long time the attendance upon the religious exercises had increased to a wonderful degree and each Sunday found as many as fifty young men actively engaged in the Sunday schools round about or in missionary work in the surrounding country. For the first two years its enrollment was large and in these early days it opened a library for general use. From the first it commanded the adherence of students whose character and ability gave them influence in the University community. Very soon after its organization its career was sorely disheveled by the shock of the Civil War. During those awful years the fires at the Institution almost went out. But through them all the flame of the Young Men's Christian Association, though flickering, continued to burn, and when the halls of the University filled up again, it was ready to renew its life in the various activities it had originally undertaken. Through many years it held on its course and influenced for good the young lives that were touched by it. Naturally as to its position and influence amid the changing scenes of university life, it met with vicissitudes. But eventually, in the providence of God, the evolution of circumstances placed it upon a permanent base and gave to it a commanding eminence. The voluntary system of worship, with its chaplains in residence, had resulted in the erection on the grounds of a church building between the years 1883 and 1885. After the building of this chapel the same system continued in force up to the year 1896. We have seen that in that year the chaplain who had just been elected and was beginning his term, suddenly died. As this event left no chaplain either in fact or in prospect, the thought of those in authority recurred easily to a subject which had been under consideration at various times, and it was finally determined to follow the example of many other institutions by calling a young man to be Secretary of the Young Men's Christian Association and at the same time to act as a sort of college pastor and to arrange for Sunday chapel services by clergymen invited from a distance. In the fall of 1900 was begun the practice of keeping the visiting clergymen in residence for the period of a month instead of a single Sunday. I recall that it was my privilege to inaugurate this experiment in spending here the opening month of that session. Two services were held each Sunday in the chapel and, in the same place we had prayers every afternoon in the week at five o'clock. During the week I had the opportunity of mingling familiarly with faculty and students. As I look back through the years I am conscious that among the large number of happy visits made to this greatly loved spot, the memory of none is more tenderly cherished than of this one to which I advert. I believe, however, that the difficulty encountered in finding men who could arrange their affairs so as to make so protracted a stay was very great and the undertaking did not long survive. In 1896, then, instead of securing a chaplain to replace the one who had died, the first General Secretary of the Young Men's Christian Association was called. From this period the organization entered upon a more vigorous life than it had ever known and assumed a new position of influence among the students of the University. In 1902 the late Dr. Hugh McIlhany was travelling Secretary for the International Committee of the Young Men's Christian Association. He became much interested in the University Branch, conceiving that it occupied a position of peculiar importance. The subject of a concentrated and sustained effort to provide a suitable and worthy building had already been broached and, a vacancy occurring at this time in the office of local Secretary, he was glad to accept the position and entered upon a period of five years of fine and fruitful service. Several acres of favorably situated land had already been secured for this purpose. Through the persistent effort of the new Secretary in availing himself of the influence of persons prominent in the operations of college associations, in no very long time Madison Hall arose, beautiful to the eye and invaluable for its end. This building was the gift of Mrs. William E. Dodge, of New York. It was dedicated on October 18, 1905, on which occasion the invocation and benediction were offered by men who were of the founders of the Association in 1858. Nothing in the construction and equipment of this building was left undone that could contribute to its efficiency in serving the purposes it was designed to fulfill. It was opened with a library of one thousand well-selected volumes. As was expected, this building became at once the religious headquarters of the University and it has served a noble purpose during the years of its existence. While complaint may at times be made that the growing power and position of the Young Men's Christian Association have interfered with the religious activity connected with the chapel, yet we fancy no one would care to reëstablish that activity if the price demanded were the lessening of the efficiency of the work represented by Madison Hall. It should be mentioned in passing that in October, 1908, the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the University Young Men's Christian Association was impressively celebrated. Thirty of the original members still survived in that year and nine of them were able to be present and participate in the ceremonies of the occasion. In the morning a sermon was preached on the benefits of coöperation as exemplified in the Young Men's Christian Association, and following the sermon an historical sketch of the Association was read. At four o'clock in the afternoon a service of song was held in Madison Hall at which brief addresses were made by various representative persons. In the same place in the evening was held a service reminiscent in its character at which addresses were made and letters were read from old members who were unable to be present. On Monday morning a service was held in the old post-office building which was originally Temperance Hall. It was in one of the upper rooms of this building that the University Branch was organized in 1858. And here was photographed a group of the founders in attendance. But no survey of the history of religious influence at the University would be adequate without attention to one of the most significant of its movements: a movement which resulted in the establishment of a school of Biblical Literature as a constituent part of the institution. As far back as the year 1892 a missionary board of one of our denominations began the execution of an idea with which it had been for some time concerned. It provided funds to sustain a so-called "Bible Lectureship" at the University of Michigan. This was in pursuance of the purpose of establishing such lectureships at state universities in general. Unless I am mistaken only four of these came into existence and, in order of time, the University of Virginia was second. This lectureship simply threw a competent Bible instructor into the institution to go at his own charges and find subjects for tuition as best he could. It could do no more. State universities not only declined to make any provision for the study of the Bible, but some of them had direct legislation against it. It was found by those who had the work in hand that students who were driven from day to day with work required by those who would win degrees, had to be extraordinarily earnest if they were to choose voluntary study no matter what the nature, where it would require regular appointments and count for nothing upon their college work. However it may have been at other places where the experiment was tried, it is certain that the results of the lectureship at this university were not such as to encourage the lecturer or those most interested in the outcome of the effort. As a consequence the friends of the movement, within a few years, fell vigorously to work to transform this lectureship into a professor's chair. At the outset and on its face this enterprise seemed almost fantastic, but in the event, through the generosity of friends combined with the liberal policy of the Board which had given the lectureship, a fund was raised for the endowment of this chair. In 1909 final steps were taken to make it one of the regular schools. As in the case of the other schools, its work is elective, but like them also this work is accepted in the attainment of a degree. The history of this chair has been one of growing prosperity and popularity. Its courses are open to graduates as well as those of the academic schools and, as the incumbent is told upon his induction that it is desired that he conduct, under the auspices of the Young Men's Christian Association or otherwise, Bible classes for those unable to take the regular work, it will be seen that every facility is provided for those who wish to study the Bible. Indeed if a student wants nothing to do with the Bible it may be said that he is obliged to go a long way around in order to avoid it. May it not be said, in the same way, that throughout the whole career of this university, if a student has wanted no contact with religion, he has been compelled to go a long way around in order to avoid it. For to the influence of those activities that have been described must be added that of the many members of the faculty who have been shining lights in their generation and have made these walls more sacred because they lived and wrought in them. Many of them not only exhaled the atmosphere of a life hid with Christ in God, but they spoke the words of this life with power. Across the years there come to us the voices of McGuffey and Cabell, of Minor and the Davises, of Kent and others as those of great defenders of the truth and distinguished preachers of righteousness. In this address I have refrained from the mention of individual names excepting where they were virtually necessary to the story. And this because I felt that time would fail me to tell of the valiant part played by the many heroes of our history. But as we touch the subject of the Christian influence of members of the faculty, I may be permitted to speak of one who as student and teacher has been with his Alma Mater through the greater part of her history, who has seen generation after generation as they came and went and whose presence in the evening of life continues to be the benediction it has always been. None who has been associated for long with the University but has been glad that it was given him to know Dr. Francis Smith. A tree is known by its fruit and we believe that in their attitude towards religion the alumni of the University of Virginia are hardly behind those of other educational institutions. They have occupied positions of eminence in all the walks of life and frequently have been as marked for their Christian allegiance as their intellectual ascendency. Large numbers of them, moreover, have occupied places of honor and leadership in the various branches of the Christian ministry and have gone with the Gospel to all the corners of the globe. From China and Japan, from India and Africa and from the islands of the sea rise the voices of devoted men and true who hail this university as their Alma Mater. Truly her voices is everywhere heard and her line has gone out into all the world. Let us pray for her prosperity and peace. May she be in the future, as in the past, a city set on a hill. May she so command the devotion of her sons that her efficiency shall be greatly increased. Above all, by God's good grace may she so keep her gaze fixed upon the hills from whence cometh her help that in the future, as in the past, there may issue from her many streams to make glad the city of God. A PROPHECY OF AMERICA By Henry van Dyke, D.D., LL.D., D.C.L. And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their Governor shall proceed from the midst of them. Jer. 30: 21. This prophecy of a divine charter for democracy has been strikingly fulfilled in the history of the United States of America. Twenty-eight Presidents have led the republic, all good men, and several of them great men,—a better record than any royal house can show for the same period. This proves that the so-called divine authority of kings is certainly not superior to the providential guidance of the people's choice in producing worthy rulers. Doubters of democracy, take note! Popular election is not an infallible method. But for the highest office it works better than the mechanism of princely marriages. Another thing about the Presidents of the United States is significant and not generally known. Every one of them, with a single exception, has come from pre-revolutionary American stock,—those plain people who crossed the ocean when a voyage meant more than a mild adventure in seasickness, to face the perils of a vast wilderness, and to win liberty and living for themselves and their children. This proves that though our country may have become to some extent a "melting-pot," the American hand and spirit still direct the process of fusion. So may it be until by common education and united work the last hyphen is melted out, and a mighty people emerges owing an undivided allegiance to America and to God! Of all our Presidents not one was more emphatically American than Thomas Jefferson. He has been called the "Father of Democracy." He would have preferred, I think, to be called its son. Born of its blood and Academic Procession to Vespers, First Day of Centennial nursed upon its milk, he was a lover and a leader, a truster and a defender of the plain people of his land. True, he also loved France. But from 1776 to 1921, a grateful love of France has been one of the qualities of real Americanism. True, he was an educated man, familiar with the philosophy of liberty, and well-read in its ancient and modern literature. But it was not from books that he drew his faith. It was from the soil whence he sprang and the folks among whom he was bred and brought up. Contact with them enlightened him, convinced him, inspired him. He knew that they were trustworthy, fit to rule themselves, and he was determined that they should do so. For their liberties he was willing to fight, in time of war, against foreign oppression. For their rights he was willing to contend and work in time of peace, against domestic oligarchy and the domination of the money power. It was on this issue that he came to the presidential chair, and for this he was mistrusted and abused by those who were not liberal enough to understand that, in a free country, the only conservative force is an equalhanded justice. Popular government; no class privileges; personal liberty within the bounds of common order; home rule for all the States, not separate but indissolubly united; a nation strong by virtue of the strength of its component parts; sound finance instead of kiting; trade not stifled by artificial barriers; and peace, so far as in us lies, with all mankind,—these were Jefferson's ideas. By them he led the young Republic for eight years, and gave to her future course a direction which, pray God, will never be permanently altered. He was an idealist, of course. All our great Presidents have been that, and all of them have been reproached for it. But somehow or other these idealists, men of the tribe of that dreamer Joseph, have had the faculty of making many of their dreams come true. And if by reason of the jealousy of their brethren they do not realize at once all their lofty ideals, they have at least the knowledge that heavenly lights have shone upon them: 'Tis better to have dreamed and lost Than never to have dreamed at all. Without the vision the people perish. Our true leaders have not been controlled by narrow considerations of self-interest, but by the loftier view of a "People guided by an exalted justice and benevolence," by the larger hope of "America first," not only in wealth and power, but also in the councils of the nations for the peace of the world. This has been the star of our Presidents from Washington to Wilson. This we trust will be the leading light of our present honored Chief Magistrate. The positive and practical achievements of Thomas Jefferson are not always remembered. Careless of his own fortune to the point of negligence, he had an ideal of financial integrity and solvency for his country by virtue of which he was able to pay off thirty-three million dollars of public debt,— a sum as large for those days and conditions as thirty-three billion would be for the United States of to-day. He had a vision of what he called "an Empire for Liberty," and by the peaceful means of purchase he expanded our national territory from the Alleghanies to the Rocky Mountains, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. He was the first to propose a League of Nations to enforce peace in the Mediterranean, and, though his scheme did not go through as planned, he was also the first to send an American fleet into foreign waters to put down the pirates of North Africa. He said truly, "Peace is our passion," and therefore he was willing to fight in its defense. He was opposed to "entangling alliances," because he wanted something larger,—a coöperation of all nations for the good of the world and the progress of mankind. Such were the ideals and aspirations of this eager and enthusiastic man. If he sometimes made mistakes in working them out, that was only human. It is better to be sometimes mistaken than to be all the time dead. Let us turn now for a moment to consider the three things by which he desired to be remembered: that he wrote the Declaration of Independence, and the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom, and that he was the Father of the University of Virginia. Mark you, these are in a way very simple things. They are not glittering political or military victories; they are triumphs in the realm of the spirit; they are pure offerings on the altar of Liberty. Mark also, and mark it well, they are not disconnected and haphazard things. They are closely and inevitably woven together in the unity of the spirit and the bond of peace. They are made of one stuff and dedicated to one purpose. The Declaration of Independence is a profoundly religious document; a gospel of human rights as conferred by God, and therefore inalienable, and a definition of human government as deriving its divine authority from the protection of those God-given rights. But how shall men understand their rights and learn how to use them wisely in harmony with the rights of others, unless they are taught to see clearly, to reason rightly, and to will nobly? Popular education is the first and greatest need of a republic. Without wisdom and discretion the sovereign people are but as a flock of sheep or a drove of wild asses. Therefore he that supports schools and establishes colleges is a strengthener of the foundations of democracy. But that will not be so if education is controlled and dominated by external authority, by the enactments of political senates or the decrees of ecclesiastical councils. The mind of man must be free to seek, to find, to embrace and to follow the truth, by observation in science, by reasoning in philosophy and government, and by conscience in religion. There is no other way, nor is there need of any other. An opinion enforced is a foreign body in the mind and never becomes part of it. A creed imposed is a treason to faith, a mockery of piety, and an offense to God. He has seen fit, in His great school of life, to make religion an optional course and worship a voluntary exercise. Therefore religious liberty is essential to the doctrine of Christ, who said, "if any man will come after me let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me." Jesus would have only willing disciples, and to them He promises, "Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free." My brethren, the fundamental convictions of Jefferson are in harmony with the spirit of Christianity, which is a democracy of souls under the sovereignty of God and the leadership of Christ. In these latter days we have special need to revive these convictions and hold them fast, for the safety of the republic and the welfare of religion. Secret and dangerous heresies are at work in our times. We are in peril of forgetting that the main object of government is not the imposition of national uniformity, but the protection of the individual in his rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We are in peril of forgetting the supreme importance of common education in a democratic state. With our lips we do reverence to it, but in our deeds we are apostates. We are spending more for fleets and armies than for schools and colleges. We are paying our plumbers and carpenters more than our teachers. We are blindly allowing a generation, white and colored, to grow up on our land, ten per cent. of whom can neither read nor write, and forty per cent. of whom have no real conception of the fundamental rights and duties of freemen. The republic is not safe under such conditions. To breed ignorance is to beget disaster. We must reverse our course. We must devote more of our wealth and effort to the education of our people than to any other national purpose. We must cultivate "preparedness" not only for the exceptional emergency of war, but also and more resolutely for the permanent and normal demands of peace. We must build our national defenses in the character and intelligence of our young manhood and womanhood. The pestilent diseases of Bergdollism and Brindellism must be extirpated. Not only our schools and universities but also our homes must be places of training for the serious responsibilities of American citizenship. Fathers and mothers, as well as teachers must take their part in the building of those living, spiritual bulwarks of enlightenment and patriotism by which alone our country can be safeguarded from the ruinous revolts of ignorance, the bold assaults of demagogues, and the insidious usurpations of gilded arrogance. And what of religion, that sustaining and restraining power, that sense of a personal relationship between man and God which ennobles every daily duty and inspires every noble sacrifice? Never has our country needed it,— pure, potent, undefiled,—more than she needs it to-day. Materialism,— wealth—worship in the form of pride or in the form of envy,—ungodly devotion to the things that perish in the using is the vice of the age and the enemy of the republic. Without religion democracy is doomed. But how shall we revive religion, how sustain and spread it? By authority and power, by pains and penalties for unbelief, by stricter censorship of opinions and conduct, by compulsory worship and blue law Sundays? Nay, beloved, never was faith fostered, nor church prospered, by such means. "Conscience is God's province." With the first table of the Ten Commandments civil government has nothing to do; only with the second table is it concerned. What man does to his fellowman law may regulate; how he stands with God is his own affair. Sunday is a beautiful park wherein the state keeps order that the people may find rest: the Sabbath is a holy Temple in the park, wherein those who will may enter to find the joy of worship. My friends, what we need is not less devotion to Christianity, but more confidence in it. It is not a weakling demanding shelter, nourishment, propaganda from the state. It is a vigorous, God-reliant religion, manly in its strength, womanly in its tenderness, sure that Christ is the love of God and the power of God unto salvation. It was born in the open air; it was taught on the lake-shore and the mountain-side; it travelled the dusty road on foot and clasped hands with every seeker after God; its supreme, triumphant sacrifice was offered on a green hill, beneath the blue sky, among sinners and for their sake. Get back to that, tell men that, live by that, and Christianity will revive to bless democracy and make it safe for the world. THE SECOND DAY The exercises of the second day of the Centennial consisted of the presentation of greetings by delegates from other institutions, the dedication of a tablet memorial to alumni who died in the World War, a reception to delegates and other guests at the President's House, and the acting of the Pageant in the Amphitheatre. The program of events on this day follows, with the text of all the formal addresses except those by the Governor of Virginia and the President of the University of Missouri, the manuscripts of which were not furnished the committee by the speakers. The complete text of the Centennial Pageant is included.

A Pageant presented in the Amphitheatre ADDRESSES ON THE SECOND DAY ADDRESS OF WELCOME TO THE UNIVERSITY By President Alderman Governor Davis has welcomed you to the Commonwealth of Virginia. I shall not seek or hope to add to the graciousness of that welcome, but I may venture to focus its friendliness upon this particular spot in the Commonwealth—this University which here to-day inaugurates this celebration of remembrance and hope in commemoration of the One Hundredth Anniversary of its birth, and which I take leave to describe as the highest intellectual achievement of an old and distinguished American state. It was founded by a lover of human freedom whose political philosophy was based upon absolute faith in the ultimate wisdom and integrity of trained men. Guided by sincere scholars who held that faith in their thinking and lived it in their lives, stamped with opulent beauty of form and girt about with fair landscapes and encircling hills, it has been at work during one century, distinguished above all other centuries, perhaps, for its fruitful pursuit of justice in society and truth in science. In peace and in war, amid all the vicissitudes that beset free men threading their way to higher destinies, here it has stood a steadfast thing of force and dignity striving to augment the forces of nature and to ally them to the uses of mankind, to mix beauty with strength in the framework of democracy, and to establish in the life of the great republican experiment enduring standards of personal integrity and public virtue. What contributions it has precisely made to American civilization belong to the educational history of the nation, and these have been recently set forth with sympathetic skill and faithful accuracy by a distinguished son of this University. We have yielded to this very human impulse, characteristic of institutions as well as of men, to mark a milestone in an endless career, not primarily to recite the glories of the past but to envisage the responsibilities of the future. We recognize in this air the ethical binding force of that reverence for the past without which there can be no true continuity in human institutions. We believe indeed that all healthy growth somehow proceeds out of the tissues of ancient strength, but our enthusiasm is for the future and our vision is a vision of potential youth of this and other ages pressing forward to carry on the work of an ever better world. In behalf of the Governing Bodies and Faculties of the University of Virginia, I, therefore, welcome you to this birthday festival: Delegates of Universities and Colleges, representatives of Learned Societies and Foundations in this and other lands, guests of the University, and in a way of peculiar affection, sons of this mature and vigorous mother, those whom the years have whitened, those who bear the work of the world in the middle period, and these young scions who climb about the knees of Alma Mater in love and gaiety. I am aware that thousands of miles and centuries separate you in space and time. Institutions are represented here to-day which were venerable when our continent lay unknown in these western seas, while others have sprung into life in answer to the cry of democratic need in the last decade; but, nevertheless, it is as a homogeneous family that I welcome you—a brotherhood of cultural force and endeavor, a fellowship of scholars, blood kin in intellect and purpose, holding the promise of the future as they have yielded the fruit of the past. Whatever we have to offer of personal affection and esteem, of historic significance, of memories of old eager teachers who showed to by-gone generations "the high, white star of truth," of present hope and intent, is yours, my colleagues. We who now serve these Virginia altars are heartened by your presence and sympathy, enlightened by your counsel and stimulated by your example. Standing upon the lintels of a new age, the University of Virginia is as of old still glad to learn and glad to teach. Like Ajax praying for light to see his foeman's face on the darkness of the Trojan plain, we humbly ask Almighty God for strength and opportunity to face whatever is before us with enlightened minds, organized wills, and uplifted hearts. RESPONSE BY PRESIDENT CHANDLER OF THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY Friends of the University of Virginia: We are deeply grateful to His Excellency, the Governor of Virginia, and to the President of this University for their eloquent words of welcome. We thank them sincerely for giving us the opportunity to be present at this renowned institution as participants in this history-making celebration. On this centennial occasion it is a privilege to speak for the colleges of Virginia. We rejoice that our University, through a hundred years of activity, has contributed so much to the educational development of the State, and has furnished so many leaders to Virginia and the United States. We are deeply grateful that its centenary does not mark old age and a decline, but a ripening into vigorous youth, giving promise of a period of more useful activity and of wise promotion of education in many fields. No words of mine can depict the deep sense of pride that we have in this institution. On such an occasion one can but think of educational conditions before the founding of the University. At the opening of the Revolution there was but one institution of higher learning in Virginia, the College of William and Mary, then nearly one hundred years old. But with the Declaration of Independence, an impetus was given to higher learning, for it was generally thought that in a Republic all men participating in its affairs should be trained for the performance of their rights as citizens. The further desire to prepare men for service to the church and to society in general, resulted in the beginnings of Hampden-Sidney in Prince Edward County, and Liberty Hall at Lexington, later Washington College, and still later Washington and Lee University. These three institutions, William and Mary, Hampden-Sidney, and Washington and Lee are the only Virginia institutions of college grade antedating the University of Virginia. George Washington had dreams of a national university, and in his will he bequeathed fifty shares of stock in the Potomac Company for the endowment of a university to be established within the District of Columbia. To Washington College, he likewise made a gift of stock with the hope that at Lexington would be maintained an institution which would prepare young men for the national university. Washington's idea of a university was a national school of politics and administration. According to Herbert B. Adams, "It was an idea born of the old College of William and Mary, where capitol and college faced each other, and where the statesmen of Virginia had been trained for their great work of liberating the colonies and of framing the Federal Constitution. The idea of a national university grew in Washington's mind with his own official connection as Chancellor of William and Mary." Before Washington became an advocate of a national university, another great Virginian was urging the establishment of a university for his own State, "although there was nothing provincial in his advocacy." He conceived of a university separated from politics and located in a small town where young men would not be subjected to many temptations—an institution around which there would cling something of a monastic spirit—a university bearing marks of an educational system found at Geneva and at Oxford and Cambridge. This great Virginian was Thomas Jefferson, who is justly entitled to be called the "father of the University of Virginia." This University, to quote again Herbert B. Adams, "is clearly the lengthened shadow of one man. But William and Mary College was the Alma Mater of Thomas Jefferson. There at Williamsburg, in intimate association with a Scotch professor of mathematics and philosophy, with a scholarly lawyer (George Wythe) and with the Governor of the Colony, Thomas Jefferson received his first bent towards science and higher education, towards law and politics—the fields in which he afterwards excelled. Jefferson's first idea of a university for Virginia is inseparably connected with his proposed transformation of William and Mary College, of which, as Governor of the State, he became ex officio a visitor in 1779." I wish it were possible at this time to review the full significance of the year 1779 in the educational history of America. Speaking briefly, in this year, the College of William and Mary took the name of university, established the honor and elective systems, introduced the teaching of modern languages, and established a school of law and a school of medicine. These steps in American education, introduced through the influence of Jefferson and the two Madisons, have revolutionized higher education in America. However, Jefferson's bill of 1779, in favor of transforming William and Mary into the University of Virginia, failed of passage because William and Mary had been the college of the established church and the various denominations represented in the Virginia Legislature would not vote public money for such an "establishment, however noble and worthy. Non-sectarianism was one of the deepest foundations in the political establishment of higher education in Virginia." It was much easier, therefore, for Mr. Jefferson and his friends to establish a new institution. In a letter of 1814 to Peter Carr, President of the Board of Trustees of Albemarle Academy, Jefferson wrote: "I have long entertained the hope that this, our native State, would take up the subject of education, and make an establishment, either with or without incorporation, into that of William and Mary, where every branch of science deemed useful at this date should be taught in its highest degree." In this letter Mr. Jefferson outlines a plan for the elementary schools preparatory to the "general" schools, which in turn should prepare for the professional schools, incorporated in the university. In 1817 a bill barely failed in the General Assembly to establish a complete system of primary schools, academies, colleges, and a university. This bill proposed that the trustees or visitors of the then existing colleges of William and Mary, Hampden-Sidney, and Washington should be invited to become a part of this system. Jefferson's conception of a University of Virginia was a place where all branches of useful sciences could be taught and where men could be trained for the professions. He said: "To these professional schools will come the lawyer to the school of law; the ecclesiastic to that of theology and ecclesiastical history; the physician to those of the practice of medicine, materia medica, pharmacy, and surgery; the military man to that of military and naval architecture and projectiles; the agricultor to that of rural economy; the gentleman, the architect, the pleasure gardener, the painter, and the musician to the school of fine arts." He also favored a school of technical philosophy and said: "To such a school will come the mariner, carpenter, shipwright, pump-maker, clock-maker, mechanist, optician, metallurgist, founder, cutler, druggist, brewer, vintner, distiller, dyer, painter, bleacher, soap-maker, tanner, powder-maker, salt-maker, glass-maker, to learn as much as shall be necessary to pursue their art understandingly, of the sciences of geometry, mechanics, statics, hydrostatics, hydraulics, hydrodynamics, navigation, astronomy, geography, optics, pneumatics, acoustics, physics, chemistry, natural history, botany, mineralogy, and pharmacy." It was not intended that this university should be a school of aristocracy but a seminary of learning to which men preparing for all professions or vocations would come. The marvel is the vision of the great master mind. Founded on so broad a conception, the University may be expanded as the needs of the people demand and as our civilization changes. Speaking for my own college and the other Virginia institutions of higher learning—state, private, and denominational—we exult in the original conception of the founder of this University, a conception looking to instruction in all fields of useful knowledge, and we pledge to the University our assistance in the promotion of education for the State. The raison d'être of a State university was well expressed by President Burton in his inaugural address when he said, "The function of the State university is to serve the State and through the State to serve the nation and the world." Through the hundred years of its life the University of Virginia has clearly demonstrated that this ideal is the goal of its ambition. Its usefulness is being expanded daily by its recognition that much of college work in the State should be done by institutions already chartered and giving standard degrees. This does not mean that the University should discontinue its college work but should insist, as it does, upon higher standards both for entrance and graduation. The sister institutions are further gratified that the University is holding firmly to Jefferson's desire to establish a correlation between the University and colleges of such a character that the colleges will become "feeders" to the University. This ideal is vital to all, but it calls for strenuous efforts to develop extensively the graduate departments of the University. The growth of the University is of paramount importance to the State and such plans as look to the expansion of the schools of engineering, education, business administration, law, and medicine; to the establishment of a bureau or bureaus of investigation and research, and to extension courses within reach of the people in various parts of the State, are gratifying evidences of the broadening influence of this institution of which we are so justly proud. We know that all these movements demand large expenditures for equipment and for personnel, but we believe that the people of Virginia are ready to be taxed for all progressive proposals on the part of its University. Mr. President, coming from an institution that is the Alma Mater of the founder of the University, and speaking for it, speaking for Washington and Lee University which owes, to a certain extent, its development to the gift from the great Washington, speaking for the ancient college of Hampden-Sidney and for the State institutions and the other institutions of higher learning, which have been established since the University of Virginia, I bring on this joyful anniversary greetings and expressions of grateful appreciation of the wonderful influence upon learning that this institution has exerted in the State and nation. We realize that this University has in many ways ministered faithfully to the educational needs of our State and country. We appreciate the high ideals that you and the Board of Visitors have for this institution. We delight in its growth and expansion. We rejoice in the prospects for an increase in its endowment and facilities. On this Centennial anniversary we declare to you our readiness to coöperate (From left to right) President Chandler, of the College of William and Mary; Ambassador Jusserand; President Lowell, of Harvard University; President Hill, of the University of Missouri; Rector Bryan, of the University of Virginia with you in your ambitions and in the superb efforts that are being made to promote culture and to prepare men and women for leadership in the State, the nation, and the world. We are yours to command for the accomplishment of the cherished purposes for which this University was established, for in those purposes we have an abiding faith. RESPONSE BY PRESIDENT LOWELL OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY It is a privilege to speak for the endowed universities of this country at the celebration of the one hundredth anniversary of the University of Virginia, founded by the philosopher-statesman, and architect as well. Here he lived during the struggle for independence, whereof he wrote the charter; and here he returned after his labors for the new-born nation, in France, as Secretary of State and as President. In his later years of well-earned repose he lit here a beacon to diffuse the light of learning he held needful for the people he had served so long. The examples of such far-sighted men as he, have been followed, until to-day, a host of lights are shining over our whole country from shore to shore. The oceans that guard our land are the only things upon the planet that man does not, and cannot, change—symbols of eternity, eternally in movement and eternally at rest. In this they typify the human spirit, unchangeable yet ever changing; and the universities, which embody that spirit in its most refined and keenest form, should ever be centers both of continual movement and of rest. Bound together in a common cause, quickened by a common aim, faithful to a noble trust, our universities and colleges are constantly calling with their bells throughout this broad land—calling to one another to serve the needs of the present time, and to prepare the way for generations yet to come. Your bells have called, and we, representatives of the great brotherhood of scholars, have come to pay our tribute of respect to this university, venerable in years, but ever young;—more vigorous and more youthful as the years roll on. We come to tell you of our faith that, large as have been her services in the century that is past, the University of Virginia, in the century that lies before us, will be greater in works, in influence and in renown. RESPONSE ON BEHALF OF FOREIGN UNIVERSITIES BY HIS EXCELLENCY JULES JUSSERAND, FRENCH AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED STATES I am most happy that it is my privilege to answer on this auspicious day and to offer congratulations, on behalf of foreign institutions, among which are those of France. The French feeling for the founder of the University of Virginia was of the warmest. Jefferson had studied our philosophers, spoke our language and spent five years among us as the diplomatic representative of the newborn American Republic. The sympathy was reciprocal. "I do love this people with all my heart," he wrote from Paris to Mrs. John Adams in 1785. The early prospects of our own Revolution filled him with joy, and he took pleasure later in recalling those feelings, when the first guest from abroad, Lafayette, was received by your University, and dined in your hall, with Jefferson and Madison in 1824. In the letter pressing him to visit what he calls "our academical village," Jefferson reminded this early friend of America of the far-off time, when, one evening they, with some "other patriots, settled in my house in Paris the outlines of the constitution you wished." Secretary of State, he saluted the birth of our first Republic in the warmest terms, assuring us that the citizens of the United States considered "the union of principles and pursuits between our two countries as a link which binds still closer their interests and affection." This union of principles and affections, after half a century of republican institutions in France, is closer now than ever before, as was evidenced, not by words, but by momentous deeds in the recent glorious past. When the longing for independence had been fulfilled in this country, the longing for the spread of knowledge became preponderant among the leaders of the nation. I wish, Jefferson said, our people would "possess information enough to perceive the important truth that knowledge is power, that knowledge is safety, that knowledge is happiness." An immense country with untold possibilities was to be developed; and two conditions for success were indispensable: on the one hand, the pluck, energy, clever understanding of fearless pioneers; on the other, knowledge. The nation had the first, not the second; it realized, however, its lack and its chiefs resolved that the gap should be filled. Peace was not yet signed, and Independence, just won, had not been consecrated, when, as early as 1782, "the President and Professors of the University of William and Mary," that famous institution where both Washington and Jefferson had studied, the honored mother of the most famous of the literary societies, the Phi Beta Kappa, sent to Rochambeau, still in America, an address couched, they said, "not in the prostituted language of fashionable flattery, but with the voice of truth and republican sincerity," saying: "Among the many substantial advantages which this country hath already derived and which must ever continue to flow from its connection with France, we are persuaded that the improvement of useful knowledge will not be the least. A number of distinguished characters in your army afford us the happiest presage that science as well as liberty will The French Ambassador, Dr. Henry van Dyke, and Other Notables acquire vigor from the fostering hand of your nation. . . . You have reaped the noblest laurel that victory can bestow, and it is perhaps not an inferior triumph to have obtained the sincere affection of a grateful people." It was a fact that in Rochambeau's army one general was a member of the French Academy, Chastellux, chief of staff, a great friend of Jefferson, and that Rochambeau himself was able to use Latin in order to talk with learned men in America ignorant of French. This Virginian suggestion was the beginning of an intercourse which has expanded considerably since, to the advantage of America, of France and of other countries. For the solution of the problem and the spread of knowledge in the United States, the two leaders, happened to be the chiefs of the two political parties, federalists and antifederalists, unanimous however on this question, both twice presidents of the United States; both sons of Virginia, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. The two had dreamt a dream that was not to be fulfilled in the way they had imagined. They wanted a National University, ranking above all others, and giving only instruction of the highest order. Washington bequeathed to the institution that was, he thought, to reach one day that rank, the shares of the Potomac and the James River companies which he had received as a gift from his native State and which he never intended to apply to his own uses. Jefferson, when President, proposed to Congress in his sixth annual message the resumption of the same plan, and as subsidies would be expected from every State he recommended the vote of an appropriate amendment to the Constitution. The National University was not to be, but the University of Virginia was to be and now is, greatly improved, increased and invigorated. With what love and devotion he fostered it, all know. It was his last great service to his country, one of the only three he allowed to be mentioned on his tombstone, where he is described as the "father" of this same University. He had indeed for her a fatherly love; describing it as "the last of my mortal cares," paying attention to every matter of importance and also to every detail; anxious about the selection of professors, the attendance of pupils and the style of architecture. Abroad, he wrote with pride "they have immensely larger and more costly masses but nothing handsomer or in chaster style." Professors were sometimes in those far-off days the cause of trouble; he complains of some who teach Latin and pronounce it in such a way that you do not know whether they are not speaking Cherokee or Iroquois. Students too have their faults, or had in those times, but all told, the undertaking is a success, and with pride again he could write "A finer set of youths I never saw assembled for instruction." We feel confident that if he were to appear suddenly among us to-day, and have a look at the successors of those he knew, he would use the very same words. He conceived, even from the first, that, although for certain branches of learning, he had to depend on professors from abroad, yet American universities could even then be of use to European youths. In 1822 he wrote to a friend of his who was American minister in Lisbon that the young people from over there might come with profit, and get "familiarized with the habits and practice of self-government. This lesson is scarcely to be acquired but in this country, and yet, without it, the political vessel is all sail and no ballast." This was indeed the lesson that without the need of any university, it is true, or of any teaching other than those of events and examples, all those enthusiastic young men who had come from France to fight for American independence took home with them. At the time of our Revolution they were foremost in asking for equality and for the abolition of privileges, Lafayette, first among them and Rochambeau with him, Marquis and Count though they were. Now the fight for knowledge is won. While continuing to learn, America can also teach; she is one of the nations in the vanguard of civilization as regards learning and discoveries. Her universities, libraries, laboratories, scientific periodicals are the envy of more than one foreign nation. She not only receives professors from abroad but sends out some of her own, who are received with open arms—and open ears. They say things worthy to be remembered and they increase the respect and sympathy every liberal nation owes to theirs. An even more telling proof that the problem is solved and that America has come to her own in the matter of learning, is the high appreciation in which are held, in every country, the medals, prizes or other tokens of appreciation she may choose to bestow. Those tokens sometimes are the sign not only of her appreciation of merit but of her inborn warm-heartedness and generosity, as when, the other day, having heard that the discoverer of radium possessed no radium she presented a gramme of the rare substance to Madame Curie, the presentation being made at the White House by the Chief of the State, in a speech that went to the heart not only of the illustrious lady but of the whole of France. To all this, foreign institutions render homage: they are glad to think that their good wishes for you are sure to be fulfilled. What a man like Jefferson founds is certain to prosper; and it is a good omen for the University of Virginia that the man who secured her charter was also the one who wrote the Declaration of Independence. A FEW REPRESENTATIVE GREETINGS Out of a large number of greetings only a score, because of space limitations, are included in this volume. The original copies of all greetings may be seen in the University Library. Greetings from the University of Cambridge L'UNIVERSITÉ DE PARIS À L'UNIVERSITÉ DE VIRGINIE Monsieur le Président: L'Université de Paris vous apporte, en ce jour mémorable du premier centenaire de votre Université, ses compliments et ses voeux. Un professeur étranger se sent de suite à l'aise parmi vous et dans l'enceinte de votre "campus," car il n'oublie pas que vos premiers collaborateurs furent précisément des étrangers, arrivés comme lui d'Europe. Dès ses débuts, et, pour ainsi dire, avant la lettre, l'Université de Virginie réalisait ainsi cette liaison intellectuelle et scientifique entre l'Amérique et l'Europe, qui ramène aujourd'hui près de vous les délégués des Universités sœurs. L'Université de Virginie s'est fait, dans le pays américain, une réputation de charme irrésistible: je ne sais pas une autre Ecole, aux Etats-Unis, dont ses "alumni" parlent avec autant de tendresse émue. Assurément, la beauté des bâtiments et la douceur du climat ne suffisent pas à expliquer cette attraction, car il ne manque pas de constructions magnifiques et de sites choisis dans la liste des Universités américaines. Il faut, pour expliquer le charme que vous exercez, admettre qu'il y a quelque chose de plus que des causes ordinaires, et ce quelque chose semble bien être l'esprit de votre fondateur qui se transmet, révéré et enrichi, de génération en génération. Pour l'exprimer d'un mot, cet esprit de Jefferson, c'est l'esprit moderne dans son sens le plus généreux et le plus large. L'idée qui a été déposée dans vos murs avec la première pierre et la première truelle de ciment, c'est l'idee essentiellement moderne de l'égalité devant l'instruction. Sans doute, une université ne peut pourvoir à toutes les phases de l'enseignement, puisqu'elle s'adresse à une élite déjà préparée. Mais l'idée de l'instruction universelle qui hantait Jefferson dans le bouillonnement de ses jeunes années, était si féconde, encore qu'irréalisable à son époque, qu'elle a comme déposé un rayon de grâce et d'attirance dans le berceau de votre Université naissante. Lorsque les projets, prenant corps lentement, à travers les difficultés administratives et financières et les compétitions géographiques, se furent fixés dans l'esprit de Jefferson et des hommes de bien qui furent ses collaborateurs, on dut sans doute constater qu'une restriction avait été opérée, et qu'à l'enseignement universitaire était seulement dévolue la tâche d'assurer la culture "de la science à un haut degré." Mais en même temps, l'idée primitive reparaissait dans une formule indiquant le but à poursuivre, à savoir donner à chaque citoyen une instruction "en rapport avec ses ressources." Ainsi, dans votre pays à peine installè dans sa jeune liberté, une Université se fondait, tâtonnant à travers mille obstacles, mais guidée par ce fanal qui jamais ne s'éteint, le souci de former l'âme populaire. Voilà l'idée clairvoyante et généreuse qui a groupé vos disciples et qui pénètre de sympathie pour vous vos visiteurs du Vieux-Monde. Sans doute, la joie que nous éprouvons à nous joindre à vos fêtes ne nous fait pas oublier à nous autres universitaires français, la terrible épreuve que nous venons de traverser et l'hécatombe qui a fauché, parmi notre jeunesse, les rangs les plus lourds d'espoir. Elle ne nous fait pas oublier non plus le magnifique et généreux élan qui, parti de vos universités, a placé votre pays à nos cotés dans la lutte suprême. Mais nous savons aussi que la vie ne s'arrête pas à cause des deuils, et que l'herbe continue à verdir sur nos tombes même les plus chéries. Le flot des générations nouvelles monte sans s'arrêter les degrés qui mènent à nos salles, et nous savons que nous avons la charge de guider sans faiblir l'âme de ceux d'aujourd'hui et de ceux de demain, exactement comme si notre patrie ne venait pas d'être bouleversée par l'ouragan. Le passé, nous ne l'oublions pas, c'est notre bien à nous, c'est notre deuil sacré; mais nous ne voulons pas nous en laisser distraire dans notre vision de l'avenir. Laissez-moi donc vous assurer, Monsieur le Président, que l'Université de Paris est, sans arrière-pensée, profondément heureuse de fêter avec vous aujourd'hui votre anniversaire de joie et votre grand élan d'espérance. Le spectacle de la jeunesse et de la vigueur de votre Université est bienfaisant pour nous, car ces vertus nous garantissent que vous comprenez comme nous l'aspiration commune qui doit nous unir, celle de préparer, pour nos pays respectifs et pour le monde, un avenir de lumière où la science règne, pacifique et large,—et en même temps un avenir de génerosité scientifique répudiant à la fois l'esprit de domination et l'esprit d'orgueil, qui sont la négation de la recherche, telle que la conçoivent de libres citoyens. Le Professeur, Délégué de L'Université de Paris, (Signed) Jules Legras. Le Recteur, Président du Conseil de L'Université de Paris, (Signed) Paul Appelly. The President, Fellows and Faculty of Yale University send their greetings to the University of Virginia, and congratulate its officers and alumni on the completion of one hundred years of distinguished service to the cause of the Arts and Sciences. They recognize that no American University has had higher standards for degrees than the University of Virginia, and that few institutions have done so much to train men to take their part as leaders of citizenship in the Nation and its constituent commonwealths. Intimately identified as it is with the immortal name of Jefferson and with many men prominent in literature, scholarship, and public life, such as Poe, Maury, Kane, Wilson, Davis, Gildersleeve, Tucker, Minor and Venable, the institution has an unchallenged position in the front rank of that small group of historic universities of national significance and influence. The University has fully justified its founder's purpose as interpreted by President Madison "to make it a nursery of republican patriots, as well as genuine scholars." The officers of Yale University have rejoiced at the progress made by this ancient University "born of the union of human enthusiasm and civic impulse" during the brilliant administration of President Alderman, and hope and believe that it may serve the Commonwealth of Virginia and the Nation with equal distinction during the generation to come. In the necessary absence of President Hadley, Rev. Anson Phelps Stokes, D.D., Secretary of the University, has been duly appointed Yale University's delegate and will present these greetings and congratulations. Anson Phelps Stokes, Secretary. Arthur Twining Hadley, President. [The University of Liège] ILLUSTRISSIMÆ UNIVERSITATIS VIRGINIANÆ PRÆSIDI S. P. D.

The Corporation and Faculty of Brown University extend to the University of Virginia, on its hundredth anniversary, greeting and felicitation. No institution of the higher learning has affected American education more vitally and fruitfully than the University of Virginia. Your original ideals and purposes were distinctly different from those animating the colleges and universities of the North, and because you were different you have helped us all. More than seventy years ago the great president of Brown University, Francis Wayland, seeking to effect certain changes in New England education, was drawn to the institution founded by Thomas Jefferson. On returning from his memorable visit he wrote his famous "Report to the Corporation" of 1850, which was like the sound of a trumpet echoing through the quiet valleys of New England. From that day Virginia began to make its notable educational contribution to the Northern States. We of Brown University greet you at the beginning of your second century. May increased resources bring only increased devotion to the early purpose of your distinguished founder, and may the fraternal interchange of ideals and methods among American colleges grow with the growing years. (Signed) William H. P. Faunce, President. June 2, 1921. OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY The Ohio State University felicitates and congratulates the University of Virginia upon the happy and honorable completion of One Hundred Years in the service of Higher Education and expresses the hope that the Centennial Exercises may deepen the interest in the Old Dominion and to the Country rendered in the Century now past by the distinguished men who have constituted the Faculty. The Alumni have taken a high place in the history of the Country representing in many instances the most distinguished citizenship of the Nation. The spirit of the scholar has never departed since the illustrious founder, Thomas Jefferson, laid the foundations of American Scholarship devoted to the public service. The University of Virginia in a very real sense a monument to his genius is at the same time a testimonial of the men whose untiring energies have sustained the ideals of Jefferson. The President, Trustees and Faculty of Ohio State University greet with enthusiasm their colleagues in the University of Virginia and have commissioned Professor Rosser Daniel Bohannan, Class of 1876, University of Virginia, and for thirty-four years Professor of Mathematics at Ohio State University, to bear these greetings and to represent the University in the Centennial exercises. By the authority and direction of the Trustees of The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. (Signed) William Oxley Thompson, President of the University. April 28, 1921. THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON To the University of Virginia: The Royal Society of London sends to the University of Virginia its most cordial congratulations on the Hundredth Anniversary of its Foundation. Its long roll of alumni contains the names of many who have enriched Natural Science and other branches of knowledge, of many who have advanced the cause of learning, of many who have played a distinguished part in affairs of State. Through these men the University of Virginia has contributed to the intellectual heritage of the English-speaking race, and to the civilization of the whole world. That the future of the University of Virginia will be no less illustrious than its past is the sincere hope and confident belief of the Royal Society of London. (Signed) Charles S. Sherrington, President. (Signed) W. B. Hardy, (Signed) J. H. Jeans, Secretaries. Burlington House, London, W. 1. THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION TO THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Greeting On the occasion of the centennial celebration of the University of Virginia, the Smithsonian Institution most heartily congratulates the University on its hundred years of prosperity and usefulness, its long line of achievements in broadening knowledge in the learned professions, and on its rolls of teachers and students bearing so many names of men of eminence whose lives have honored their university and their country. The Smithsonian Institution, founded for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men, extends to the University of Virginia its well wishes for an even greater usefulness in the field of learning during future centuries. (Signed) Charles D. Walcott, Secretary. May 28, 1921. THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA UPON THE OCCASION OF ITS ONE HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY The most of the greetings conveyed to-day are from sister institutions of learning. This, from a library, cannot claim quite equal rank; for a library, though it contains certain of the elements of an institution of learning—an essential apparatus, and, in a sense, a faculty—lacks others equally essential; it neither prescribes a system of studies nor imposes authority in their process, with deliberate selection, towards a definite end. Its greeting cannot, therefore, bring the sympathy of a like experience in identical problems. But the Library so-called "of Congress" has a concern for learning far beyond its immediate privileged constituency. It is a library "for research"; it has a paramount interest in the promotion of that research—everywhere— whose end may be the widening of the boundaries of knowledge. And its effort is to extend its resources freely and fully in aid of this. It does so chiefly through the Universities; and its interest is keen in the prosperity and progress of these. Having, itself, the duty to conserve and make useful the records of the past, it especially rejoices in an institution who so persistently honors and links itself with the past as does the University of Virginia. In addition to these general motives it has a unique sympathy with this occasion from the fact that the universality of its collections and the seriousness of its aims are preëminently due to Jefferson himself. The very foundation of its present collections was Jefferson's own library; it was Jefferson who named it "The Library of the United States"; and it was the comprehensiveness of his selection, the largeness of his view, and his confident faith in a democracy of learning, that, establishing thus early its character and purpose, have assured its development into a library truly "national." It therefore shares with you the shadow of the great Founder. May that Shadow never grow less! Washington, June the first, Nineteen hundred and twenty one. VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY TO THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Greetings To the University of Virginia, now celebrating the Centennial of her founding, Vanderbilt University sends greetings and congratulations. The rare beauty of buildings and grounds, the high standards and ideals of scholarship, the adoption from the beginning of the principle of freedom of electives, and the maintenance by the student body of the honor system, have rightly won for her the admiration and praise of all American institutions. The prestige of past achievements is the surest guarantee of her future success. That she may command the resources necessary for the extension of her work and influence is the earnest wish of her younger sisters, who covet the privilege of coöperating with her in the making of a greater nation. (Signed) J. H. Kirkland, Chancellor of Vanderbilt University. Nashville, Tennessee, June 1, 1921. GREETINGS: In her Centennial Year Celebrated May 31st, to June 3, 1921, to the University of Virginia the first in America to grant a scholarship to students from the University of Belgrade which was shattered in the World War, Our greetings are sent to you officially through Rosalie S. Morton, M.D., of Virginia, the Founder and Chairman of the International Serbian Educational Committee from our Executive Committee, Advisory Board, and the students who are now studying in schools, colleges and universities from Vermont to Texas and from Massachusetts to California with heartfelt gratitude and appreciation of the world comradeship of American educators, among the greatest of whom for all time, Serbia honors the name of Thomas Jefferson A LETTER TO THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA FROM THE RICE INSTITUTE In accepting the invitation of the Rector and Visitors and the President and Faculty of the University of Virginia requesting the presence of a delegate from the Rice Institute during the exercises in celebration of the one hundredth anniversary of the founding of the University to be held on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, May the thirty-first to June the third, nineteen hundred and twenty-one, the Trustees and Faculty of the Rice Institute have pleasure also in announcing the appointment of Mr. Stockton Axson, Litt.D., L.H.D., LL.D., Professor of English Literature, to represent on so auspicious an occasion in the history of University education in America the youngest of educational foundations in the South, and to bear to the University of Virginia, Alma Mater of men and of universities, cordial greetings of congratulation and good-will from the Rice Institute, a university of liberal and technical learning founded by William Marsh Rice, and dedicated by him to the advancement of Letters, Science and Art, by instruction and by investigation in the individual and in the race of humanity. And these cordial greetings carry also grateful recognition of several reminders of his ancient university which an alumnus of Virginia may discover in the environment of the new institution in Texas: a campus site of spacious dimensions and a comprehensive architectural plan of dignity and distinction; the spirit of research and teaching housed in a home of extraordinary beauty as well as of more immediate utility, and the features of the founder of the University of Virginia cut in stone among the effigies of its patron saints in the more humane letters, ancient and modern, and the fundamental sciences, pure and applied; a society of scholars seeking solutions of the universe of thought and things, and a guild of students living a common life under the restraining influences of an honor system of self-government: these reflections of academic traditions that flourished in Virginia's early history: and Faith and Freedom: here the freedom of the plains, as there the freedom of the mountains: here, as there, faith in the capacity of human intelligence to find in human experience firm foundations of hope for the human spirit: and here as there, the freedom vouchsafed by a heavenly vision of service towards which men may well press forward, heartened by whatever of progress our civilization may have already achieved towards Justice, Security, Tolerance, Knowledge.

TO WORLD WAR HEROES Invocation offered at the Dedication of the Memorial Tablet by Reverend Beverley D. Tucker, Jr. Almighty and everlasting God who art the author and giver of life, and who in all the ages past hast inspired the sons of men with a sense of their heritage to become sons of God; we yield Thee hearty thanks for this our Alma Mater, who under Thy divine guidance has been a maker and molder of men. We give Thee thanks for our fathers who, in a former day, went forth from this place to give their lives for home and country. We give Thee thanks for these our brothers who, in this latter day, went forth in this same exalted spirit that freedom might not perish from the earth. We commend them, O God, to Thy fatherly care and protection, and pray that their names emblazoned here may shine in our hearts as the stars forever, that the cause for which they died may yet through us prevail. O Thou strong Father of all nations, draw all Thy great family together with an increasing sense of our common blood and destiny, that peace may come on earth at last, and Thy sun may shed forth its light rejoicing on a holy brotherhood of peoples. We ask it all in the name of Him, who is the perfect Son of Man and the eternal Prince of Peace, Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. REMARKS OF THE PRESIDING OFFICER, LIEUTENANT COLONEL CUTCHINS (Introducing Captain Barksdale) It is a beautiful and an inspiring thought that the first assembly of the alumni of the University of Virginia, returning to celebrate the completion of Alma Mater's one hundred years of service to State and Nation, should be for the purpose of doing honor to, and perpetuating the memory of, those former students of the University who gave their lives in order that the ideals for which their Alma Mater always had stood might endure, and who, by their death, exemplified the daily teachings and the loftiest traditions of this University. No graver charge can be lodged against any country than that it is ungrateful to those who have fallen in its defense, or neglectful of the obligation to perpetuate their memory. That the names of those immortal sons of Virginia who willingly have given their lives in order that that civilization, for which the University of Virginia has stood for a century, might be perpetuated for unnumbered centuries yet to come, shall not go unrecorded and unhonored, is due to the zeal, the loyalty and the patriotism of the classes of 1918, 1919, 1920, and of the Seven Society. Those classes and that society have earned not only the thanks of the great body of the alumni, but they have earned as well the thanks of the countless thousands of Virginia students who in the years that are to come will walk these paths, and, walking here, will stop to read the names of that immortal company, and, reading, will be inspired to go forth and so conduct themselves in the world of men that the cause of civilization may be advanced, and that they too, in time, may merit and win the thanks of Alma Mater. One indeed treads upon sacred ground when one attempts to interpret to the living the voices or the wishes of those who have passed beyond, but I make bold to say that if that silent company who are to-day bivouacked "on fame's eternal camping ground" could give expression to their sentiments, they would bid me say that it is a source of satisfaction to them that this Tablet Memorial is to be presented in their honor by one who himself has inhaled the smoke of battle, one who himself has engaged in hand to hand conflict with the foe, and one who has borne the seemingly endless vigil of the long nights before the days of battle. That my old comrade of the 29th Division, who will present this beautiful tablet to-day, meets fully those requirements I personally can testify. Nor need I give personal testimony, for the government of the United States has recognized that fact officially, by awarding him the Distinguished Service Cross for three separate acts of exceptional gallantry on three different days of battle. It is therefore with much pleasure that I present Captain Alfred Dickinson Barksdale, who now will present this Tablet Memorial to the University of Virginia. ADDRESS OF CAPTAIN A. D. BARKSDALE, PRESENTING THE MEMORIAL TABLET Thousands of miles away upon the friendly bosom of a sister republic lie these heroic sons of Alma Mater. Filled with the loftiest ideals known to mankind these modern Argonauts sailed three thousand miles to engage in the mightiest conflict since the creation, and with their fellows they cast their deciding weight into the balance on the side of humanity. In that vast cataclysm which so recently enveloped the earth many there were who made sacrifices, who gave of their time, of their means, of their blood—but these have given their all; they have given their lives. Only a few short years have passed since they in the fullness of their strong young manhood were capable of standing here as we stand and feeling that thrill which contact with this noble old Jeffersonian structure always inspires. It seems as if it were but yesterday when they moved among us, and made life brighter by their presence. But to-day their places are vacant and we are gathered to honor their memory. From far and near we have gathered to print their names in everlasting bronze upon the walls of this Rotunda. But nothing that we do here or can ever do will add anything to their glory. Their names have been ineradicably enrolled upon the great American Roll of Honor. Those of us who knew them will always bear their memory fresh in our hearts until we are called over yonder. But our days are numbered and as we grow old and fulfill our allotted span we shall wither Tablet Memorial Unveiled on Second Day of Centennial as the grass. "They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old; age shall not weary them nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning we will remember them." When we are gone generations yet unborn will honor them. I know of no more priceless heritage to one entering these portals than to be able to point to this tablet and say, "I am descended from one of these." In the early days just after America had aligned herself upon the side of freedom and right, throughout the land there was a feeling of uncertainty whether or not we Americans untried in war were capable of withstanding the fierce onslaught of the Hun. The whole world stood anxiously watching to see how Americans would stand the test. How they went through their trial by battle, how they underwent their baptism of fire is now writ large upon the glorious pages of the history of the world. And we are gathered here to-day to place upon the walls of our University the names of her sons who gave their all that their country's honor should be unsullied and to show the world that Americans could still die for their country. Since we cannot fathom the infinite we can never know why the grim reaper as he stalked over the battlefields and army camps chose these. Sometimes it seems as if it were all wrong; that only the best were taken; that there must have been some great mistake somewhere up in the infinite. But I think not. One night on the bank of the Meuse just after dusk, when the guns were roaring and the shells were crashing everywhere, and the whole world seemed in an uproar and confusion, I chanced to turn my eyes upward and in the heavenly firmament above, countless myriads of stars shone down upon the earth beneath; each one in its accustomed place unmoved, unperturbed and imperturbable. Then over me surged the consciousness that somewhere there was a Supreme Being who ruled over the battlefield, who guided the destinies of mankind, and directed everything according to His infinite plan, and although at times it seems that since the war both nations and people have grown more selfish and subject to petty jealousies, surely such sacrifices could not have been for naught. If we keep faith with those who lie beneath the poppies, surely the world will be a better place because of their sacrifices. It was my privilege to serve with one of those whose names are written on this tablet, Robert Young Conrad. In a few minutes his daughter, who has never known the depth of her father's love and whose little body will never be held in her father's strong arms, will assist in the unveiling. Together we marched through the black night of October 7, 1918, to our position in advance of the French lines from whence we were to attack at dawn. The gloomy, drizzly night which disspirited many rather heightened than dampened his spirits. "The very night for us," he said, "we can get ready without being observed." Arrived at our position we lay down for a few hours' rest on the wet hillside. Before the first rays of morning light he called to me that it was time to place our troops in order of battle. As the day slowly broke I could hear him calling to his men and placing them in their respective positions. At dawn the roar of our barrage and the shrieks of the shells overhead burst upon our ears. At zero hour he moved off in the midst of his men and I could hear him calling to them with words of encouragement and cheer. When the shells of the enemy's counter barrage began to fall I could see him here, there and everywhere strengthening and encouraging his men. Finally he disappeared over a hill and I never saw him again. Hearing that one of his platoons had been halted by a murderous machine gun fire, without a moment's hesitation he hastened to lead them in the charge and fell mortally wounded. He was carried unconscious to the rear and died in the little village of Glorieux, near Verdun. Aye, at Glorieux, he met death gloriously. It would take too long to recount the daring and unselfish exploits of all of them, but whether they were called when soaring above the clouds as Jim McConnell or while in the execution of some more prosaic task, in the death of each one of them surely there is a glory incomparable. Free from all that is mean and petty they went to meet their Creator inspired by the noblest impulses known to mankind. They were taken at the high tide, at a point where regard for self sunk into nothingness, and devotion to the cause reigned supreme. "Don't bother with me, go ahead," murmured one of them with his last conscious breath. Although they loved life they did not fear death. Doubtless all of us when filled with the romance of youth have read with bated breath of heroes who met death with a smile and wondered what sort of divine clay they were molded of. But we need wonder no longer, for here is the roll of Virginia's sons, our brothers, in whom were inculcated the principles of right and justice and duty, so that when the call came, they did not hesitate but hastened cheerfully to lay down their lives, and if they had any regret it was for those they loved and left behind. Death is always a solemn thing and perforce sad, but for these, our fallen comrades, we should repress our tears and rather let our souls swell with pride in the glorious heritage they have bequeathed to their Alma Mater. No one of these generous unselfish souls would ever wish sorrowful tears shed for him. I believe that Alan Seeger, that valiant American who also lies over there, expressed the wish of each of these when he said: "Honor them not so much with tears and flowers, But you with whom the sweet fulfilment lies, Where in the anguish of atrocious hours Turned their last thoughts and closed their dying eyes, "Rather when music on bright gatherings lays Its tender spell, and joy is uppermost, Be mindful of the men they were, and raise Your glasses to them in one silent toast." Mr. Rector, we present to you for the University this tablet "in memory of the sons of this University, who gave their lives for freedom in the World War." May its presence here always be an inspiration to Virginia's sons and may it stand forever as a proof that amongst the sons of this University 'tis counted a glorious thing to die for one's Country. ADDRESS BY JOHN STEWART BRYAN, RECTOR OF THE UNIVERSITY, ACCEPTING THE TABLET On this porch, a little more than half a century ago, were gathered students in whose ears still sounded the drums and tramplings of the War Between the States. There, in graven bronze, are five hundred and fifty names of those who marched forth under the flag of Virginia, and died in the defense of their homes. Here are the memorials to their fourscore younger brothers who in their day and generation heard the shrill bugle, and gladly followed the call of duty. The sad sagacity of age has taught us that nothing built with hands can "hold out against the wreckful siege of battering days," and yet we place this tablet on the walls of this century-old Rotunda in response to a wish that lies deep in the heart of humanity. That desire to enshrine beloved memory beyond the changes and chances of time is one that has come to all men everywhere. Every heart has its inner shrine. To the university's great altar we bring to-day this frail barrier against the engulfing tides of oblivion. Size is not the measure of our memorial. The Pyramids of the Nile have no such spiritual import as the most obscure cross in Flanders field. And who can compute the power that gave this tablet its long roll of the Knights of the University, the champions of pure liberty, the Galahads of pure manhood? When those boys were born, the possibility of international conflict belonged to the limbo of "Old, unhappy, far-off things, And battles long ago:" and war seemed as far removed from the peaceful course of their lives as volcanoes are from the calm Blue Ridge. As those young men grew up, they saw nearly one half of our revenue being spent for works of peace, and now 95% is poured out for war, past, present and to come. What was it in those boys that throbbed in response to the drumming guns? Why was it then that those boys heard in these quiet shades the blare of the war trumpet, when older and wiser heads still dreamt of peace? What was it that called into instant action their aptitude for command and their instinct for war? It was the glorious atavism in the blood of men whose fathers and forefathers endured pain, darkness and cold at Valley Forge, or stormed the heights of Chapultepec, or set new standards for military genius and personal bravery at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg. The blood that gave that type is coursing in the veins of Virginia. The inspiration that controlled those lives is still potent. Experience could have seen that those great spirits needed but the revealing touch of death's finger to show that like their elder brothers of Virginia blood they, too, when "Stumbling on the brink of sudden opportunity, Would choose the only noble, God-like, splendid way!" Heredity alone will not explain the achievements of these sons of the University. It was blood, yes, but it was training; it was heredity, but heredity developed by environment; it was the soul of the South and the traditions of the University of Virginia that made perfect those gentlemen unafraid. It was not the Prussian drill master, but the Virginia school master, that inspired those students and fortified their souls and liberated their intellect. Those boys lived in the last unpoliced institution on earth. No guardian was set over them here at the University, except the guardian of conscience; they were tried and tested by the unwritten code of gentlemen; they were electrified by the powerful spiritual currents that flow unimpeded through the halls and arcades of this great school. No law bound them except the law of honor, and by their lives, as by their death, they proved again that an ideal is not only the most noble, but also the most useful possession that an institution may give or a nation receive. They had eaten the bread of Virginia in which lived transubstantiated the soul and body of the whole nation. They found that to be a gentleman was at once the crown and the sanction of life, and they showed by their willingness to die that the certainty of sacrifice is the guerdon of greatness. The glory that radiates from that tablet is the glory of the spirit of the University of Virginia. The shining faces of those sacred dead have caught the light of honor, and that flame will never perish from the earth while the memory of their deeds endures. Nor is the radiance theirs alone. Its light is upon us, too, for we who stand here this afternoon are in a very real sense members of that mystical body of Virginians who, living and dead, have fashioned the soul of this Commonwealth. By ties of blood, by the unifying influence of race and The Unveiling of the Tablet Memorial to World War Alumni tradition, by the welding force of a common ideal, by the impress of the same youthful enthusiasm awakened and amplified at the University, our hearts are one with theirs. We grasp with an appreciation that far transcends any power of reason what it was that made their lives luminous and their deaths not in vain. We dedicate this tablet, and with swelling throats and uplifted hearts we turn again to the common tasks of daily life. That bronze memorial stands immobile and silent; of itself it can do nothing; it is we alone, and our lives alone, that can make it a vitalizing force. It is we, and we alone, professors, alumni, students and citizens, who can surcharge that noble scroll with an ever renewing energy. And this we can do by so living that the spirit of those youths shall never be a stranger in these halls. For only the souls of the living can make and keep the University a congenial home for the souls of the dead. This is no easy task. Our right to claim companionship with those shining exemplars must be won in conflict with the hosts of darkness, even as theirs was won. In the reeking trenches of France, in sweating camps, and silent hospitals, across barbed-wire, and under the whirlwind of shrapnel or the thunderclap of T. N. T., the sons of the University won their right to be brothers in arms with the mighty men of all ages, who, from Thermopylæ to Château-Thierry "Had done their work and held their peace, And had no fear to die!" Many of us were not in uniform. Oh, never mind the reason, for each heart knew its own bitterness when the angel with the flaming sword passed by; but all of us can be brothers in spirit with those whose virtues we revere, and whose names we commemorate to-day. Like them, we can face our duty without flinching; like them we know what high adventure America sought in entering the war, and for them, as for ourselves, we can repel the base slander that America made her stupendous effort not to save her soul, but to save her skin! It is not the expenditure of Forty Billions; it is not the long rows of 75,640 silent dead that sleep in Belleau Woods and elsewhere in France, that mark the full extent of the price we paid. Ah, no! America's contribution is not in shot-torn troops, but in shattered ideals; our loss is not in men and money, but in morale and faith. And the mere fact that such a calumny on the ideals of a great nation could be uttered by an ambassador who has continued unrebuked at his post is evidence enough that what America is suffering from is not poverty of goods, but destitution of spirit. And this tablet we dedicate to-day—if we ourselves do not keep faith with those who died for the soul of America—will not be a memorial, but a mockery and if we are not baptized with the baptism of those we commemorate, we will stand not as brothers, but as blasphemers before "That splendid fame this tablet watches o'er Their wars behind them, God's great peace before!" The souls of those men are here, radiant with imperishable glory, leading the way with strong exulting wing where we, with slow tread, must follow. How shall we name them all, and how shall we discriminate among those equals in valor of purpose and fortitude of execution? We cannot choose or pick among that chivalry—when all are calling to us to "Be true to the nation, be true to Virginia, be true to the spirit of the University,"— and by God's good grace, we will! REMARKS OF THE PRESIDING OFFICER, COL. CUTCHINS, INTRODUCING THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR As long as memory lasts, and whenever men and women shall gather together in any part of the world for the purpose of memorializing the names or the deeds of those who participated in the World War, there is one name that, above all others, will be in every mind—the name of France—France, glorious and immortal! On the beloved soil of our own Virginia there are scars, long since healed, that mark the burial places of soldiers of France who stood shoulder to shoulder with the soldiers of America when America was fighting for her liberty and for her existence as a nation; on the sacred soil of France there are scars, not yet healed, that mark the burying places of countless thousands of the sons of America who laid down their lives more than a century later to preserve not only the liberty and the national life of France, but to preserve civilization as well. These scars indicate ties which neither time nor circumstances can sever. It is indeed a happy coincidence that to this memorable ceremony at the University of Virginia, founded by Jefferson who, afterwards, was sent as an ambassador of the United States to France, there has come the distinguished Ambassador of France to the United States, to do honor to the memory of those sons of Virginia who have fallen in the greatest cause for which man ever has fought. He has graciously consented to express to us the sentiments of his countrymen on this occasion. I have the honor and the pleasure to present His Excellency, M. Jusserand, the distinguished Ambassador of France to the United States. [Note by the Editor.—As the eloquent address of Ambassador Jusserand was entirely extemporaneous, it was, unfortunately, not reported. The Ambassador very graciously consented to speak at the last minute in the absence of M. Gabriel Hanotaux who had hoped to be present.] THE CENTENNIAL PAGEANT THE SHADOW OF THE BUILDER By Mrs. Frances O. J. Gaither Foreword W. M. Forrest, Chairman, Pageant Committee. This pageant is the farthest possible remove from the historical pageant that seeks to visualize the development of an institution by a series of tableaux or floats reflecting various important episodes of its life. It has also chosen another way to reflect the spiritual element of the University's life than by the insertion in the pageant of allegorical interludes, or by an accompanying masque. It is a narrative of the way that Thomas Jefferson planned his University, both the body of it and the soul of it. About the struggle to get nothing but the best builded into the material structure of the University there is woven a simple but compelling drama. Nerving the great dreamer to make no compromise with the people who wanted something cheap and quickly put to work, nor with his own ardent desire to see the University open and at its task, were his visions of the young life yet to throng its colonnades. So into the story of a single day in the University's opening history the author of the pageant has packed all the hopes, and dreams, and struggles leading up to that day, and all the fruition of those hopes and dreams and struggles flowing down through a century of life. It was the day when Lafayette was entertained at the unfinished University upon his return, in old age, to the land to which in youth his sword had helped to give freedom. It was also the day upon which the Father of the University was confronted by the fact that his determination to have nothing but the best for his buildings involved another long delay, a new struggle with popular opposition and with the legislature to get more money. At every crisis of the debate with himself and others over this matter during the long day, compromise was made impossible to Jefferson by the visions he saw of youth—beautiful, ardent, truth seeking, honor loving, joyous, sacrificial youth, as it yet should live and be trained in the University. And so the decision to have his capitals of Carrara marble ended his struggle, and forever determined that his University would content itself with no less than the best, cost what it may. That the dreams of the old philosopher should be expressed in terms of Greek life is fitting. From classical architecture he drew inspiration for his buildings. The democracies of the Greek cities helped him in all his work and hopes for a free people. The untrammeled soul of Socrates gave him an ideal for the professors of his new temple of learning, and the beauty loving, truth seeking youths of Athens were such men as he fain would see crowding the colonnades and pavilions of his own athenæum. As the alumni and friends of the University of Virginia watch the unfolding of this pageant-drama they will not find its artistic harmony marred by any intrusion of historical scenes, such as the meeting wherein the honor system was inaugurated by faculty and students, nor the marching away of the student soldiers of 1861 or 1917, nor yet of the athletic struggles nor the Easter time festivities of their college days. Yet in looking upon the scenes wherein Socrates and his pupils discourse of the ideals of youth, and the young men, in solemn ceremonial before the altar, consecrate themselves to honor and truth, there must stir anew in the heart of every beholder that passion for truth and honor which has been the soul of the University throughout its century of life. And in song and dance to the accompaniment of martial music will be revived again the memories of those days when the men of the University met the acid test of patriotism and went forth to battle and to die upon the fields of Virginia and of France. Likewise will the echoes of bygone athletic combats and the festal strains of far-off Easter and Finals' revels resound in the corridors of memory as the dream figures of the pageant strive for the mastery, and mingle in their dances of youth and love. Nor will any fail to catch the vision into the true heart of youth flashing out from those scenes where the lads, engaged in high converse upon truth and the dedication of life to art and philosophy, to toil and battle, are instantly diverted to dancing and revelry by the sight of their "Helen of a thousand dreams." It was a far cry from that scene a hundred years ago where Jefferson struggled for the best for his University to the moment when that University gave to the cause of world freedom its many valiant sons. But it all seems shadowed forth amid the rising walls of a new temple of learning and freedom when Jefferson and Lafayette met and the flags of America and France mingled. None then could see when the khaki clad hosts of America would speak through the lips of their commander to the spirit of the old Marquis of France saying, "Lafayette, we are here." But a Jefferson could know that his athenæum, for which nought but the true and the good would suffice, would not fail to have ready, in every hour of the world's need, heroes of peace and heroes of war whose service would be all the more whole-hearted because they had whistled and danced and sung while pursuing truth and honor amid the cloisters and colonnades of the University of Virginia.

Beyond a green lawn dimly shows the façade of a low building. When the people have assembled, the music changes, the lights all about grow dim, and the façade ahead whitens into beauty. Against it forms with increasing distinctness, the shadow of the Galt statue of Thomas Jefferson. And then the shadow fades, leaving only its pedestal, a real, unfinished Corinthian capital of coarse stone. (Across the lawn come workmen. They fall to work; and as they pound their hammers and scrape their trowels, they sing:) If the walls shall be true, Then the stones must be true; And each on its fellow be laid By a hand that is skilled Heeding eyes that are filled With faith in the house to be made. Refrain Blow upon blow, blow upon blow, Build toward bending skies. Stone upon stone, stone upon stone, Lofty the columns rise. If the house shall be fair, Then the walls must be fair; And each one in beauty must stand. Crowned with cornices white, Pierced with portals alight, That house will give grace to the land. (Gorman, a workman of great stature, coming up from the lawn, goes to the blunt, half-shaped capital and inspects it in mock appreciation.) GORMAN Copied right out of one of Mr. Jefferson's pretty picture-books, every leaf curled just so. A WORKMAN (Laying down his trowel and smiling sarcastically.) But Signor Raggi is an artist, Gorman. He's no clumsy American stonecutter with thumbs for fingers. (Gorman leans against the stone and, lighting his pipe, indulges in un- couth mimicry punctuated by puffs of smoke. His audience drop tools and relax into attitudes of enjoyment.) GORMAN Ah, Signor Jefferson, how the American stone is brittle. It crumbles like cheese. In Italy, signor— (Such acclaim and laughter greet the intonation of this evidently familiar phrase that Gorman's voice is quite drowned; and only the exaggerated shrug of his great shoulders carries on the imitation. Raggi, a stone-carver of Leghorn, comes lightly up the steps from the lawn, blithely whistling a scrap of opera melody. He is a nervous person, whose jaunty breeches and scarlet cap atilt, stamp him as alien as his every syllable, liquid, vivacious.) RAGGI Good-morning, signori. You rest? Signor Gorman entertains you with a bit of pantomime. Yes? (He does not seem to notice that his airy greeting meets but surly, half-articulate response.) I must warn you: I have passed the proctor. (He smiles at the general scramble to resume work.) GORMAN (Alone scorning to stir.) Mr. Brockenbrough knows we are not loafers—Mr. Jefferson, too. (Raggi resumes his whistling, softly, and falls to chiselling the capital.) RAGGI Pardon. Just a little aside, signor, you delay my chisel. GORMAN Delay? Hm. And you trying stone from every quarry in Virginia for nearly twelve months—at so much a day. (Raggi's chisel slips. A sliver of stone cracks off and goes rattling to the floor. He whirls upon Gorman, mallet uplifted, face dark with anger.) RAGGI Me, an artist! You accuse! (Brockenbrough comes up from the lawn and steps between them. He is evidently weighted with a thousand cares.) BROCKENBROUGH What is this? RAGGI An infamy on my art! A cruel infamy! GORMAN Mister Raggi has spoiled another capital.—But he is used to that. Why should he get excited? (A shadow falls upon them, the natural, morning shadow of Thomas Jefferson who has come silently up the steps at the end of the terrace. Jefferson is a tall, old man in an old-fashioned, snowy stock, and suit of homely gray broadcloth. Before his steady gaze Gorman drops his eyes swiftly and turns away. The workmen doff caps in ready respect.) JEFFERSON Ah, Gorman. Good-morning, Mr. Brockenbrough. More trouble, signor? RAGGI (The angry attitude relaxing, his tone dropping to a plaint.) Madonna! The coarse stone, like cheese. I but tap it once, so. Crack! The work of weeks gone. (Cornelia, the granddaughter of Jefferson, following him, exclaims with sympathy at Raggi's ill luck. She is a wistful young person with great earnest eyes and she carries, as if it were most precious, a great portfolio in her arms. Going to the rough-hewn stone, she lays the portfolio down and touches with her finger tips the scar.) CORNELIA Is it quite spoiled? BROCKENBROUGH Chop off the curl of the leaf, Raggi. It will never be noticed—thirty feet aloft. RAGGI (Appealing to Jefferson in a shocked tone.) It will never be noticed. Yes? I shall—chop it? (Jefferson's only reply is a slow, sympathetic smile and an almost imperceptible shake of the head. He turns with a smile to the men at work and at the same time speaks to Brockenbrough.) JEFFERSON No holiday, Mr. Brockenbrough, even to welcome Lafayette! BROCKENBROUGH Every hour counts so—with all these buildings under way. JEFFERSON But it is here our neighbors of Charlottesville are coming to honor Lafayette. (Brokenbrough dismisses the men with a gesture. Pouring down on the lawn they clap each other on the back like hulking schoolboys turned out for the day. Raggi lingers uncertainly. Jefferson extends a hand to Cornelia.) My dear, let us give Mr. Brockenbrough the specifications and drawings we promised him. CORNELIA (Opening the big portfolio with immense precision and giving several drawings to Brockenbrough.) All except the Temple of Fortuna Virilis. That I have to shade. JEFFERSON (Smiling indulgently.) We are as jealous of presenting our conception in true artistic form as a Raphael, Mr. Brockenbrough. (Brockenbrough smiles, too, and bows his thanks to the serious young artist, but his manner is quite abstracted from the pleasantries of the moment.) BROCKENBROUGH (Anxiously.) Doesn't the work drag, sir? JEFFERSON Why, Mr. Dinsmore is putting up the modillions in his pavilion. BROCKENBROUGH At last. But Mr. Perry can't go on with the foundations of his until he has blasted that rock out of the way. Mr. Ware has not begun to burn his bricks. And now this! (He touches the capital with the sheaf of drawings.) JEFFERSON Remember, Mr. Brockenbrough, we are building not what shall perish with ourselves but what shall remain to be respected and preserved through other ages. If we do not finish this year or next or even in our life— BROCKENBROUGH But the months pile up so and I want to see the University open. JEFFERSON And I—if I might live to see it on its legs, (His voice trails wistfully into mild humor,) my bantling of forty years' nursing and growth, ah, then, my friend, I could sing with serenity my "nunc dimittis." (Brockenbrough seems much moved. He clears his throat twice and then abruptly changes the subject.) BROCKENBROUGH Shall I have Raggi try to redeem this— JEFFERSON (Firmly.) No. BROCKENBROUGH —or put him to helping Gorman hack out those door-sills? JEFFERSON (Smiling at Raggi's movement of horror.) Not on Lafayette's day. Wait. Some of the Visitors of the University will be here. Let us have their advice. (Brockenbrough goes off. Raggi comes forward eagerly.) RAGGI In Italy, signor, we use such coarse stone only for paving or for—how do you say?—what the big Gorman hacks out, ah, door-sills. The feet do not care. But the eyes, signor, the eyes are different. They look up to the capital. It is the crown of the house. It must be fair. It must be delicate, white— (He breaks off with a gesture of despair at the futility of English words.) CORNELIA Like clouds. RAGGI (Gratefully.) She understands. The capitals for your beautiful academy, signor, should be of marble. JEFFERSON Marble! (He begins a gesture of negation, but the suggestion plainly fascinates him. Back of them dawns an other-worldly light. Jefferson looks straight ahead of him, but his eyes are illumined. Cornelia's gaze, too, seems to change and soften. Raggi, alone unconscious of the vision, leans absently against the rejected stone. Shadows move through the radiance behind them, The Pageant: Jefferson and his Granddaughter shadows of such figures as might wreathe a Greek vase. There is the sound of foot-falls as light as falling leaves, a strain of far-heard pipes and timbrels. Then the shadows vanish, the light fades, and the timbrels are still.) No, Signor Raggi, no. Go before you tempt me! (He paces away along the terrace. Raggi goes off, but Cornelia follows Jefferson.) CORNELIA Marble capitals would be beautiful. (Shadows move again, and then the lovely shapes that made them, dancers, beautiful, undulating. When they are gone, Cornelia sighs gently and insists, half in statement, half in puzzled query, looking up into Jefferson's face.) And marble would be best. (Jefferson only smiles at her and leads her back toward the rejected stone where he seats her on the little campstool which up to now has masqueraded in whimsical wizardry as Jefferson's cane. She as by habit sits down to begin drawing. Her movements are absent, and even as her hands busy themselves with the paper her eyes follow Jefferson. He again walks away along the terrace. When he has reached the far end, she repeats her puzzled words.) Marble would be best. JEFFERSON (Halting to turn and look back at her as she sits, eyes grave, pencil poised.) But, my dear, how the very word would reverberate in legislative halls. Consider Mr. Cabell. CORNELIA Mr. Cabell would not mind. Is it not his "holy cause"? And Mr. Madison and President Monroe always— JEFFERSON Humor me. But— CORNELIA (Shutting the portfolio and going to him.) It is your dream. You cannot make it true with stone too coarse to be shaped. Think of the Pantheon. When it rises there at the end of your lifting line of colonnades, must it wear (Her voice breaks) for its crown chipped and broken stones? JEFFERSON Ah, Cornelia, I am not Pericles with tribute from a chain of subject states to buy me beauty. CORNELIA Just the capitals. Everything else of brick and wood and rough stones. But the capitals of marble. (They are standing at the farthest point of the terrace. Jefferson takes a little notebook from his pocket and computes rapidly, speaking the while more to himself than to her.) JEFFERSON Perhaps thirty all told. A small thing to a great state, something more than a score of marble capitals. But it would mean—more waiting. I could hardly hope to live to see it finished, our Athenæum—I have longed to hear it hum with an ordered throng of youths like those in the antique poet who sat so seemly as they read their Homer and so lightly ran their "laps beneath the olive trees." (Light, far footfalls, pipes and timbrels, moving shadows, and a row of swaying dancers, hands linked. Two youths come out on the terrace. One, the younger, runs down upon the grass to dance. The other drops to the steps where he half reclines as he looks on. Socrates, a bearded man with a long staff, strolls in and stands meditatively regarding the dance. Both youths nod to him affectionately; and the dancer moves in ever-decreasing arcs nearer and nearer to him.) SOCRATES The dance of Lysis has a meaning, I suppose, Phædrus, a meaning and a name? PHÆDRUS The Moth-dance. SOCRATES And the flame? PHÆDRUS You, to be sure. Are you not a purveyor of wisdom? SOCRATES (Sitting down and bestowing his draperies comfortably as for a long talk.) So it is wisdom the Athenian youth crave. PHÆDRUS Indeed. And their fathers for them. Men spend vast sums to get their sons education. SOCRATES What! Exchange solid drachmas for such a vapor! Dear, dear. And the men who receive all this money, the teachers—I suppose they but sit and hark to the boys con their Hesiod and Homer. (Lysis laughs aloud as he drops breathlessly to the steps at Socrates' feet.) LYSIS Oh, Socrates. PHÆDRUS Hardly. They must be men of learning and high purpose. Otherwise the youth would be corrupted. SOCRATES True. (He tells off one finger of his uplifted hand.) Learning and high purpose granted. Then the father, having found such philosophers and driven his bargain may go his way in peace. Of course the sages will seek out the young son, perhaps in the market place, and there, vying with cackling fowls and hucksters crying their fish and myrtles, they will press at the youth's elbow and pour wisdom in his ear. —No? Why not? It is paid for. A bargain is a bargain. PHÆDRUS (Moving his shoulders fastidiously.) But to learn in the noise and dust of the market-place! SOCRATES Then where? (Several youths come up. They stand listening while their attendant crouches apart, as by custom.) Phædrus here is about to tell us where it is meet that youth shall be educated. PHÆDRUS (In some embarrassment.) I hardly know. But the place must be beautiful, an academy of cool colonnades and— SOCRATES (Prompting.) Yes? PHÆDRUS And a lawn where (softly quoting) "the plane-tree whispers to the linden." SOCRATES (Telling off two more fingers.) A fair colonnade, whispering trees, learned teachers,—then surely the fathers may be easy now. All the sons will be wise. (The youths all laugh, and others press nearer. The terrace is filling with men of various ages, flowingly suggestive, in their easy grouping, of Raphael's School of Athens. Phædrus springs to his feet in his eagerness.) PHÆDRUS But, Socrates, a great deal depends upon the sons themselves. SOCRATES Why, they are only the vessels into which the oil is to be poured. (Low laughter from the listeners.) PHÆDRUS Even so, they must be good vessels, not leaky or—hideous. (Murmurs of approbation.) SOCRATES Beautiful vessels, too! O, Phædrus, how may we hope to make the students beautiful? PHÆDRUS By trainers, of course, by the wrestling-school, by racing, by jumping— (His words are drowned in the general applause. Socrates, with a good-natured gesture, admits himself worsted and turns away toward an elderly man, who promptly rolls up the papyrus he is reading to make ready for delectable talk. The boys toss off their mantles and run down upon the lawn. A trainer with his official staff and wearing a vivid striped mantle selects from the crowding youths a half-dozen to compete in a race. Slaves with oil-flasks make the contestants ready. They withdraw to the beginning of the race-course. There is a hum of eager talk and speculation. A host of youths pour in to see the sport. They crowd the lawn, but are pressed back from the line of the race-course by trainers. The contestants come running into view. Lysis is winner, and is at once caught up and borne back with bravos to the steps of the terrace to be crowned with laurel by a red-robed judge waiting there. The enthusiastic crowd presses in upon the little knot of athletes singing jubilantly:) Hail, heroes, hail! Weary, dusty, deaf to fame, Hear our pride in your acclaim: Hail, heroes, hail! Shake, stadium, shake! Shake, each solid, stony seat, Shake to thud of champions' feet. Shake, stadium, shake! Cheer, comrades, cheer! When our shout the stadium fills, Make its echo leap the hills. Cheer, comrades, cheer! (The terrace empties. The youths still singing mount to the slopes above the amphitheatre. The light on the amphitheatre grows dim, but the rosy glow holds.) Interlude Music in which blend strains familiar to University victory and prowess in athletics. (When the music is ending, the light fades. As the amphitheatre brightens again, Jefferson and Cornelia are seen still standing half-hidden by shrubbery. A man who is presently to style himself a plain American citizen, a voter, speaks officiously at Jefferson's very elbow.) VOTER Mr. Jefferson. JEFFERSON (Startled, recovers himself with an effort.) Sir, have I had the honor—? VOTER You do not know me. I am a plain American citizen, voted for you for President. I want a word with you. (Jefferson inclines his head at the implied obligation and gently disengages Cornelia's hand lying upon his arm.) JEFFERSON You will excuse us, my dear? (Cornelia drops a shy curtsey and goes toward a group of ladies who have come up from the lawn accompanied by servants with baskets. One of them greets her.) WOMAN Cakes for the banquet—and we have yet to slice them! CORNELIA Let me help. (They go inside.) VOTER I admire your political principles, Mr. Jefferson. I respect your age, but I must tell you that people are very dissatisfied with your building here— fancy ornaments, foreign labor, extravagance of all kinds—we want more closets and fewer columns— (Jefferson paces away from him a few steps and then pauses, his eyes turned toward the shadowy confines of the lawn.) JEFFERSON There are divers minds, sir, and divers modes of thought. That we should have builded to meet the approbation of every individual was in itself impossible. We had no supplementary guide but our own judgment. (His mild voice pauses. Then turning suddenly toward the voter, he puts a period to the conversation.) We have builded by our taste, sir, and by our conscience. (He bows low with old-fashioned courtesy and goes within. The voter stands a moment staring after him. Cabell comes up the steps and passes. He is half across the terrace when a voice halts him. Madison and Monroe cross the lawn together.) MADISON Mr. Cabell! (The voter recovers himself with a start and puts out his hand toward Cabell as Cabell is turning back to the steps.) VOTER You do not know me. I am a plain American citizen, voted for you for the legislature— CABELL (Bowing rather distantly and attempting to pass.) Accept my thanks, sir. VOTER I want to speak to you about Mr. Jefferson's wastefulness in the building going on here. There is a good deal of gossip— CABELL Gossip, sir! Mr. Jefferson is as indifferent to gossip as Monticello to summer mists. (Chin up, he passes on to greet Madison and Monroe. They meet beside the rejected stone and the little camp-stool forgotten there. Cabell's face relaxes at sight of the stool. He takes it up and folds it carefully.) The Old Sachem is here ahead of us. (The voter goes down to the lawn and off.) MADISON Perhaps, as the workmen say, he watches through his telescope the driving of every nail; and if one is driven falsely, mounts Old Eagle and comes charging down to right it. MONROE Every nail! Ah, sirs, even we, the Visitors, scarcely know the half of Mr. Jefferson's dreams for the University. CABELL Perhaps we should grow faint if we often looked aloft from this material base, these buildings dearly fought for and not yet completely won,— aloft to the imagined towers of science he bids us rear. MADISON (Musing.) We talked together, he and I, at Monticello last night—the punch-bowl half buried in a drift of pages, the gathered dreams of half a century.— CABELL (Interrupting in an undertone.) And such ordered dreams! MADISON Exactly. The very books for the library listed as minutely as those specifications for bricks he daily sets his cramped wrist to draw up. Even a masterpiece of sound defense for what he calls "our novelties," schools of Anglo-Saxon, agriculture, government! A packet of letters already written to precede Mr. Gilmer to Europe on his quest for "characters of the first order"— MONROE We have progressed since the day when Mr. Jefferson laid out the first building with peg and rule and twine here in Perry's old stubble field. CABELL If I could but have made the legislature see the great scale of his vision! MONROE You have accomplished much. You will do more. CABELL (Sadly.) I cannot go back another term. My health is quite spent. MADISON Poor Old Sachem! Does he know? CABELL No. I must tell him to-day. (A boy dashes across the lawn shouting.) BOY He's come! Lafayette has come! (The sound of drums and processional music. Gaily dressed people gather on the lawn. From the building come Cornelia and the ladies. They curtsey to the gentlemen and pass down to the lawn. Down the center aisle of the amphitheatre and through the lane of people, who wave handkerchiefs and cheer, passes the procession: the chief marshal and his aids; the president of the day; magistrates and other local dignitaries; Lafayette and his staff. A flagbearer carries the flags of America and France. At the steps, the dignitaries pause and divide to let Lafayette pass through. Jefferson meets him there. They embrace, and the cheering mounts to a frenzy. "Lafayette! Lafayette!") JEFFERSON God bless you, General! LAFAYETTE Ah, Jefferson! (He turns toward the lawn and speaks to the people.) Even in the old world, I think, I have not seen a work that so clearly speaks the spirit of the master as this, your Athenæum, speaks of him who has fathered it. Its white colonnades are yet empty of young life, but a shadow falls along them daily. Athwart the centuries, so that your sons and their sons in turn shall walk within it, still will stretch the shadow of the friend of freedom, of truth, Thomas Jefferson. (Cheers, "Jefferson! Jefferson!" One voice cries, "The Declaration!" Jefferson bows his head.) JEFFERSON My friends and neighbors, I am old, long in the disuse of making public speeches, and without voice to utter them—It is my single wish to hear you acclaim with undivided voice, as but now you did acclaim our great guest and me, this, our University. (A straggling voice calls, "The University!" but the crowd stirs with confusion. The bands begin to play again, and the dignitaries go up the steps of the terrace. There they form a lane again, and the chief marshal by gesture invites Lafayette in to the banquet. Lafayette turns to Jefferson, who stands looking out over the lawn, and offers him his arm. Jefferson squares his shoulders, smiles affectionately, and lays his hand within the elbow of the old marquis. With stately steps they walk together into the banquet hall. Again the crowd cheers. When the banqueters have gone the throng on the lawn gradually disperses, some straying in groups upon the terrace to look curiously about. A woman with her young son at her side pauses in admiration before the unfinished capital. The voter approaches them. Cornelia, half-hidden from them by a clump of shrubs on the lawn, stands listening.) VOTER I suppose you'd call that beautiful. WOMAN Why, no—it is still so rough—but it suggests beauty. VOTER H'm. More useless finery, fancy folderols, expensive toys for a man in his dotage. A MAN (Coming up to them.) Is it true that Mr. Jefferson will have no professors here but foreigners —and Unitarians? (The hum of voices swells and the stragglers foregather.) VOTER I don't doubt it. No one really knows what religion he believes in himself. MAN And he did get a lot of foreign notions when he lived abroad. WOMAN Ah, you are all swift to detract. HER SON (Tensely.) But I heard you cheering, "Jefferson! Jefferson!" WOMAN Hush, my son. (From the banquet hall comes an orator's voice rounding a period: "—the friend of freedom," and then the sound of applause.) VOTER But, my boy, that is the thing to do, to cheer when public men stand before us. I voted for Thomas Jefferson for President, but when it comes to emptying out my pockets, why, that is different. BYSTANDERS Very different—. Indeed—. —especially for pagan professors and un-American buildings. VOTER Of course it was not our business if he chose to throw away a lifetime and a fortune on building his own house. Monticello— (Raggi pushes through the ring of listeners and interrupts.) RAGGI Monticello? Ah, the fair, the serene house. Long after the flimsy shelters in your valley lie rotted it will stand in beauty—so art endures, signori and signore—on the breast of its little mountain. (A breath of silence, during which Raggi picks up his chisel, left forgotten on the stone.) MAN And who is he? VOTER (Shrugging his shoulders and turning to go down the steps.) An importation of Mr. Jefferson's—from Italy. (The circle breaks up and the people drift away. Raggi, leaving, is stopped by Cornelia coming up from the lawn, portfolio in her arms.) CORNELIA If you please. I want to show you the drawing of the library, the great building to stand at the head of the lawn. (She opens the portfolio on the capital, and Raggi gives a low exclamation of pure delight.) Do you recognize it? RAGGI Recognize it? Ah! CORNELIA It will be smaller— RAGGI Of a certainty. But the proportions! The perfect round. Have you seen it, the temple of all the gods? You have been to Italy, to Rome itself? You know the Pantheon? CORNELIA (Wistfully, shaking her head.) Only pictures. (She watches him study the drawing.) Would rough capitals spoil it? RAGGI Rough capitals? A thing impossible. They must be of marble. (With a gesture of finality he turns abruptly away. She follows.) CORNELIA But of course there are different sorts of marble, some smoother than others, whiter, some— RAGGI Ah, if we were but in Italy! There is the perfect marble, flawless like untracked snow. CORNELIA It is—? RAGGI Carrara. CORNELIA Oh. Carrara. (Satisfied, she turns to tie the portfolio again, and, when Raggi has gone, sits down on the steps, her chin on her palms. Jefferson comes from the banquet hall.) JEFFERSON Cornelia, you are waiting for me? But you will grow tired. Men love talk like old wine. CORNELIA Shall you have a chance to speak to the Visitors of the University? JEFFERSON When the meat is served. We are to come here. But you must not wait, my child. Are you delaying your carriage until the file winds up to Monticello so that I may be your cavalier? I am but a grizzled outrider, and Eagle an ancient mount— CORNELIA Listen. I have found what kind of marble we want for the capitals, the smoothest, the whitest, the best—Carrara. JEFFERSON (Suddenly serious, taking her chin in his hand to study her eyes.) My dear, we can but try. I will ask our Visitors. (Jefferson and Cornelia separate, he going with bowed head back to the banquet hall and she stealing softly down to the lawn.) (Light dawns upon the terrace. Phædrus, in short, dun-colored cape and little hard, round hat slung about his neck, comes out between Socrates and Lysis. He wears a new and strange appearance which cannot be entirely attributable to his clothes, although they are of course both new and strange. It is rather a matter of lifted chin and a far-off gaze. Lysis presses very close to him, looking up into his face and now and then feeling the stuff of his cape. Socrates smiles whimsically at the two of them.) SOCRATES Lysis, I think you are envying Phædrus. But the life of training he has begun is rigorous. Surely you do not crave that ugly uniform. (Lysis laughs and shakes his head.) Or the close-cropped head? No? Perhaps it is the mad revels of the young men, their societies of mystic names? Nor these? Then perhaps the shield and spear Phædrus will have from the state—and the dangers he will soon go out to encounter on the frontier? LYSIS Oh, no, Socrates. SOCRATES Then it is the sacred oath he swore just now in the sanctuary. (Lysis not denying this, but instead looking eagerly toward him, Socrates drops his humorous tone and speaks very gently.) Ah, Lysis, do you suppose that you must wait for a day and year to take an oath as sacred? Or that temples alone can consecrate high purpose? This rough stone be your altar. Phædrus, here, and I, your friends, will speak a prayer with you, and like good comrades claim a share in the blessings it brings. PHÆDRUS But, Socrates, men say you do not believe in the gods. SOCRATES And you, who are my friend, who talk with me daily, how do you answer them in your heart? Do you say, Socrates believes the sun a stone, he has no faith in what is divine? PHÆDRUS No. But the men who are so clamorous to pass the sentence of death upon you are not your friends. They declare you never sacrifice to the gods of the state— SOCRATES Hush. It is sacrilege to give God to our little Attic state. Pray with Lysis. Ask with him the dearest wish of his heart. PHÆDRUS Ah, I know what that will be—honor. SOCRATES Is that so, Lysis? Do you yearn above all things for truth? (Lysis nods. The two youths stand by the rough stone and pray after Socrates.) O, Pallas, glorious goddess, keeper of wisdom,— PHÆDRUS AND LYSIS O, Pallas, glorious goddess, keeper of wisdom,— SOCRATES —give me beauty in my inward soul. May I be brave. PHÆDRUS AND LYSIS —give me beauty in my inward soul. May I be brave. SOCRATES And then, Athena, send me truth. PHÆDRUS AND LYSIS And then, Athena, send me truth. (Socrates moves away, leaving Phædrus and Lysis. Phædrus, taking a scroll from his tunic, sits down to read in it. After a moment Lysis slips to a lower step and drops down quietly. He hugs his knees boy-fashion and bends over to sniff delicately at the beautiful papyrus.) LYSIS Oil of sandalwood. Mmmm. PHÆDRUS (Thinking aloud.) It would be splendid to be a poet, to speak truth, but half-knowing how—yet easily, as the smilax climbs. LYSIS I have thought of that. PHÆDRUS After this (touching his uniform), I may try it,—try putting into starry words the beauty that lumps in my throat. LYSIS (Reproachfully.) But you were going to be a master artisan and fashion wings for us. You said it would be simple to fly. PHÆDRUS Simple? Even the seagulls know as much, poising surely between blue and blue in the wake of tall triremes. LYSIS (Still reproachfully.) And only this morning you talked of founding a great world state so that there might be an end of wars and all the oppressed should be free. PHÆDRUS Who can tell? (Moonlight silvers the façade beyond the terrace and streaks the floor with light and shadow. A fair Athenian girl in shimmering fabrics with garlands of unreal silver flowers stands a moment in a path of light. Phædrus, spying her, springs to his feet, hand outstretched. Startled, she vanishes before Lysis, leaping up and looking back, has seen her.) It was Helen! LYSIS How could you know? PHÆDRUS By her beauty. Was it not the glory of Greece? I have seen her in a thousand dreams flash white-armed along these moon-barred colonnades. (Again the girl appears. This time it is Lysis who sees her. He cries aloud and runs toward her. She eludes him. He pursues and overtakes her. But she breaks away and leaves him with empty arms staring at the moon-lines on the floor. Soft music, and then the voice of song:) The moon's a drink In a silver flask. Drain it and dream Whatever you ask: Shadow and shine, And the stir of leaves, Trim hands, slim hands, In fluttering sleeves. Dream porticoes On the silvered ground. Dream of a lute And dance to the sound. Breath of the dew, And a forehead fair, White feet, light feet, And cool-wreathéd hair. (The girl comes slowly out into the light again. Lysis meets her and they dance of the love that comes to youth in dreams, mystic, evanescent. At last she slips away. He follows. Other maidens come and dance on the lawn; and the dance drifts into joyous revelry. They go off laughing, Phædrus in their midst. The moonlight endures.) INTERLUDE Music, in which blend strains associated with University revels and dancing. (The amphitheatre grows bright again. The door of the banquet hall opens, loosing a hum of general talk and laughter and the clink of silver upon china. Jefferson comes out resting his hand affectionately upon Cabell's shoulder.) JEFFERSON Whether to ask remission of our debt or funds for the library? The latter, oh, surely, my friend, the latter. Were we to stop building now and open our doors, we should fully satisfy the common sort of mind. And so we should then be forced to proceed forever upon that low level. CABELL I have said we must never again ask money for building—but it is my chief happiness to please you, in the little time I have left. JEFFERSON (Starting away from him.) The little time? CABELL I am quite unable to stand for reëlection. JEFFERSON Desert now your holy labors! Think—one life you have. Can you spend it better? The host of young in the years ahead depend for the freedom of their souls upon our sacrifice of time, health, even life—(His voice breaks, but he tries to go on.) If you continue not firm-breasted, how shall I without vigor of body or mind— CABELL (Stopping him.) It is not in my nature to resist such an appeal. JEFFERSON (Again dropping his hand on Cabell's shoulder.) My friend, my friend! —You will announce your candidacy? CABELL In the next issue of the Enquirer. VOTER (Coming up to them from the lawn.) The talk I mentioned to you, Mr. Jefferson, has reached a head to-day. The people gathered here are very dissatisfied. When they come together again to see Lafayette come out, you should speak to them, explain this rumor— CABELL (Frigidly.) A rumor, sir? VOTER That these fancy capitals are an utter failure. CABELL More gossip, sir. JEFFERSON Gently, my friend. We are physicians unenviably prescribing a draught nauseous to the public. (Turning to the voter.) You are correct in supposing us to have made mistakes, but we prefer to make no speeches. I have found in a long life that the approbation of the public denied in the beginning will surely follow right action in the end. Time dissipates these mists of prejudice. We are building for those who are to come after us. They will know whether we have builded well or ill. It is from posterity that we expect remuneration (extending his hand toward the far boundaries of the lawn), and I fear not the appeal. (The voter goes off as he came.) It is true, Mr. Cabell. Our Italian artist to-day spoiled this stone. (He turns in greeting to Madison and Monroe as they come out of the banquet hall.) Your feasting with Lafayette has been interrupted, sirs, by the claims of your office as Visitors of the University. Your rector needs advice. Signor Raggi has decided, after all, that Corinthian capitals can never be faithfully carved from such coarse stone. Shall we in the absence of our colleagues, the other Visitors, arrest his work? MONROE By all means. MADISON Pay his passage back to Leghorn if need be. He is hardly more popular than useful. JEFFERSON And the capitals? (The other men are silent, waiting for him to go on.) We shall still have to get capitals. (He takes the notebook from his pocket and, consulting it, speaks in deliberate, matter-of-fact tones.) I have made computations. Capitals are relatively cheap in Italy. They understand there doing these things more expeditiously than we. We can have at a reasonable figure—less than we have already spent in experiment—capitals of flawless marble. MADISON Marble! CABELL And imported! Consider the legislature, Mr. Jefferson. MONROE Think how delays goad the public impatience. JEFFERSON (As if he has not heard.) These colonnades will shelter the visions of unnumbered hosts, young Lockes, Newtons, even Lafayettes brave for right. Here the fledgling poet shall sense the law of austere beauty which Homer knew, and boy Ciceros learn to strip their raw fancies from the chaste, compelling truth— (He breaks off. There is a little silence, and then Madison taking a step forward speaks to Cabell and Monroe.) MADISON Thomas Jefferson is the father of the University of Virginia. It is the very shadow of his great self. He alone can know how its spirit must be bodied forth. Let us not deny him one stone. MONROE Jefferson, you must decide. (He seizes Jefferson's hand and wrings it warmly. The others follow his example and go at once back toward the banquet hall.) JEFFERSON But your advice—I need your advice—your help— CABELL You are an infinitely better judge than we. (They go in. Jefferson stands alone staring down at the rejected stone, his notebook still in his hand. Brockenbrough comes up from the lawn.) BROCKENBROUGH You saw the Visitors? JEFFERSON Yes. BROCKENBROUGH About Raggi, I mean. JEFFERSON About Raggi? Yes. BROCKENBROUGH What did they decide, sir? Is he to go on spoiling good material? JEFFERSON No. Oh, no. We must have no more good material spoiled, Mr. Brockenbrough. (His abstraction is so deep that he seems not to notice Brockenbrough's restless shifting of position.) We must stop Raggi from spoiling good material. They were clear about that. BROCKENBROUGH And the capitals? How shall we finish the columns? JEFFERSON They told me to decide—but I am very tired—It would take a long time to bring capitals from Italy, Mr. Brockenbrough. BROCKENBROUGH A good many months, I should suppose, and a clumsy job at best. Even after they are dumped off at New York, they would have to be got to Richmond, and, after that, long, tedious hauls by batteaux and wagons. It would delay us indefinitely. JEFFERSON Months and months. BROCKENBROUGH (With sudden sympathy.) Why worry now, sir? You've had a long day. You can discharge Raggi to-morrow—and then think about the capitals. JEFFERSON To-morrow. I will decide to-morrow. (Brockenbrough goes off hat in hand. From the banquet hall comes Lafayette.) LAFAYETTE Jefferson. My friend. JEFFERSON Lafayette, Lafayette, the years press sensibly on our shoulders. How long since your shield covered this neighborhood from the ravages of Cornwallis! How long since you brought your band of patriots to my house in Paris to wish a constitution! History has turned many chapters since then, of Robespierre, Barras, Bonaparte and the Bourbons. LAFAYETTE Many chapters indeed, Jefferson. JEFFERSON (Walking away, head bowed.) Replete with intrigue, dark with death. LAFAYETTE (Following.) But on every page the bright recurrent phrase. JEFFERSON The bright phrase? LAFAYETTE You ask! You who in young manhood wrote, all men are free; and now in the ripeness of age make them this material pledge. (His gesture includes the buildings and lawn.) JEFFERSON Freedom. LAFAYETTE A fair flag for the young crusaders to be nurtured here. (The chief marshal comes out of the banquet hall and looks about him. Lafayette, at the far end of the terrace, presses Jefferson's two hands in silence and joins the marshal. They go back into the banquet hall.) JEFFERSON Young Lafayettes brave for truth. (A shadowy figure slips in and kneels beside the rejected stone. Then comes Socrates, hands behind him, face lifted, intent upon absorbing reverie. Back of him is Phædrus with shield and spear. They are almost upon the kneeling youth when Phædrus, seeing him, lays his hand upon Socrates' arm.) SOCRATES What, Lysis! Still at the altar of truth? (As Lysis lifts grief-stricken eyes, his tone of raillery softens into tender reproach.) Ah, my son, you grieve. PHÆDRUS (In a low tone.) Because I am ordered to the frontier and you are to be tried, Lysis is sure I shall be killed and you condemned. SOCRATES Lysis, I was condemned to die from the hour of my birth. My judges can but fix the time of my setting forth. Look, is tranquil sleep a boon or a curse? LYSIS (Rising and never taking his eyes from Socrates' face.) A boon, of course. SOCRATES Or if, as some say, we live on after death, would not Phædrus joyfully go to meet the heroes of old—Palamedes and Ajax, the son of Telamon? Think, Lysis, what could he not learn of Orpheus or of Homer. LYSIS (Lifting his arms, as though they were winged and he would take flight.) Truth itself. PHÆDRUS And how they would tell it! Greek Dancing at the Pageant SOCRATES You see. The hour is neither here nor there. Would not you yourself, Lysis, who are yet young, this moment gladly die, if you so might lighten, a little, men's load of tyranny and error? LYSIS Gladly—Oh! (Far off a trumpet sounds and then the tread of marching feet. A company of youths with shields and spears passes along and Phædrus silently joins them. Lysis, lifting his arms high above his head, leaps down the steps to dance upon the grass. He dances, not the freedom of nature but the blood-bought liberty of peoples, to music which is martial and splendid. Socrates watches him and then goes away, stopping once or twice to look back at him. Dancers in deep blue come in. The recurrent poses of their dance suggest a frieze or the pediment of some Greek temple. When their dance is ended Lysis rushes up the steps and pauses there, arms uplifted as though he would actually take flight. Again there are trumpets. He drops his arms and marches away at the head of the martial company.) (The doors of the banquet hall are thrown open, and there floats forth a confusion of talk and the scraping of chairs. The flag-bearer comes out, but, finding himself a little premature, halts suddenly and stands looking back almost hidden by the mingled folds of the two flags. The nearly level light throws a long diagonal shadow across the terrace, enveloping Jefferson. Lafayette comes out. He pauses once at the very spot where Lysis stood a moment earlier, and the sunlight falls startlingly upon him and the mingled flags behind him. The banqueters coming out in confusion fill the terrace, and crowds on the lawn press near the steps. A fragment of cheering struggles up, but clamor drowns it. Lafayette goes down the steps with his staff, folowed by the local dignitaries; and the people push in behind them. Jefferson is left alone. From the shadow on the lawn pass workmen homeward bound singing softly:) Blow upon blow, blow upon blow, Build toward bending skies. (Jefferson hurries after them along the terrace, calling.) JEFFERSON Gorman, oh, Gorman! GORMAN Yes, Mr. Jefferson? JEFFERSON Has Signor Raggi gone? GORMAN No, Mr. Jefferson. (Jefferson has stopped in the light; and its glow falls full upon his face turned toward Gorman down on the lawn.) JEFFERSON Then send him to me. (Gorman goes back. There is a light, deepening to brilliance, and the sound of flutes in processional drawing nearer and nearer. A girl comes out and dances, and after her Athenian maidens bearing green palm fronds. They dance on the grass and then sweep the rejected stone and the steps with their branches. The flutes are at hand, and the players appear. After them come other groups in sacred processional: high-born maidens carrying aloft painted jars of oil and golden vases of wine; old men with olive-boughs; athletes wearing coronals of victory; and attendants of the temple, some with long garlands of flowers for the altar and some with trays and baskets of sacrificial loaves and fruit. From the slopes above the amphitheatre come the host of Athenian youths in ordered march filling the lawn in great semicircles. They carry unlighted torches. At last the priestess of Athena walks slowly forth to stand beside the stone. An attendant brings her the lustral bowl. She bathes her hands. Attendants offer fagots. She kindles a fire and prays.) PRIESTESS Cleanse us of error, great daughter of Jove. (As the fire leaps into flame, Lysis draws near in the last measures of the Moth-dance. The priestess gives a torch into his hand. He runs down and kindles the torch in the hands of a youth near the steps. The light travels from hand to hand until the whole lawn is ablaze with torches. The youths sing:) High in the vaulted council halls The old men thoughtful sit. They vote for peace or vote for war As seems to them most fit. (Lads the while go whistling by) But when bugles blare, It's the young who dare, And the young go out to die. Build here a temple: young men dream Of altars' leaping fire. They yearn to feel, they yearn to know With ardent young desire. (Lips the while may whistling be) But the heart of youth Craves the flame of truth— And it's youth must set men free. (Still singing, carrying torches aloft, led by Lysis, they march up the steps and through the central doorway of the building. Group by group, the worshipers follow. The priestess, when they have all gone, pours a perfumed libation on the fire, quenching the flame, and herself follows. The last sound of the recessional is the echo of flutes.) (A group of workmen passes. Jefferson hurries toward them into the light, but then he pauses, waiting. Another group passes. Then come Gorman and Raggi.) RAGGI (Cap in hand, below the steps.) You wanted me, signor? (Gorman goes on by.) JEFFERSON Yes, Raggi. I have decided. CORNELIA (Coming out of the shrubs at the other side of the steps.) Are you never coming? JEFFERSON Ah, my child, is Wild Air impatient? CORNELIA Wild Air! Why, dear, Wild Air belonged to White House days. I can hardly remember him. Don't you know—you ride Eagle now. JEFFERSON Yes, yes, Eagle, Old Eagle. (He straightens himself. The sunset light deepens in color upon his face.) Raggi, I have decided. You shall be our agent to buy capitals in Italy. RAGGI In Italy. Of marble, signor? It is so firm to the chisel. CORNELIA (Softly, hands to her breast.) Marble of Carrara? JEFFERSON White marble from the quarries of Carrara. (Raggi goes off, and Cornelia turns away. Jefferson comes down the steps to the lawn, his shadow yet a moment lying in the last path of light.) THE THIRD DAY The proceedings of the third day of the Centennial consisted of a public assembly in the Amphitheatre, with addresses by the British Ambassador and the Professor of International Law and Diplomacy at Columbia University; a pilgrimage to Monticello and a reception there, with addresses on the life and teachings of Thomas Jefferson; and a formal dinner in the Rotunda to delegates and invited guests. It was a day of tributes to the University and its Founder by distinguished spokesmen. The ceremonies of the day began with the reading of a letter of greeting from ex-President Woodrow Wilson. The President of the University said: As a prologue to these exercises, I take leave to read a brief letter from a son of this University who, in a crisis of the world, embodied and expressed the conscience and aspirations of mankind, and thus has found an enduring place in human history. Woodrow Wilson 2340 S Street N. W. Washington, D. C., 30th April, 1921. My dear Dr. Alderman: It is with heartfelt regret that I find myself unable to attend the great festival of the University. I regard the University with genuine affection, recalling as I do with the keenest interest and with many happy memories the profitable days I spent on her lawns and in the stimulating class-room where we used to gather about the great John B. Minor. He was a great teacher, and I hold myself his permanent debtor. May I not express the confident hope that, surrounded by her sons, the University may take on new life? With affectionate loyalty to the noble University; Faithfully yours, Woodrow Wilson. Dr. Edwin A. Alderman, President, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia. Thursday, June 2d 11.00 A.M.

We, therefore, welcome him as a scholar and fellow craftsman, but most particularly we welcome him as the representative of the mother land of this Commonwealth and, in a sense, of this nation. Possessing common ideals of justice and law, similar standards of honor, habits of thought, and canons of taste, the last catastrophe of civilization would be unfriendliness between England and America, and the surest guarantee of peace and progress, their continued amity and good will. I have the honor to present His Excellency, Sir Auckland Geddes, British Ambassador to the United States. ADDRESS BY THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR Sir Auckland Geddes, LL.D. Ladies and Gentlemen: It is a great personal pleasure to me to be here to-day but it is a greater pleasure that I should be privileged to attend your celebrations as the representative of the British peoples and to be able to convey to you the congratulations upon the great work which this University has performed and is performing, as well as to express to you in words, I fear inadequate, their sentiments of friendship and good will. To this day as in the days of Queen Elizabeth, the word "Virginia" stirs in the mind of the British a feeling hard in detail to define but not less real, not less cordial, because of that difficulty. In that feeling there is something perhaps of the spirit and mystery of adventure, something of the idea of high-born lineage and courtly grace, something born of experience, of the confident expectation of beauty, something of gallantry, something of bravery, courage, loyalty and service. For reasons hard in detail to analyze but at their spring perhaps connected with the ancient loyalty and affection for a great Queen and the tradition of what she and the men of her spacious days stand for in Britain's story, but added to and reinforced by the countless tributaries of history and the record of your achievements, Virginia and all that is hers holds in British minds and British affections a place apart among the States of this Republic. I know that I no more than voice the feelings of the people it is my high privilege to represent when I say that they are with you in sympathy and spirit to-day and throughout these days when you celebrate the completion of a hundred years of your University life. I wish that they could have been with me here now, to see with their own eyes the beauty and grace of your buildings, to feel in their own souls the pulse of your academic life. That cannot be; still it is they that extend to you through me their warmest greetings. Though the younger universities do not know it and by a merciful provision of Providence cannot know it, no university comes of age and enters into its manhood until it reaches the dawn of its second century of The President of the University Introducing the British Ambassador existence. It takes time for the soul of a university to evolve. Born of many men's minds and aspirations it is at first too fluttering, too tender a thing to hold its way untrammelled and unafraid amid the difficulties and influences which beset it. In its early days the strong man can make or mar the university, in its manhood the soul of the university makes or mars the strongest man that enters its portals as a pilgrim seeking truth. Some universities, and you are among their number, have been fortunate in that the strong men of their beginning used their minds and souls to make not to mar the university, but that impulse would not have persisted powerful and effective as it has if it had not been reinforced by the minds of a generation that again knew suffering and sacrifice, high endeavor and the glory of faithfulness to the end. War is in itself bad, but from its badness there may flow this good, that lessons which in any event life will teach may be learned sooner and more clearly and may be applied by young men who can do what old men cannot hope to perform. Once again the world has passed through the furnace of war, once again the horror of the battlefield, made more horrible by science, has bitten deep into the minds of the nations. Once again for a time they yearn for peace but as ever, the human mind is forgetful of horror. Already the memories of the beastliness of war grow dim and the recollections of the fellowship, the courage, the glories of the human spirit rising triumphant above the terrors of the body, grow bright and brighter. Our minds are straying back to the old circular path that leads men to speak of the honor of war and then of its glory and just before they again know its horror, of its desirability. To you as to all universities that have achieved manhood, there falls the duty of preparing your sons to face the problems of the world, not according to the individual fancies of a man or a small group of men, but according to the knowledge and the experience that have made the soul of your University. You have known war and its horrors. You have seen your sons march out strong and lusty. You have mourned and glorified those that fell, but mourning and glorifying you have known the pity of the mourning and the tragedy of the glorification. I know that the hour may come to any nation as to any individual when he has to fight or die, perhaps fight and die. But I also know that not in every war fought by every nation was that the choice. There have been unnecessary wars. There will be so again, unless you and those like you who are responsible for the thought habit of your sons consciously and actively strive to set within their minds an understanding of peace, conceived not as the absence of war, but truthfully as the joyful acceptation of the reign of law. I am often asked why should the universities concern themselves actively with the problems of peace. My answer is that they are concerned with placing truth before the minds of their children and that the true facts of national life clamor aloud for peace. Here let me interpolate one remark. I have noticed that when I, as British Ambassador, speak of Peace I am usually supposed by some newspaper reporter to dread the immediate or early outbreak of war between your Nation and mine. May I say that I am not so silly. The continuance indefinitely into the future of peace between our peoples is so obvious a necessity of our national lives that I do not dream of the contingency of its rupture. What I am concerned with is something that seems to me far greater and far nobler. I wish to see the English-speaking peoples of the world banded together; in leadership of all the nations, to the era of world peace and, as a first step, to the era in which the wars which even now we can recognize as futile and unnecessary, are done with for ever. I do not wish at this time to speak so much of the higher motives that impel to peace. I have spoken of them before and others more able than I have poured forth their eloquence to raise man's mind to a contemplation of their excellence. I abate no jot or tittle of what I have said in the past but abating nothing I think it no derogation to speak of the gross folly of war and to beg of this great University that it will see that its sons and daughters, ere they go forth to their appointed places in the higher or the subordinate leadership of their nation know clearly what is the cost of war. That phrase that I have just used "the cost of war" connotes something much more than the expenditure of money and the loss of trade. It connotes mental costs and physical costs hard to be borne by the warring generations. It also connotes burdens on their posterity that are grievous to bear but often overlooked. It was your own Benjamin Franklin who said: "Wars are not paid for in war time; the bill comes later." That is profoundly true and the bill that comes in is a bill for national vigour and physique, for health and strength and the happiness that is the portion of the hale and hearty. Many have believed that there is good in war—that it toughens the natural fibre and purges the body politic of slothful ease. My fellow countryman Ruskin it was who taught that war was a stimulant and "the foundation of all the high virtues and faculties of men." The best answer to that false doctrine known to me is that of an American, Professor Starr Jordan, when he roundly declares that there is precisely as much reason for and sense in the assertion that fire "is the builder of the forest" since "only in the flame of destruction do we realize the warmth and strength that lie in the heart of oak." That expresses exactly what war does. It burns up stores of good will, of high resolve, of unselfish impulse not only, it also burns up the physical strength and fitness of the people. The biological effect of war upon a people is a subject of study that surpasses in interest and I believe in ultimate importance the whole of war's economic effects which are themselves of such interest and importance. There is of course close connection and much action and reaction between the two, still they are in reality as sharply defined the one from the other, as are the problems of the mental and moral effects of war from either. Let us look for a few moments at this biological problem and as preliminary let me recall to your minds three biological laws:—The first, that any pair male and female, human, animal or vegetable, which are themselves of the same kind, tend to have, that is on the average do have, offspring like unto themselves. That is, like tends to beget like; the second, the law of filial regression formulated by Galton which I shall enter into a little more fully in a moment, and the third, that any race of living things can be modified in either direction by stringent selection to the limits of the normal variation of the race and can with certainty be maintained at that level so long as the stringency of selection is maintained. I spoke a moment ago of the law of filial regression. It is a statistical generalization which is certainly true when large numbers of living things of one kind are considered. It has no bearing on and cannot be used for prognostigation in individual cases. It is known to be true for the inheritance by human beings of stature, arm span, eye color and mental faculties but to apply it, it has to be assumed that the people under examination have been made homogeneous by intermarriage. Put very simply it reads that the children of unusual parents will be less unusual than their parents. For example, if the parents are unusually tall or short the children will be less unusually tall or short; in other words, the children digress towards the level of mediocrity which is the level of their average ancestor. Consider the ancestors you must have had twenty-five generations ago if in your family trees there is no intermarriage of cousins within the 25th degree of consanguinity. Two parents, four grandparents and so on gives sixteen million great great ancestors at or about 1066, the year of the Norman Conquest of England. To find anything like a fifth of that number we who are of blood drawn from the British Isles would have to derive something in our origin alike from kings and haughty peers, from pot boys and kitchen maids, from the houses of the religious, from the stews and sinks of the medieval cities. Similarly for all others of European stock. We are all without exception the descendants of an absolutely average ancestral pair, average in their physique, their manners, their morals and their customs and it is toward this average man and woman that the children of the unusual tend to regress. Many who meet with the law of Filial Regression for the first time find difficulty in understanding how, if it be true, the whole population is not of precisely the same height and intelligence. As a matter of fact it does not even suggest that the population should be uniform. It merely indicates that in a homogeneous population, favorable variations, for example good stature or intelligence, are not to be looked for in any special social clique or class but may occur anywhere over the whole range of the homogeneous population. But though this is true it does not mean that the children of the good stocks and the children of the bad will be on the average of equal excellence or worthlessness. The children of the gifted members of a poor stock may be individually equal to the children of two poor members of a gifted stock, but of the children's children those of the former will tend to regress to the mean of their stock, that is to be less gifted, whereas those of the latter will tend to regress to the mean of their stock, that is to be more gifted. The reason for this is that the nearer the ancestor the more he or she contributes on the average to the total of an individual's characteristics. The statistically determined proportion gives the parents one half of the total heritage of an individual, the four grandparents, one quarter, the eight grandparents, one eighth and so on. All this simply means that though the sons of short men may be tall and the sons of stupid men clever, the average grandchild will be short or stupid, though less short or less stupid than their grandparents were, whereas the sons of tall men may be short and of clever men stupid, yet the grandchildren will pull up the average again, though they will not be so exceptional as their grandparents. Now to gain a good idea of the effect that war will have on the physical and mental attributes of a population all that the biologist needs to know besides these laws is, how are the national armies raised, what are their casualties, and over what period were they spread. Does the whole manhood of the nation of certain ages fight regardless of physique, intelligence or of any other quality—or is there some form of selection? Are some of the men of military age taken and others left? Or are some of the men put into fighting units and others into noncombatant on some basis of selection other than pure chance? So far we have considered a homogeneous population involved in war. What if it be heterogeneous? Does it for example consist of two races; one in reality ruling, the other in reality subject? Or is the population broken up into strata, degenerates in the slums of great cities, stunted clerks and healthy countrymen? Or is there a great class cleavage on the one side of which there is light and air and freedom to grow and develop, on the other insufficient clothing, early toil, lack of food, filth and squalor. Then the questions are: How from such a population is the army raised? In the one case does the ruling caste take the burden of warfare on its own shoulders, in the others is there selective conscription, real universal service, or is there a small standing army recruited voluntarily and depending for its expansion in time of war on the patriotism of volunteers? Obviously in an address of this character I cannot deal with each of these possibilities of military and national organization. Let us take one or The British Ambassador Speaking in the Amphitheatre two examples and examine them. Let us consider first the nation in which there is a ruling caste which perforce assumes the burden of warfare and see what happens in an extreme case. Generation by generation let us suppose the healthy virile men are required for the army and leave a proportion of their numbers upon the battlefields. When a young healthy man dies the nation loses not only an individual but a potential line of healthy men, for each is, in posse, the founder of a virile stock. True these soldier men may leave descendants but many of them will not be in the old homesteads. Too often a majority of their offspring are found on the frontiers of their nation, learning an alien mother's tongue and hatreds and an alien mother's creed. The true sons of a ruling caste are often taught to be its bitterest foes, while in the old homesteads those unfit for the army rule in their dead brothers' places and father the next generation. By the law of filial regression their sons will be more fit than they and these will be the recruits of the next generation and their less fit brothers the fathers of the one to follow. So on the process goes from generation to generation, the average ancestor tumbling down and down the physical scale until in the end defeat and destruction overtake the nation. Rome is the great historical example of the Empire that fell because its ruling caste was wasted in war. For centuries she relied upon the healthy yeoman farmers of the Apennines to form the backbone of her army but she squandered her capital of manhood. Professor Seechs calculates that "Out of every hundred thousand of her strong men, eighty thousand were slain; out of every hundred thousand of her weaklings ninety to ninety-five thousand were left to survive." Even if these figures be only approximately correct, they show how war wore out Rome, not so much economically as in physical strength and energy. She debased her average ancestor and forced the law of filial regression to work against her. But you may say, that is old and long ago and far away. As a matter of fact biologically it is fairly recent, but here is another example more recent still. France in the days of Napoleon raised her armies by conscription with a special eye on the tall men whom she required to fill the regiments of the guard. Napoleon as we all know was a great general; his victories cost France two million lives. Those gallant Frenchmen died practically without issue in French homes and they were the best, the tallest, the straightest that France could bring. The result was that the average Frenchman of 1910 was two inches shorter in stature than the average Frenchman of 1810. Doubtless the law of filial regression was carrying French stature back to its old mean but the time was short and the less fit ancestors of a hundred years ago were too much in the foreground for much of the loss to have made up. I speak only of stature but doubtless there were other losses not dissimilar in kind in those that Rome suffered. We know how numerically stagnant France's population was when this century opened. That was to be expected. And France has again been bled white. It is too soon to say what the biological effects of that will be, but that years are necessary to her biological recovery is certain. Time forbids that I go on with these examples. My point is this: "War has to be paid for in physical ill-being through generation after generation." Nations cannot squander their best and maintain the standard of their stock. Children tend to be like the parents that the nation lets them have; generation after generation the stock may try to get back to its ancestral type but the stringent selection of war such as Rome used will in the end hold the population at the level to which selection modifies it. Nor need we fear that peace will rot the vitals of a nation. After two centuries in which she knew no war Japan proved her courage on the battlefields of Manchuria. That is what we should expect. As Professor Starr Jordan has well said: "In time of peace there is no slaughter of the strong, no sacrifice of the courageous. In the peaceful struggle for existence there is a premium placed on the virtues. The virile and the brave survive; the idle weak and dissipated go to the wall." It is the selection of peace not the selection of war that makes a national stock grow strong. I have left on one side the economic effects of war, more intense to-day as the result of the industrialization of the nations than ever before. I have not spoken of the shattered towns and broken cities, the ruined mills, the flooded pits. I have said nothing of the moral and mental devastation that war causes. Of these I have not spoken nor of the outrage that war is to all that is best within our souls. The indictment against war can be made so strong that none who is not perverse and foolish can gainsay it. I believe most profoundly that it is the duty of every university to plant, in the minds of its intellectual children, a true understanding of the cost of war so that never light-heartedly will they let their nation turn to the dread arbitrament of arms. I have acknowledged that in the world as it is, the choice for a nation may be to fight or die but I believe that now is the time for the English-speaking peoples with their great and peculiar advantages to resolve, that never again will they permit this fair world to be devastated by unnecessary war if by standing firmly together they can prevent it. What is to hinder their coöperation to this great end? Nothing that I know of but ignorance of each other's ideals and aspirations and the suspicion that is the child of ignorance. May I say this to you the University of Virginia—Great is your record and great are your achievements. Add blessedness to your greatness and send forth your sons and daughters burning with a high resolve to be numbered among the Peacemakers. Introducing the next speaker, the President of the University said: The finest thing any University can do in this world is to train a man who seeks the truth and finds it and makes it known to his fellows. We call such a man a scholar. Our next speaker is such a scholar who has enlarged the boundaries of knowledge in his field, given his spirit unselfishly to youth and served his country with fidelity and devotion. I present John Bassett Moore, Class of '80, Professor of International Law and Diplomacy, Columbia University. IMMORTAL YOUTH By John Bassett Moore, LL.D., of Columbia University We celebrate to-day the first hundred years of the immortal youth of the University of Virginia. While a university may gather years, it should never grow old. Neither with its name nor with its work should the thought of death or of feebleness be associated. So far as it is subject to the influence of mortality, the things that pass away should be regarded not as lost but merely as fructifying the soil for a richer and more abundant harvest. Thus it is that in the highest sense death is swallowed up in victory, and that, so far as concerns the university, we should conceive of the flight of years as a perpetual resurrection to a new, a higher and more useful existence. Approaching the hundredth anniversary of the University of Virginia in this spirit, we look not only to the numbered past but also to the boundless future. As we halt for retrospection, our minds are filled with fond and grateful recollections; and if we say, in the words of a great orator, that the past at least is secure, we repeat his words in no spirit of despondency. On the contrary, surveying what has gone before, we feel the spell of the immortality which we ascribe to our Alma Mater. We think of the devoted men who in our youth sought to light us along the path of life and to point us toward the high destiny which by our own efforts we might achieve. They loom before us as the sages, the wise and pious mentors, of our earlier years, who explored the past in order that they might furnish us with the lessons of its experience. We recall them as men of ripe learning, of exemplary character and of lofty purpose, who lived not in order that they might glorify themselves but in order that the world might be better for their having lived in it. Nor, when we recur to recollections such as these, are we stirred merely by the associations of sentiment. We are concerned with the very substance of things, with the vital essence of the university's life and power. To-day we witness the widespread appropriation, by many and varied non-academic vocations, of the professorial title; but, although this may be regarded as a recognition of the title's past renown, it does not contribute to its present prestige. Meanwhile, in the promiscuous strut of titular distinctions, which, by enabling the wearer perchance to gain an undeserved credit, may occasionally serve even as a cloak for imposture, the bewildered public is too prone to lose sight of the dignity and importance of the function of the teacher. Who should not be proud to think of himself simply in this character? To be a teacher of men not only is one of the noblest, but is one of the most responsible and most sacred of all callings. For the teacher may justly feel that, while he lives for the present, the knowledge he imparts, and the principles which he inculcates, are the things by which the future of the world is to be shaped. Therefore, while I have spoken of the masters who filled the chairs of this university in my own youth, I wish also to pay my tribute to the devoted men who are upholding the traditions and carrying forward the task of the university to-day. Their lot has not been an easy one. It may, indeed, be said that the quick changes and wide fluctuations in our later economic life have been felt in the universities with special severity. Moreover, the spirit of competition has invaded even the academic sphere. Methods formerly adequate have had to yield to new demands. Changes in organization have proved to be requisite; and fortunate was the University of Virginia, when, the easy democracy of its earlier administration succumbing to the exigencies of the times, it secured, as its executive head, one who combined, in so large a measure as its first president has done, the qualities of character, patience, wise foresight and real eloquence. He and the loyal men gathered about him have borne their burden and performed their task in a manner worthy of their predecessors, and in a devout spirit of self-forgetfulness that entitles them to the eternal gratitude of the commonwealth. No provision that could be made, for them and for their successors in office, either by the state or by private benefaction, could exceed the measure of their merit or the just reward of their efforts to maintain, to perpetuate and to advance the cause of sound learning and public service. I have referred to the life of the university as one of immortal youth. This necessarily implies that the university must be progressive. No man, no state, no nation can stand still and maintain its place in the world; nor does any man, any state or any nation deserve to hold its place in the world that is content with what has been achieved. Mere contentment with the past, no matter where we find it, means decay; the so-called happiness that springs from placid satisfaction with things as they are, or with exaggerated worship of things as they have been, is essentially spurious and is not a blessing but an evil. Man was born to labor. For this purpose he possesses his faculties, and if he hides them or permits them to remain unused he justly incurs the sentence cast upon the unfaithful steward who lost not only the opportunity for profit but even his original store. As perpetual vigilance is the price of liberty, so perpetual struggle for higher and better things is the price that must be paid for the immortality of the university. But, in striving for immortality, what are the things for which the university should stand before the world? I have mentioned the word "liberty." Like all things else, this is a relative concept. All mundane things are subject to human conditions; and, in spite of all efforts to formulate precise definitions, we are never able to find one that is permanently satisfactory. Nevertheless, there is such a thing as liberty, of the absence of which, if we lack it, we very quickly become conscious. In its essence, liberty means freedom of self-development, and this freedom is to be allowed as far as the absolute safety of society will permit individuals to determine for themselves what they will or will not do. The university should, therefore, stand for liberty, meaning the widest possible freedom of thought and of action. By no statesman or philosopher has this principle been more luminously expounded or more clearly exemplified than by the founder of the University of Virginia. Perhaps one may say that if he had been called upon to designate the one great principle to the inculcation of which the institution which he had founded should through all future time be devoted, he would have designated the principle of human liberty. This necessarily leads us to another thought, and that is the principle of toleration. To-day we are living in a world still racked by the passions resulting from a great war. Human beings, instead of loving one another, have been fighting and killing one another. This is a condition into which the world, as long as we have known it, has from time to time fallen; and at such junctures, confidence being supplanted with suspicion, there is a tendency to regard differences of opinion as a menace and as something to be suppressed. We should ever be on our guard against this tendency, alike in society, in politics and in religion. To-day our eyes and ears are constantly assailed with wholesale attacks upon persons of a particular faith or a particular creed, attacks which, if not inspired by passionate excitement, would be regarded as purely wanton. Such things can only be deplored as manifestations of human traits which fortunately are manifested chiefly under abnormal conditions. In antithesis to the principle of toleration, I venture to mention another word which has come to be characterized by base associations. I refer to what is now popularly known as "propaganda" signifying in effect the systematic dissemination of falsehoods or perversions for political, commercial or other selfish purposes. The world is to-day rife with this sort of activity, which is by no means confined to the perpetuation of bitterness by and between nations that lately were enemies. Stimulated by the war into abnormal activity, and now practiced more or less by all against all, it seeks, with frenzied and unscrupulous zeal, in an atmosphere of universal suspicion, to permeate all the relations of life and to create and foster ill-will among all nations, including even those supposed to be friendly. Scarcely can one attend to-day a gathering for the discussion of public questions, without being treated to the pernicious productions of this vicious system, which, finding their way into the press and into books ostensibly genuine, are glibly rehearsed by persons whose position and profession should cause them to exhibit a greater sense of care and of responsibility. A university, as a seat of learning, should set its face against such methods. One of the chief glories of the university is the fact that it is a place devoted to the search for truth. A great philosopher, whom I read in my student days, declared that, if the truth were placed on the one hand and the search for truth on the other, and he were asked to choose between them, he would take the search for truth as the sublime quest of his life. Such is the spirit of aspiration, such the insatiate longing for what is true, beautiful and sincere, that must animate the university, if it is to justify the attribution to it of the thought of immortality. The word propaganda has, however, been associated in times past with a type of thought and of action altogether different from that which has lately made it repulsive. Some years ago, in the city of Buenos Aires, I saw a volume which one could not touch without feeling deeply moved. It was a copy of a translation of the Bible, into a dialect of the Misiones territory, by some of the fathers, agents of the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide, who bore Christianity to the aborigines of that them remote and almost impenetrable region. Not only did they make the translation, but they printed it in the wilderness at a place even the site of which is to-day unknown. This they did to save men. In their holy zeal to carry salvation, according to their belief, to unknown lands, they shrank neither from peril nor from sacrifice. As we think of their helpless separation from the haunts of civilized life, of their self-denial and their days and nights of solitary toil, we are lost in admiration of the men who wrought such a token of their faith and of their love for their fellow-beings. Could there be a more inspiring example for those who accept a teacher's sacred trust? There is still another thought that rises in the mind in connection with the University of Virginia and its future. We are accustomed to think, and are, as I believe, justified in thinking of the University of Virginia as the first real American university; but it cannot be affirmed that this claim has been universally conceded; and it is proper to say that the claim rested not so much upon assumed superiority of instruction as upon the exemplification in the university's curriculum of the principle of freedom of individual choice and the pursuit of studies along the lines of one's individual preferences and aptitudes. Up to a comparatively recent time, however, the University of Virginia was universally admitted to be the first university of the South. This position it can hardly expect to hold in the future in the same uncontested sense as in the past. Other universities have sprung up in the South, and, receiving generous support from public and from private benefaction, have developed an active and robust life and have come to figure as vigorous rivals. Nevertheless, the University of Virginia to-day educates within its halls students from all quarters of the globe, and I love to think of it not only as a State institution but as an institution which is to fill a distinctive place in the life of the nation and of the world. For the discharge of this exalted function it needs vastly increased resources; but it also possesses an inestimable advantage which mere material accessions cannot give, and that is the influence of its memories and traditions, and of its association with the name and fame of its founder, the great apostle of modern democracy. On an occasion such as this, when we bring to the shrine of our Alma Mater our inmost thoughts, an expression of personal feeling may not be out of place. In my childhood there were two names which I was taught peculiarly to revere. These were the names of Washington and Jefferson; one the author of the Declaration of Independence, and the other the chief architect of the nation. Subsequently it fell to my lot for a number of years to occupy a public office from which, whenever I looked out of the window, I saw the Washington monument and the ever-moving current of the Potomac; and as I gazed upon the silent memorial pointing to the sky, and dwelt upon the character, the wisdom, the self-control of the first President of the first American republic, I wondered whether the time might not come when the world, recalling, in the words of Poe, "the glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome," might say that in the nation whose independence Jefferson declared and Washington established that glory and that grandeur were combined and magnified. And then, as I gazed upon the ever-moving, ever-widening stream, under the everchanging skies, it seemed to typify the endless flow of the life of the nation, finding its way to the ocean and permeating the farthest reaches of the boundless sea of human endeavor. So let us think of the immortal youth of the University of Virginia, ever flowing on, ever broadening, and permeating the intellectual and moral life of the world. In the ceaseless, endless flow of its intellectual and moral influence, the university both conserves and creates. Tennyson spoke of his generation as "the heir of all the ages, in the foremost files of time." In a sense no saying could be more fallacious or more misleading. As he who would be first in the Kingdom of Heaven must become the servant of all, so the first requisite of knowledge is a spirit of humility, such as renders us willing to learn. The potentialities of heirship are severely limited by human conditions. We all begin life in the same helpless way, dependent on others for existence and physically and mentally groping about. But, as we grow older, and become more self-conscious, we are perhaps not over-respectful of the wisdom of the aged. Indeed, even if it be liberally conceded that we know the causes that previously produced certain ill-effects, we are disposed to believe that their similar operation may be averted in the present instance; and, obedient to our possibly uninstructed impulses, we proceed to try our own conceptions of what is wise and expedient. The assumption, then, that we are the heirs of all the ages, representing the farthest human advance, should not be unduly encouraged. Such an attitude is essentially hazardous, and, if inadvertently indulged, tends recurrently to subject the world to the loss of a large part of its garnered treasures. For the prevention of such loss, we look to our seats of learning. While the university conserves the teachings of the past, it also uses them for the profit of posterity. In its quiet halls of study and reflection, overconfidence is chastened, so that uninformed aggressiveness may neither mar the present nor embarrass the future. The impulses of youth are refined and wisely directed. The mind is fertilized. Ideals are raised. Ambition is stimulated; and in endless train there issues from the gates the eager procession of intelligent builders by whom institutions are competently fashioned. Society and the state are the gainers; life itself is dignified and ennobled. Rejoicing, then, in our university as the perpetual dispenser of priceless benefits, let us strive to maintain and strengthen it with all the resources at our command, placing above its portals the words, "Conserver of the Past, Creator of the Future." ADDRESSES AT MONTICELLO THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THOMAS JEFFERSON By Judge Richard Thomas Walker Duke, Jr., of Charlottesville, Va. Ladies and Gentlemen: I deem myself peculiarly fortunate in being asked to speak at this time and at this place and in this presence upon "The Private Life of Thomas Jefferson." We are "atmosphered"—to use Goethe's word—during these days with the thoughts of this great man's work in the founding of the Institution whose hundredth anniversary we are celebrating. We forget for the moment the wonderful brilliancy of his statesmanship, the breadth of his philosophy, the depth of his marvelous intellect. We think of him to-day as the Father of the University of Virginia. But I wish to speak to you of him as the tender and solicitous father of most affectionate children; as the devoted and loving husband; the generous neighbor; the good citizen; the faithful zealous, kind master of many slaves. The place where we stand suggests all these things. In plain sight from yon eastern portico we look down upon his birthplace—upon the fields "where once his happy childhood played." Here stands the house he builded— carefully watched over and preserved by its hospitable and patriotic owner. Everything suggests the man. It is the man of whom I would speak. In the august presence of the distinguished visitors who face me I am no less fortunate—representing, as they do, so many peoples and countries. They may—doubtless will—keep in no long memory the words I may speak, but I wish them to remember the facts I briefly relate, so that they may be able to recall those facts and know that, great as he was, Jefferson was no less great in the beautiful characteristics which make up pure and noble manhood, and that his private life should deserve the plaudits of mankind no less than his public career. And I do this because no man was ever so foully belied; no man more wilfully and falsely attacked. Some of us believe that the ugly vituperation of greatness—the besmirching of private character for political purposes— has well-nigh reached the zenith in these later days; but compared to the attacks made on Jefferson during his lifetime they are but zephyrs compared to a whirlwind. His bitter political opponents—and they were of the bitterest kind—slandered him in every possible way. His domestic life, his relations with his slaves, were made the target for the slings and arrows of contemptible penny-a-liners and paltry politicians. These creatures seem to have had in mind what Sidney Smith was to say at a future period: "Select for your attack a place where there can be no reply and an opponent who cannot retaliate and you may slander at will." For Jefferson disdained to notice the barking of these wretched curs. He was always repugnant to "provings and fendings of personal character" and, too great to reply, too highminded to attempt to retaliate, he stood firm in the knowledge that those who knew him best—his friends, his neighbors, those who loved him— knew him, and before them he needed no defense. Even when Tommy Moore—the "Little" man, the licentious verses of whose youth were the shame of his old age—sang of him in vulgar strains, it is said that when the lines were read to him he smiled and murmured, "What a pity poetry could not always be truth and truth ever poetical." Standing upon this mountain top, the purity of whose air is no purer than Jefferson's private life, I recall the beginning of his married life, when in a dark and snowy winter night he brought his young and beautiful bride to this place. At Blenheim, a few miles away to the southwest, the deep snow compelled the young couple to abandon their carriage and they rode eight miles to Monticello. They arrived late at night. The servants had retired, the fires were out. Too kindly and thoughtful to awaken the sleeping servants, they went to yonder little office on my left, and soon a fire of oak and hickory was blazing on the hearth; a bottle of old Madeira was found on a shelf behind some books; the beloved violin was taken down, and with song and merry laughter they passed the night until daylight gleamed through the lattices. Here commenced a romance that ended only when, in the room just behind me to my left, in the mansion, a pure and gentle spirit took its flight and a bereaved widower lay fainting by the bedside where lay the inanimate form of the only woman he ever loved, with a devotion as holy as it was passionate, and as strong as it was pure. It was my good fortune to know well that grand old gentleman, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, Mr. Jefferson's grandson and the staff of his old age, as he called him. With him I once roamed over this mountainside and went in every room of this house. Space will not permit me to tell you of the anecdote after anecdote that this venerable man poured into my all-willing ears. Standing within a few feet of where I now stand he pointed out the office of which I have told you and related to me the instance I have just related. Then in a burst of indignation he remarked to me, "You have heard the miserable lies the dirty politicians and political enemies have told of my grandfather, Mr. Jefferson. Let me tell you no better, purer man ever lived. Neither I nor any one else ever heard him utter an oath, tell a story he could not have told in the presence of the most refined women, or use a vulgar expression. He loved but one woman and clave to her and her memory all his long life, and no father in all the world was more loving or beloved, more solicitous or careful of his children." He told me then of the book his daughter—my dear friend, Sarah N. Randolph—was preparing, to show the beautiful private life of her sire's grandsire—The Domestic Life of Thomas Jefferson. The copy of this book he gave my honored father is one of the most prized books in my library. It should be re-published. No one can read this book without being convinced of the peculiar sweetness and beauty of Mr. Jefferson's private life. No man but of the noblest character could have written those letters contained in this volume, to his children and friends, and as incident after incident is related in it we recognize that it reveals indeed a man "Integer vitae, sclerisque purus." It is very pleasant for me to say that all of these slanders against Mr. Jefferson came from a distance. His neighbors—and some of them were his bitterest political opponents—never repeated them—never believed any of them. I have known in my lifetime more than a dozen men who knew Mr. Jefferson personally. Two men I knew who saw Jefferson and Lafayette embrace one another at the foot of this lawn. Every one of them said that no neighbor of Mr. Jefferson believed one word of the vile stories told of him, but that he was beloved, respected and admired as a high-minded gentleman, a pure and upright man. His daughters worshipped him. The grandson of whom I have spoken could not mention his name save with a reverence as remarkable as it was touching. When he lay a-dying at Edge Hill, down yonder a mile or two away, he bade them roll his bed into the drawing-room, through whose windows Monticello could be plainly seen, and his last earthly gaze was upon this "Little Mountain," where beside his great ancestor's ashes his own were soon to rest. It cannot be amiss at this time to say something of the house in front of which we now stand and of Mr. Jefferson's life here. The house was commenced in 1764. It then faced to the east and was very much on the order of the average Virginia residence. But after Mr. Jefferson's visit to France, where he was very much struck with the architecture of that country, he remodeled the house in the style in which we now see it. It has really never been entirely completed. In his lifetime it was filled with works of art, paintings, engravings and statuary, and contained the largest private library in the United States. Mr. Jefferson's life here was that of the simple Virginia farmer. He arose early; a book always lay upon the mantelpiece in the dining room, and if the meals were not on the table he read from this book until called to the meal. He generally rode over the plantation every fair day, looking carefully after the overseer as well as the hands. He kept a minute diary of all the work day by day upon the plantation, and in it records of the direction of the wind, the thermometer and barometer were carefully set down; the budding of every plant and tree, the first appearance of any vegetable upon the table, and a thousand minutiæ which fill us with amazement to note how a man of his multitudinous affairs could take such minute pains over things most men would consider trifles. In the afternoon he attended to his various and varied correspondence. Many of his letters were written with his left hand, as his right was seriously injured whilst abroad, the wrist being broken. He had an ingenious arrangement by which the light of the candles was shed upon his book or paper and shaded from his eyes. His voluminous correspondence shows that he could never have wasted a single moment, but that his long life was filled with an industry seldom surpassed. He was very moderate in his food and drink. He very seldom touched ardent spirits but was fond of good French wines and had them always on his table, though he partook of them very sparingly. He was a moderate man in everything except in that which related to the welfare of the people. To advance that he was perfectly willing to be called "Radical" or almost any other name which political opponents chose to give him. He was a man of wonderful self-restraint, seldom if ever replying to any attack upon him in any way in the public print, and here at this place which he loved more than any other place upon earth, he spent the happiest and as he says, the best years of his life. As a neighbor Mr. Jefferson was most kind and generous: Always ready with counsel and often more material aid, his advice was sought by all the countryside, and freely given. He planned homes, he suggested improvements in husbandry, and whenever his superbly groomed horse was seen bearing him through what was then the little hamlet of Charlottesville his course was often checked by those who wanted to ask his advice or benefit by his wonderful knowledge. As a citizen he took part—when at home—in everything that related to the welfare of the county and State, giving to their small affairs the same thought and attention he gave to the Nation. He was always on the lookout for improvements in agriculture. You know he invented the mould board of the plow—a greater service to humanity, I believe, than even the great Declaration. He imported rare plants and seeds; he brought the first seed-rice into America. Nothing was too great for the range of his mind— nothing too small to be considered, if any good could be found in it. Of his religious life we can only say that his faith was of the Unitarian order, though he was never a member of any church. But he contributed to the building of the first Episcopal Church in Charlottesville, and when the rector thereof was building himself a house he sent him a handsome contribution, with a playful letter. He never professed—he lived. The Searcher of all hearts alone knows what that meant. But surely the faith of that man is not in vain whose last words were "Lord, now let Thy servant depart in peace." He was the soul of hospitality. Colonel Randolph told me that he had seen as many as sixty horses of visitors in the stables at Monticello at one time. He was literally eaten out of house and home. He recognized the evils of slavery, but also its benefits. He desired to emancipate as far as possible his slaves. As a master he was firm but kindly and considerate, and his servants loved him with that devotion which the oldtime slave ever showed to the master who treated him well. I must hasten to a close. In the time allotted to me I could but briefly outline the main characteristics of the private life of this great man. I said in the outset I deemed myself peculiarly fortunate in being asked to do this. For never more than in this hour of the world's great changes is pure and upright character more needed in statesmen—and men of private life as well. Only good men can give us good government; for government is of men. And never was the force of good example needed more. And after all, the private virtues are those which are of the Immortals. Kingdoms rise and fall; governments perish with the peoples that made them; philosophies change, and the belief of to-day is the mockery of to-morrow. But virtue and truth and purity; benevolence, integrity and the love of God and of fellow men—these things are alike of yesterday and of to-morrow—of the years of the past, the æons of the future; they alone survive when all else perishes. Of them and through them comes the health of the nations—the salvation of the world. They have their origin and their destiny alike in the home of our Father and the bosom of our God. JEFFERSON AND THE PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY By Archibald Cary Coolidge, Ph.D., LL.D., of Harvard University This spot and this occasion recall to the minds of all of us memories of the man in whose honor we have made this pilgrimage. We are here at the place that was dearest to him, at the home from which the influence of his wisdom and his benign presence radiated for so many years over his fellow countrymen. You have just heard the description of his daily life. It is, indeed, here that his figure is most distinct to us, that we think of him in his kindliest aspect, an object of affection as well as of admiration to millions then and since. It was here that he planned and dreamed and brought into being the University of Virginia. To us this visit to Monticello is in itself a source of inspiration. It brings us once more under the spell of a lofty character and master mind whose influence has not been confined to one party, but has extended over the whole people and has been felt even by those who opposed him most, and it has not been effaced by the lapse of time. Thomas Jefferson still holds his place as one of the guides of our republican ideals and citizenship. His words are still quoted and the truths that he expressed are still held sacred. And if this be so, is it not natural for us when we feel ourselves in the shadow of his presence to turn to him for counsel and help in dealing with some of the momentous problems which beset our paths as American citizens? May we not obtain guidance from his wisdom even under circumstances which he himself never could have foreseen? At least one may speculate as to what he would have thought of them, and such fancy need not be idle. It is true there are dangers in such a course. We must be careful how we apply any one concrete pronouncement on the part of Jefferson to an altered situation; what was a wise decision under former conditions is not necessarily the one that he would now make. We know, too, that like every mortal he was not always consistent; that in his long career he was deeply involved in the strife of his times and that he used terms and expressed opinions which reflect rather the passions or the prejudices of the moment than the mature judgments of his riper thought. Nevertheless, while making all such allowances, we may feel that Jefferson entertained certain ideals, certain visions, certain fundamental beliefs, to which we may turn and apply the inspiration we drew from them to problems of our own times. Let us look at some of these beliefs. Would it not be fair to say that the first and foremost article in Jefferson's political creed was his unshakable faith in democracy and particularly in American democracy? We may quibble as we please over the exact meaning of the term "democracy" but no one can deny that Thomas Jefferson was a democrat in the best sense of the word and we may well rejoice at the extent that his ideals have prevailed and are prevailing far and wide. Rank and title mean little enough to-day. Universal suffrage has been broadened to include those whom it has always been the privilege of man to love and to protect but to whom he has never before admitted a right to rule equal to his own. Has then democracy triumphed so that we have no fears for the future save such as may arise from its own excesses? No one should assert this. Here as elsewhere there is still a long gap between theory and practice. The power of wealth, inherited and acquired, still counts for much in the world, the conscienceless capitalist too often is the successor of the robber baron, and modern economic development with its tremendous accumulation of capital, its infinite ramifications and its necessary concentration of authority has seemed to threaten us with a servitude as real as any which has existed under crown or aristocracy. But this peril is not new, and provided we maintain our honesty, we can achieve the new freedom as well as the old. Vigilant as we must be to defend our heritage against the insidious power of corporate wealth, it is not from that quarter that the ideals of Jeffersonian democracy are most undermined at the present moment. Our liberties may be imperilled but the menace has taken on new forms. For instance we can see that society is in danger of becoming the slave of its own development. In the endless meshes of the modern state and of modern industrial and economic conditions the individual can hardly aspire to be as free as were his ancestors. The "sum of good government" has increased in a formidable manner since the days when Jefferson was at the helm of the state. It looks almost as if in the future the existence of the American citizen from the cradle to the grave will be regulated by prescriptions. They are perhaps necessary for the welfare of our wondrously organized system. But we are in danger of paying a heavy price in the sacrifice of the freedom of the individual citizen which Jefferson regarded as one of the highest privileges of mankind. If the march of civilization appears to demand that sacrifice, let us at least trust that it may not be too complete and refuse to make it save when there is real necessity. We shall do well to remember that in creating the most perfect machine, when its parts are human beings, the more scope we can safely give to each to think, act, and even make mistakes for himself, the more we do to preserve what has been one of the best characteristics of the American. Even efficiency may be bought at too high a price. But slavery to the machine which we ourselves have helped to create is not the only menace to our liberties. The democracies of free people are now being compelled to face the threat of a new despotism. Just when it has seemed that the idea of equal opportunity to all and the right of the majority to prevail were becoming the acknowledged basis of society for the whole civilized world, we have witnessed a sudden reaction towards a new oligarchy. The claim of one class to dominate regardless of the rest has been set forth from a new quarter in startling form. The red apostles of communism have declared ruthless war against the whole conception of true democracy and in order to secure their sectarian triumph they are prepared to shed torrents of blood and if need be to stamp out civilization itself. They have established their rule in the largest continuous empire in the world and by terror they hold to-day under their control a hundred million of their fellow beings. They have sent their emissaries abroad and they have their followers in all lands, even in our own, appealing by every argument to the ignorant, to the dreamer, and to the discontented, to all indeed who have suffered under our present system of society and can be deluded into imagining that its overthrow would bring about a millennium. In combating the infection of such ideas the strong and healthy democratic beliefs of Jefferson, his confidence in the essential goodness of human nature if given a free chance to develop, his doctrine of the utmost liberty to the individual compatible with the welfare of the state, and of the safety with which error may be tolerated when reason is left free to combat it, offer us the best grounds on which to take our stand. It is true that society must defend itself when attacked, that we cannot allow conspiracies to be hatched in our midst against all we hold most dear, that the right to poison the public mind is not a God given one. But though alien and sedition bills may be more necessary now than they were in the early days of the republic, it is not by blind repression alone any more than it was then that perils can be conjured. We must avoid panic and reaction and all that savors of persecution unless we wish to give to whatever revolutionary spirit there is in our midst a moral force which now it lacks. Against the perils of revolutionary propaganda and discontent, it is not enough to fall back on mere measures of repression. The counsels of terror are seldom wise, and the ultra conservative breeds the revolutionary. While striving to right the many evils that exist in our own as in every other social system, we must have faith not only in the virtue of our institutions but in their strength and in the spirit which they are meant to express. The calm broad vision of the sage of Monticello is often sadly lacking among us. The excesses and horrors that accompanied the French Revolution did not shake his trust in popular government and the progress of humanity. Those of the Russian one would not do so were he alive to-day. Turning from our domestic situation to our foreign one, where the difficulties if of less fundamental magnitude are even more pressing, what lessons has Jefferson to teach us there? A famous passage from his first inaugural address comes to our minds: "peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations—entangling alliances with none." Surely, we say, a wise principle, one well tested in the history of this country and one that it would be folly to abandon now. But are we so certain of what should be its present interpretation? Has it been in no way modified or broadened by the enormous changes that for good and for ill have brought all parts of the globe so infinitely nearer to one another than they were a century ago? Do we even know what we mean by "entangling alliances?" Is not an international convention of any kind, whether it deals with commerce or patents, or with rules relating to the Red Cross, an entanglement in the sense that it is a limitation to our complete freedom of isolated action? Has not the whole development of the last hundred years tended to emphasize the necessity of coöperation in all good works between nations as well as between individuals? Is there any reason in the nature of things why such cooperation should not be beneficial in political affairs as well as in economic or in sanitary ones, and is an alliance anything but a promise of mutual coöperation? All these considerations are not to be lightly dismissed in favor of a literal interpretation of a maxim enunciated in a very different world. To many of his contemporaries, Thomas Jefferson seemed what today would be called a pacifist. At one time he appeared to submit with tameness to buffets at the hands of both England and France. But he was a statesman not a mere theorist. His conduct of this country's disputes at that juncture may not be a brilliant page in his career, but under extreme difficulties he made no sacrifice of principle and each year that he preserved peace the country gained in strength. He showed more than once in his career that when the moment came for decisive action he could be resolute, and he did not shrink from the gravest responsibilities. As the last resort he was ready to take up arms if the honor of his country demanded it. Even expeditions overseas had no terrors for him. By dispatching an American fleet to wage war on Tripoli he set Christian Europe an example of how to put an end to the shameful tribute it had been the custom to pay to a nest of pirates in order to be spared from their depredations. Everything we know of the character and views of Jefferson makes us confident that if he had been alive at the time of the Great War he would have approved of the sending of our soldiers to lay down their lives for their country and its cause on the battlefields of France. The sympathy which he felt for the first French republic would have gone out in far larger measure to the present one and none would have felt more than he that the liberties of mankind would be menaced by the triumph of military imperialism. He would have known, too, that our task would not be finished or our burden be lifted by the close of hostilities, but that we must and shall share in the vast work of the reconstruction of the world. Duty like charity begins at home, it does not end there. We may perhaps doubt just what form of league or association or brotherhood of peoples Thomas Jefferson would now wish to see established, a brotherhood in which this country of ours should hold its proper place. But we cannot doubt that with his whole heart and soul he would have been devoted to some such ideal of fraternity. The "Parliament of man," the "federation of the world" would be for him no mere empty phrase. Undismayed by the cataclysms which we have just witnessed and are still witnessing, he would put his faith in his fellow creatures, and particularly in his fellow countrymen. He would believe it to be their proud privilege to lead rather than to follow in all movements for the common welfare. While condemning visionary crusades or neglect of our own problems he would recognize our obligations to struggling humanity at home or abroad. We who honor his name, let us live true to his spirit. We have proved as a nation that we could fight for our ideals. Now that peace has come we must beware "lest we forget, lest we forget." SPEECHES AT THE DINNER TO DELEGATES RESPONSE BY JACOB GOULD SCHURMAN, PH.D., LL.D., FORMER PRESIDENT OF CORNELL UNIVERSITY Mr. Chairman: This splendid dinner, so characteristic of the generous hospitality of the South, marks the close of three of the four days set apart for your Centennial Celebration. It is difficult to imagine what remains for you to do to-morrow. Certainly the past three days have been for us all days of noble and elevated joy. We have been genuinely conscious of a fraternal communion and interchange of spirit and sentiment. Not only the speakers, but the great company of delegates and visitors have joined in the well-merited congratulations and cordial good wishes which the speakers brought you on behalf of sister institutions. Have the triumphs of truth and reason in this University been eloquently set forth? The silent auditors, as you might have recognized from many signs of approval, make those eloquent tributes their own. Has the influence of this University in molding the religious life of the Nation been justly assessed? The audience joins you in the testimony that man lives not by bread alone—nor yet by bread and science together. Have you set up memorials to your heroic dead? In the presence of your tears, in the hearing of your prayers, we bow our heads and devoutly give thanks that the University of Virginia has been so preëminent in the training of men for the service of the Republic. Not only oratory, you have invoked also music and art and pageantry to give worthy expression to the spirit of this occasion. And the spirit seems to me as manifold as the media of its expression are varied. No doubt the primary note is the exaltation of the scientific and scholarly mind, for the formation of which universities were called into being and after the lapse of so many centuries still continue to exist and flourish. But life is more than intellect. And the university is in close and friendly alliance with the church, the state, and every other institution which makes for the improvement and advancement of mankind. Thus, most appropriately, you have made your high celebration a means not alone of stimulating intellect, but also of awakening historical imagination, of quickening patriotism, and of deepening the sense of the religious significance of life. All this might have been done, nay, all this I have seen done, by other universities at home and abroad. But there is one feature of your Celebration which is absolutely unique. No other historic university could have arranged to make a pilgrimage to the home of its founder and under the very roof where he spent his mortal days pay honor to his memory as we this afternoon at Monticello all-hailed the Father of the University of Virginia. There is often a contrast, which may amount even to contradiction, between the founders and benefactors of colleges and universities and the proper ideals of the institutions which they have called into existence. The things which give them pleasure, the objects they pursue from day to day, the literature they read, the thoughts which make the furniture of their minds, may be entirely alien to the life of the devoted scholar or scientist. And their conception of his function, and of the ways and means of performing it, are likely to differ entirely from his. Here lies the possibility of fatal collisions! The millionaire benefactor, apart from his benefaction, has seldom been an object of enthusiasm either on the part of teachers or students. Nor can I imagine that Henry VIII or even Wolsey was ever regarded as an exemplar for the young gentleman of Christ Church. It was not merely cynicism that inspired Goldwin Smith's bon mot that the proper place for a Founder was in marble effigy in the College chapel! The University of Virginia is in this regard fortunate in her Founder. No doubt Jefferson's thorough-going democracy predisposed him in some matters to defer too much to popular opinion; and the principle of vox populi vox dei is fatal to the life of a university. But it was only in politics that he would determine truth by counting noses. In other spheres he insisted on evidence, and if evidence were lacking he suspended judgment. In this respect he was the very embodiment of scientific method. Indeed, all things considered and all necessary abatements made, you will find a remarkable harmony between the mental postulates, operations, and outlook of Jefferson and the spirit of a genuine university. Here and now I can signalize only one or two of these features. In the first place, Jefferson was above everything else an idealist. Those who would disparage him called him an impractical visionary. Certainly he was ready to theorize on any subject which engaged his thought. The force of his penetrating intelligence could not be restrained by any convention, however respectable, or by any tradition, however venerable. He was a thinker who must see and understand for himself. The dread of new ideas, which is a universal characteristic of mankind, had no place in the composition of that daring spirit. On the contrary, the fact that a theory was new commended it to one who, like Jefferson, ardently believed in progress and zealously strove for the advancement of mankind. He did not mind being branded as a radical or a revolutionist. His sanguine taste for novelty was exhibited in all his activities—in agriculture, in which he was all his life an enthusiast, as well as in politics, in which for forty years he was an unrivaled leader. And no consequences deterred him from following the principles he had embraced to their logical conclusions. If the "rights of man" signified to his mind an almost entire absence of governmental control he did not hesitate to declare that "a little rebellion now and then is a good thing." Now this hospitality to new ideas, even to the extent of being enamoured by their novelty, and this readiness to follow new ideas whithersoever they lead—till they eventually proved themselves true or false—is the animating spirit of a genuine university. On this more than anything else whatever the intellectual progress of mankind depends. Has not Darwin, indeed, taught us that the evolution of life, from lower to higher forms, is due to the survival of characteristics which on their first appearance can only be described as "sports" or freaks? And, in the realm of mind it is just by means of the "freakish" ideas of dreamers and visionaries that successive steps of progress are effected. In the highest conception of it a university is an organ for the creation, development and dissemination of new ideas. I do not recall any time when this high and vital function of the university stood in need of greater emphasis. We are to-day living in one of those periods of reaction which invariably follow war. The exhibition of physical power which for four and a half years convulsed the world still dominates our habit of thought. The invisible world of ideas seems weak and insignificant beside that colossal empire of all-compelling might. And if the two come, or appear to come, into conflict men invoke force to suppress new theories, which can always be branded as dangerous, if not also disloyal. But vis consili expers mole ruit sua. Now the university is the nursery of new ideas. Its members are, in the fine phrase of Heine, "knights of the holy spirit"—the holy spirit of truth and culture. I trust that a fresh dedication to that noble service may be one of the results of this celebration of the Centennial of the University founded by Jefferson. There is a second service rendered by Jefferson to this University which you will perhaps grant me the time briefly to mention. I can describe it best by contrast. All institutions tend to lose themselves in their own instrumentalities. A university has buildings to care for and funds to invest and enlarge and routine business to administer. But a university is a spiritual institution. It has to do with mind, and exists for mind. The danger to-day is that the real university shall be submerged by its "plant" and "business." Are not universities corporations? And should they not be conducted like financial or manufacturing corporations? Nay, should not heads for them be found in the offices of Wall Street or the factories of Pittsburg? These are the questions we hear in the marts and markets to-day. In contrast with the implications of these questions, stands Jefferson's just and noble conception of a university. He clearly perceived that it was the Faculty that made the University. And that the Faculty might not be dislodged from the high place that naturally belonged to it, he would have no president at all but leave the administration of the institution in their hands. I think Jefferson sacrificed to this fine idea the obvious means of administrative efficiency. And I argued that thesis in a long letter fifteen or twenty years ago when your Trustees did me the honor of soliciting my opinion regarding the creation of the presidential office in this University. Undoubtedly the course of university development in the United States had made such an office a necessity. But even that reform would have been purchased too dearly, if it had involved the abandonment of Jefferson's conception in respect of the supremacy rightfully belonging to the Faculty. Nothing whatever can change the fact that in relation to the teachers and investigators, not only all material appliances, but also all governing and administrative officials—even the highest—exist solely that they may do their work in quiet and freedom and utter devotion with the minimum of distraction and the maximum of efficiency. Happily the University of Virginia found the right man for the new office. We join you in rejoicing over the success of President Alderman's administration! Long may he continue to go in and out among you as your intellectual leader and the worthy exponent of your spirit. But though methods of administration vary, Jefferson's conception of the place and function of the Faculty is so true and precious that the University can never afford to part with it. It is through the eminence of its professors that the University of Virginia has attained the great influence and the high standing which it to-day enjoys. May their tribe continue and increase! So shall the noble University which they serve and of which all America is proud fulfill the universal heart's desire: Semper Floreat! RESPONSE OF REVEREND ANSON PHELPS STOKES, D.D., OF YALE UNIVERSITY Mr. Rector, Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I hardly recognize myself in the highly colored picture which the Toastmaster has so generously painted of my character and work. His estimate was evidently not shared by the officers of a publication in Chicago with some such title as "Distinguished Young Americans" who recently wrote me enclosing a sketch of my life from Who's Who and added, "you are not quite up to our standard, but if you will forward $10 we will include sketch of your life!" However, a local undertaker in my home town thinks better of me, for he recently asked me to join the Coöperative Burial Association. I told him that I did not feel so inclined, but would like to know the conditions. He replied that if I would pay $10 down and $5 a year they would guarantee to give me and every member of my family a $100 funeral. He added: "I know, Mr. Stokes, that this is not a financial necessity for you, but the fact of the matter is that if we can bury you and a few other people of local prominence we will gain much prestige!" Your Chairman, in writing to me and the other speakers, courteously suggested a ten minute limit. I had not supposed before that the South cared anything about time. But you are even stricter in your requirements than we in the College Chapel at Yale, where President Hadley is reported to have answered a preacher's inquiries by saying, "We have no time limit at Yale, but few souls are saved after twenty minutes!" What, only ten minutes to pay my respects to Thomas Jefferson, to President Alderman, to Charlottesville, the State of Virginia, the South and this great University, and in addition to say something about University ideals! It seems like a sheer impossibility, but I will do my best. First, as to Thomas Jefferson. No man can speak here without paying his tribute to the sage of Monticello. Although a Northerner and a New England man, I was brought up by my father to have great respect for the political teachings of Thomas Jefferson, and I do not regret this. I am proud that my University was among the first in this country to honor him by giving him in 1786 the degree of LL.D. I remember that when Jefferson visited New Haven two years previously and was introduced by Roger Sherman to Ezra Stiles, the latter, then President of Yale University, put in his diary: "The Governor is a most ingenious Naturalist and Philosopher —a truly scientific and learned man—in every way excellent"—an admirable tribute to which most of us are glad to give assent. I know of no place in America which is so dominated by the personality of one man as this place has been by that of Thomas Jefferson. One has to go to Europe for its counterpart. At Eisenach you breathe the spirit of Martin Luther. At Assisi you feel the very presence of St. Francis. So is it here with the "father of the University." The beautiful pageant yesterday evening showed "the shadow of the founder." May it never grow less, but may it stand for all time as a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night to hold this institution, this Commonwealth and this Nation up to the high educational and political ideals for which he stood. And now as to President Alderman. I often wondered why the University of Virginia went for eighty years without a President. I realize now that it was largely because it took this length of time before the spirit of Jefferson was reincarnated in someone who could carry out his educational ideals here. As a political philosopher, as an eloquent speaker, as a man of broad culture and of high conceptions of a University, President Alderman may in many ways be considered the living representative of the founder, the one on whom the mantle of Elijah has fallen. We have had at my University during the past twenty years many of the most distinguished speakers from America and abroad. Theodore Roosevelt gave his first public address as President of the United States at Yale's Bicentennial. Woodrow Wilson delivered at Yale his great address on Scholarship, before the Phi Beta Kappa. Many other orators have made a profound impression upon Yale audiences, but no one has made a speech which created a more profound impression than that delivered by President Alderman at a Yale commencement a decade ago when we gave him our highest honor, the Doctor of Laws degree. As a colleague of your President's for many years on the General Education Board I have gained a deep respect and affection for him. I know of no one in this country who interprets all that is best in the South to the North, and all that is best in the North to the South, with more unfailing insight and a better spirit than he, and it would be hard to render a larger public service than this to the nation. And now as to the University. There are many reasons why the University of Virginia should make a profound appeal to all thoughtful Americans. I have time to mention but four. It stands for beauty. There is no academic group in America of more simple charm and dignity than that which Jefferson designed about the Lawn here. Virginia is the only American university that has passed through the Victorian period without being saddled with some architectural monstrosity. I hear some of you complain of your Geology Museum, but it would pass among the best buildings at some of our educational institutions! I can only hope that you will continue your policy of developing a consistent architectural plan in one style. If a donor should come along and offer you a million dollars for some much-needed building with the understanding that he could choose his architect without reference to the University's plan, I hope that the Board of Visitors may have the courage to decline the offer. You have escaped all "early North German Lloyd" and "late Hamburg-American" here, and you must maintain your precious heritage! It stands for breadth. Here was developed under Jefferson's guidance the first real university ideal in America, for Jefferson's system included medicine, and law, and the fine arts, and statesmanship, and engineering, and mental and natural philosophy, and almost all the other departments which universities have developed in the past half century. He had a broad plan, and he showed his breadth by instituting here at an early day what was virtually the elective system in the different schools of study. This breadth has been well maintained, and it is seen to-day not only in the curriculum, but in the fact that students come here not only from the Commonwealth of Virginia, but from all the States of the South, from many States of the North, and from foreign countries. It stands for idealism. The incident of the carved marble column about which so much was made last evening has its profound significance. Jefferson and his successors have had high ideals. The starting here of the honor system, which has meant so much to American universities, was a good example of this. So is your Chapel, a building, I regret to say, not always found in state universities; so is the record of your great scholars Gildersleeve, Sylvester, Moore and many others. It stands for public service. Founded by one President of the United States, guided by two others, it has nurtured a fourth, and has trained at least as large a proportion of men for the highest public service of the nation as any American university. And now as to the future. A university like the University of Virginia has many functions. In its College it will train men as leaders in citizenship; in its professional departments it will continue to give men the highest preparation as lawyers, doctors, engineers, teachers; in its Graduate School it will extend the boundaries of the world's knowledge, and, perhaps most important of all, as a University it will hand down through all its schools and departments the culture and traditions of the past. This last is a matter of vital importance in our changing democracy. All is in flux. We have not in this country many of the institutions such as an established church, or a royal family, or great buildings like Westminster Abbey bearing memorials of many centuries, which hand down and focus attention on national traditions. For some of these lacks we are thankful. For others we express regret; but the fact remains that there are few American institutions which sum up so much history and are so well fitted to transmit the heritage of the past to future generations as our historic universities. For these reasons I say with you most heartily to-night "Diu floreat Alma Mater Virginiensis." RESPONSE OF PRESIDENT HARRY WOODBURN CHASE, PH.D., OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA The ties of friendship and affection which link the University of Virginia with the institution that I am privileged to represent to-night are so close, so intimate, that no formal words of congratulation on my part could possibly convey the warmth and heartiness of the greetings which I bring you from the University of North Carolina. Both of us are children of that far-visioned Southern statesmanship which so soon saw that democracy must make public provision for the training of its leaders; we have known common sorrow and mutual joy; we have learned each other's temper at work and at play; we claim, equally with you, him who at this hour presides over your destinies—our own alumnus, teacher, and president, whose Alma Mater greets him and rejoices with him at this birthday feast. On an occasion such as this, one is torn inevitably between the mood of the historian and the mood of the prophet. A milestone has been reached in the history of a great public, a great national, institution. It marks the completion of a century of distinguished achievement; a century spent in the growing of men whose careers are a more lasting memorial than bronze to the magnitude of the service of this University. But it is, I know, your temper, as it is the temper of America, to conceive of anniversaries not merely as memorials, but as points of departure. The mind kindles not only with the memory of that rich and glorious past which is yours, but in no less measure with the vision of the splendid promise which lies ahead. Thus it seems to me of happy significance that we should celebrate with you your centennial, with all its joy in work well done, at the moment when you and your sister universities of the South are called to the performance of a task, certainly of greater magnitude, perhaps of greater difficulty, than any that lies behind. For it is very clear that the South is even now beginning the writing of a great new chapter in her history, whose theme is to be the final and full release of her splendid material and human resources. There is no braver story in history than the story of the last half-century in the South; the story of her struggle for reëstablishment and for liberation from poverty and from ignorance, which was its sequel. I cannot think it without significance that the men who had the courage and the vision to make that fight have been men of the stock and the blood that made America, children, almost without exception, of the colonists, the pioneer, the builders of our country, they are making a new civilization where their fathers made a new nation. Such is the blood which flows in the veins of the youth of the Southland. Who can fail to see what promise their liberation holds for the South and for America! This is the South's appointed hour. Out of the hearts and minds of her sons then shall surely proceed—is even now proceeding—a new, a greater and a higher order. Thus the task of the Southern university of our generation must be, in the full sense of the word, constructive. Men must be trained for full participation in the difficult and complex responsibilities of a swiftly developing new civilization, fitted to live happy and productive lives in an environment that shifts and alters even as we view it. And it is, I think, no less the task of the universities of the South to guide, to focus, to interpret to themselves and to the world this great forward, upward movement of democracy, to do their utmost to see to it that it becomes, not merely a great national expansion, but a steady enrichment of life in all its higher reaches. The task of the Southern State universities is then to-day in a very real sense a pioneering task, as in the days of their foundation. Their journey is again by unknown, untried ways. To you, University of Virginia, born of the spirit of the pioneer, to you who played so bravely your part in the making of your State and your country, beloved by us all, hallowed by memories that cluster about you— to you we bid Godspeed as your second century begins, in confident assurance that your contribution to the future South will be as free, as splendid, as enduring, as has been the service of the century you have passed. The new South, the new day, is here. May you go forward, under skies that brighten more and more, with steps that falter not, and a vision that never shall grow dim. RESPONSE BY THE HONORABLE THOMAS WATT GREGORY, FORMER ATTORNEY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES Mr. Toastmaster and Ladies and Gentlemen: The experience of the ages has demonstrated that liars are divided into three ascending grades—the liar, the damn liar, and the old Alumnus. It is astonishing how, on an occasion like this, the fossil representative of a former generation of students magnifies and manufactures the Homeric deeds of his youth. He likes to think that in the old days he was a distinct menace to society, that the faculty quailed when he went on the rampage, and that the police of Charlottesville took to the Ragged Mountains when his voice was heard in the land. He may have been the mildest sheep in the entire flock, but he will bow his back and purr like a cat on hearing his son whisper that "Dad was a devil in his day." Few people believe these stories of the old timer any more than the story-teller himself believes them. I claim no monopoly of veracity, but it does no harm to tell the truth occasionally, and besides it sometimes pays. I recall a citizen of my native State of Mississippi who was elected to Congress and remained there twenty years, largely because he openly proclaimed that he had been a private soldier in the Confederate Army. The great body of privates, who were masquerading as captains, and majors, and colonels, voted for this man because they had a sneaking admiration for his honesty and were unwilling to see his grade become extinct. He developed into a national character known as "John Allen, the only surviving private soldier of the Confederacy." With deep humiliation I confess that when I attended the University of Virginia during seven months of the collegiate years of 1883-4 I was "a grind." I trust that this candid confession will be remembered in my favor at the judgment day, if not sooner. I did not belong to the German Club or the Eli Bananas; I did not take calico even in homeopathic doses; I did not have more than two pairs of pants at any time, and only one pair during much of the time. For me it was a period of grinding labor, with few friendships, interspersed with little of lighter vein. I was a part of the wreckage of a stricken South. I was born just after the first battle of Manassas. My father died in the Confederate Army. A widowed mother, with painful toil, accumulated the small fund which enabled me to enjoy for a few months the best instruction the South afforded. I came to sit at the feet of John B. Minor and Stephen O. Southall, to breathe an atmosphere sanctified by Monticello and the grave of its builder, to gather inspiration from the best that was left of the old South by contact with its loftiest minds. Almost forty years have passed and "the old grind" comes back, and will tell you why he comes back. Those were the most valuable seven months of my life, and looking backward I can clearly see what made them so. Loyalty is the finest word in any language; as long as you have it you will be young in heart and worth associating with, and when you lose it your years will be of little value to anyone, least of all to yourself. I have the most profound sympathy for former students of this Institution who are absent on this occasion without good excuse. They remind me of the unhappy Scotchman who said he found no more pleasure in smoking, that when he was smoking his own tobacco he was thinking of how much it cost him, and when he was smoking the other fellow's tobacco he packed his pipe so tight it wouldn't draw. In contemplating the indifference of those who show no appreciation of past associations and the high ideals which bring us here I recall the words of Stevenson when he heard of the death of Matthew Arnold: "I am sorry for poor Arnold, he will not like God." Like most of you, I have long since forgotten most of what I learned in the classroom of "The Old Annex," though God knows John B. tried hard enough to teach me the distinction between an executory devise and a contingent remainder. I have never been an enthusiastic admirer of the mere scholar, and recall with malignant pleasure that John Randolph of Roanoke once said of a very erudite opponent that "the gentleman reminded him of the soil of Virginia,—poor by nature and worn out by cultivation." What then is the tie that binds? What is the mark set upon the brow of the student of that long past day? What did he take away from here which he has not forgotten? It was the teachings of Thomas Jefferson, and the personal example of the men who constituted the Faculty of the University during the years immediately following the Civil War. In those days the spirit and influence of Jefferson brooded over this Institution like the wings of a mother bird. If asked to state his doctrine in few words I would say it was the principle of individual liberty and a corresponding individual responsibility. He was not so much interested in protecting the rights of the States against the powers of the National Government, as he was in protecting the rights of the individual against the encroachments of all authority. Out of this fundamental belief of Jefferson grew, among other things, your original faculty organization, your honor system which has spread over all the land, the right of the student to select his courses, the freedom of the student from restraint outside of the classroom, and the trial by an organized student body of all infractions of a high code of personal integrity. Well might he dictate for an inscription upon his marble sentinel—not that he was Minister to France, not that he was Secretary of State, not that he was Governor of Virginia, not that he was Vice-President of the United States, not that he was President of the United States—but that he was the "Father of the University of Virginia." And as long as the old Arcades, planned by the Master's hand, shall stand, as long as her sons shall bear her honored name to every section of this Republic, so long shall the University of Virginia be counted no unworthy monument to her mighty founder. To the memory of the Faculty of that day I bow in humble reverence. They were a Spartan band, but old age had crept upon them. They had toiled for a third of a century in making the University of Virginia the Mecca of learning for all the South, and had established here a standard of scholarship probably unequaled on this continent. They had lived through war and defeat. Finally the tempest of reconstruction had swept over them, carrying away for the moment every landmark of social status and political faith, and leaving these men standing, with folded arms and undaunted courage, amid the flotsam and jetsam of creeds which were knit into every fiber of their beings and ancestral traditions which had become a part of their daily lives. Their attitude carried no craven apology for the past and no unseemly defiance of the future. Speaking of the typical Southern leader of that day, Daniel H. Chamberlain, the reconstruction ruler of South Carolina, said: "I consider him a distinct and really noble growth of our American soil. For, if fortitude under good and under evil fortune, if endurance without complaint of what comes in the tide of human affairs, if a grim clinging to ideals once charming, if vigor and resiliency of character and spirit under defeat and poverty and distress, if a steady love of learning and letters when libraries were lost in flames and the wreckage of war, if self-restraint when the long-delayed relief at last came; if, I say, all these qualities are parts of real heroism, if these qualities can vivify and ennoble a man or a people, then our own South may lay claim to an honored place among the differing types of our great common race." Such was the matured judgment of the Massachusetts Governor of South Carolina during the reconstruction period in regard to men of this type, and there is nothing I would wish to add to it except this—that when we of the South forget the precept and example of these men, when we forget that from them there has come down to us a heritage of loyalty, of manhood and of courage such as the world has seldom known, when we forget these things then God, in His infinite justice, should forget us. The "old grind" has not forgotten. He is here to-night to renew his allegiance to these men and what they stood for, and to reconsecrate himself to the faith that was theirs. THE FOURTH DAY On the final day of the Centennial were held the regular commencement exercises of 1921, with a formal address by the President of the University; the meetings of the Alumni in departmental groups for technical discussion; the annual Class-Day celebration; the Alumni Barbecue, with the officials of the University, the delegates and other guests and their families, in attendance; and the closing Torchlight Parade and Fireworks on the Lawn. Immediately following the Commencement invocation and just before the conferring of degrees, the decoration of the Distinguished Service Cross of Serbia was presented to President Alderman by Mrs. Rosalie Slaughter Morton, M.D., of the International Serbian Educational Committee, representing the Government of Serbia, in the following address: Mr. President, Members of the Faculty, Delegates, Student-Body and Guests of the University of Virginia: It is with a great deal of pleasure that I have come this morning to present to the President of the University of Virginia the Distinguished Service Cross of Serbia. In the tenth century there was a king's son whose name was Sava, and who said that he thought no man had the right to precedent which came through the accident of birth, and he therefore declared his intention not to succeed his father on the throne but to devote himself instead to a scholastic life. As the only schools of learning at that period were monasteries, he entered one and by the time his father, who lived to a good old age, was approaching the end of his life Sava had become through his industry and admirable character the chief of the order and his influence, directly and through the lives of those he helped to train, was far reaching for mental, moral and spiritual good. When the courtiers from the Palace came officially to tell him that it was his duty to study international relations and government policies with a view of fitting himself to rule the kingdom, he replied that it was more important for him to keep his word than to be king, and he refused to listen to their arguments and entreaties; so the succession passed to his brother. In many countries this man would have been regarded as a fanatic. In Serbia, where the spiritual has always outweighed the material, he was canonized and the maxim of St. Sava "by the excellence of your work you shall accomplish all things" became a precept for the guidance of youth. In 1883 when it became general for governments to recognize services through decorations, the cross of St. Sava was established as the Distinguished Service Order of Serbia, and on this occasion when the sons and daughters of this University are graduating to go forth into the world fulfilling the democratic precepts of St. Sava, the occasion is most fitting for presenting to the distinguished President of the University of Virginia this cross which is bestowed by the Serbian government in recognition of the intellectual comradeship shown by the universities and colleges in this State, in extending invitations to students who were qualified to enter the University of Belgrade, an opportunity to pursue their studies here; and also in appreciation of the hospital supplies presented to Serbia by Virginians. There are among the organizations represented at this Centennial twenty who have coöperated with the International Serbian Educational Committee; i. e., the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, University of the State of New York, State College of North Carolina, Bowdoin College, University of Maryland, Randolph-Macon College, Mount Holyoke College, Tufts College, Vassar College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cornell University, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, West Virginia University, Bureau of Education, University of California, Syracuse University, Sweet Briar College, Columbia University, and American Council on Education; and the cities where many men and women earnestly worked and from which were sent hospital equipment and supplies to lessen suffering and save life in Serbia are Charlottesville, Richmond, Petersburg, Norfolk, Lynchburg, Danville, and Staunton. Therefore, Mr. President, with great appreciation of the world spirit of Virginia, the Government of Serbia authorized the presentation of this medal which I am privileged to ask you to accept, symbolizing as it does a love of learning in Serbia which has come down through a thousand years, as a tribute on this Centennial occasion of the University from which so many with high purpose, wide vision, great faith and successful accomplishment have gone forth. THE RESPONSE OF PRESIDENT ALDERMAN I am deeply grateful to His Majesty, the King of Serbia, for this valued decoration, and to you a veteran in the service of the Serbian people, for your gracious presentation. I shall cherish it always as a souvenir of a gallant people who knew how to win their liberties by the exercise of unexampled valor and devotion. Friday, June 3d 11.00 A.M.

O God of Truth and Grace; the Truth through which freedom comes, the Grace to which alone and ever we must look for help. The years that are past are rendered illustrious by Thy mercies. The paths we have trodden have opened to our advancing steps, and have given new visions of Thy greatness and Thy glory, new experiences of Thy wisdom and Thy love. As we look back through the vista of the past we are grateful for Thy mercies. As we look forward to the coming years we are cheered by hope. We thank Thee for the prevision which planned this great Institution; for the wisdom which laid its foundations; for the skill which reared its walls; for the resoluteness which marked its construction; for the noble purpose which threw wide open its doors for its splendid educational career. We thank Thee that by Thy kind providence this Institution not only has made real the great ideal of its honored founder, but in its development and growth and achievement has surpassed even his beautiful dream. As we look back through all Thy protecting care during these one hundred years we are made profoundly grateful for the wonderful career and extraordinary record of this University. By Thy blessing it has been a Fountain of knowledge, where many have refreshed themselves; a School of Training where many have been fitted for life work; an Academy in the shades of which many have gathered about its great teachers and have been enriched by their wisdom. In Thy leading, to it youths have come in the glow of life's morning. From it they have gone forth men, qualified and incited to do great deeds and achieve great results. By Thy favor this Benign Mother has sent her sons out from these sacred scenes with benefits and blessings from her hand and heart. They in turn by their successful and brilliant careers have rendered yet more illustrious their Alma Mater. Looking toward the future we invoke for this honored and beloved University divine guidance. May all that has proved good in the past be preserved. May all that is good in the keeping of the future be bestowed in great fulness on this Institution. May it ever stand for highest ideals, for accurate and extensive scholarship, for truth and honor, for noblest character. Bless the Board of Visitors with wisdom to guide its affairs. Bless the Faculty that in every way they may meet their great responsibilities. Bless the students of the past, present and future. May they as year by year they go forth from this educational retreat, go forth in all the glory of superb character to be an honor to the State, the Nation and the World. Bless all the great educational institutions that by their distinguished representatives have conveyed their salutations and congratulations to this University on this Centennial of its life and work. In the great partnership of intellectual life and work may this high art of teaching and learning attain its noblest reach and broadest culture. May supreme human culture ever delight to sit humbly at the feet of Him who is Truth and who by the Truth makes Free. Amen. A CENTENNIAL ADDRESS By President Edwin Anderson Alderman, D.C.L., LL.D., of the University of Virginia The Father of this University, whose name has been upon the lips of so many during these days of commemoration, combined in his vivid personality something of the insight of the prophet, the imagination of the artist, and the engineer's passion for constructive detail. Like Kubla Khan in Xanadu, he could here a stately culture-dome decree, but he had no satisfaction until he had set down with a precise hand the specifications of the dream structure looming in the eye of his mind, enumerated its concrete tasks, and defined its immediate objectives. So clearly did he do this that he has enrolled his name among those who cannot be passed by in any enumeration of the educational reformers of the modern world. As the culminating unit in the great national moulding force which he— first of American educators—conceived education to be, he drew in one comprehensive sweep a charter of University function. It was declared that the task of the University was— "(1) To form the statesmen, legislators, and judges on whom public prosperity and individual happiness are so much to depend; "(2) To expound the principles and structure of government, the laws which regulate the intercourse of nations, those formed municipally for our own government, and a sound spirit of legislation which, banishing all unnecessary restraint on individual action, shall leave us free to do whatever does not violate the equal rights of another; "(3) To harmonize and promote the interests of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, and by well informed views of political economy, to give a free scope to the public industry; "(4) To develop the reasoning faculties of our youth, enlarge their minds, cultivate their morals, and instil into them the precepts of virtue and order; "(5) To enlighten them with mathematical and physical sciences, which advance the arts and administer to the health, the subsistence and comforts of human life; "(6) And, generally, to form them to habits of reflection and correct action, rendering them examples of virtue to others and of happiness within themselves." It may be doubted if any agent of society ever received general orders more liberal and catholic than these as it adventured forth to enlighten and elevate human thinking and increase human knowledge. Let us recall that they were drawn up in the first quarter of the nineteenth century. Nevertheless, the light from the sun of the democratic theory, then not high advanced in the heavens, illuminates each separate syllable. Inherent in them may be seen that interdependence of democracy and education which constitutes the basis of modern society, and out of them alone might be deduced the belief that in this secular world the highest optimism of mankind is embodied in the democratic theory and given heart and substance by the processes of education. I fancy there is clear to all of you the curious, impressive likeness between the scene of the world as it then lay before Jefferson's vision and the scene of the world that our own eyes behold. The century was young then as now. The slumbering injustice of ages had awakened and broken up the settled forms of order and society only to develop its own special brand of chaos, a vaster philosophy of force, and to meet its doom then as now before the free and unconquerable spirit of man. A world in transition and confusion had forgotten its high, unselfish emotions, succumbed to temporary pessimism and disillusion, substituted personal and class aggrandizement for patriotic passion, and, freed from the fierce stimulus of war, exhibited lassitude and a tendency to turn from big issues to immediate economic advantages. Then, as now, men felt that they beheld the end of an age and the beginning of another epoch; and the new seminary of 1819, like the mature mother of 1919, faced a convalescent world, fretful in its moods, let down in its morale, dull in its thinking, commonplace in its ideals, waiting irresolutely for guidance into right paths of peace and reconstruction. Then, as always, in this troubled but advancing world, the saving remnant saw the two great forces of permanent reconstruction—youth, unbound by tradition, unbroken by war, undepressed by events, because sustained by the glorious buoyancy that surrounds the morning of life, and, secondly, a new social theory of intelligent coöperation for the common good supplanting dull autocracy or benevolent despotism. Though thus alike in certain outward external characteristics, the transformation of the daring Republican experiment of the west during the passing of this century from a hope to a reality, the growth of democracy from the status of a dogma to the status of a practical governmental policy, the application of natural science through inventions to human needs, inaugurating the most rapid and extensive industrial revolution in all history, the advent of nationalism and its investment with almost religious sanction, separate the eras by a gulf of political motive and social purpose. It would seem to be a proper time to enquire if our University, sent forth so confidently, instructed so minutely, and beholding so clear a field of operation, has thus far played a just part in the drama of democratic society? Has it met the specifications of the great educational architect fairly and honestly? Let us not be tempted into mere boasting, for it is the last word of vulgarity, but I do proudly claim that the University, which forever hereafter you shall acclaim as your Alma Mater, has, under tragic difficulties, fulfilled the law and satisfied the contract, and has, therefore, a right to stand upright here to-day looking along the paths of the The Academic Procession from the Rotunda to the Amphitheatre new century with the vigor and purpose that come of an unclouded conscience and a quiet spirit. Have the young men of successive generations nourished here—twenty-two thousand in all—done their duty to the public and kept their honor clean? I challenge the records of the nation's service in all vocations, the rolls of the Senate, the Cabinet and diplomatic service, the Governor's chair, the roster of the Army and Navy, for proof that they have so lived and acted. This University has faced each crisis in the progress of the national life from the period of raw confidence in its virile youth to the portentous strength and moral dominance of the present most venerable republic of the world, with the leadership suited to each crisis; and it has made for itself institutionally in travail and self-examination a definite spirit and an atmosphere compounded of intense individualism, democratic sympathy, religious freedom, uncompromising integrity, distinction of standards and austere toil. These are granite virtues, and a house built upon them, let us thank God, is built upon a base that revolutionary storms cannot disintegrate or waste away. You and I, young men, have business with this University no less solemn, significant, and fateful, than the work which Thomas Jefferson and his associates found to do, and which has been carried on so faithfully by great teachers and scholars of succeeding generations. It may be that we shall not look upon their like again, for they were great democrats who issued out of aristocracy, and our reliance must be, in this later age, upon great aristocrats bred of democracy. But the University which they built stands here still for us to perpetuate a symbol of deathless fecundity, institutionally barely mature, its strength even now multiplied a hundred-fold, its responsibility a thousand-fold. Here the nation, its wildernesses conquered, its wealth piled up, its civilization composite of all mankind, its surging society made over literally in industrial method and social aim, beset with new perils and temptations, and awed by new grandeurs, seeks direction toward an ideal of Americanism which shall somehow define republican citizenship in terms of enduring value for all mankind. Yonder throngs over wider lawns and greater spaces and through nobler edifices at our bi-centennial, the great assize of your great grandchildren, asking with appraising minds, and the old sentimental loyalties, what part their University has played in the State and the nation and the world as the great social theory out of which it was born, still further unfolded its purposes, enlarged its implications, and strove toward its ultimate ascendancy. In that far future, we shall be the past, and we shall be a worthy past in proportion as we have served the present future. No past ever wins respectability, much less reverence, in any other way. We shall serve the future worthily in the degree in which we approach the majestic problem of human progress with openness of mind, with clear knowledge that does not deceive itself, with faith in trained men, and with sympathy for humanity erected into a practical philosophy. Liberalism, faith in God and man, sound and varied learning forever pushing back the horizons of knowledge, human coöperation—these are the cornerstones of the university of the future. Without them democracy itself may become a tyranny more gross and rapacious than ever cursed society and mere learning, as we ourselves have seen it, the sword of the cruel and the selfish instead of the torch of him who seeks the truth. I am aware that I seem to indicate a program of idealism so vast and slow as to suggest the processes of geologic growth. I am aware, too, that this program involves dealing with all grades and conditions of men, and may seem to take not sufficient thought of the obvious and immediate, or to yield brilliant and romantic results, but in its patient grandeur and resistless strength, it is warp and woof of the mighty theory inherent in its logic and necessary to its progress. Undoubtedly what the world most urgently and constantly needs is unusual and capable individuals who are valuable to life. I, for one, do not fear that education thus considered as a great socializing force, slowly moulding national life into higher forms, will miss these precious sports and rare individuals, and thus flatten out the surface of life into amiable mediocrity. I rather believe that the stature of mankind is in process of definite enlargement and that its giants will be giants still and taller if less detached and lonely. The qualities of men must make such differences in them forever as to preclude the fall of life to dull commonplaceness. The liberalism which I have planted as the first cornerstone of the University of the future, though far too comprehensive a creed to be written out here, means essentially emancipation from the dead hand of any authority that rests upon the human mind or spirit, to paralyze its energies or weaken its ardor. It means protest against treating as if it were a mutiny in a regiment the thinking of thinkers or the play of the conscience. John Morley points out that, after all, respect for the dignity and worth of the individual is its real root and while, like democracy itself, it is charged with explosives, almost everything that is new in any age may be traced to its hand. Thomas Jefferson was a greater liberal than John Morley. Those who invoke his name as a static influence in modern life have never met the man himself but only a wraith conjured up out of ignorance or misunderstanding. They certainly do not understand the young Albemarle farmer-lawyer, who at the age of twenty-two, stood tip-toe in the hall of the House of Delegates, at Williamsburg, and listened with bated breath to the fierce eloquence of Patrick Henry, and at the age of thirty-three, after giving the world the Declaration of American Independence, appeared in the colonial Capitol of the Old Dominion with four or five bills in his pocket which proposed to revolutionize the existing social order and to inaugurate a new economic, religious, and educational life in the Commonwealth. In letters to Joseph Priestley and others, Jefferson thus set forth a plain philosophy of belief in the orderly growth of human institutions unhindered by dull conservatism: "The Gothic idea that we were to look backwards instead of forwards for the improvement of the human mind, and to recur to the annals of our ancestors for what is most perfect in government, in religion and in learning, is worthy of those bigots in religion and government, by whom it has been recommended, and whose purposes it would answer. But it is not an idea which this country will endure. "When I contemplate the immense advances in science and discoveries in the arts which have been made within the period of my life, I look forward with confidence to equal advances by the present generation, and have no doubt they will consequently be as much wiser than we have been as we than our fathers were and they than the burners of witches. "We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy, as civilized society to remain under the regimen of their ancestors." The World War, just ended, subjected the social theory, out of which this University was born and to which it is dedicated, to a pitiless crossexamination by the mind and spirit of mankind. What is the verdict? It is generally agreed that this theory has accomplished more for the improvement of human society than any other social scheme in history, that it is nevertheless no patent social panacea and harbors many weaknesses. It is agreed by some with alarm that it has greatly advanced its point of view from a theory of the political rights of man to a theory of social and economic fairness and even perfection. It is clear that it is triumphant, indeed that it is about the only thing in the past century that has never stopped advancing, despite the apparent collapse of 1914, from its faint beginnings as small group cooperation for the protection of common rights to the emergence of the Covenant of the League of Nations, the bravest and most reasonable effort in all political history to rationalize world relations and to protect all mankind against its deadliest enemy. However severe an indictment may be brought against it as a perfect system, its defenders can safely put the question—What better alternative do you offer? Did not the American, the French, and the British democracies, under the great test, demonstrate the essential spiritual validity at least of the doctrine and give proof that its strength was grounded on the best there is in the nature of man? The eighteenth century sought the answer to the question—What are the rights of man? It was the age of Constitutions, Declarations, Revolutions. The insistent query of the nineteenth century was—How are these rights to be made available for the production of wealth? The twentieth century, which most concerns us and which we must deal with, is grappling with the problem—What is the duty of society in regard to the wealth which it has created and the liberty which it inherited? Lord Bryce asserts that the ideal of securing material conditions of comfort and well-being for everybody, erected into a doctrine of humanitarianism, has so dominated the minds of modern leaders as to endanger and obscure all other ideals and especially the ideal of individual liberty. Men fear discomfort more than tyranny and hardship more than autocrats. The great question of our time, then, toward the solution of which universities must furnish right wisdom, is to restore liberty conceived in the old American sense to the place it once held in men's thoughts and yet to find somehow the golden mean between the individualism which safeguards human freedom and the collectivism which ensures social progress. Men will no longer love a government which seems to them merely "anarchy plus the policeman," and they will not have any government to love if it shall become a vast benevolent society preoccupied principally with promoting material welfare. The solid glory of this nation, or any nation, must, it would seem, finally be determined by its ability to comprehend and readapt the theory and practice of democracy as it reacts upon society in its progressive changes as an eternal faith elastic enough to confront and strong enough to overcome the changing forms of human error and injustice. As democracy thus redefines itself, education, as its foremost policy, must redefine itself, and the University as the chief servant of education must re-examine and re-relate its power to the life about it. Do not imagine that I shall here seek to define an American University in any rigid terms. Experience has been called the best definer, and the pressure of social situations the logical moulder. For us Jefferson's educational specifications stand as steadfast in their field as his other great Charter in the field of political liberty, needing only to be expanded to meet the needs of a world society made into one organic unit by the rise of new scientific inventions and economic laws, the advent of new professions, the call of new knowledges, the implications of that great modern outlook which proclaims that the community must seek to obtain for all of its children what the wisest parent desires for his own child. I dare to declare to you, young gentlemen, my belief that the future of this University will not be unworthy of its past. The century that lies before us with its unimagined wealth of new truth and new aspirations and new entanglements will behold the University of Virginia, clothed in greater strength and beauty, standing, as of old, at the northern gateway of the South, embodying in its physical form and spiritual essence something of the note of romanticism, with its central quality of exaltation of personality, its deep loyalties and that balancing power of conservatism peculiar to the region out of which it sprang. Power to interpret the distinct sections of American life to each other will reside in it, and out of it will issue into the mighty national stream the values of old Americanism and the best inheritances of the English consciousness, moulding the individual man into dignity of life and skilled usefulness, and yet working toward a larger collective future, where every man may seek to earn a power to use and a dignity to cherish. As a Fortress of truth hardly won, I behold it undertaking to assemble and preserve the bequests of civilization in its museums, libraries, and laboratories. As a Workshop, it will be busy seeking to liberate the mind and spirit of men and women by acquiring through honest work the truth that exists and winning through discovery the truth that lures, while through wise selective processes, it will sift the masses of young scholars and craftsmen within its walls for talent and genius. This is its daily, primary, elemental task. In this Workshop scholarship is the product sought for and the power to adjust the mind to the greater issue as it arises, the end aimed at. As a Dynamo I perceive it sending its force through all the avenues of life in such fashion as to touch and mould the sources of public opinion, thus realizing Fichte's dream of a University as a place from which, as from the spiritual heart of a community, a current of life energy might be poured through all of its members. As a Commander-in-Chief in the great warfare against incompetence, it will seek to coördinate the whole daring process of public education—elementary, secondary, cultural, and vocational—into one unified servant of the State, in accordance with Edmund Burke's noble conception of the relation between the State and the University as "a partnership in all science, a partnership in all art, a partnership in every virtue and in all perfection, and, since such a partnership cannot be attained in one generation, a partnership between all those who are living and those who are dead and those who are unborn." As a Watch-tower, it shall stand upon its hill and strive to discern and comprehend the flow of life about its base, so that it may furnish, through trained leadership, technical guidance, liberal direction, and spiritual power to that life. As an Altar and a Home, seated amid classical and peaceful scenes, where friendships are made and convictions formed and youth emerges through self-expression into manhood, it will contrive to distill an atmosphere to which the creators of the new civilization may repair for quiet standards of straight thinking, good taste, Christian living, clean honor, and fidelity to trust. As a Lighthouse, it shall rise above the tempests of the times, a beacon to those who voyage in darkness, a shelter to those who have found the light, a luminous guide to juster and wiser paths of action and life. And now, finally, young gentlemen of the Class of 1921, may I recall to you that you are in a very real sense a most fortunate group. You entered here as a class when the University was a military camp, organized to train you to become soldiers of your country then engaged in a great war in defense of liberty and public right. You have served under the flag of your country by land and sea and in the air. You reach your collegiate climax amid the big emotions, tender memories, and high hopes of this Centennial festival, and you pass out into a world sadly out of joint and calling for brave and capable men to set it straight. I believe you are men of such quality. I bear testimony that you have borne yourselves handsomely in this University world. You are to take your part in your country's life in a period of world-wide dramatic unrest, of definite conflict between the old American individualism and the demands of new social and industrial organization. To do your part well will test you to the utmost in mind and character. The spirit of youth is the salvation of society. Your University has affection for you and faith in you. "I do not know beneath what sky Or on what sea shall be thy fate; I only know it shall be high, I only know it shall be great." ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY One year ago the alumni of this University conceived the plan of presenting to their Alma Mater, on her One Hundredth Birthday, a gift expressive of their faith and gratitude. On March 7th, after wise organization, the movement was launched to realize this purpose. I need not remind this company that this has been a period of unusual depression in the world of business. I hold in my hand a statement authorized by John Stewart Bryan and Frederic William Scott, Joint Chairmen of the Centennial Endowment Fund, and prepared by Armistead Mason Dobie, Executive Director of the Fund, formally presenting this gift to the University of Virginia, and informing me that its total amounts, to date, to $1,300,000. In behalf of the Governing Bodies and the Faculties of the University, I accept this handsome gift of her loyal sons, of two great foundations—the Carnegie Corporation and the General Education Board—and of wise patriotic citizens of this State and nation who were not trained here, but who believe it to be for the public good that Jefferson's University should be properly equipped to face the demands of the new century. The gratitude Old Alumni in Procession (Class of '61) and appreciation of this University goes out in full measure to every subscriber to this fund. I have mentioned Messrs. John Stewart Bryan and Frederic William Scott, the Chairmen of the Fund, who have given of their best strength and substance to this movement. I take leave to mention again with gratitude the name of the Executive Director, Armistead Mason Dobie, who has given to this work for one year his ability, energy, and devotion, without stint. I cannot pass by the names of Lewis Crenshaw who has devoted his strength to Alumni service and Charles A. McKeand, who has served so ably as Executive Secretary. I wish time was afforded me to call the roll of the faithful regional chairmen and indeed the whole list of subscribers—alumni and non-alumni. Suffice it to say that their names will find place in our history and in our hearts, and we shall not forget them. Such manifestations of public spirit are rare in the lives of state universities. It is the State's business to maintain and develop its own University. If it seemed proper after a century of service that the privilege of giving to this faithful agent of society should be afforded to good citizens and loyal sons everywhere, it was not intended to relieve the Commonwealth of Virginia of the primary duty and responsibility of maintaining adequately an institution which it brought into life and which exists to serve its people. In recent years, the State has greatly increased its appropriations to higher education and under circumstances of great difficulty. May this example of general public appreciation incite Virginia to still more adequate treatment of its chiefest public servant! It is my pleasure to announce further, as an independent gift to the University of Virginia, the sum of $200,000, for the distinct purpose of establishing, on the basis now existing, a Department of Commerce and Finance in this University. This contribution is the gift of a great citizen and far-seeing student of social affairs in his own State and the nation—Paul Goodloe McIntire. Mr. McIntire has already enrolled himself among the great benefactors of the University—indeed the very greatest in its history—and of this community in so distinguished a way as to make it difficult to add new appreciation to his services. In the School of Fine Arts, bearing his name, he has sought to care for the spiritual and cultural aspects of life. In this new department, he seeks to care in a high way for training in the great field which develops trade and commerce and material prosperity. The South has furnished more than its share of great soldiers, statesmen and lawyers. It is his belief that we must now prepare to train great business men for the important services of trade and commerce. The University repeats its former expressions of gratitude to this wise helper of men. ADDRESSES AT DEPARTMENTAL ALUMNI CONFERENCES I. The Clerical Alumni RELIGIOUS MINISTRATIONS IN STATE UNIVERSITIES BY DENOMINATIONAL AGENCIES By Rev. Beverley D. Tucker, Jr., D.D., of the Episcopal Theological Seminary, Alexandria, Va. The opportunity for service which the State universities offer to the Church is one that has been largely neglected in the past. The older universities and colleges in America were established under definitely religious auspices, and long after the rise of the State university the various Christian communions tended to limit their sense of responsibility to those educational institutions, which bore the imprimatur of their respective denominations. Moreover, with the principle of the separation of Church and State fundamental in our national constitution, the problem of how the Church may wisely minister in a State university is a delicate and complicated one. The utmost care has to be exercised to avoid denominational prejudices— no system will be tolerated in which the privileges are not theoretically equal for members of every religious affiliation. As a corollary of this principle of religious freedom, the system adopted should not involve any form of coercion; attendance upon religious exercises must needs be voluntary. Dr. Philip A. Bruce has recently described at length (in his History of the University of Virginia) the extreme caution which Jefferson observed in eliminating every trace of denominational influence in the formative period of the University of Virginia's life. So scrupulous was he to enforce his fundamental principle that "education and sectarianism must be divorced," that in his original plan for the University, states Dr. Bruce, he made no real concession to religious feeling beyond providing a room in the Rotunda for religious worship. As religion, however, is an irrepressible factor in human life, the demand that the University should be other than neutral in religious expression soon made itself felt. The first proposal to make good this deficiency was put forward by Jefferson himself. The proposal was that each of the principal denominations should establish its own theological school just without the confines of the institution. Thereby would have been established a natural liaison between the secular education of the State and the religious education of the Christian communions. One can only voice the regret that the leaders of the Church in that day had not the vision to carry out the proposal. Through such an arrangement mutual confidence and respect might have been the resulting relationship between the religious and educational forces of the State rather than the suspicion and misunderstanding that has too frequently characterized their mutual attitude. While this opportunity for coöperation between the University and the Church on a large scale was not taken, yet the demand for some religious expression in the life of the faculty and students soon received a modified provision. As early as 1829 a plan of engaging the services of a chaplain was undertaken by those interested. The support was arranged by voluntary subscriptions, and the chaplain elected, in rotation, from the leading denominations of the State. This plan continued in operation, in one form or another, until 1896. For a portion of this period regular religious services were held in one of the University halls set apart for that purpose; later, a chapel was built on the ground, the funds for the purpose being contributed, not by the State, but by friends and alumni of the institution. From 1896 until 1917 the plan was adopted of inviting distinguished clergymen from the various denominations to conduct religious services in the Chapel as a substitute for the earlier plan of having a resident chaplain. The Young Men's Christian Association, through its general secretary, stood sponsor for the plan and, in addition to the Sunday services, made provision for Bible study groups and fostered opportunities for social service. Theoretically there is much to be said for each of these plans. Their primary motive was to furnish a method of religious cooperation, which would be interdenominational in character. Practically neither method proved an adequate solution of the real situation. The latter plan lacked continuity both in the personality of the leader and in the mode of worship. Both plans failed to furnish any definite connection with the previous religious training of the students or to make any positive preparation for the church life, to which the student might go after leaving the University. In 1917, the Faculty Committee on Religious Exercises decided to discontinue the chapel services and to make an appeal, through the Charlottesville Ministerial Association, to the various religious denominations to assume a more definite oversight of their adherents at the University. The immediate occasion for taking this step was the general upheaval at the University owing to war conditions, but the committee frankly recognized that the chapel system had served its day and had become a burden to be borne rather than a stimulus to the religious life of the University. While such a system might supplement, it could not serve as a substitute for the organized ministrations of the various communions. Moreover, this appeal to the Church as such to assume the leadership in providing religious opportunities for the members of the University was in line with Jefferson's original policy, namely, of making no provision for theological education in the University curriculum and proposing that the various denominations should establish their divinity schools in the university neighborhood. As early as 1910, the Episcopal Church had taken a positive step in this direction. Recognizing the inadequacy of the university chapel system in providing pastoral oversight and cultivating church loyalty; recognizing, furthermore, the practical difficulty of adding the pastoral care of the Episcopal students at the University to the extensive parochial duties of the rector of the local church in Charlottesville, the Diocese of Virginia has organized a parish, with its own rector, in the University community, for the avowed purpose of ministering to its adherents among the students and faculty. An excellent building site has been purchased and a temporary chapel erected, where for the past ten years regular services have been held. The plans provide for the building of a permanent church as soon as the funds are available. While a local congregation, over and above the student and faculty members, has come into being, yet the work is regarded in the nature of a diocesan responsibility. The bishop has authority to insure the selection of a clergyman who is qualified to be a helpful pastor and preacher to a student community, and the diocese assumes the obligation of assisting the local congregation in the financial outlay for building and retaining such a church. An alternative to this plan, and one that is being tried in many State universities, would be to add to the staff of the local congregation a student pastor, who will serve the university community and foster the affiliation of the students with the Charlottesville church of their respective denominations. The fundamental principle to be observed in both of these plans is this, that the State University, where our young men and women gather from many parts of the country at a critical stage in their intellectual and spiritual development, should be regarded as a special field of service by the Church. It requires an oversight more definite than a collegiate chapel system can furnish. It calls for leaders, who are especially qualified and trained for work among students; for leaders, moreover, who can give their whole time and thought to the moral and religious life of the university community; and is a work of too great importance to be tacked on as an incident of the busy life of a local rector or pastor. In this day when the outlook for Christian unity seems more hopeful and encouraging than in the past, the system outlined above may seem to imply a backward step, a building higher the walls of partition. Personally, I should conceive it as a step forward in the direction of Christian unity. The colorless, vague religion of a college chapel makes not for religious unity but for religious negation. I have greater confidence in the fact that a group of broad-minded student pastors, working together for the moral and spiritual life of the University, will do far more to create that attitude of mutual trust and tolerance, which is the first step toward cooperation and unity. The problems confronting the different college pastors would be much the same. Through conference and through combined efforts in service extension and Bible study there will be many natural opportunities for fellowship in the Christian life. Unless our ideal is for a dead uniformity rather than for a lively unity, I have greater hope of Christian unity in the direction of positive loyalties than of amiable negations. Abstract of an Address by Rev. Samuel Chiles Mitchell, Ph.D., LL.D., of the University of Richmond Mr. Chairman: In addition to the plans of the preceding speaker, the only suggestion I can make is that the various denominations coöperate with the Young Men's Christian Association in the maintenance of a University Preacher on permanent tenure. In this way I believe a man on the order of Phillips Brooks could be secured, who would give his whole strength and time to the religious life of the University. Such a man as Bishop McDowell, or Dr. Gilkie, or Dr. Jowett would make a lasting impression upon the University community by his continuous presence and by his messages, springing out of the changing needs of the student body. The advantages of a permanent tenure over the chaplaincy for two years, which was the custom in my student days here, and over the place of having different visiting ministers from Sunday to Sunday, are apparent. By permanency of office you can get a really great personality whose voice will command attention everywhere. His interpretation of the spiritual life will be progressive in spirit and cumulative in effect. He will enter sympathetically into the life of the individual student as well as reënforce the religious purposes of the University community as a whole. In Madison Hall we have an agency with which the denominations can work to this end. Whatever might be lost to specifically denominational interests by this plan, would in my opinion be more than made up by the emphasis upon the essentials of Christianity which such a preacher would give, thus enriching religious life and truth for all through the University. HOW MAY RELIGIOUS CULTURE BE GIVEN TO THE STATE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY? By Rev. Thomas Cary Johnson, D.D., LL.D., of the Union Theological Seminary, Richmond, Va. The subject as assigned—"Religious Culture in State Universities by Denominational Agencies" suggests several theses which hardly require discussion in this body, to wit: First: The university community should have religious culture. There may be small groups of people here and there which would dispute this thesis; but it may be asserted safely that the vast majority of thoughtful people the world over would maintain that the university community, as certainly as it is included within the grade of rational and responsible agents and as certainly as it is to exercise an indefinitely large influence for weal or woe on the rest of the State, should have religious culture. It may be even more boldly assumed, also, that this body of "clerical alumni" would consider it worse than a waste of time—an impertinence, indeed—to set about proving on this occasion, the truth of a thesis which our very calling proclaims that we hold—a thesis which we can deny only on pain of professing ourselves to be hypocrites. Second: The State University in these United States of America cannot of itself give an adequate religious culture. Men are found to say: "If theism be true and discovered, and if its teaching be necessary to the stability of the State, the State may teach it." Granted for the sake of argument; yet we all say that bare theism—the doctrine of a personal God, the Creator and Moral Governor of the Universe —is inadequate religious culture; and for adequate religious teaching the State has neither warrant nor fitness—no warrant, its constitution gives none; no fitness through possession of an adequate religious creed, or of a holy character. So far is it from possessing an adequate creed which it may teach, its sovereign people hold some of them one thing and some of them the contradictory thereto. Nor has the State the holiness of character to be desired in a teacher of religion. The State as represented by its government, and as represented by the Board of Regents of the University, may be pious in one era and impious in the next. The State has no fitness, as no commission, to teach any other religion than bare theism, if to teach that; and its attempting to do so would be an impious assumption. Good Americans and good Virginians, it is taken for granted that we all agree that the State must not attempt to give an adequate religious culture, and that the State University—an organ of the State—should not attempt it. Third: That religious denomination which possesses in its creed the largest amount of cardinal religious truth, is, other things being equal, under the weightiest obligation to attempt to give religious culture to the university community. The knowledge of religious truth—the truth about God, about man's relations to Him and man's duties to Him and to His creatures —the grasp of the eternal realities—is a possession, a leverage for uplift, which any true ethics urges him, who has it, to give to his fellows. That religious denomination, therefore, which claims the largest possession of religious truth, virtually avows, in the claim, its obligation, circumstances permitting, to impart that truth to all men; and, in particular, to impart it, as speedily as possible, to any body of men destined to be as influential on other men as the university community. In the present point it is not ours to determine which of the denominations has most of religious truth and largest ability to impart it. We are concerned with the principle that largest possession of truth and of power to put others in possession of it carries the weightiest responsibility to do the service. Fourth: Other religious denominations are under obligation to take a hand in the religious culture of the university community proportioned to the truth of their teachings and their ability, through holiness of life and favoring Providence, to put their teachings across. This will hardly be denied. It cannot be denied consistently by any Christian denomination, for Christ commissioned his disciples to evangelize every creature and to disciple all nations. If the foregoing propositions be accepted as true, we may properly confine ourselves to suggesting and discussing answers to the question: How may religious culture be given to State university communities by Denominational Agencies? It is conceded that this is not the exact form of the subject set us; but it is, at the same time, believed that an effectual plan by which the Denominations can give to the university community religious culture is what is sought after. To the present speaker the following seems a practicable plan: Let a denomination conscious of the possession of priceless religious truth and conscious of ability to do such service, under the good hand of God, to the university community, acquire a convenient plot of ground, erect on it a building containing an auditorium, lecture-rooms, classrooms, reading-rooms, a room for a specially selected library of the standard religious literature of the ages—a building for a church of the institutional type in short; let it endow this Church with such liberality that for it can be commanded a man of singular abilities as pastor, preacher and lecturer and teacher. Let him have such helpers as necessity shall dictate. Let him, in addition to preaching on the Lord's day, and looking after (as a faithful pastor) his whole contingent in the university community, plan and conduct a course of study in religion which shall be as effective in disciplining or informing, or in both disciplining and informing, the mind, as any course of the same number of hours in the university curricula so that, if the university pleases, the successful completion of this course may be rewarded by a credit equalling that received for any elective university course of no greater number of hours. Such a plan, if put into operation by any given denomination, would insure the pastoral oversight of the student and faculty members of the university community of that denomination; would secure preaching of the type of doctrine peculiar to the denomination. Those two functions, if ably performed, would affect the life of the whole community to a degree. And the special course, taught with vigor, ability and learning, would produce a more intense effect on the class. Suppose four denominations had such material plants established and ably manned, the university community would be affected in no small degree. The university would be made a place of larger privilege, its cultural opportunities would be enlarged as by the establishment of a new chair; and the character of the whole body morally invigorated and ennobled. It should not be difficult to secure plants and endowments. There must be men, in each of the great denominations who would at once see the limitless importance of bringing such influence to bear on the university community, and, through the outgoing students, upon the world—men ready to establish just such foundations as we have described. Look them out, gentlemen; invite them to make religious culture by the denomination they love best and respect most a certainty in this city set on a hill, that the pathway of our future leaders may be lighted not only to true greatness in this life but to God and blessed communion with Him in the life beyond. RELIGIOUS CULTURE IN STATE UNIVERSITIES By Rev. Byrdine A. Abbott, Editor The Christian Evangelist, St. Louis, Mo The poet Tennyson in the first part of his immortal elegy on the death of his college friend, Arthur Hallam, breathes a prayer which might fittingly be used as the daily litany of both minister and teacher, for it states the whole case of the true relation of learning and religion. He sings: Let knowledge grow from more to more, But more of reverence in us dwell; That mind and soul according well, May make one music as before. True religion includes real education and genuine education must eventually lead to true religion. On the recent foundation of the university for the natives of South Africa the Government declared, according to the British Weekly, that to educate them without religion would be to raise up a nation of devils. To educate Englishmen, Frenchmen, Americans or any other people without religion would produce the same result. The deepest thinkers of our day have come to see the evils of a purely materialistic education. It makes the world merely a huge machine that grinds up men and women, soul and body. The idea is brilliantly expressed by Paul Elmer More in his latest volume of the Shelburne Essays. He says: "As we contemplate the world converted into a huge machine and managed by engineers, we gradually grow aware of its lack of meaning, of its emptiness of human value; the soul is stifled in this glorification of mechanical efficiency. And then we begin to feel the weakness of such a creed. . . . we discover its inability to impose any restraint upon the passions of men or to supply any government which can appeal to the loyalty of the spirit. And seeing these things we understand the fear that is gnawing at the vitals of society." A demon at the wheel of the ship, or in the cab of the engine, or admitted into life in the formative hours of youth is scarcely more to be feared than a conscienceless man in possession of the secrets of chemistry, electricity, government, commerce, or war, or in charge of the ordinary machinery of society. These things have filled the modern father and mother with almost a poignant anxiety as they have seen their sons and daughters go forth to the great universities with their brilliant and sometimes fierce intellectual lights. This fear has made it easy for the ill-informed and the mischief-maker to create prejudice and make cleavage between the church and the university. To continue this and allow it to grow would result in calamity to civilization. It would be possible to overcome this problem in the independent universities by ordinary processes of influence, but the State universities present greater obstacles, owing to the separation of Church and State in this country. The church college will afford some relief. Through it the student may be so thoroughly trained that he will need no special religious opportunity after getting to the university. It would be possible to make out a strong case for the position that a student ought not to be admitted to the State university unless he had had training in a church school of worthy, educational standards. Plainly, however, this course would be found impracticable because the State universities will always grow greater and stronger and more students, rather than fewer, will attend them directly from the public schools. It is left to the churches, then, to find a way to follow their young people to the State universities and throw about them such influences, put before them such opportunities, and lay upon them such obligations, that in pursuit of the knowledge and training requisite to their aims in life they will not surrender the mastership of the soul nor abandon the conviction of the reality and greatness of God nor of the supreme value of things eternal. But that the student may keep his spiritual vantage ground the church must follow him to the classroom, the campus and the dormitory of the university as far as possible. It is now twenty-eight years since the Disciples of Christ, the body of Christians with whom I am identified, took definite steps to supply this urgent demand. Through the Christian Woman's Board of Missions, an organization which recently became merged into the United Christian Missionary Society, it was determined to institute Bible Chairs at such universities as would receive them, even if only on toleration first. And it may have been that on their first advent they were very narrowly watched. They might contain possibilities of annoyance and a certain kind of trouble even if not of mischief. They might be crusaders of proselyting, they might stir up friction between the adherents of different denominations, they might introduce quite an unhealthy emotionalism or at least encourage an unscientific approach to learning and to life. If there was such cautionary bias it was unnecessary, for the Bible Chair at the university has proved its value in many ways. The Chancellor of the University of Kansas said, referring to one of these institutions: "The Bible Chair is a real factor in the religious life of the university, and I desire that its influence increase." My people are now supporting such chairs at the State universities of Michigan, Texas, Virginia and Kansas. In addition we have The Bible College of Missouri, which is operated in its own building at the University of Missouri, the "Indiana School of Religion" at the University of Indiana, the Eugene Bible College at the seat of the University of Oregon, and at the present time, buildings are in course of erection for the "California School of Religion" in Los Angeles, just across the street from the University of Southern California. The initial amount of money raised for the "California School of Christianity" was $800,000 which will be quickly increased to $1,000,000 and added to thereafter until the school has satisfactory support. In addition to these schools and chairs we support student pastors at Purdue University, the University of Illinois and the University of Washington. It is their duty especially to establish confidence and form pastoral connection with our own young people and also to render such Christian service generally as may be considered proper in the student body at large. These schools, Bible Chairs, and pastors give fine opportunity for religious contact with, and training of the young people and they are doing much to achieve the ends sought by their establishment. Of course they are absolutely non-sectarian and the Bible Chairs and schools do not presume to offer courses of study sufficient in themselves to equip men and women for the pulpit or the mission field. But they bear witness to the part religion must have in a well-rounded and fully girded life. They help to create an atmosphere which permeates the entire school and makes teaching easier and more delightful. They make a moral and spiritual appeal and, because the big men of the universities like to have them there, they gain respect from even those who do not patronize them. "The Bible Chair building itself is a protest against the scientific materialism of the campus, and stands a silent but impressive reminder that there is a God of truth and that all truth, both scientific and religious is His truth." While we do not presume that other and better ways of spiritual culture for the young people in the State Universities are impossible, we are happy in what has been achieved in that respect and we hope to increase the value and number of these agencies in keeping regnant the soul life of the students destined to become the makers of all the to-morrows. II. The Law Alumni THE LAW SCHOOL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA By William Minor Lile, LL.B., LL.D. Dean of the Department of Law Gentlemen of The Law School: In the University catalogue of 1849-50 there appeared the following announcement: "The year 1850 being the twenty-fifth since the organization of the University, the ceremonies, it is expected, will be of more than common interest, and an unusually large concourse of alumni and friends of the institution will probably assemble on this solemn occasion." History does not record how solemn the occasion proved to be. But as it occurred before the adoption of the XVIII Amendment, and during a lull in the city of Richmond's clamor for at least a portion of the University, we are entitled to wonder why the catalogue-man anticipated an event of such solemnity. Nothing appears in the program for this Centennial Year likely to lead your thoughts along funereal lines, unless it be the announcement that you are to be addressed, at this solemn hour of three o'clock, on a sultry summer afternoon, and on a topic that one would not voluntarily select for a holiday diversion. By the time, therefore, that the present exercises are concluded possibly you may agree that in one feature at least we have matched the forecast of the reunion of 1850. The privilege of welcoming so large a body of the sons of the Law School—the largest number ever assembled within our walls—is the most grateful of the many happy experiences of my twenty-eight years of life as a law teacher. Responsive to the official writ, you have come from the seven seas and all the remote parts adjacent thereto—and on behalf of my colleagues and myself I bid you a right royal welcome. If you will present your writs, in person or by mail, I shall be glad to endorse a proper discharge thereon. Some of you hold diplomas antedating my own; others were my contemporaries in the Law School; while still others represent that interesting interval when your speaker was performing, in a neighboring bailiwick, those marvelous professional stunts with which every student since 1893 is familiar. But I note with special interest, and with a kindling heart, that the larger number of those before me are my own sons in the Law, to whom it is indeed an honored privilege to extend a father's greeting. No daughters have as yet graced the family circle, but they are well on the way, and perhaps our next family reunion will be graced by many sisters and daughters—fair Portias, "fresh from brawling courts and dusty purlieus of the law." The lives of the law teacher and the practitioner, are in strong contrast. The essential qualities and aims of the two, in some respects similar, are, on the whole, widely different. The practitioner spends most of his life as a partisan, in the endeavor, not to ascertain what sound principle is applicable to a given state of facts, with the reason upon which it rests, but by astute argument to qualify or distinguish the basic principle to suit some special case in hand. He has studied disconnected propositions of a particular topic as applicable to some narrow state of facts, rather than the field of the topic in its entirety, or with attention to the relation of one branch of it with another. He conceives of the law not so much as a science as a collection of isolated rules; and he has less concern whether his contentions be sound or unsound than whether he can establish them in a given case. The teacher, on the other hand, must work out his subject in its entirety and with judicial poise reach his conclusions regardless of consequences. He must seek the truth and that only. He does not deal with concrete facts, nor with living personalities. John Doe and Richard Roe constitute his clientele, and Blackacre and Whiteacre his horizon. For him the fine points must give away to broad and basic principles—and kindred but disjointed propositions must be brought together and correlated. Day after day he speaks to the same uncritical, and often uncaring, audience, on the same subject—to be repeated year after year, with a new but equally apathetic assembly. The teacher participates in no warm contests on the hustings or at the bar. For him there is no gaudium certaminis. He wins no victories to kindle his enthusiasm, and loses no cases to teach him his errors. His compensation is the same whether he works or plays. And to whatever heights he may attain in his profession, the stipend of his earlier days, pitiful enough even at that stage of his career, tends to remain as static as the countenance of the Sphinx. One annual joy, however, is his—he is able to A Writ of Summons twirl his thumbs in defiance of the income tax collector, and he hoards no surplus wealth to tempt him to invest in forbidden commodities. He leads a sort of monastic existence, apart from the madding crowd. The newspapers do not report his lectures, howsoever learned—or howsoever illumined by recitals of his own prowess at the bar, or by anecdotes, culled from his well-thumbed repertory. The consequence is, that the law teacher finds that his most difficult task is the maintenance of that enthusiasm for his work, without which he is a mere wooden man on the rostrum. A burning zeal is the one essential of the teacher as it is of the advocate. But the keen enthusiasm of the latter needs no conscious effort to quicken or sustain it. The flame of his passion keeps pace with his professional growth, and is the natural outcome of his daily routine. On the other hand, from causes mentioned, it is only by constant and persistent effort of his own, with rare aid from without, that the teacher may hope to emulate the zeal that inspires his brothers of the bar. He may not enthuse to-day and brood to-morrow. Six days out of the seven he must stand upon his retired rostrum, aloof from his fellows, and do his task with a glad heart and a joyous countenance. If this comparison has created the impression on your minds that my colleagues and I are unhappy in our roles, and are disposed to complain of our tasks, you have misunderstood me. On the contrary, not one of us would exchange places with you; for in the quiet of our academic shades we find much to compensate us, and to teach us that even the life of a law professor is well worth the living. Our interest in and close association with the fine body of youth that with each recurrent season gathers within our walls— in my opinion the finest assembly of young American manhood to be found in the college world—blinds us to the truth that our tethers are limited and grow shorter with the passing years, and depicts life to us in somewhat the same roseate hue as our young scholars see it. Nor must you alumni of the Law School forget that howsoever high the places you occupy at the bar or on the bench, in the depths of our own hearts we claim something of the credit. You and the best of you are but our creations! No—we have not grown weary of our tasks, and an army with banners could scarcely drive us from our places! I have thus momentarily drawn aside the curtain, and given you a glance at the inner life of the law teacher. This, for the possible interest that you might find in this glimpse of precincts removed from common observation, but chiefly that you might understand the depth of the welcome already extended to you. You cannot know what a delight—what a genuine inspiration—it is to us to greet you here, at any time, singly or in groups, but especially on this our Centennial Anniversary. You could not know, except from my telling of it, how hard it is for us to keep our enthusiasm alive. Your presence here—this renewed intercourse after the lapse of the years— your gracious greetings—the records that you have made as sons of the Law School, standing out in plainer colors now that we see you face to face— have given to each of us of the teaching staff a new spirit for our duties, and a renewed ambition to deserve our places as teachers in the Law School, and to justify your continued confidence. It has seemed to me that it might not be inappropriate on an occasion such as this, which comes but once in a hundred years, briefly to rehearse to you something of the history of the Law School, with very cursory mention of those faithful men who, standing in our places, gave of their strength for its upbuilding, and directed its policies in the earlier days. It has been well said that institutions are the antitheses of men who erect them. The former, properly nourished, escape the infirmities of age, and grow stronger as their years increase. Such has been the history of the Law School. At the close of its century of life, it finds itself the fruitful mother of many devoted sons—their numbers increasing with the passing of the years, and her powers of reproducing and nourishing her offspring responding to the ever increasing demand. Though the charter of the University was granted in 1819, it was not until 1826 that the Law School was opened to students. At this period there were few law schools in the country, and few or none had attracted many students to their halls, or gained the confidence of the legal profession in their methods and results. "Reading law" in the office of an experienced practitioner was thought a more beneficial course of preparation for the bar than that offered by the law school. The law office, rather than the law school, was, therefore, the center of legal education. Nor was there any American precedent for a law school erected, supported and governed by the State. Mr. Jefferson himself had received his legal training under Chancellor Wythe, next to Marshall the most distinguished jurist that Virginia, or indeed, America, had then, or has since, produced. Our Founder had also, as a member of the Board of Visitors of William and Mary, had a part in establishing the law school of William and Mary with Chancellor Wythe as professor, and therefore appreciated the value of a law school training. It may be assumed that his main purpose in establishing a chair of law in the State University was to afford facilities for legal training, superior to the office method. But it was in keeping with Mr. Jefferson's character and temperament to hope that through the instrumentality of the Law School, in addition to the technical training of candidates for the bar, a sound (i. e., a Jeffersonian) political philosophy might be disseminated among the rising generation of the South. Thus we find him writing to James Madison, in February, 1826: "In the selection of our Law Professor," he writes, "we must be rigorously attentive to his political principles. You will recollect that before the Revolution, Coke-Littleton was the universal elementary book of law students; and a sounder Whig never wrote, nor of profounder learning in the orthodox doctrines of the British Constitution, or in what were called English liberties. You remember also that our lawyers were then all Whigs. But when his black-letter text, and uncouth but cunning learning got out of fashion, and the honeyed Mansfieldism of Blackstone became the students' law book, from that moment that profession (the nursery of our Congress) began to slide into Toryism, and nearly all the young brood of lawyers now are of that line. They suppose themselves, indeed, to be Whigs, because they no longer know what Whiggism or republicanism means. It is in our seminary that that vestal flame is to be kept alive; it is thence that it is to be spread anew over our own and the sister States." How far short of the Founder's hope, as thus expressed, the Law School fell, may be inferred from the circumstance that Robert Toombs, of Georgia, and Henry Winter Davis, of Maryland, were both its products. The first professor of law was John Tayloe Lomax, of Fredericksburg— Francis Walker Gilmer, originally chosen, having been prevented by ill health, followed shortly afterwards by death, from entering upon the duties of the chair. After Gilmer's death, the position, along with the presidency of the University, was offered to William Wirt, but the offer was declined. The course covered but a single year. The textbooks used were (Mr. Jefferson's advice notwithstanding) Blackstone's Commentaries; Cruise's Law of Real Property; Selwyn's Abstract of the Law of Nisi Prius; and Maddock's Chancery. The complaint of insufficient salaries at the University, now so vociferous, appears to be but a prolonged echo from those early days—as Lomax resigned after four years of cultivating the law "on a little oatmeal," to accept a circuit judgeship, which offered a larger compensation. To those familiar with the history of the salaries of circuit judges in Virginia, res ipsa loquitur. Lomax was succeeded in 1830 by John A. G. Davis, grandfather of John Staige Davis now of the Medical Faculty. Professor Davis held the chair until 1840, when he was killed by a riotous student. For the single year following, the chair was filled by the temporary appointment of N. P. Howard. In 1841, Henry St. George Tucker, who had been President of the Virginia Court of Appeals, a position which he had filled with singular distinction, was appointed as Davis's successor—resigning from ill health, four years later. In this brief period, however, he left the indelible impress of his genius, and builded better than he knew, in establishing the Honor System, of which he was the moving spirit—the most splendid inheritance that Virginia's University possesses to-day. Tucker was succeeded by John B. Minor, whose remarkable career, as teacher and author, is familiar not only to hundreds of those still living who had the good fortune to sit at his feet, but to the present generation of lawyers throughout the country. Professor Minor held the chair for fifty years—1845-1895—and gave a prestige to the Law School which made it nationally famous. The tone with which he endowed it, the standards that he set for it, the devoted spirit that he exemplified toward it, have been the inspiration and the goal of his successors. In 1851, the Department of Law, then known as the "School" of Law— in accordance with the then general plan of designating each of the several subjects in the University curriculum as a "school"—was divided into two schools, a second chair was created, and James P. Holcombe became adjunct professor—promoted to full professor in 1854. Holcombe resigned in 1861, on the outbreak of the Civil War, to become a member of the Confederate Congress. After the Civil War, Stephen O. Southall succeeded to Holcombe's chair, and on his death in 1883, James H. Gilmore was named as his successor, resigning in 1897. In 1893, chiefly with the purpose of relieving Professor Minor of the heavy burden which for 50 years he had borne with never-flagging zeal and tenacity, but which had become too onerous for his advanced years, William Minor Lile was added to the teaching staff as a full professor, and the work of the law school was equally divided among these three—Minor, Gilmore and Lile. The work assigned to the new incumbent was taken in equal proportions from that of the two existing chairs. This division left Professor Minor with but two subjects, Real Property and Pleading and Practice at Law (volumes II and IV of his famous Institutes). To ease this burden, still further, his son, now Professor Raleigh Colston Minor, was named as his Assistant. The son took over the Pleading and Practice, leaving to Professor Minor, for the last two years of his life, the single subject of Real Property, with two lecture periods a week. Those who remember the strong will and self-sacrificing spirit of the great teacher, need not be told that this effort to ease his latter days was not without passionate protest from him. Following Professor Minor's death, in 1895, Walter D. Dabney was appointed full professor, with Professor Raleigh C. Minor as Adjunct,— Professor Dabney succeeding to the course in Pleading and Practice, and Adjunct Professor Minor to that in Real Property—and to these two were assigned other courses added to the curriculum in 1895, coincident with the extension of the course from one to two years. On Professor Dabney's untimely death in 1899, Professor Charles A. Graves, of Washington and Lee University, was appointed his successor. The inception of the three years' course, in 1909-10, called for an enlargement of the teaching staff—now composed of Professors Lile, Graves, Minor, Armistead M. Dobie and George B. Eager, both of the latter graduates of the Law School. The appointment of Edwin A. Alderman as first President of the University, in 1904, was followed by a complete reorganization of the several departments, and the erection of minor faculties—each department presided over by a dean. This office in the Law School has been held by Professor Lile since that date. The session of 1826 opened with 26 students. The average attendance down to the outbreak of the Civil War was approximately 60. During the four years of the Civil War, 31 students were enrolled. For the period between the close of the Civil War and 1895, the approximate average per session was 110. Since then, the enrollment has steadily increased year by year. For the present session, the number of matriculates is 310, from 30 states. Originally there were no prescribed entrance requirements, and the minimum age for admission of students to any department of the University was sixteen years. While graduation in Law was provided for, no degree appears to have been offered until 1842, during the régime of Professor Tucker. From 1842-1865, the catalogue designates the title of the degree as Bachelor of "Laws"; but, beginning with 1865, the term Bachelor of "Law" appears;—the plural designation re-appeared in 1905, and is still retained. It was also during Professor Tucker's incumbency that a short-lived statute, admitting graduates of the Law School to practice without the necessity of a license from the judges, was enacted. This statute was repealed in the Code Revisal of 1849. Tradition accredits the repeal to the insistence of Professor Minor, who preferred that his students should pass the same examination for admission to the bar as was required of other candidates. The wisdom of this policy has been vindicated by its quite general acceptance by the profession, and particularly by the standard law schools of the country. Knowledge on the part of the teacher that the results of his instruction are to be submitted to the acid test of the bar examiners, who are in daily touch with the law in its most concrete form, is a manifest incentive to the teacher, and a safeguard against loose pedagogical methods and practices. The important part that the Law School has played in the University itself is indicated in the circumstance that out of 5571 degrees conferred by all the departments since organization, 2051 have been degrees from the Law School—or 37% of the total. The Law School has never been, like the average state law school, a merely local one, for the production of local lawyers—but from earliest days has drawn its patronage from all parts of the United States. It has educated thousands of young men for the legal profession. The very large number of these who have occupied the highest places in the states and nation, has illustrated the fine quality of the spirit that the School inspires, and the soundness of the instruction that it affords. When the information first came to your ears a year ago that we were preparing to open the doors of Jefferson's masculine University to women— and admitting them even within the sacred precincts of the Law School— you doubtless wondered why, and recorded your mental, if not written, protest. But it has been done—not because we of the Law School believed the law a fit profession for the mothers of the coming generations, but for the same reason that the gods gave the frogs a king—they clamored (I dare not say croaked) for it so vociferously. Voters as they now are (the women, not the frogs), their insistence and persistence—their crying aloud night and day without surcease—their strident threats of forcing their way in by the legislative door, and therefore on their own terms—convinced us that discretion was the better part of valor. We surrendered on very honorable terms, magnanimously dictated by ourselves. These terms are that the woman applicant for admission to the law school shall be twenty years of age, and the holder of a baccalaureate degree—or else twenty-two years of age and having completed two years of standard college work. These requirements are thought sufficient to secure proper maturity of mind and manners, and the desired seriousness of purpose—and to exclude the airyfairy Lilians as a disturbing element in our peculiarly and traditionally virile surroundings. Those of you whose college careers antedate modern entrance requirements, may be interested in the announcement that, at present, candidates for admission to the Law School must have completed one year of college work, in addition to graduation from a high school—and that with the session of 1922-1923, an additional year of college work will be required. This may mean that in the course of a few years the entrance standard will be raised to the requirement of a baccalaureate degree. The existing entrance requirements at Virginia are considerably short of the standard exacted by the best professional and pedagogical thought of the country, and we are already lagging behind most of the standard law schools in this respect. A number of these already require a baccalaureate degree or its equivalent. My own experience of twenty-eight years as a law teacher convinces me that in keeping down our entrance standards at Virginia, we have unwittingly done great injustice to the youth of the South, and through them to the legal profession. My observation is that the average youth contemplating the study of law, or of any other profession, will be content to enter upon his professional studies with the minimum of preparation required by the school of his choice. He is not to blame for assuming that the wise heads who admit him to the Law School with merely a high school preparation, are expressing to him the opinion that no further preparation is necesary to fit him for a distinguished career at the bar. The result in our own Law School has been disastrous. Unfledged youths, fresh from the high schools, the parents of many of whom were abundantly able to finance them through a complete academical and professional course, have rushed into the Law School, with their professional ambitions as immature as their high school minds. The result has been a veritable slaughter of the innocents. Under such standards, an entering class of 100 would produce a graduating class of approximately 30 or 40—with the majority of these made up of men with college training. Our medical friends have far outstripped us, in spite of our aristocratic scorn of them as parvenus in the professional field. As lawyers, we trace our ancestry back a thousand years—whereas, as a scientific profession, this new rival was born within the recollection of some of us who are not old men. Forty years ago in Virginia, any quack might call himself doctor, and serve all patients rash enough to employ him—and this without let or hindrance from the State. But, led by the well-educated members of their profession, their standards have already been raised to a point which we lawyers of Virginia can scarcely hope to reach in a generation. The result has been that medicine and surgery have made greater advances in the last forty years than in all the preceding ages. I cannot refrain from taking this opportunity of reminding you that one of the chief reasons why legal standards have lagged, is due to the lawyers themselves—who, as pointed out recently by the Carnegie Foundation, and as known to every observant lawyer who has attended sessions of our legislatures and meetings of bar associations—lose no opportunity of blocking efforts within the profession to raise legal standards. "Look at me," exclaim these blind guides, "and think what the State would have lost had your high standards excluded me from the Law School, and from the bar of which I am such a shining ornament." Perhaps a word about our teaching methods may not be out of place. We still use the old fashioned text-book and lecture system, supplemented by the use of illustrative cases. With most of the other law schools of the country now thoroughly wedded to the so-called Case System, we find ourselves almost in a class to ourselves. We are thought of, and not infrequently referred to by our contemporaries, as old-fogyish, and out of date. But we have held to our own methods—not from ignorance of the virtues of the other system, but from deliberate choice. . The argument in favor of the one or the other system is too long to be presented here at length, even on the assumption that you would be interested in following it. I think it may be summed up in the statement that the main purpose of the Case System, as its disciples confess, is not so much to teach legal principles, as to cultivate the student's reasoning faculties—surely a most desirable end. Under this method the lecture room is converted into a sort of debating society, of which the instructor is the leader and interlocutor. A half-dozen or more cases, previously assigned, constitute the basis of the debate. The whole hour is not infrequently consumed in the discussion of a single point, or of a single case from the assignment. Normally, the assigned cases not reached during the hour are passed over, a new assignment is made, and a new debate held at the next period—the student being left to work up the ignored cases as best he may. It is heresy to limit a lively debate in the interest of economy of time. The point or points actually discussed are thus thoroughly ventilated and impressed upon the student—or upon such of them as participate in the debate, or take accurate notes thereof. An entire lecture period may thus be devoted to the discussion of Benjamin Butler's famous point whether the key to a man's shop is personalty or realty and therefore the subject or not the subject of larceny—or the distinction between a demurrer to the declaration and a demurrer to the evidence. The natural tendency of the system is to develop a race of case lawyers. But the most serious objection is the slowness with which the course goes forward, and the gaps that the method must leave in the continuity and completeness of the topics pursued. If the student had six years to devote to his law school course, instead of three, the case method might prove ideal. Our theory is that a large part of the body of the law rests upon no particular reason, but is conventional, or may we not call it arbitrary? This cannot be deduced by any course of reasoning howsoever subtle or astute. The mere statement of the rule, with a practical illustration, is its best exposition. One need not read an opinion of several pages to learn that a contract must have a valuable consideration, or that the agreement must be mutual; or that an infant is not bound by his general contracts, but ordinarily is liable for his torts; or that an indorser's liability is conditioned on the taking of the proper steps on dishonor of the paper; or that a corporation cannot lawfully exercise a power not conferred by its charter; or that the plea of the statute of limitations, or the statute of parol agreements, is personal to the defendant. These illustrations might be indefinitely multiplied. And considering the law of procedure, whether under the written or the unwritten law, substantially the whole of it consists of conventional rules, which are to be mastered only by memorizing them. These considerations, with the further consideration that the student's time in the law school is limited, and that under our old-fashioned methods the student obtains a complete bird's eye view of the fundamentals of each of his topics—succinctly stated and generally illustrated by the text itself, and by the case-book, and always by the instructor himself—make us content with our own methods. Under our method the subject is presented as a consistent whole, an impossible desideratum under the other system. Where reasons exist, and serve to assist the student's understanding, they are properly stressed,—indeed, these are more apt to be found in the textbook than in the opinions. But equal stress is laid upon the student's acquisition of fundamental principles for their intrinsic value, and upon his remembering them just as he must learn and remember the letters of the alphabet or the rules of Latin syntax. The conclusions reached from our theoretical study of the two methods, seem to us abundantly sustained by the results. The reasoning qualities of our graduates are thoroughly well developed, though possibly not quite so highly as under the other system. Our men go out into the profession not only with excellent reasoning powers, but fully equipped with a knowledge of fundamental legal principles. The further cultivation of their reasoning powers, and their alertness and resourcefulness in debate, may well be postponed to the succeeding thirty or forty years to be spent in the forensic contests at the bar. The high positions taken by our graduates throughout the country satisfies us that our Law School, however old-fashioned or conservative in its methods, is accomplishing the purpose for which it exists— to supply the bar and public stations with accomplished, well-rounded, highminded and efficient lawyers. I hope that this brief summary of our teaching methods and their results may convince you that the University of Virginia has followed along its own lines, in spite of the new cult of the case system, not ignorantly, nor capriciously, but for reasons quite satisfactory to those of us charged with the responsible duty of maintaining its standards and its prestige. THE PLAN AND HISTORY OF THE VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW By Randolph Caskie Coleman, '21, M.A., Editor Mr. Chairman, Alumni of the Law School, and Visitors: It was intended, as appears on the program, that I should make you a speech on the Virginia Law Review, but after the splendid address of Dean Lile, I feel that any attempt at a speech on my part would be feeble indeed. So I am going to tell you very simply and briefly a few things about the law journal published by the students. On March 5, 1913 an informal meeting was held in Minor Hall for the purpose of considering the publication of a legal journal by the students of the Law School. It was unanimously resolved to form an association to issue the journal, and on April 23, 1913 a permanent organization of the Virginia Law Review Association, with an editorial board and a business management, was effected. The first number appeared in October, 1913, and since that time the Review has been published monthly eight times a year from October to May, except during the year of 1918-'19, when owing to the late opening of the Law School on account of the war, publication was necessarily suspended. The current issue, which through the courtesy of Mr. Minor's committee will be presented to each of you at the end of the meeting, marks the close of Volume VII. The plan of the Virginia Law Review is quite similar to that of the Harvard, the Columbia, and the other leading Reviews. But it differs from many of them in one important respect, that is, in being exclusively a student publication. Some of the Reviews are published principally by Law Faculties, others have both Faculty and student editors, and still others, though having only student editors, have Faculty representatives who supervise all the work that is done. It is entirely in accord with the spirit and traditions of Virginia, with its liberal measure of student control in all its activities, that the Law Review should be published by the students alone. To that fact, we believe, is largely attributable the self-reliance, the interest, and the fine esprit de corps which have always characterized the editorial board. Each number of the Review contains leading articles of general interest to the profession, Notes, Recent Decisions, Book Reviews, and a Virginia Section. The articles and Book Reviews are prepared by prominent members of the bench and bar and by law teachers, while the Notes and Recent Decisions are entirely the work of the editors. This year saw the inauguration of the Virginia Section. Due to the insistent demand of many of our readers, we thought it well, although retaining our character as a general rather than a local journal, to establish a section devoted exclusively to comment upon the Virginia decisions and statutory changes. While the material for this department is largely furnished by students, yet in order to make it a real forum for the discussion of Virginia law, we have decided to invite contributions to it from the bar of the State and bespeak for it your interest and support. From the first the Review has set a high standard, and we believe we can say without undue pride that to-day it has attained a foremost rank among the established law journals of the country. Dean Lile and Professor Graves place it just after the Harvard and Columbia Reviews and in the lead of the others, and the superiority of those two, says Professor Graves, is to be found in their leading articles, in obtaining which they possess distinct advantages over us, and not in the student work. This classification reflects the greater credit upon the Virginia Law Review when we consider that at Harvard and Columbia the enrolment far exceeds ours and, furthermore, that a baccalaureate degree is required for entrance to the Law School. The editors of our Review have been constantly encouraged by commendatory expressions and requests, some from quite a distance. The other day we received an order for the Review and the back volumes from the League of Nations Library at Geneva. Recently a letter came from Regina, Saskatchewan, asking permission to reprint in the Canadian Law Times one of our articles, which was described as "admirable and world-wide in its application." Some time ago Professor Isaacs of Pittsburgh and Professor Schaub of Harvard asked leave to reprint in their coming volume on Commercial Law some extracts from the Review, adding the statement that "in the present state of our legal science, the law journals are the repositories of the best thought in commercial law as well as in the other fields of jurisprudence." Dean Wigmore has complimented the Review highly, laying particular stress upon its form and appearance. I trust you will pardon a reference to these things when you realize that they are due not only to the work of the present board, but to that of all our predecessors. While this is the story of what the Review has accomplished, we feel that it should do a great deal more. In fact it has reached a critical stage in its life. The present vastly increased cost of printing has made it a most difficult matter to finance the Review with the limited subscription list we now have. This condition has affected all the Reviews more or less seriously according to their circulation and resources from endowment or otherwise. Recently the Columbia Law Review issued a statement that unless it could secure a thousand additional subscribers it might have to suspend publication. The Virginia Law Review unfortunately has no endowment and is entirely dependent upon income from subscriptions and a few advertisements. Is it worth while to keep it alive and vigorous? That depends upon the service it is performing. To the student here it is a constant incentive, since election to the board is based upon the quality of work done in the Law School. To the editors it is a very valuable—some of them consider it the most valuable—part of their legal training. To the Law School it is a means of expression, without which the School would be somewhat inarticulate, and at the same time the best type of advertisement. Going into the offices of hundreds of lawyers, especially in Virginia and the South, it should give a far clearer and more vivid idea of the character of the work in our Law School than any mere catalogue. Can it be doubted that if the Review went to several offices where it now goes to one it would be instrumental in bringing many more students to this Law School? If a larger attendance is not to be desired, then we would be enabled to take another forward step in the important matter of raising our standards for admission. But of what service is the Review to you, our alumni? It is a direct means of communication, of contact with the Law School. It keeps alive your interest and your memories. As it brings to those here, through the articles you contribute, the results of your discoveries in the field of active practice, so it carries to you the fruits of the researches of Faculty and students in the legal laboratory of Minor Hall. With your active coöperation the Review can not only perform this service, but can steadily increase its usefulness. Without your support, it will wither and die. There is no reason why we cannot make it the leading organ of legal expression in the South, as the Harvard Law Review is in its field, and a potent influence with our courts and legislators. It should be in every way worthy of our great Law School, which for sound instruction in fundamental principles we all believe to be second to none. Our alumni are fully equal to the task. With your contributions in articles embodying the product of your labors, your arguments in noteworthy cases, your views on vital questions, and your suggestions as to changes in our law and procedure, we could publish a Review that would stand comparison in every respect with any law journal in the country. So when you have the material for an interesting paper, prepare it and send it to us, as well as discussions for the Virginia Section or Book Reviews. In this way, through your loyal support in articles and subscriptions, the Virginia Law Review can become a powerful, living force in our legal world, informed with the noble spirit and standards of this institution, a teacher of true doctrine in these times of false and dangerous theories, a champion of what is sound and progressive in law and government. Thus it can be made a source of just pride to the alumni and to the Law School. The achievement of this purpose rests in principal measure with you, and we have every confidence in your decision. III. The Medical Alumni MOVEMENTS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION By William Holland Wilmer, '85, M.D., LL.D., of Washington, D. C. May I take the liberty of speaking briefly of only one phase of this movement in Medical Education—a phase, however, that is uppermost in the minds of every loving alumnus of the dear old Alma Mater? When one of the very distinguished members of the Medical Faculty of this great University courteously asked me to express my views at this meeting concerning the question of removing the Medical Department to a distant city, I wrote him the question had been so thoroughly discussed by Dean Hough in his fine report that I could do very little more than to say "Amen." But I wish to express my personal views even if they possess no other value than that of a retrospect, as it has been thirty-six years since I left these beloved portals. I have seen the following reasons advanced for the advisability of taking this step: (1) The necessity of securing greater clinical material; (2) to avoid separating the Richmond Medical, Dentistry, and Pharmacy Schools; (3) economy; (4) athletics are a disadvantage to medical students; (5) the medical students do not take part in general university life; (6) the general student body does not receive any profit from the older medical students. The first three points are the only ones that require any serious consideration for consenting to this radical and painful operation. The first argument divides itself very naturally into two main lines—quantity and quality. In the argument for removing the Medical Department, the necessity of a quantity of clinical material has been emphasized. This greatly emphasized quantity is not dependent upon city environment. It can be obtained by enlarging the present hospital facilities of the University, where there is already in existence a great teaching hospital of two hundred beds and 3,500 patients annually under the control of the staff of the Medical Department. A hospital is like an individual. When a reputation for work of the highest type has been established, the numbers of patients seeking treatment will be limited only by the capacity to care for them. Among the most notable proofs of this fact are the Mayo Clinic, at Rochester, Minnesota (a town of 6,000 people); Ann Arbor, Michigan; Iowa City, Iowa; Madison, Wisconsin; the three latter being average university towns. The hospital facilities of the great German universities were entirely out of proportion in size to the small cities in which they were located. Dr. Edsall, Dean of the Harvard Medical School, says in speaking of the University of Virginia: "Of course clinical material is essential, but there is no doubt in my mind that the clinical material can be obtained in a perfectly adequate way just as Michigan and Iowa have done it." Ease of communication and transportation brings the suburban and the rural districts constantly into closer contact with hospital centers. With the annihilation of many of the problems of time and distance by the fast trains, the automobiles and the prospective airplanes, those hospital centers will be increasingly independent in the future, in regard to their location. Even now in regard to transportation the University of Virginia is excellently placed. While the demand for quantity could certainly be adequately met, it is well to remember that quality is even more important. For after all, valuable preparation does not lie in the number of cases seen by the student, but in the great care taken in the study of each case and in the acquiring of the proper method of pursuing that study to the very best advantage. One case exhaustively and efficiently studied is worth a dozen or more cases considered hastily or imperfectly—the great temptation where the mass of clinical material is very large. Furthermore, I wish to emphasize the point that it is the method that must be studied and not merely the individual case. That great student of medical teaching, Sir James MacKenzie, says: "It is far better to be trained to understand a few matters thoroughly than to have a superficial knowledge of a great many things." In addition to these points of "quantity" and "quality" there is another question about this suggested change that requires serious consideration—vocational instruction versus the teaching given by the busy practitioner of medicine in a large city. The practitioner is certainly handicapped. He is often harassed by a number of serious and pressing cases that demand his attention. At best, it is difficult for him to find the time for regular didactic lectures or for clinical instruction—often to the detriment of his students. In Outdoor Departments, the teaching is often left to younger men who have not sufficiently broad experience to enable them to give the student the best viewpoint in the most important study of the beginnings of disease. In the fundamental branches there can be no comparison between the advantage of the instruction under the professor who is vocational, and the teaching by the practicing physician. This is well illustrated by the teaching of anatomy at our Alma Mater. I know of no other university in any land where anatomy has been so well and unforgetably taught. This splendid instruction has been a very great and lasting asset to every one of the medical graduates of the University. The achievements of its alumni prove that the teaching there in the past has been efficient in lines other than the so-called "fundamentals." The recent graduates, too, have been most successful in competitive examinations for hospital positions, where clinical and laboratory tests were required. For the last five years, not a single one of the graduates has failed to pass the examination of any State Board. I have known of instances in New York where among all the men who took the examination for filling two hospital vacancies, both of the coveted positions were won by graduates of the University of Virginia. The second argument, that it is necessary to associate with the Medical School the departments of Dentistry and Pharmacy, as now exist in Richmond, is easily met. These two departments can function, as they do in other cities, apart from a Medical School; and, at present there are needs more urgent than the addition of these departments here. In due time this can be brought about. I personally feel that Dentistry is becoming such an important part of the Medical Science that a Dentistry Department should be instituted later at the University of Virginia and I am sure that it could be accomplished without difficulty. The atmosphere of university life would be of inestimable value to the dental student. There is no reason why a practical clinical department of Pharmacy and Therapeutics should not be established also. In this connection it may be interesting to quote what Sir James MacKenzie says in regard to medical education: "Each time a drug is given, the teacher must give the reason for presenting it, and the student must be set to watch the effects it is supposed to produce." This sound and practical advice can only be followed in a faculty-controlled hospital. By this means the student may have the opportunity of seeing remedies prescribed on grounds of reason and not of credulity. These suggestions for two new departments are made, because, in my mind's eye I see a well rounded, evenly balanced, vitalized University in the future, and not one shorn of its glory. Even the division of the four year course is detrimental to the highest medical education. There is much dissatisfaction in the minds of the broadest thinkers upon the subject of medical education. It is a cause of thankfulness that they do not apply to the University of Virginia as now conducted. The objections are that anatomy, for instance, "is often but an intelligent description of facts, so that the student is burdened with an accumulation of many trivial details." Sir James MacKenzie in regard to medical education says that "Physiology is such a broad subject that it is difficult to determine how much is necessary to impart to the medical student." This criticism is true of the other so-called medical sciences. However, in a medical department, with buildings clustered around the campus, the teachers of the fundamentals come into closer contact with their fellow professors of clinical work and laboratory investigation than could possibly be the case in a large city away from the Mother University. In this way they have a closer insight into the practical problems necessary for the student. The third argument for removing the Medical Department is economy. "Efficiency and not retrenchment is true economy," wrote that sagacious statesman, Disraeli. This is a saying for all time. The education that is the most economic is not the one that costs the fewest dollars, but the one that is the best, the most efficient and broadening, for the least relative financial outlay. Dr. Flexner wisely says: "It is easier and cheaper to bring patients to Charlottesville than to reproduce the University laboratories, workers, libraries, and spirit anywhere else." A University like our beloved Alma Mater, with its beautiful and healthy situation, its charming social advantages and its broad cultural opportunities, will always attract the best type of instructors; but separation from the life of a great university and the associations of colleagues, together with the higher cost of living in the city, would have the reverse effect. The disadvantage of athletics to medical students forms the fourth argument. Quite to the contrary, athletics, which have become such an integral part of college life—and justly so—are benefited by the participation of medical men. The instances where medical students have led in all types of athletic sports are too numerous to mention. It is equally true that medical students are vastly helped by athletics. Quick and accurate response of brain and muscle to each stimulus is thereby inculcated. The medical student above all others should have a "sound mind in a sound body." Whatever may be the case at other universities, the fifth and sixth arguments that the medical students do not take part in general university life, and that the general student body does not receive any benefit from the older medical students, are not at all applicable to the charming life at our dear old University. As far as my own personal experience goes, my dear friend and roommate of my first year at the University was a student in the academic department and he is now a very distinguished Episcopal minister. In my second year, my roommate was a brilliant student of law and the judge of the "moot court" the following year. The third year my room on East Lawn was in the midst of men who have since become leaders in their respective walks of life—distinguished scientists, senators, judges. As class commander of 1885, some of the most delightful letters received have been from classmates who had not been in the Medical Department. To illustrate the close cultural relations between the students in the different departments, I have only to recall to my collegemates of long ago some of the episodes of our college life. I can remember as if yesterday the eloquent lecture of Professor Smith upon "Gravity"—not to be erased by the theories of Relativity. Notable too was the fascinating lecture upon "Opium" by Dr. Davis. There were many such occasions when the lectures were so interesting, so charming, so impressive that they drew students from all departments. The very association with the great men who were teachers in those days was a liberal education in itself. This has been equally true in years since then. Who in the eighties could forget the gentle tap upon the door and in response to "come in," the entrance of Dr. John Staige Davis. After an apology for interruption he sat down for a chat for fifteen or twenty minutes. The medical student was left charmed and energized and returned to even his fundamentals with renewed zest. Or, who could forget the kindness and helpfulness of that commanding figure, Dr. Cabell? Dr. Towles taught anatomy in such a way that he made it as delightful as it is indelible. These men had the true vision—not to pitch the greatest number of students, but to set a high standard and to elevate the men to that standard, and thus to secure the greatest number of well-trained men for service. William James, in his interesting brochure, "On Vital Reserves," emphasizes the fact that all men "energize" far below their normal maximum. Athletes are familiar with this fact of "second wind." The successful and most useful men push farther and farther away the barrier of fatigue. This is an evident fact that the busiest men are those who still take time for outside activities. The student in contact with the multifarious activities of university life will "energize" at a higher level than those segregated into a class—which too often occurs when one department is located in a large city away from the parent university. It has been well said that "The most important factor is university contact, ideals and activities." On the whole, the body thus isolated will be inferior to a similar body "run at a higher pressure." Can the State of Virginia afford to take away from the medical students within its gates, those great stimuli that "awaken the energies of loyalty, courage, endurance or devotion?" The tendency of medical science is towards prevention and not cure. The advance in surgery is marvelous beyond expression, but it is a confession in each case of the failure of prevention. It should be resorted to only when there is no possibility of relief in other ways. If this applies to the individual, how much more does it apply to the growing, vigorous University of Virginia, where dismemberment by amputation of one of its most essential parts seems as abhorrent as it is unwise? Even at the risk of repetition, the words of men like Dr. Edsall and Dr. Flexner should be emphasized at this critical juncture in the affairs of the University. The former feels so strongly the importance of intimate contact with the general university that he says: "I should be very glad indeed if the mere three or four miles that separate the Harvard Medical School from Harvard University could be wiped out." After calling attention to the fact that "the independent medical school has practically disappeared in the last ten years," and that "the universities have simply had to take charge of medical education because they alone have the correct point of view of spirit," Dr. Flexner, one of the greatest authorities on medical education, goes so far as to say: "It is my conviction —a conviction born of observation over a very wide area—that Virginia will hardly be able to develop a school of the highest grade except as an immediate part of the State University in Charlottesville." Thus it will be seen that the specialists in Medical Education are against this transfer. Four college presidents, eight deans of medical schools and fifty professors have registered their opposition. The Medical Faculty of the University of Virginia is against it; and I do not personally know a single one of the medical alumni who has not protested against this step. Moreover, there is no precedent for the transfer of a medical school that has been functioning efficiently for a hundred years. Those who are pressing favorably this transfer must bear the burden of proof. If, in the face of the opposition of the Medical Faculty, the alumni body, and the experts in medical education from all sections of the country, they carry through this unfortunate policy the burden of responsibility for the unnecessary handicap fastened upon the future graduates of the Medical School, will be theirs. From a broad philosophic point of view no doubt can arise concerning the great wisdom of keeping intact the present structure of our beloved Mother University. Sir James MacKenzie says that "We are all creatures whose mode of thought is influenced by tradition and environment. Teaching and particularly medical teaching, is more affected by tradition than almost any other subject." When the tradition is as noble as it is here, and the environment as inspiring, it would be indeed unfortunate to lose them. There is an old text that "Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding." The man who has the deepest understanding, the broadest point of view and the widest vision is the man who will give the greatest service to humanity. President Alderman has said: "Scholarship and knowledge fulfill themselves only in service to men." While close association with men of diverse trains of thought is a most potent factor in producing the wise psychiatral point of view so essential to the highest success in every form of life's activity, environment is an equal force in man's development. Who could spend a portion of the plastic period of youth in this ideal spot, with its beauty of hills and valleys, its inspiring architecture, its splendid ideals and ennobling traditions without being better fitted for service to his state, his country and to his fellowman? This Centennial Celebration of our Alma Mater has been a memorable and happy occasion. Her sons have returned to her in goodly numbers. Her sister universities and scientific and educational bodies have striven to do her honor. Speakers of rare eloquence have expressed in glowing phrases their conviction that her vigorous and inspiring past is but an earnest of her splendid future. The far-seeing Rector with pointed epigram and eloquent appeal has shown us the way of duty and of lofty ideals. He has extolled her vital essence, and shown that it was her spirit, breathed into those valiant youths while in these sacred precincts, that enabled them to fight for the cause of freedom, and to make the supreme sacrifice for the right. Shall we who have not been called upon to lay down our lives, be less true than they to the inspiration of this beloved Mother? They have glorified her in their sacrifices; shall not we add to her strength and beauty until another generation can take from our hands the privilege of loving upbuilding? But even while all honor is being paid to her and her praises sung by all, a shadow falls across the hearts of many of her devoted sons at the thought of the dismemberment that is purposed for this nurturing mother. In the mind of Thomas Jefferson there was a true university with all of the schools that we have now—and more in addition. He did not seek to found an academy or a college, but a university of glorious proportion. Shall this beautiful dream be turned into an unrestful nightmare? What excuse can we offer the "Master-Builder" if we do not strive to avert this work of disintegration of the fabric that he wrought so lovingly? The medical student is as true a son to Alma Mater as any other son. Is he therefore to be denied his rightful inheritance? If so, then other sons will ultimately be deprived of their portions, once this vicious process has begun. Do not take from the medical student his precious heritage inspired by the brilliant genius of Thomas Jefferson—this beautiful creation called the University of Virginia. Leave him where he can exclaim with his brethren of the other schools, as they look from the beauty of architecture to the mountains of blue: "I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help." IV. The Engineering Alumni OPENING DISCUSSION OF THE TOPIC, "ORGANIZATION OF AN ENGINEERING ALUMNI COUNCIL" By Allen Jeter Saville, '08, M.E., Director of Public Works, Richmond, Va. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: Some years ago while on a visit to the University several of us were talking of our experiences, and discussing what we thought of the training at the University in the light of these experiences. That conversation resulted in my being asked to present this paper to-day. As you know, engineers are now split up into so many different specialties that it is not possible for a young man at college to get familiar with all of these specialties. The best thing to be done at college, I believe, is just what is being done here. That is, teach the foundation principles, and leave it to the man to later supply the technic of his chosen specialty. There are several reasons why this is the best course but perhaps the one that will first occur to a man who has not been at college for ten years is, that it is very difficult to dig into the fundamental principles, after a few years out of college. There are some drawbacks, however, to this method of teaching only the fundamentals at college. I think that the greatest of these is, on account of the theoretical nature of his training a graduate does not appreciate the practical limits of application of theory. I remember hearing of the two Engineering seniors who had to get the contours of a mountain ravine, and set their pegs ten feet apart each way. Of course their work was accurate but there was no need of this accuracy. Another result of the specialization that is now in vogue is, that college men become narrow and develop in a one-sided fashion. This is decidedly to the disadvantage of the students, as very few of them know exactly what line of work they will get into before they have been out of college many years. How to retain at the University our present system of teaching the fundamentals, and at the same time remedy the drawbacks to this method is the proposition that we are here to consider this afternoon. When I speak of the University teaching fundamentals, I do not mean that practical consideration is altogether neglected, but I mean that theory rather than practice is emphasized. The suggestion offered for your consideration as a remedy is as follows: That at least once each term an alumnus read a paper before the whole Engineering School, on some practical work, in some branch of Engineering. This scheme, I believe, has many interesting possibilities. In the first place, it provides for the student some definite, tangible evidence of the practical application of the work he is doing. In the second place, these papers will necessarily be on various kinds of work so that the student gets a view of the practical limits used, and also gets some insight into the practical work of many lines of Engineering. Incidentally, it will undoubtedly help the younger student to decide what branch of Engineering he would most likely take up, by giving him a clear picture of the work being done in the various lines. The benefit to be derived will not be confined to the student. Such a scheme will keep the alumni interested in the University, and I believe will be also very interesting to the faculty in that it would keep them informed as to the methods used in practice that would perhaps not otherwise be brought to their attention. I do not believe it will be difficult to get the alumni to take hold of this, as the papers are not supposed to be essays on highly technical subjects, but rather simple descriptions of work done and methods used. I think that these papers should preferably be written about work the alumnus was engaged in himself. They might describe design or construction. The main point should be that they are to be practical, and as far as possible in detail. Now, as to the practical operation of such a scheme, I would suggest that there be a committee of ten, consisting of two professors, two students, and six alumni, with the dean of the department as chairman; the two professors to be appointed by the dean, the two students to be elected by the student body, and the six alumni to be the last six speakers. This may seem a rather unwieldy committee but I believe that these many are needed in order to keep in touch with the various interests. Of course, money will be needed to pay expenses. My suggestion would be that the students contribute one dollar a year each, and each alumnus be asked to contribute an amount sufficient to meet all expenses, perhaps not over two dollars and a half each. I think that in order to relieve any embarrassment, the University should pay the expenses of every alumnus who returns to the University. I believe that if this scheme is put into operation it will prove to be both interesting and profitable. There is no reason why engineers not alumni should not be asked to address the student body, but I believe it would be best always to have three a year from the alumni. Of course we all know that engineers are not very keen for making speeches but this proposition is simply reading a paper describing some work with which he is thoroughly familiar. If this scheme is good enough, it should be adopted, and if adopted carried out enthusiastically. There are many other benefits to be derived by this contact between the alumni and students, and I hope the scheme will be given a trial. THE CIVIL ENGINEER'S POINT OF VIEW By Walter Jones Laird, '09, C.E., of Wilmington, Del. I have been asked to make a few remarks, from the standpoint of a Civil Engineer, regarding the feasibility of forming an Engineering Alumni Council. To my mind such a Council is a very necessary adjunct to the fullest development of the Engineering courses and for general helpfulness in many other apparent ways. I am sure we all feel the necessity for keeping the Engineering courses abreast of the times, just as the Engineering profession in general must continue to progress. We cannot be in the position of the old mountaineer and his bride from one of the neighboring mountains, who came to Charlottesville during my college days and proceeded to take a trolley ride from the lowe end of town to the University. As the car became crowded the conductor came in and asked the passengers, in a rather harsh manner, to move along. The mountaineer got up indignantly and said to the conductor: "I've done paid my ten cents and Mame is going to sit where she damn are." We cannot sit where we are even though some of us Alumni are inclined to think that the Engineering courses and methods of our college days are sufficiently good for any of the younger men entering college. We too must "move along" and realize that just as the last few decades have seen the ferryboat of one-man power, on certain of our rivers, replaced by beautiful spans of steel and masonry, and have seen the mule and winch of other days replaced by the Corliss engine or the Turbo Generator, representing engineering skill of to-day, so technical education must advance and we must help where possible to provide the men who are going out into the Engineering world from our colleges with the best that can be given them in a well balanced, practical, and theoretical Engineering course. This is being accomplished in great measure by our Faculty at Virginia, but their efforts could undoubtedly be facilitated by proper coöperation from the Engineering Alumni. There is certainly no reason why an Engineering Council is not practical, if we do not attempt to carry its functions too far. The members could either be appointed by the Dean of the Engineering Department or elected from time to time by the Alumni by means of the letter ballot, or the Council brought into being in some other approved way. In order to command more diversity of talent and advice, and also not place a too permanent burden on any one group of Engineering Alumni, it would seem wise to have the term of Council members limited to about three years for each individual and to have terms rotate so there would be a majority of older incumbents in office all the time. This Council would place on certain Alumni the definite duty of keeping in touch with the curriculum of their Alma Mater and of suggesting from time to time changes or additions that appear important when viewed from the standpoint of an engineer who has observed everyday practice and usage in his particular locality. It would be of value in helping establish a series of Alumni lectures on practical engineering subjects and it would help maintain a proper balance between the practical and theoretical sides of the Engineering courses. For example: Many engineers have advocated greater shop facilities and very much more extensive shop and field training than is now given in many colleges, including the University of Virginia. It is undoubtedly advantageous for an engineer, upon leaving college, to have a sufficiently practical knowledge of some phase of engineering work to enable him to make a decent living from the outset. If, for instance, a man has obtained in college or during summer vacations a thorough knowledge of transit work, he may at once after leaving the University be self-supporting; whereas, he might otherwise lose some time in getting on his feet, and in some instances might be discouraged to the point of going into some other line of work. Personally, I think a very limited course in the fundamentals of shop and field work is sufficient in most cases and allows of additional time being given to important correlated studies which are of great value to the average engineer in everyday practice, and are very much harder to obtain out of college than is additional practical experience. Some years ago, courses in Economics, Contract Law, etc., were considered unnecessary to the average engineer, but now we find many of our engineers requiring a knowledge of these subjects as much as of some of the straight Engineering studies, hence the need of including such subjects in a complete Engineering course. This leads an Engineering Faculty to the problem of arranging, where possible, for auxiliary courses in practical shop and field work between college sessions, rather than to take an undue number of hours out of the important college sessions to devote to the purely practical sides of the student's work. Such coöperative courses are in successful operation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Cincinnati, etc. An Engineering Council could undoubtedly offer some valuable suggestions in a case of this kind. A further important feature of the Engineering Council from another side would be to keep all of our Engineering Alumni alive to and keenly interested in the activities of their Department in college. Too many of us are inclined to forget what our own college is doing and when an opportunity comes from time to time to advise some student what college to enter, and to explain the advantages of our college training, we are not in a good position to do so; nor are we apt to be as interested in helping to place Alumni who leave the University. The mere fact of having an Engineering Alumni Council working among us would tend to stimulate continued interest in the University and its Engineering Department. Therefore, I hope such a Council can be brought into existence in the near future. THE MECHANICAL ENGINEER'S POINT OF VIEW By William Carrington Lancaster, '03, M.E., E.E., of New York City It is a far cry from the young engineer graduate proudly wearing the emblems of many college societies, and glorying in a long list of honors won in the classroom and in athletics, to this same graduate, a few months later, in overalls and a flannel shirt. No matter how brilliant has been his career through college, no matter how high have been his marks on examinations, no matter how profound his knowledge of mechanics, of hydraulics, or of thermodynamics, the mechanical engineer graduate must don the garb of the laborer, and learn by the sweat of his brow, the practical details that are essential to the successful practice of his profession. More appealing is the early work of the civil engineer. His life is largely in the open. "The Call of the Wild" attracts him. His is a picturesque figure as he peers through a transit, standing in sunny fields of green and waving to his rod-man away off across some babbling brook. He appeals to the popular imagination. The hero of the novel, if he is an engineer, is always a civil engineer. Not so happy is the lot of the young mechanical engineer. There is nothing picturesque about the grease and grime of the machine shop, or the rattle and bang of the boiler factory. But he must spend several years, at least, in some such shop or factory, before he has learned enough of the practical side of engineering to be eligible for a position of responsibility. This is true even when he had graduated from one of the large colleges with magnificently equipped shops and laboratories, where he has spent many hours and has become familiar with every machine. How valuable then is the college degree to the mechanical engineer? The great national engineering societies all have as a requirement for full membership, an engineering degree plus a certain number of years of experience in responsible charge of engineering work; or, a certain larger number of years of experience without the college degree. For example, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers requires an engineering degree and three years, or five years without the degree. In other words the degree is considered equivalent to two years of experience in responsible charge of engineering work. The engineering college then does not turn out a finished product. When he leaves college, the engineer graduate is nowhere near ready to practice his profession. To a limited extent, the same thing may be said of the other professions. The graduate in medicine generally takes a postgraduate course at some hospital; the young lawyer often serves as little more than a clerk in some large law firm; and the preacher begins with a small country church. But the medical graduate is very soon a full fledged doctor. His hospital course may last only a few months, or he may elect to take none at all. Just as soon as he passes the State Board examinations, which he does promptly before he forgets what he has learned at college, he starts the practice of medicine and is in responsible charge of the lives of his patients. The graduate in law likewise passes the Bar Examinations just as soon as possible and can then practice law. He is in responsible charge of the rights of his clients. The preacher starts to preach as soon as he enters his little country church and immediately is in responsible charge of the souls of his flock. It is not so with the engineer. He has no State examinations to pass. The law does not create him an engineer by giving him a license to practice. No license is required of him. He stands solely on his merits. Perhaps it is partly for this reason that he must go through long years of arduous work with small pay before he is recognized as a real engineer. An important question then presents itself. Is there something fundamentally wrong with our method of teaching engineering, and should the engineering college attempt to turn out the graduate so thoroughly instructed in both theory and practice that he can more quickly take his place in the world as an engineer ready and capable of taking responsible charge of engineering work? Apparently the answer is both "yes" and "no." In the first place of course the graduate is too young to be immediately put in responsible charge of important work. He must first learn such things as organization and directing the work of others. His judgment is apt to be faulty. These things come only with experience and the passing years. But we are not concerned with these. His shortcomings merely because of his youth cannot be helped by the college, and they apply equally in other professions. What we have to consider are questions as to whether the courses of instruction can be changed for his benefit, and if so how we Alumni can help to do it. Doubtless many young men are deterred from taking up engineering, and especially mechanical engineering, by the thought of the long years of disagreeable and poorly paid work that must follow their graduation. Possibly many brilliant minds are thus lost so far as mechanical engineering is concerned. Other professions get them. For this reason it would seem desirable to so change the course of instruction, if possible, that the young engineer may arrive at the desired goal with less time given up to drudgery of his profession. The chief criticisms of the young mechanical engineer, fresh from college, seem to be: 1. Ignorance of the value in dollars and cents of engineering materials, and how to estimate the cost of engineering work. 2. A tendency to be too theoretical, and not to give due weight to the commercial side of the problem. He forgets that the added cost of making a machine of a few per cent. higher efficiency may be more than the capitalized annual saving in power consumption due to this higher efficiency. Manufacturers' standards mean little to him, and yet they are all-important to the experienced designer. 3. An inadequate knowledge of fundamental theory, especially as regards pure and applied mathematics and mechanics. 4. Insufficient knowledge of engineering practice. This applies to practical things to be done with the hands, such for example, as what to do when a bearing runs hot; and also to the practical calculation of engineering problems, such, for instance, as how to figure the characteristics of a centrifugal pump for a new set of working conditions. 5. A lack of knowledge of the English language. The engineers who are quite unable to write a good engineering report are all too many. And sadder still is the fact that many young engineers cannot even write a grammatical letter. On the other hand, can the engineering college be expected to give sufficient training in shop work and practical engineering methods? Obviously it cannot. Not even the great northern and western colleges, with endowment funds of vastly more than "three million dollars," can afford the large and expensive machinery, nor could they keep up with the rapid changes and improvements even if they once had this machinery. And too something more must be learned than mere familiarity with this and that type of machine. One must rub elbows with the mechanic and eat from the same dinner pail to reap the full benefits of the democracy of the flannel shirt. It would seem then that some middle ground must be found. Certainly there is room for improvement in the teaching of theory and its practical application to engineering problems. As regards shop work, would it not be better to let it be clearly understood that the college makes no attempt to educate the engineer along these practical lines? Let us tell the prospective young student of mechanical engineering, frankly, that he will receive only the theoretical side of his training at college and that he must, after graduation, devote several years to learning practical things in some large machine shop, power house, or factory. Then reduce the amount of time that the student must spend in the college shops to a minimum. Use the machinery only to illustrate the application of the theory. Give the student every minute of time possible to work on fundamental theory; for a man can do only so much in a day, whether that work be done by his hands or with his brain. There is no use in his learning to be an expert lathe hand in the college shops, for he may have to go all through it again on a bigger and better lathe. If he learns this work at college he neglects his theory, which he will find it vastly harder to learn in the years that follow his graduation. Four years are little enough to learn even the fundamental theory, especially when each college year is only some eight months long. But these are all grave questions. They are perplexing. Engineers doubtless differ regarding them. They require deep study. Changes in existing methods of instruction should be approached carefully, and with a full knowledge of modern engineering practice and what will be required of the young engineer. How then can the college professor be expected to answer these questions and plan the courses of study without the continual coöperation and assistance of the practicing engineer? An Engineering Council, to act in an advisory capacity and composed of some ten members chosen from the engineering alumni, has been proposed. Surely such a council would be of inestimable assistance to the engineering faculty, and aid them to shape the courses of instruction so as to best meet the difficulties that have been pointed out. As loyal alumni we have given of our means to the endowment fund, every cent that we could afford, but every one of us would like to have given more, had he been able. Here then is an opportunity to give of our time and our brains. The Council will be of little value unless its members give it their best thought and are willing to sacrifice ample time to it. Those who are not on the Council, too, can be of assistance by answering intelligently and promptly the questions that the Council will doubtless put to them. Our beloved Alma Mater asks us, through her engineering faculty, to help her. Let us welcome the opportunity. Let us have the Engineering Council. THE ELECTRICAL ENGINEER'S POINT OF VIEW By Matthew Orpheus Troy, '96, B.S., of Pittsfield, Mass. I have been requested by the Dean to discuss the above topic from the point of view of the Electrical Engineer. After an experience of twenty-four years with one of the largest electrical manufacturing organizations in the world, I am convinced that the electrical graduate in the practice of his profession can be of great assistance to his Alma Mater and to the undergraduate body, and that such assistance should be rendered. Before taking up more in detail the questions of how this may best be accomplished through an Engineering Alumni Council, it may first be well to outline the kinds of work which the modern engineering graduate may be called upon to perform, and in that way see just what it is he should expect from his college course in preparation for his life work. Without attempting to draw a definite parallel between the electrical profession and any other, it has been my observation that the electrical graduate has a very limited choice of paths from his Alma Mater to the first step of his business career, even though the path he may choose ultimately branches in every direction, and affords a tremendous range of application— a range which is constantly expanding. A very high percentage of each year's electrical graduates head at once towards the larger electrical manufacturing organizations, or as is more probable towards one of the two American organizations that substantially cover the entire field of electrical apparatus manufactured in the United States. Other paths lead to the large telephone or telegraph interests; to the operating companies; to the syndicates combining or controlling these companies; or to the large management, engineering, or operating associations, of which there are quite a number. Initially, therefore, he does not have a wide choice as to how he will direct his steps upon graduation. After having become a part of a large organization, however, the path which he pursues, either through choice or force of circumstances, is one of a vast number to which, each year, are added many others, and I can probably be most helpful in tracing a few of these paths in a large manufacturing company like the one with which I am associated. Assume that the graduate has applied for entrance to the testing department of an electrical manufacturer and been accepted. Here the student engineer, so-called, is given an experience of from six to eighteen months in the testing and inspecting of machines, apparatus, and appliances of every description. If the demand for men is great his career in the testing department may be cut to six months. If, however, he is to obtain a reasonably broad experience his stay may be extended to the full eighteen months. A year, however, is a fair average. Twenty years ago, if a man were shifted at reasonable intervals, he could in a year obtain through his testing experience quite a comprehensive idea of the product of the manufacturer—the details of construction, as well as methods of testing and operation. To-day, whether he stay in the testing department one or two years, he can only obtain an experience touching upon a few of the more important lines of manufacture, and it is not improbable that even then, before he completes his work some of the lines which he tested earlier in his course will have been superseded by a new product, embracing new developments and new ideas. A new catalogue recently issued by the General Electric Co., which only covers certain of its more standardized product, contains over twenty thousand catalogue numbers, and this omits much of the Company's product. Over this great diversity of product the graduate's testing experience is well directed towards that which will be most useful to him in his future work. From his testing course the graduate will probably go to a designing-engineering, a commercial-engineering, or a research department—in most instances direct to the designing-engineering department, where again his path may branch in one of many directions. There are a great number of designing-engineering departments, and he may from choice or necessity go into any of them. The field is too broad and life is too short to cover many of them—the probabilities are that his experience will be limited to one, at the outside two. At this point the engineer may become a highly specialized designer, carrying on developmental or specific research work; may remain with the department in some more or less subordinate position; or may go to the head of it in an administrative capacity, which calls for ability to direct men, design, developmental, and research work in the lines for which he is responsible. Instead of remaining with a designing-engineering department he may transfer to what is called a commercial-engineering department, of which there are a large number. These are departments which are intermediate between the designing and general office selling organizations. They help the commercial organization in the selection of equipment, or combination of apparatus best suited to the proposition in hand, or they assist the designing engineering department in changing its design to suit either general or specific commercial requirements of specific propositions. In some instances the commercial engineering work of a given department is combined directly with the sales proposition work, and there is no clean-cut line of demarcation between the proposition work and the commercial engineering relating thereto. Important commercial sections are usually under the direction of highly trained technical graduates, or at least under men who through broad experience have developed into broad gauge commercial engineers. Not infrequently these large commercial departments, in addition to a commercial engineering department have, as a part of their staff, consulting engineers, to whom both the proposition men and the commercial engineering men refer. If the technical graduate leaves the designing engineering department, he may take up general commercial work along any of the lines described. He may be fond of travel—a broader contact with the outside, or for various reasons wish to enter the outside organization, or it may be to the company's interest to send him there. Many take this path, and become a part of one of the various district office organizations. He may go direct from the designing engineering, commercial engineering, or general commercial departments to the district offices, and there be assigned to the engineering, sales, or administrative department of the District. The electrical salesman of to-day is in a different category from the electrical salesman of twenty years ago, and in a very different category from what we generally mean by the term "salesman." He is either a man of very specialized training—what we term a "specialist"; or he is a very broadly trained commercial engineer, capable of analyzing and studying the conditions on a large transmission system, and should be in a position to advise the engineer of an operating company as to the best selection, combination, or application of apparatus, appliances, etc. He should be more properly called either an "engineering specialist" or a "sales engineer." His foundation is his technical training and engineering experience, but his success is measured by many other qualities, such as initiative, forcefulness, personality, his knowledge of people, his ability to assume responsibilities, his knowledge of psychology, his ability to make wise engineering decisions, and to convince others of their soundness. It is a field of endeavor to which many graduates aspire, in which they succeed, and find much real enjoyment in their work. After this experience they may later become department heads in the District Offices to direct the efforts of other sales engineers, or may be put in charge of important offices where they have large numbers of men under them, direct their efforts, and become responsible for the success of that office in a given territory or district. In the foregoing I have traced a few of the paths more ordinarily pursued. There are others too numerous to mention. Some of them lead to the great research departments of manufacturing organizations where specialization is carried to the extreme, and work is taken up and carried beyond the point where all other investigators have stopped. They pry into unexplored fields, and delve into unfathomed depths. It may be the electrical engineer, the chemist, or the physicist who carried on the work. The graduate may enter one of the large manufacturing or production departments, find that he is particularly fitted for this work, and ultimately become a manufacturing superintendent or a production manager handling large organizations and an output that runs into many millions of dollars. He may choose other paths that lead into the general administrative offices of the company, assist the president or vice-presidents of the organization, with possibilities in this direction limited only by his own resources. This aeroplane view of a large manufacturing organization has been expanded for a particular purpose. I wish to leave the inference that the work which will open out before the graduate is so tremendous in its magnitude and scope that no one mind can grasp it all, nor can any college curriculum cover the field. The curriculum can but lay the foundation on which the superstructure is built, and the superstructure in the career of each individual is most apt to differ from that of every other. There may at times be striking points of similarity, but the structures differ as individuals differ, and it is very apparent in most instances that the individual's ideals and abilities form a very important part in creating the superstructure; furthermore, the superstructure is never finished. It begins when the individual enters the organization, and continues to the end. There is no stopping point except as enforced by the limitations of the individual. This is true even where the individual picks out a particular line of specialization and adheres to it. The work grows, develops under him, he expands with it, and adapts himself to the changing conditions of the country and the art. One point I wish to emphasize particularly is that in a large manufacturing organization these paths are not charted in advance, except in a most general way, and the individual graduate from the time of his entrance into the organization becomes a keen competitor of all his fellow graduates. Even though all might be progressive, some will progress more rapidly than others, and the extent to which one rises or forges ahead depends largely upon his resourcefulness, initiative, and all those qualities which go to make for leadership. This is a very happy condition because it makes work interesting, one sees achievement and possibilities ahead of him, and strives constantly to add to-day to the achievements of yesterday. In the future of the industry with which the electrical graduate associates himself, no part of the work is more important than the research work, even though the research effort departs widely from what is commonly known as electrical engineering. Many of the greatest advances and noteworthy achievements are the work of the great research departments associated with the large manufacturing institutions. The work of these large research departments is in a measure distinct from the more specific research work carried on daily in engineering and developmental sections or departments of the company. We find a very striking analogy between all this and what is being accomplished in medicine. One has but to compare the work of the general practitioner, specialists in medicine and surgery, and the great research departments of organizations that have given us our serums and anti-toxins to obtain a picture of what is going on in the large electrical organizations. The latter has its general engineers, its special engineers assigned to specific problems, its research work carried on in connection with these specific problems, and in addition its large research organization which goes into general problems of every description, and from year to year accomplishes almost the impossible, often discovering new truths which contradict the facts of the past as we supposed them to be. Dr. W. R. Whitney, Director of the Research Laboratory of the General Electric Co., has written many able articles bearing on this topic, and these articles are available for reference. A footnote is appended giving some of them.1 1 "Incidents of Applied Research," Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, vol. viii., No. 6, page 559, June, 1916; "American Engineering Research," presented at 342d meeting of American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Phila., Dec. 13, 1918; "Research as a National Duty," Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, vol. viii., No. 6, page 533, June, 1916; "The Newlands Bill and National Research," Metallurgical and Chemical Engineering, vol. xiv., No. 11, June 1, 1916; "What is Needed to Develop Good Research Workers," Electrical World, June 17, 1920. I cannot refrain, however, from quoting a few extracts from his address—"Incidents of Applied Research." The diversity of research work in a large manufacturing organization is summed up as follows: "The varied interests of the General Electric Company made complex intercoöperation possible between widely diversified needs and equally diversified lines of knowledge, and I find on a rough survey that we have worked in some way on such a long list of subjects that even the list itself is tiresome. It extends from paints, oil and varnishes, to irons, steels and alloys; from the production of copper and zinc to molybdenum and magnesium; from thermions in pliotrons to X-rays in beetles; from carbon and tungsten incandescents to luminous arcs and searchlights; from the mica in the commutator of a railway motor and the brush that wears it away, to the electric solder on the bars and the insulation on the wires; from the composition of the turbine blade to the corrosive action of the boiler feed water; from atomic hydrogen in lamps to molecular layers in catalyzers; from silicon in transformer iron to silica in fuse-fillers; in elements from lithium and boron to uranium and thorium; in substitutes for rubber and for platinum, in the insulating body of the aero magneto, and the contact of the automobile vibrator; from "Sheradizing to Calorizing"; and from condenser and boiler tubes to special pyrometer tubes; and always through prosaic past experience, to the exciting new outcome. "Through all I see the same interesting fact. It is the desired unforeseen which frequently eventuates, and our constant need is for faith that this will happen again. The regularity with which we conclude that further advances in a particular field are impossible seems equaled only by the regularity with which events prove that we are of too limited vision. And it seems always to be those who have the fullest opportunity to know who are the most limited in view. What, then, is the trouble? I think that one answer should be: we do not realize sufficiently that the unknown is absolutely infinite and that NEW knowledge is always being produced. The thing which has been impossible will be accomplished by new knowledge which cannot now be accurately preinventoried." Looking back on my own experience among the vicissitudes and worries of the undergraduate, the two things which were uppermost in my mind were—first, the question expressed in the old song—Where Do We Go From Here, Boys? My future was a great unknown. I hoped to arrive somewhere, but I had not the slightest conception where the path would take me. The second great worry was somewhat associated with the first. Not knowing what I was to do I had no way of judging which of the great mass of detail in my curriculum was most important in the work I was later to pursue, and I know now that I laboriously tried to master many details subsequently proven to be unimportant and I passed over others of basic importance. While there are many ways in which an engineering council, made up of graduates in service, can assist Alma Mater and the undergraduate, I can, speaking for the electrical graduate only, say that if it does no more than assist the undergraduate in the two ways mentioned, i.e., in guiding his steps after graduation toward the path he is best suited to follow, and in giving him an idea of what is vital in his undergraduate course, it will accomplish much for the undergraduate engineer, stimulate interest in electrical engineering, and thereby assist its Alma Mater. Under the conditions of to-day, an engineering council could offer very definite suggestions to the prospective student, the freshman or the senior, as to the path to choose after graduation, or at least a very definite choice of paths, and thus having something definite before him, the student will take up his engineering studies with an added interest. As bearing on this point I quote from an address by Dr. Whitney at an Alumni Dinner given by Union College, February 17, 1921: "I believe that our high school graduates are already in mental position to appreciate more interesting and modern matters than they often get in college. Most of them, when they enter college, want to learn to be useful. Those who may enter merely to play or kill time, should be discouraged, but few colleges ever do this. One which does will probably become a good school. Most freshmen have reached the period when they want to do something, rather than hear ANYBODY! "The advantages of doing, and the new fields in which something useful may be done, are enormously attractive and numerous to-day, and boys know it. Perhaps at one time, long ago, the accumulation of learning was so small that a student could easily cover many subjects, but nowadays he can seldom acquire a complete understanding of any modern subject from college teaching—he can only start. If he learns to appreciate one half the new literature of a subject, he does well. I refer particularly now to the natural sciences, where, during the past century, the growth has been very rapid. "Let me give a few illustrations. In physics, as taught in most colleges, the student gets but little more than the elementary course common thirty years ago. But physics is a growing, modern science, and has much of help for doctor, lawyer, or professional men in any field. His knowledge of energy, wave motion, electrical phenomena, etc., the schoolboy is probably not learning in his physics class, but through play with his wireless set. His interest in mechanics is probably coming to him by the way of his automobile engine. "The modern elements of chemistry and physics, as modified by the revolutionary discoveries of radium, the decomposition, limitation, and structure of elements, he is apt to learn first from some interest in his luminous Ingersoll watch, or through a newspaper story about Madame Curie. He can scarcely get far enough in chemistry at the present rate to feel the exhilaration of making a little synthetic dye stuff or an explosive, or to appreciate the value of a microscope for studying the wonders of new steels or of living cells. Biology is just another `ology' to him. If he wishes to become a doctor or a surgeon, he must wait years, while listening to matters he feels he knew at high school, before he can experiment on any of the wonders of the blood, or take part in, or even see, an experiment in psychology or in plant or animal heredity. Just at the period when he would be most affected by contact with real things, he is often forced to acquire habits of passivity. "It is natural that a suppressed American lad should break out somewhere, and this in part explains the stress on American college sports compared to that in all other countries. The past has shown us that the early years of our lives are apt to be the most productive. Pasteur and Lister, Faraday and Henry, Darwin and Huxley, and countless other known leaders, were well along in successful, enjoyable and productive life courses, when they became of age. Can we do nothing to make more valuable the important years spent at our local college? At a time when it ought to be possible to continue the natural interest of youth in things, we are failing. It is a standard student joke to say, `Don't let your studies interfere with your education,' and therein lies the explanation of the fact that America is not yet famed for its scientific productivity." Referring to the second of my worries as a student, I fear that the first part of my paper offers no solution, as it emphasizes, even more than does the diversity of a college curriculum, the wide field to which the graduate may in future life be expected to apply himself, and emphasizes the impossibility of complete preparation. This is true. The curriculum can at most merely lay the foundation, and all of the superstructure has to be erected in subsequent effort, application, work, and study, but it is of greatest importance that the foundation be the best which can be devised for the superstructure which the graduate is to build for himself. The graduate who has been away from college for many years is not an authority on textbooks, curriculums, etc., but he should be in a position to help the University's staff, if only indirectly, by bringing to its attention from time to time some of the everyday problems which face him in his outside career. I will not attempt to discuss this phase of the subject in great detail, but in looking over the present day curriculums they are spread out too thin in many places, and the foundation is not deep and thorough enough in others. I am constantly in contact with electrical graduates, and without having University of Virginia graduates in mind, I am impressed by the fact that very few of them really learn their mathematics, physics, and chemistry. When they have struggled through their mathematics, and passed their examinations by a narrow margin, possibly having learned enough to appreciate its importance, they have a feeling that they will pursue the subject further, and will then perfect themselves. The majority never do; and there is a tendency in after life to sidestep difficult problems involving mathematics, or to look for assistance to those who have been more thorough. They trail rather than lead in this respect, though they may in other directions make up their shortcomings. A student who has thoroughly learned his mathematics has a foundation which need not be disturbed, irrespective of what is new in electrical discoveries—at most only the application has to be changed. When a student has obtained his basic training in mathematics, the application of this training to problems of various descriptions—such as the solution of electrical equations and the actual design of electrical apparatus—serves to fix in his mind his mathematical fundamentals so that they cannot be effaced. A basic training in chemistry and physics is of equal importance, but in order that these fundamentals, like the mathematics, may become firmly fixed, or for that matter thoroughly understood, the laboratory work is of the utmost importance. By this I refer to the experimental work in the chemical, physical, and electrical laboratories. Very few electrical graduates have occasion to apply any of the training they may have received in civil engineering, except in the fundamentals, particularly the details that cover the use of instruments, transit, etc. He may in his work with a large operator find that some civil engineering has to be done, but he is not called upon to undertake such work. A graduate civil engineer is available for the purpose. The same is true, though to a somewhat less extent, of large hydraulic projects. While a general knowledge of these subjects is necessary, it would appear in the case of the electrical engineer that they could be touched on lightly, and more time given to fundamental electrical problems. Knowledge of thermo-dynamics and steam engineering is frequently of use to the electrical graduate, but it is doubtful if much time should be devoted to obsolete steam engines, intricate valve motions, and mechanical features that have outlived their day of usefulness. A more intimate and thorough study of a representative steam turbine makes for a better foundation. In industrial chemistry, instead of trying to cover a field of almost unlimited breadth, let the technical graduate concentrate and learn more thoroughly the industrial chemistry of what will be most useful to him; the manufacture and preparation of insulations—their qualities and characteristics; insulating compounds—their behavior under the action of heat, oil, and electrical stresses; study of oils for insulation purposes and heat dissipation; study of porcelains, glass, and other similar materials for their mechanical and electrical properties, as they relate to the development of electrical apparatus, and the development of transmission and distribution systems. All education is broadening and develops the mind, and on this score we can defend the study of a great variety of subjects, as a part of the training of the electrical engineer. There is so much, however, that he should obtain in his four-year course—in fact so much more than he can obtain of basic fundamental facts, that are directly applicable to electrical engineering, that it would seem to me the present day curriculums could be improved with this thought in view. While many of the topics above touched upon might be classified as encyclopædical training, they cover interesting details, apparatus, subjects and applications which might profitably form parallel reading to the University course, but should not be allowed to crowd out fundamental training or fundamental training plus the essentials of a direct professional training. In closing I would emphasize that this is a day of specialists, whether it be in finance, business, manufacture, medicine or engineering. The man who stands out above others in some particular field of endeavor obtains a satisfaction from his work, a standing and remuneration from his profession which the general all around good man infrequently receives. Let the engineering undergraduate pursue fewer subjects, but pursue them thoroughly, and if possible specialize in some particular field of endeavor, either research, or the design of a special class of apparatus. The man who thoroughly masters the transformer diagram, the mathematics relating to all the formulas involved in the design, who knows the design thoroughly, who can analyze wave form and study the stresses applied in service to every piece of insulation under the diversity of conditions to which the transformer will be subjected, can readily take up the induction motor and study it in the same way, although he did not have time to do so at college. It would be better for him in future life to have mastered the transformer thoroughly than to have obtained a superficial knowledge of both the transformer and the motor, even though later he specialize in motor design. The technical student who will learn thoroughly how to design a 200,000 volt transmission line, understand the phenomena which go on in such a system—the high voltage stresses, corona losses, behavior under impulses of every description, steep wave fronts, high frequency line disturbances; who will learn how to analyze the stresses over its insulators—the reactance, capacity and induction of the lines—its regulation and compensation, has placed himself in a position to obtain recognition which cannot be obtained by the student who has a superficial knowledge of wiring and distribution in general. THE CHEMICAL ENGINEER'S POINT OF VIEW By John Marshall, '13, Chem. E., of Swarthmore, Pa. Mr. Thornton has asked me to discuss from the standpoint of the Chemical Engineer the organization of an Alumni Council which would presumably be advisory to the Faculty of the Engineering Department of the University in the outlining of courses of instruction. Such a subject as this at first resolves itself into a discussion of the necessity for the organization of this Council. Certainly it would have no excuse for existence unless deficiencies existed in the present courses of instruction which are within the power of the Alumni to assist in remedying. I wish, therefore, to confine myself to a discussion of the advisability of establishing this Council. With my present ignorance of the courses which are offered now in the Chemical Engineering work at Virginia, it is impossible to give a discussion of the subject as applied to Virginia alone. So far as I know, the work here is practically the same as that offered by the other Engineering schools of the country, and I believe that the Chemical Engineering graduates of Virginia are on an equal footing as regards knowledge and ability to apply it with the graduates of other Engineering schools. There are, however, a number of points which I have noticed in the Chemical Engineers I have seen in the industry, and things which other chemists and Chemical Engineers have told me which I believe indicate a lack in the fundamental training given men of this profession. In the first place I have never met a man who was able to give me a good definition of the term "Chemical Engineer." I imagine the first man to call himself by this title was engaged in the design of chemical plants and chemical apparatus, and that the usual course in the subject has been based upon this same idea. The requirements for the Chemical Engineer have expanded mightily since that time, however, and to-day I suppose that only a small percentage of the men calling themselves Chemical Engineers are engaged in apparatus design alone. My own idea at present of what should constitute a Chemical Engineer is a man qualified to design a plant for a chemical process, operate the plant, and develop the process economically, but I would not venture to offer this as a definition. It is certain, however, that a satisfactory college course for the Chemical Engineer cannot be designed unless we have arrived at a sufficiently broad definition of Chemical Engineering; and here is the first point at which the Alumni could give assistance, because from their direct contact with the industry, they should have learned first hand what is required of the Chemical Engineer. The next point I have had in mind is linked up in a way with the foregoing, and has to do mainly with the method in which the colleges bring home to the student the real nature of the profession he is studying. Chemical Engineering is a relatively new profession, and the courses of instruction in it are in the main the result of selection from already existing courses offered in the same college. As a result, therefore, we have Chemical Engineering taught as a more or less of a hodge-podge of Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Chemistry, instead of as a single well-rounded course in Chemical Engineering designed to meet the needs of a Chemical Engineer. Under this system, the men taking the work are not given a fair chance to learn what is the nature of their profession and what will be expected of them in after life. I realize that this condition of affairs has been inevitable. We cannot justify the teaching of Chemical Engineering by Chemical Engineers until the profession has assumed sufficient importance, and until enough men are applying for Chemical Engineering training to justify it. But I do believe that constant contact of the Engineering faculty with the chemical industry and familiarity of the faculty with the needs of the industry as brought out by that contact would go far towards overcoming the difficulty. The Alumni Council would present an obvious means by which this contact could be brought about. So far I have dealt with generalities, and perhaps the two points so far raised are sufficient, but there is one particular phase in the training of Chemical Engineers that I feel should be mentioned as being particularly lacking. To my mind the thing the Chemical Engineer needs most, and the thing that he apparently gets least, is ability to analyze a problem or a process in order to develop the proper method of attack. Perhaps this is just another way of saying that he lacks research experience. It is reasonable that he should lack this experience, for his time is sufficiently filled up while in college with all the other things he must study. But, nevertheless, it is all-important that he get this ability from his college work, for most of his success in after years will depend on how rapidly he can reach a conclusion on questions of change in process or apparatus, and the rapidity with which he reaches the conclusion will depend directly on the accuracy with which he has sized up his problem in the first place. Inseparable from this is the ability to analyze costs. Cost is the final deciding factor of any chemical operation, and yet, in spite of its evident importance, I believe I have never seen a Chemical Engineer, or for that matter a graduate chemist of any description, who when he left college had any knowledge of how to develop a problem from the cost standpoint. Cost analysis is not easy under any circumstances, and on a plant producing many interdependent products, it may be extremely difficult, but the successful Chemical Engineer will have to learn it some time. If he can learn it in college, his advancement will be hastened by years. I do not believe that ability to analyze costs can be gained by a study of accounting methods, but I do believe that it could be developed in a well-designed industrial research course in which would be gained research ability as well. I believe the Alumni could be of assistance here, in helping lay out such research courses and in selecting problems. To summarize briefly, it appears to me that the terms Chemical Engineer and Chemical Engineering have been too vaguely defined in the past to permit the most logical arrangement of college work; that the various subjects taught Chemical Engineering students in the past have been imperfectly correlated; and training in research and cost analysis have been slighted. I believe the Alumni would be more than glad to give any assistance possible in overcoming these defects, and it appears to me that the proposed Alumni Council would be an excellent agency through which this could be accomplished. V. The Collegiate Alumni THE ACADEMIC SCHOOLS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA By William Harrison Faulkner, Ph.D. In the time at my disposal, it is naturally impossible to give anything like a history of a century of development in the academic schools of the University. Nor can I consider the response in their growth to external conditions. I must limit myself to discussing what seem to me the internal causes affecting this development. These internal causes can be studied most systematically in the varying requirements for graduation and degrees. From this standpoint our discussion may be divided into five periods, viz.: 1. The Period of Jeffersonian Ideals, 1825-1831. 2. The Period of the Master of Arts of the University of Virginia, 18311890. 3. The Period of Transition, 1890-1900. a. To the Undergraduate College. b. To the Graduate School. 4. The Period of Full Undergraduate Growth and Development, 19001921. 5. The Period of Future Graduate Growth, 1920- The original Enactments of the Visitors, written by Jefferson and printed in 1825 (before the faculty had been installed), are, as it were, the Jeffersonian constitution of the University, under which its great founder expected it to function and develop. The distinctive and even revolutionary characteristics of this constitution are, first, the independence, the autonomy, of the individual school; second, the advanced nature and the extensive character of the instruction to be given; and third, the freedom of the individual student to select any course or courses for which he might be prepared. Under this constitution the University was a federation of sovereign and allied institutions rather than a single organism. In matters of discipline only and in the conferring of diplomas did the federal law take precedence of the rights reserved to the states. With the one exception of the School of Law, the head of a school was the sole and final arbiter as to courses offered, textbooks and methods used. Absolute Lehrfreiheit was the guiding principle. In the list of subjects to be taught in the individual schools, one is immediately struck both by the advanced and specialized nature of the courses to be offered and by the broad conception of the field of learning allotted to each school. In the schools of Ancient and Modern Languages were to be taught not only the language and literature, but also the history and geography, the political and social institutions, the economic conditions, ancient and modern, of the nations whose languages were studied,—as a matter of fact, philology in its widest sense. The school of Natural Philosophy was to give instruction in the whole realm of modern physics, and in mechanics, geology, mineralogy, botany, and astronomy, that of Mathematics in all branches of Pure and Applied Mathematics, including surveying, engineering, and navigation. The school of Moral Philosophy comprised not only Logic, Ethics, Psychology and Metaphysics, but also courses in Criticism, Belles Lettres, and Political Economy. The School of Chemistry was most restricted in its field, being limited to Chemistry and Materia Medica, the latter, however, being especially for students of medicine. As is well known, Jefferson's original complete plan included a system of state-supported commonschools, a group of ten state colleges, and the University as the apex of his pyramid. When it became evident that circumstances, political, social, and economic, made impracticable the carrying-out of the whole scheme, the University alone was retained. The pyramid was to begin with the apex, the educational arch with the keystone. Whether such topsy-turvy architecture possessed a validity in the world of ideas, failing it in the realm of space, time alone could show. In fact, for over two generations the history of academic schools is that of a constant effort to build downward, to adapt themselves to a very slowly growing foundation and thus save the structure from the usual fate of castles in the air. For Jefferson, uninfluenced by his failure to establish state colleges as feeders, adhered to the university conception of the institution, as distinguished from the collegiate; rather a university of instruction, however, than of research. And here I feel I must attempt to clear up what seems to me an almost universal misunderstanding. The freedom in choice of courses given the individual student was not the so-called elective curriculum, later appearing as a revolutionary innovation in undergraduate colleges. It was a necessary concomitant of the University as distinguished from the colleges,—the Lehrfreiheit of the student as a complement to the Lehrfreiheit of the professor. Jefferson cannot be called the inventor, or, as some would put it, the instigator, of unrestricted election in undergraduate education. Nor was his university, as has sometimes been asserted, a university The Lawn and Cabell Hall from Top of Rotunda without a degree. The Enactments of 1825 provide for two diplomas: that of Doctor and of Graduate. Though not so limited in the Enactments, the Doctor's diploma was from the beginning restricted to graduates in all the courses applying to the practice of medicine, and so does not concern us here. The degree of Graduate in its original application has been frequently misunderstood. It was not given to any student who merely attained the first division (the term "passed" is of much later origin) in a senior course in any school, or in all the courses in the school. This merely qualified the student as an applicant for candidacy for the degree. The degree was conferred on the basis of a special examination for graduation. The scope of these examinations is described in the faculty minutes, and in addition the actual examination given is outlined in presenting the report on each individual candidate to the faculty. The examination oral and written covered every phase of the subject and is essentially the rigorosa of the German Ph.D., rigorously interpreted. Moreover the original Enactments provided: "But no diploma shall be given to anyone, who has not passed such an examination in the Latin Language as shall have proved him able to read the highest classics in that language with ease, thorough understanding, and just quantity. And if he be also prepared in Greek, let that also be stated in the Diploma." The reasons given for this are interesting as indicating Jefferson's conception of "a well-educated man," and also what his opinion of any elective system which omitted Latin and Greek would have been. The regulation continues: "The intention being that the reputation of the University shall not be committed but to those who, to an eminence in some one or more of the sciences taught in it, add a proficiency in those languages which constitute the basis of a good education and are indispensable to fill up the character of a `well-educated man.' " This practically amounted to requiring of a graduate in any school or the recipient of any diploma the completion of Senior Latin and, by implication, also of Senior Greek. We shall see that it was so interpreted in the case of each graduate with diploma (including M.D.'s) until the establishment of the M.A. degree. We shall also see that the graduates of this first period did not apply for candidacy for the degree until they had attained the first division in the senior course of the school for two sessions, and that each of them had regularly won previous to the conferring of the degree similar distinction at intermediate and final examinations in course in four other schools, including Latin and, in all cases but one (Grad. in Chem.), also Greek. By subsequent enactment (April, 1828), the faculty added an English Examination, to be required of all candidates. This consisted of a composition of not less than twenty-five lines, on some subject from the course in which the candidate applied for graduation, and of an examination in syntax and orthography. It was held before the entire faculty. The degree of Graduate in a School could not be obtained in less than three years, and actually was not. Such a degree was what we think of as a Ph.D., minus a dissertation or thesis. The latter was required only of the doctors of medicine, and included also the public defense of the thesis, if the candidate was called on. Let us see now the working out of these three characteristics of a university in application to contemporary conditions. Mr. Gilmer had been eminently successful in his hunt for "characters of the first order." No new institution of the time could have shown a more competent faculty. And this faculty proceeded rigorously to put into effect the constitution drawn up for its guidance and control. The autonomy of the individual school and the academic freedom of instruction caused no trouble. Quite otherwise the academic freedom of the student. It became almost immediately evident that only a few students of exceptional ability and unusual advantages in preparatory education were willing or able to profit by university instruction and academic freedom, if success in examination is a criterion of such profit. The number of students attaining distinction in examinations in course was very small year by year, and after three sessions only six made application for the degree of Graduate in a School. An examination of the record of these first graduates of the University will show how strictly the stated requirements for graduation were observed and also the advanced nature of the examinations for graduation. May 31, 1828 was set as the last day on which application for degrees might be made. The nine applicants (three for M.D.) were examined in English the same day. All were accepted, though one was recalled and reëxamined, as there seemed some doubt as to his qualification. The examinations for graduation began on the fourth Monday in June and the results were reported to the faculty and the degrees conferred on the 14th and 17th of July. Four examinations of two hours each were held in Greek: two in writing, on Euripides, Herodotus, Thucydides, and Xenophon, and on Greek prosody, especially the trochaic, iambic, and anapæstic of tragedy; two on Greek history, geography, and philology; and an oral on Xenophon. The two examinations on Mathematics were held on separate days and consisted of questions selected from one hundred examples from Peacock's Collection of Examples in Differential and Integral Calculus, and of questions chosen by the faculty from La Place's Traité de Mécanique Céleste and from Coddington's Optics. The two examinations in Chemistry of two hours each covered the following topics: the Rationale of all Chemical Operations; the Elements of Practical Chemistry, more particularly with respect to the use of Tests and Apparatus; Nomenclature; Laws of Composition; Applications of Chemistry; History of the Science. In addition the candidates in Chemistry were required to furnish a week before examination a written statement of all speculative subjects in Chemistry, and to explain, if called upon, the existing theories respecting them, and to write by dictation upon subjects connected with Chemical Technology. Each candidate had attained eminence for two sessions in the senior course of the school in which he graduated. In addition each had passed on four other senior courses. These in every case included Senior Latin, and in every case but one Senior Greek. This then was the academic degree system in theory and practice until the M.A. was instituted. I have gone into it in some detail, because the three principles involved: the autonomy and independence of the individual school; the high standard for graduation with almost exclusive emphasis on the senior courses; and the freedom in choice of studies allowed to the student, dominated the development of the academic courses for nearly three quarters of a century and influences it strongly even to-day. It had become evident that the degree of Graduate in a School either could or would be sought by only about one student in twenty. In 1828, the year in which these first diplomas were conferred, began in the faculty the discussion of a more general and coördinated degree. Three years later the Master of Arts of the University of Virginia was superimposed on the degree of Graduate. From the scanty records available of the discussion preceding the recommendation of the degree, the faculty seems to have intended by it to obviate the disadvantages of study without fixed plan—in other words, to supply a curriculum. The degree of Graduate in a School, as originally conferred, was beyond the powers of nine out of ten of the students. This new degree required graduation in all six schools, a total of eight senior courses, as Latin and Greek were both required in Ancient Languages, and one Romanic and one Germanic tongue in Modern Languages. As three schools a year had already become the standard maximum of work undertaken by each student, the degree could not be taken in less than three sessions, and then only if the student entered prepared to take senior courses in all subjects but one. At first there was no abatement in the difficult standard of graduation in the individual school, except that Latin was no longer rquired as a qualification for the diploma. The distinction between examinations for graduation and examinations for distinction was still made. In addition, the candidate had also to stand before graduation a general examination in all courses required for the degree, and show by examination a satisfactory knowledge of English, and also to prepare a graduation essay or thesis. These last three requirements, however, were gradually relaxed in severity and finally abolished. There still remained, however, the most striking characteristic of the degree,—the almost exclusive emphasis placed on the senior courses. This seems to have had two effects,—disregard of the educational importance of lower courses, and a gradual common-sense reduction in the amount of work required in the higher ones as the number of academic schools increased. Prior to the period of the development of the sciences as educational subjects, only two additions were made to Jefferson's original six academic schools. From the beginning the University had been subject to criticism because it offered no specific instruction in English and General History. Jefferson probably considered that History would be sufficiently provided for in the schools of Ancient and Modern Languages, and that the courses in Latin and Greek would afford adequate training in English composition while the course in Anglo-Saxon would teach the history and development of the language. From the beginning, however, the faculty imposed an additional English requirement. Finally in 1856-57, the establishment of the School of History and Literature was announced, with that most versatile of scholars, George Frederick Holmes, as Professor. At first, the instruction was for the most part in English Composition, with lectures on Literature, but gradually, the interest of the head of the school shifted to General History and Sociology, with consequent change in the courses offered. Its courses were not listed among those required for the M.A. until after 1856, so that the requirements of the degree remained unchanged until then. The second new school made no increase in the courses given. By 1857 the number of students in Latin and Greek was so great as to be beyond the strength of a single professor, even with two or three assistant-instructors. In 1858, therefore, Basil L. Gildersleeve was elected Professor of Greek, and the School of Greek created as an independent school. The precedent thus established, that the creation of a new professorship meant the establishment of a new independent school, was closely adhered to until 1905. The logical development of Jefferson's broadly conceived academic schools would have been the creation of professors of individual subjects in a school, without further subdivision. This departure seems to the writer to have been unfortunate. It weakened the individual school. It led to lack of coördination in the programmes, both undergraduate and graduate, subsequently established. And the principle of the independence and equal importance of the academic schools, now applied to what should have been minor subdivisions, produced an impossible multiplication of subjects required for the "old M.A," and even for the first real undergraduate degree established, so that freedom of election amounted to little more than a choice (frequently unwise) of the chronological order in which the required courses could be taken. In connection with the School of Greek comes the first indication that the degree of Graduate in a School was no longer the highest conception of specialized academic study. In 1859-60, the School of Greek announces the formation of "a post-graduate department, in which graduates and more advanced students have opportunity to extend their acquaintance with Greek literature under the personal direction of the Professor. The course embraces such of the higher Greek classics, as are unsuited, either by form or by subject, for the general instruction: e.g.: Æschylus (sic), Aristophanes, Aristotle, Hesiod, Pindar, Theocritus." Seven graduates in Greek of the previous session entered it, among these Launcelot M. Blackford, later the most distinguished preparatory-school principal of the South, and H. H. Harris, afterward Professor of Greek in Richmond College. When the close of the Civil War allowed the wounded veteran to return to the University, Professor Gildersleeve resumed the post-graduate course. It continued to enroll from half a dozen to a dozen graduates annually, and was, so far as I have been able to discover, the first graduate course, in the modern sense, offered in an American university. In 1867 a similar "postgraduate department" in the School of Latin was announced by Professor William E. Peters. In spite of its long history and the fanatic reverence shown it, even by those students who could never hope to obtain it, "the old M.A." did not fulfill the purpose with which the faculty established it, nor was it suited to educational needs. It was too general for graduate work and yet the courses required were too advanced for the great mass of academic students. By depreciating the esteem in which the degree of Graduate in a School was originally held, it lowered the high standard of graduation in the individual school, without producing, in compensation, courses suited to the great majority of the students. Finally, it was so difficult that scarcely one student out of twenty could ever hope to obtain it or actually did. In consequence the other nineteen lacked, while students, the sense of organic connection with the University which a candidate for a degree has; were without the added incentive to successful work which this gives; saw no especial academic inducement for more than a session or two of study; and, leaving without a degree, had not, as alumni, that feeling of continuing membership in the living organism of the University which a degree gives. The faculty was not unaware of these defects. In 1848 it established a B.A. degree, but one that shows how difficult it was to break with the tradition of the overweening importance of the senior courses, especially in Latin and Greek, and the independence and equal sovereignty of the academic schools. It required graduation in all but two schools and a proficiency in the junior courses of the remaining two, and was therefore almost as difficult as the M.A. Despite this it seems to have been regarded as a contemptible consolation prize. At any rate, few students ever applied for it. After the Civil War, during the period in which schools of Biology and Agriculture, Analytical and Industrial Chemistry, and Geology were established, repeated efforts were made to break from the "old M.A.'s" dominating influence without abolishing it. New baccalaureate degrees,— at one time three in addition to the B.A.,—were instituted. None "took," so to speak. All suffered the fate of the first B.A. The addition of new schools, with new M.A. courses, as they had now come to be called, only increased the impracticability of the Master of Arts degree. Despite this, the development of the University continued, a development that must be attributed to the ability, scholarship, and personality of the individual professors rather than to any coördinated educational plan. Nor were these qualities confined to the lecture-room. Two of the faculty became, through their books, great popular educators. The names of McGuffey and Holmes carried the reputation of the University into almost every primary school in the country. In addition to this, Professor Holmes quickly became one of the most prolific and versatile of publicists, his versatility being only equaled by the soundness and depth of his scholarship. Dr. Mallet began the publication of those articles which were to make his name familiar to every chemist, while Professor Schele de Vere's publications in linguistics and etymology gave the University international standing in these rapidly developing sciences, and Courtenay's Calculus was long a standard work in this branch of mathematics. To the weight of scholarship and learning in these and other members of the faculty was added the energizing force of the strong and distinctive personality of each individual. Nor would I imply that the great mass of academic students, who went away without degree, were on this account uneducated. Their training had resembled that which one acquires in the contacts of real life in the world rather than the coördinated discipline of a curriculum. They had been educated by personalities rather than subjects. And the man who had "had" "old Pete" or Colonel Venable or Basil Gildersleeve, or Dr. Mallet or Professor Smith may have failed on Latin, Mathematics, Greek or Physics, but he had learned something that none of these subjects alone could have taught him. Moreover, the students of this middle period, particularly in the ante bellum decade, had an intellectual stimulus, which their present successors seem to me to have lost They belonged to a governing class,— an aristocracy, if you will. Almost without exception, each one could look forward, in one way or another, to direct power in political life. Their reading, as shown in the library records, their work in the literary societies, even their daily conversation, so far as we have record of it, reflects this. In this respect they resembled rather the students of Oxford and Cambridge, those universities of English diplomacy and statesmanship, than the student-body of the modern American college. Their history in after life shows that education and leadership are not matters of a degree. The twenty years, approximately 1870-90, closing the life of the old M.A., are characterized by certain salient features. First, the growth in natural science and the development of laboratory work; second, the shifting of emphasis from Latin and Greek to Modern Languages, English, and History. With each professorship a new school was established,— independent and of equal importance with its sister sovereignties. The M.A. was thus threatening to topple over from its own weight. Finally, after a long and acrimonious conflict with alumni, the faculty recommended in 1890 its abolition. In its place were instituted a new B.A., requiring passing on nine intermediate courses, classified into groups of related subjects, and a new M.A., conferred on B.A.'s who passed on four additional senior courses. For the first time in the history of the University the distinction was made between undergraduate and graduate courses, and the foundation laid for a college. At first, as was to be expected, the new baccalaureate degree was strongly influenced by the conception of the importance and comprehensive character of the work of the individual school. The small number of courses required for it, as compared with baccalaureate degrees in other colleges, was based on the assumption that concentration on three subjects in a single session was better educationally than to cover the same ground in each subject in two sessions, at the rate of from five to six courses a year. Experience proved, however, that this was a mistake, and in 1911 all the old intermediate courses (now designated B courses) except those in laboratory sciences, were divided into B1 and B2 courses of a year each. The baccalaureate degree thus became the normal 60 session-hour degree of the standard American college, and the differentiation between the College and the Graduate school was fully established. During this period of transition,—indeed at its very beginning,—an addition of transcendent importance was made to the number of academic schools: the foundation in 1892 of the Linden Kent Memorial School of English Literature, with Professor Charles W. Kent as its first professor. The school of English, established in 1882, had not been a success, and the undergraduate students were without systematic training in English composition and Rhetoric and Modern English Literature. To a group of alumni, who knew Dr. Kent and most of whom were students under him, it is not necessary to emphasize the astounding development in these allimportant subjects, that is due to his scholarship, educational statesmanship, unremitting industry, high standard of work, and enthusiastic and inspiring personality. With the differentiation of undergraduate from graduate courses begins also the period of close connection between the University and the public-school system of the state, dreamed by Jefferson but so long denied fruition. Its first sympton was the institution and growth of so-called A1 courses in foreign languages, English, and Mathematics, to fill in the gap which was found to exist between the end of the high-school course and the B.A. courses in the University. From this time on the coördination between the state's secondary and higher education gradually becomes perfected. In one particular, however, the 60-hour baccalaureate degree from 1911 still showed the influence of the independence and equal importance of the individual academic school of the old M.A. Each school, new or old, desired and frequently claimed, directly or indirectly, equal representation in the degree programme. This led to such multiplication of small groups of required subjects that the student's election of studies amounted to not much more than a choice of the chronological order in which the required subjects might be taken. This defect has been removed by the new baccalaureate programme, effective next session, which provides for fundamental subjects in the first two sessions, free election during the last two, and for concentration by requiring that the candidate shall have completed in one school a C course to which six hours, or two B courses, are prerequisite. In conclusion I would sum up by saying that we have freed ourselves from the mere letter of the original Enactments, but have remained true to their spirit. After a century the apex of the pyramid has not been lowered but has built downward to a firm foundation, the keystone has developed the arch. And the result is not a dead structure, but a living organism, capable of almost infinite growth. A prophet is notoriously without honor in his own country. From prophecy I would therefore refrain. I would state only what seem to me the two general problems which the academic schools must now face and solve: first, the evolution of some plan, which will give both stimulus and recognition to the undergraduate student of unusual ability and special intellectual interests: something in the nature of the Honors Schools at Oxford; and second, the development of the graduate department, with its masters' and doctors' degrees, into a great fountain-head of scholarship and productive research, in keeping with the ideal of our great founder. In the papers to be read before the separate sections, I feel sure we may hope to find the method of approach and solution of these two problems. I. The Language and Literature Group THE PRESENT CRISIS IN MODERN LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION By Robert Herndon Fife, Ph.D., Columbia University The bromidic remark, heard very often three years ago, that "things will never be the same after the war" has proved as true a prediction in the field of modern language instruction as in other fields. The war seemed at first to bring an immense increase of interest in our subject. For the first time in history America sent its soldiers to fight on the soil of Europe, with its sharp linguistic divisions and rivalries. To hundreds of thousands of young Americans, French ceased to be a memory of the school bench or an unreal tradition of something far off and unknown and became the daily speech of comrades in trench and field and of a citizenry bound to ourselves in the daily routine of a common cause. German, somewhat more often heard here as a living language, and consequently more vital to us, was no longer merely the vernacular of handworker or cheese-and-butter merchant, but became the expression of the spirit, living in the mouth of prisoner or captor, of a nation in arms, seeking to destroy our ideals. Italian and Polish, Russian and Bohemian, Servian and Roumanian and Greek, all shot into reality and half a dozen more tongues forced themselves as living organisms into the consciousness of the youth of America, which up to that time had scarcely dreamed of their existence. The first result of all this was to demonstrate how insufficient and unpractical our instruction in the modern languages had been. Young men and women, who had spent precious years in the acquisition of what they fondly imagined was a practical knowledge of the French language, found themselves face to face with Frenchmen and unable to understand the first word or express the most urgent want, and even months of intercourse with the people of the country was insufficient to do more than supply the means of conveying the simplest daily needs, because of the lack of a proper basis of training in idiom and vocabulary. One immediate consequence of the declaration of war was a tremendous growth of interest in the language of the associated nation on whose soil the western front was drawn. In camp and cantonment, in school and club the size of the classes in French depended only on the number of available teachers. These teachers were often blind leaders of the blind; but if they had been the most expert of their profession, the conditions under which they had to work could have made anything like real success out of the question. For it now became generally clear, something which of course was known already to the trained teacher, that the use of a modern language for any practical purpose is an art which, to be acquired successfully, needs the plasticity of youth and a perseverance and method which the crowded months of the war could not admit. The urgent days of the struggle and of repatriation of the forces did little more for the study of the foreign modern languages than to show the defects in our system. This revelation of defect was, however, of sanitary value, for it came at a time when America's changed position as a result of the Great War put a practical knowledge of the modern languages among the absolute imperatives of national security. Whatever currents may flow on the surface of the political waters, however politicians who have been washed to the top by the muddy ebb-tide of war may prate of American isolation or appeal to short-sighted selfishness with smug platitudes about America's national interests, the intertwining of our affairs with those of Europe cannot be undone. Economic forces as irresistible as those geological changes that come with the cooling of the planetary crust have set us down among Frenchmen and Italians and Germans and Poles and Czechs and Russians and have made us industrially dependent on these peoples. Heretofore it has been simply the bonds of a common civilization that have held us to the Continent, and these have been drawn mainly through England. From now on it is the life cords of economic preservation and national development which unite our banks and farms and factories to the capitals and commercial centers of every European country. We have recently witnessed the effort, more or less disguised, of both former associates and foes to make America out of its wealth pay the cost of the outbreak of European jealousy and ambition. We may rest assured that unless we are fully equipped for defense in the field of international finance and commerce, we shall not only find ourselves paying the German indemnity and rebuilding France but left behind in the planetary race for commerce which is even now being staged. Unfortunately also, the war has brought about changes in modern language instruction which have left us poorly prepared to face the present crisis. German has been very largely driven from the schools. This came as a result of conditions which brought us into the conflict and through the impulsive character of our national temperament; but the consequences have been none the less destructive and from the standpoint of national strength deplorable, for in 1917 German was, as a rule, the best taught of the foreign languages and as a branch of secondary school and collegiate instruction was in many parts of the country on the way to develop a methodology of teaching at least on a par with that of the better English schools and not far below that of the Continental schools themselves. French was immediately lifted into a position of tremendous importance, with the resulting overcrowding of classes. Teachers, whose sole equipment consisted of some knowledge of the French verbs and the buoyant disposition that came with the outburst of national enthusiasm, were put in charge of classes where overcrowding would have made success impossible under the most experienced instructor. Spanish, which five years ago was scarcely known as a high school subject in the New England, North Atlantic, and Middle Western states has, through the indifference of school directors and as a result of an unheard-of propaganda, been given an importance among school subjects which is far out of proportion to its cultural and scientific value, and in most sections of our country in no relation whatever to its commercial significance. As a matter of course, no consideration whatever has been given to the desperate lack of trained teachers of Spanish. Many men and women, formerly efficient teachers of German, have become inefficient and discouraged teachers of Spanish. While it must be said of these that they have at least had some general pedagogical experience in modern language instruction, which may in part compensate for an ignorance of Spanish, a great number of the newly recruited teachers of Spanish lacks even this asset. It would be bad enough if we had simply destroyed our former values. We have done more. We have shaken the confidence of school superintendents and the public generally in the teaching of the modern languages. From every side comes the statement that pupils are discouraged and unwilling to continue the subject, that school principals have either reduced the already insufficient time assigned to the modern languages or threaten to eliminate them altogether, that school committees are not sympathetic, that parents are restive and want to see their children taught something where demonstrably useful results may be obtained. It must be said that the attitude of certain modern language teachers is not of a character to recommend the subjects which they represent. At a time when the value of violent and persistent propaganda has been demonstrated to a sufficiency in every country in the world, the modern language teacher has not failed to note the lesson and has cried his wares with an insistency that does credit to a commercial age. The German teacher, to be sure, has been under the shadow; but with the coming of technical peace he may be trusted to rush to the fore with the others. In the meantime the representatives of French have found conditions most favorable. The Spanish and Latin propagandists have fought merrily over the bones of German instruction and proclaimed the value of their substitute with unhalting voice. The advocates of Russia were warming up for an advance on the schools in 1917, when certain events in St. Petersburg brought their advance to a sudden halt. Italian has a small but vociferous band of devotees. Brazilian trade,—or its promise,—brought Portuguese to the fore in certain cities, while the nationalistic urge from Ireland and commercial prospects in the Orient have led to an enthusiastic demand that the schools teach Gaelic and Chinese. In the larger cities of the East there are signs that Poles and Czechs and Jugo-Slavs look yearningly toward a share in the modern language programs of the schools supported by public funds. Under these circumstances it is inevitable that the public mind should be greatly confused as to the purpose of modern language study. The nationalistic propaganda which the war has so much intensified fills the air with its watchwords and seeks to make a battle-ground of our American schools. Even those who should be able to take an expert and objective view of education are often unclear in their own minds as to the object of teaching foreign modern languages and the choice of the languages to be taught, so that the average teacher is left without any proper idea of purpose and method. School committees and school principals, all too ready to yield to local political and quasi-political pressure, are without direction or leadership and swing with the emotional currents of the day. In view of this chaotic condition, it may be proper in the few minutes remaining to me to formulate some ideas on this matter. Aside from the importance of the national crisis, there are two considerations which make the discussion of the problem peculiarly proper on this occasion. First, the great interest which Mr. Jefferson took in instruction in the modern languages both at William and Mary and at this institution, which was the first in America to teach the modern languages as carefully as the classical; and, secondly, the distinguished position which the graduates of this University have taken in the service of the nation. It is from this standpoint, that of service to the country rather than that of benefit to be derived by the individual, that the subject should be viewed in the present crisis. From this viewpoint, then, there are three purposes from which the study of modern languages derives importance: for trade and commerce, for scientific research, and for national culture. I need make no apology at the present time for placing the cultivation of our national trade in the first position, since through its success alone can the national bases of wealth and progress be made permanent. It is not necessary to point out that the time has passed when we can hope to be self-dependent, either as an industrial nation or as a producer of raw materials. It is well known that even before the war the United States was organized industrially to a point where foreign markets had become a necessity for our factories, and the years from 1914-1918 speeded up this organization until not merely the prosperity, but even the solvency of great communities in the New England and North Atlantic states and the Middle West depend on gaining foreign markets. It is also too well known to repeat that the war has made us a creditor nation, something which creates an entirely new dependency on the maintenance of intimate relations with Europe and the Orient. In the race for the world's business we shall now have to strike into a faster pace than that which marked our easy-going methods of seven or eight years ago. This is perfectly clear to those who will look across the two oceans and see how the nations of the world are stripping themselves for the conflict. The knowledge of foreign languages was not the least of the assets which Germany possessed before the war and by means of which she was able to elbow her way into the front rank of exporting nations after 1895. That is a lesson which England especially has learned from her rival. The appointment of a committee to investigate modern studies, by Mr. Asquith in 1916, and its important report show how fully the eyes of the British had been opened to the necessity for overcoming the advantage which Germany enjoyed in this field before the war. Unless American banks and exporters and importers can find young Americans who have laid at least a sound basis for the command of the leading languages of commerce, they will have to entrust their trade commissions and trade secrets to foreigners. In the race for primacy in trade the two great rivals whom we shall meet in every market are the British and Germans, both of whom have through their geographical position superior advantages in learning modern languages. We must not be deceived by the fact that we enjoy for the present advantages in capital and the disposal of raw materials. The time is not distant when American business will have to meet the foreign trader on a battle-ground where educational equipment will count as heavily as material assets. The second great national demand in modern language instruction comes in the field of scientific research. Both in the natural sciences and the human sciences America has to create and maintain the bases of national greatness. In the steel industry, in textiles, in the chemical trades and in every branch of electrical technique and agricultural chemistry and biology, an up-to-date knowledge of the languages of the other great producing nations is in a new sense a part of the alphabet of the scientist. The war has made the sciences more truly international than ever and has welded into an indissoluble union laboratory experiment and national production, both agricultural and industrial. No nation can afford to rest its knowledge of what is being accomplished in foreign laboratories to any great extent on the circumlocutory methods of translation. Its scholars, down to the last laboratory assistant, must be trained in at least the chief languages of research. If this is true of the physical scientist, it is equally true of the historian, the economist, and the philosopher. The possibilities of national culture and the ability for leadership depend on the ability to take part in the great international exchange of ideas with those nations which aspire to leadership in civilization. National greatness depends not only on factory and farm, on scientist's laboratory and scholar's study. It depends also upon the ability of the great mass of educated men and women, especially such molders of public opinion as clergymen, journalists, and political leaders, to share at least to some extent, in the culture of other peoples. Some one has said that while training makes men better citizens, culture makes them better men. No nation, least of all America, can live to itself. We believe ourselves engaged in the creation of a peculiar and original type of national culture, but the whole basis for it in school and college is that European culture from whose loins our own has sprung. In this sense our national history is the prolongation of the history of England, Holland, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, and to some extent of the Scandinavian North. Our poets are the heirs of Burns and Tennyson, to be sure, but also of Dante and Goethe. Our drama is sprung from the stock of the English stage, from Shakespere to Shaw, but also from the French realists and Ibsen and Hauptmann. Our novel traces a long line of ancestors, which include not only Fielding and Thackeray, but also Cervantes and Mérimée. No American national culture is thinkable that does not rest on what is best and most characteristically national in the civilization of Western Europe, none that does not keep step with the philosophical, political, and economic theory and the belletristic literature of the great peoples across the Atlantic. The question as to the choice of modern languages for study in the American schools and colleges is not one that can be decided a priori. America is large and the various contacts with its continental and trans-marine neighbors make varying demands on its business and professional life. A very strong reason for the study of Spanish exists in the Gulf States and Southwestern states. The importance of the Oriental trade makes it advisable to give especial attention on the Pacific coast to the languages of the Far East. Nevertheless, for the great bulk of American youth the question has to be decided on broadly national grounds, with a full consciousness of the great significance of the decision. As a rule our schools can offer no more than two foreign languages and they do well, indeed, if they can give efficient instruction in these. In comparison with this last consideration, the quality of instruction, all others are of secondary importance. It is much better to do French or German well, for instance, than to try to do French and German, or French, German and Spanish, as has been tried in many poorly equipped schools. It must be remembered that while each language has concrete values and peculiar charm, when a choice is made, regard must be had to all the factors of national service that have been outlined above. Thus, while Italian ranks very high for the student of literature and perhaps also of the theory of the State, its value in other fields is in so far negligible that it cannot come into consideration where the limit is two languages for the average high school boy or college boy. It must be emphasized also that our schools and colleges teach a European history and civilization and that we live to a great degree from a foreign trade that is in the main European, though increasingly Latin-American and Oriental. In the economy of educational life we are driven to confine ourselves to those languages which open widest the door to all sides of business and cultural possibilities. For purposes of general culture French stands first for the American student as for the youth of every people in Europe. The justice of this is so generally recognized by all who have any knowledge of the history of Europe since the Crusades and of present-day European conditions that it seems unnecessary to enlarge upon it. In assigning the second position from this standpoint, one might select Italian, but for one very important consideration. As French has been for generations the lingua franca for the culture of Western Europe, German plays the same rôle to the East of the Rhine and north of the Alps. For centuries even those nations which, like the Poles and Czechs, have been in arms against the German advance have depended upon Germany as their medium of communication with Western Europe for all branches of culture as well as for business. The same is true, though to a less degree, of the Scandinavian peoples, and to an even greater extent of the peoples of the Eastern Baltic and Russia. To their own immense and significant contributions to physical and historical theory and economic theory and also to those of their neighbors to the East and North the Germans open a door which must of necessity pass through Central Europe. From the Scandinavian tier of states, Ibsen and Björnson and Strindberg and such moderns as Bojer and Nexö and Lagerlöf found their way into world literature first through German translations. The same is true of Tolstoy and Gorki and Sienkiewicz and of dozens of minor novelists, dramatists, poets, and essayists of the Scandinavian and Slavic world, many of whom would remain unknown outside their own vernacular but for the busy German translators. In the field of science the same is true. Here only two languages really come into consideration, German and French: the latter through the accomplishment of its scholars in the fields of the mathematical and historical sciences, medicine and philosophy; the former through its philosophers, chemists, physicists, biologists, geologists, and mineralogists. Here again German plays a significant and indispensable rôle as the intermediary between West and East. For instance, all of the states that came into existence as a result of the dissolution of the Austrian Empire and the plucking off of parts of old Russia have been for many years busily engaged in the development of their own national culture. The universities at Warsaw and Cracow and Lemberg, at Dorpat, Prague, Agram and Budapest are centers of a throbbing national culture that regards the national language as its most cherished and distinguished asset emblem. Many of these universities have made in the past important contributions to the world's store of science and it is probable that under the present conditions these contributions will be greatly increased. For centuries, however, the Slavic and Hungarian scholars have depended on German to make their discoveries known to the western world. It is not presumable that it can ever be otherwise, for whatever political ties may bind these peoples to England and France, the bases of their scientific and business life rest on an ancient bilingual tradition, in which German holds its place as the Koiné of Eastern Europe. The gradation series of importance for general culture for American students then reads, in my opinion, French, German, Italian, Spanish. For scientific research the position of the two leading languages should be reversed. In neither field does Spanish play an important part. Conditions are, however, different when we consider the position of America in the field of commerce. Here indications point to a relatively diminishing importance for French as compared with the other languages. Here Spanish makes a far stronger claim to consideration, for the spread of the study of Spanish since the war rests on a solid basis, though perhaps not so broad a one as its more vociferous advocates claim. Its importance to be sure, lies mainly in the future, but that there is an immense and hitherto undreamed-of responsibility both politically and commercially in our relation to the countries to the south of us is one of the results of the falling of the scales from our eyes that came after 1914. That we were once blind in this direction does not, however, excuse us for becoming blind in another direction, for blind we shall surely be if we permit ourselves, in view of the present disorders in Russia and Central Europe, to overlook what a great share of our national prosperity depends on the trade of the part of the world whose Koiné is German. In general, in the choice of the language to be studied for commerce, some regard must be had to regional considerations. For the New England and North Atlantic and North Central tier of states, the Central and Eastern European markets are of the greatest significance, and even for the cotton-producing states of the South the finger of necessity points in that direction. It is far from my purpose to be dogmatic or to do more than to seek to lay before you the present condition of affairs in modern language instruction and what seem to be the fundamental bases upon which reconstruction must rest. In this hour of our national history, when so much depends upon the discovery of means of economic relief and cultural development, the country needs no ex parte statements or a priori conclusions. What it does need desperately is a broad survey of the situation by patriotic men, among whom ought to be included not merely modern language experts but practical educationalists and men of affairs, who shall go deeply into the reasons and methods of modern language study in America and prepare a program that puts the needs of public service in the foreground. THE DEMAND FOR TEACHERS OF FRENCH AND SPANISH By H. Carrington Lancaster, Ph.D., Johns Hopkins University When I was asked to come here to-day and offer some constructive criticism in order to show how the University would best fulfil its function in regard to the teaching of French and Spanish, I felt somewhat overwhelmed by the thought that the institution where I learned to appreciate this field of knowledge should turn to me for suggestions concerning it. But I soon came to the conclusion that you really regard me as one of many scouts you have been sending out and that I am now called back to headquarters merely to report on conditions as I have found them. What you prefer to hear from me must be the conclusion to which I have come as a result of finding myself at one of those cross roads in academic life where students come to prepare themselves for the profession of scholar and teacher; and college presidents to fill up gaps in their faculties. From the outlook that I get from that observation post I have no hesitation in saying that the great need of the profession just now is student raw material of the quality that is produced here at Virginia. This has not always been the case, for there was a time when our greatest need was of another sort. But in recent years opportunities for graduate study in the Romance languages have been greatly improved. Universities are better equipped in books and scientific journals. The intercollegiate library loan helps to supply the books that many institutions cannot buy. There is a far greater variety of specialists than formerly in the various fields. There are more numerous reviews in which they can publish their work. Opportunities for study abroad have increased decidedly. When I was a student it was rarely, if at all, that a man went to Europe on a traveling or research fellowship. Now there are special organizations that provide scholarships generously and many universities have traveling fellowships of their own. Moreover French and Spanish scholars are more ready to coöperate with us than they used to be. American exchange professorships, clubs like the American University Union in Paris, and most of all the war itself have helped to bring us all together. Proposals are now pending that may enable Americans to study for the doctorat-ès-lettres. In our own Universities, as well as in the French, Romance philology and medieval literature are no longer taught to the exclusion of modern literature, so that another reason that may formerly have kept students out of the Romance field has ceased to exist. Statistics recently published in the Modern Language Journal, though by no means complete, illustrate the great increase among students of these subjects. In some 109 colleges and universities there were, in 1914, 10,177 students of French; in 1920 there were 19,501. In 1914 there were only 2049 students of Spanish in those institutions; in 1920 there were 12,545. Indeed, whether we approve or disapprove of this orientation in cultural studies, the fact is that the public is coming to look upon the Romance languages next to English, as the chief subject for study among the humanities; upon the Romance languages with History as the chief subjects by which we can learn to understand our neighbors in Europe and in Latin America. So large is the number of those who study French in an important western university that the department has had to limit the size of beginners' sections, but the limit is forty! It is superfluous for me to point out to you the kind of results one gets from classes of this size unless one is an adept in the college yell method of instruction which had, as you remember, a certain vogue in army camps a few years ago. But with even so generous a limitation there are not enough teachers for the classes. When I left the Johns Hopkins in June, 1907, there were only two openings that I had heard of and I was in a position to hear of any that were reported to the department. This year, my colleagues and I in the same department have been written to by the authorities in seven colleges and nine universities. In the list occur a number of our leading institutions and all of the positions are such that they would give a satisfactory start to a Ph.D in Romance languages. In some cases we have been able to supply the man or the woman needed, but in most cases we have not been able to do so. We are considerably embarrassed by our inability to meet this demand. The kind of man they usually want is one who understands the American college boy, who has been abroad enough to speak French or Spanish with fluency, who can interpret a foreign literature and a foreign civilization with understanding, and who has shown in his own scholarship enough originality and energy for him to be counted on for future additions to the general knowledge of the subject. Now we do get Ph.D. students who will develop into this type of man, but we get far too few. And when I say we, I do not mean merely the University with which I am connected, for I am sure you will get the same reply from Chicago and Princeton, from Columbia and from Harvard. And where are we going to turn? Not, I think, to foreigners to any considerable extent. Several of them are among our leading scholars and teachers, but their numbers are strictly limited and necessarily so. Initial difficulties with our speech, more serious difficulties with our ways militate against the success of many. Those who have already won fame in their own country are not likely to leave it permanently. We must, then, depend chiefly on Americans, just as France depends upon Frenchmen for instruction in English. What we do need is the graduate of an American college with enough cultural background and capacity for work to get his training by graduate study here and in France. While I taught in Amherst College I used every year to see men graduating that were just the kind we needed, but most of them were going into business. I suppose that much the same situation is found here to-day, though I think it was better here in 1903. I wonder if something cannot be done about it? Certainly business is far less attractive now than it was a year or two ago. An economist said to me the other day: "It's a good thing to have hard times now and then; if we didn't, everybody would go into business." I hope that we can at least take advantage of this opportunity, when business does not offer its former attractions, and put before undergraduates the advantages and values of our profession. And I wonder if this task is not particularly the province of our Alma Mater. A French friend of mine the other day, after a visit to Mount Vernon, told me that he had been much impressed by the similarity between the life in Virginia before the Civil War, as he saw it exemplified there, and life in France, so much so that he thought that those who were familiar with our older culture would have a special aptitude for understanding things French. Perhaps he was carried too far by a pleasant visit to Virginia or by his politeness to me, but there is, after all, at least this much truth in what he said. It was particularly here in Virginia that a form of American civilization was developed in which, to use a consecrated phrase, men were primarily interested in the art of living, which is, of course, the essential vocation of the Romance peoples. And while we have doubtless in many instances sold our birth-right for somewhat dubious advantages of another sort, there surely remains something of the old spirit in the state and especially here at the University. So that is one reason why one may turn to Virginia with hope of a genuine response. Another reason is—Dr. Wilson. If there is anything that stands out in my memory of the years I passed here, it is the charm of his teaching. And from what the alumni tell me he has never lost his rare gift of making Romance civilization real and vital, of inspiring students with a devotion to the subject he teaches that may carry them through life. If then, you ask me how the University will best fulfil its function in regard to Romance languages, I should say that it would be by making a serious effort, under the guidance of Dr. Wilson, to interest men who are graduating here in going on with post-graduate work in order to fit themselves for meeting the very general and insistent demand for teachers who are in the best sense scholars and interpreters of foreign manners and of foreign thought. ENGLISH INSTRUCTION IN THE STATE UNIVERSITY By Morris P. Tilley, Ph.D., University of Michigan At the present time in our country there is going on a re-valuation of educational methods in the light of the increasing cost of state instruction. A new America is demanding a standard of clearer thinking and of higher purpose on the part of the student who has spent four years in a state-supported university or college. General criticism of present results insists upon a reëxamination of university curricula, of administrative methods, of the quality of teachers, and of the fitness of students to whom is granted the privilege of state instruction. It is all an effort to determine and to justify the final value to the state of the vast sums that are now being spent in this country for collegiate and professional training. This examination of the value of our present methods of instruction comes at a time when there is an abnormal demand on the part of thousands of young men and women for higher training for their life work. In order to provide an education for these young people there must be obtained more classrooms and more teachers! It is a fitting time, therefore, for those to whom has been entrusted the instruction of the future leaders of our land to take counsel among themselves and try to decide upon some means by which better results may be obtained. The purpose of my paper is to consider some of the problems of English teaching in the state university. Among the most insistent of these are the necessity, first, of caring for the freshman English work adequately; second, of securing instructors of suitable qualifications; and, third, of developing among the members of the department a spirit of continuous growth. The most pressing need to-day is that of providing fully for the freshman work. This cannot be done unless there is a recognition by the administration of the special claim of the English department for adequate assistance! It is true that the increasing number of students since the war has affected the teaching conditions in all subjects. But no department is threatened to the same extent as is the English with being submerged by ever increasing numbers. The large classes and the inferior quality of many of the freshmen are a severe handicap to the English instructor already burdened with themes and conferences. As a result he is unable to do effective teaching. The first year student is the sufferer. He fails to receive at the beginning of his course the stimulating instruction to which he is entitled. To correct this condition should be the first aim of those responsible for the freshman work in English. It should not be difficult by figures and by comparisons to convince the administration of the urgent need of sufficient assistance to reduce the sections to twenty-five students each. The department should see to it, also, that the more experienced and more mature teachers share in the instruction of the new students. The number of teaching hours of the younger men should be reduced, where possible, to not more than twelve a week. And every effort should be made to introduce into the classroom such methods of instruction as may be most helpful to the student who has not yet had time to adjust himself to college work. To make sure of small sections under capable teachers, however, is not the whole story. There is need of considering further, whether the content of the course may not be so improved as to secure for the freshmen a more stimulating appeal. Notable experiments are being conducted this year at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at the University of Missouri. These consist in a combination of English composition with history and economics in which the lectures and assigned readings supply the subject matter of the themes. The general aim of these experiments is to give it to the writing in English a more vital interest; and it cannot be too highly commended. Indeed, the success attending these combination courses may well bring about a radical change in the methods of conducting the written work in our freshmen English instruction. The outstanding success as Columbia of a "Contemporary Civilization Course," that is required of all freshmen, points to the value of organizing first year work in such a way that the freshman's mind be forcibly stimulated. If the tutorial system introduced some years ago at Princeton could be combined with a study of selected English masterpieces dealing with economics, history and philosophy, we should then have an arrangement of study well calculated to stimulate the freshman's mind. This course given five or six hours weekly, would go a great way towards correcting the lack of interest which marks much of the freshman's attitude. II The second problem that presents itself is the difficulty of securing men with the requisite qualifications. The demand from the over-crowded English departments of our colleges for well-prepared teachers is far greater at present than our graduate schools can supply. The standard of preparation and of personality demanded of university instructors, as a result, has been lowered. Men have been engaged, who a few years ago would not have been thought eligible for vacancies on the teaching staff. But the instructor question to-day is more than one of lowered standards. The proportion of instructors to professors in our faculties has steadily increased for a number of years. At the same time the ratio of students to all members of the teaching staff has tended to become higher. In this continued weakening of the teaching force there is serious cause for concern. We need seek no further for an explanation of much of the criticism directed against university methods to-day. In view of these conditions the selection of instructors is vitally important. There is a general agreement, I believe, in the qualifications desirable in a university instructor. The candidate selected should be the man who has taught with the most marked success, who has pursued his graduate work with the greatest originality, and who has the strongest and most attractive personality. The one hundred per cent. man in each of these essential requirements is rare at any time! Especially in a period of readjustment like to-day it may be necessary to be satisfied with a teacher who does not measure up to the normal standard. But there is a minimum in teaching experience, in scholarly work and in personality below which a candidate may not fall. He should have taught long enough to have convinced himself and others that he finds in teaching an abundant source of satisfaction, even joy. He should have followed his graduate studies at least to that point where he recognizes that a scholar cannot continue successful teaching unless he has an ever deepening knowledge of his own particular field. And he should have progressed so far in the development of his personality as to be able to give freely of himself to his students both in and out of class. To consider the appointment to a university faculty of a man who is known to be deficient in any one of these qualifications is a serious mistake; and invites the necessity of dismissing him when he breaks down under the rigorous tests of success. There has been a tendency, now fortunately passing, to weight excessively, in the selection of a new instructor, evidence that is offered of ability in research work. The more important qualifications of character and of ability to teach have sometimes been overshadowed by a brilliant doctorate. But numerous instances where the gifted Ph.D. has failed to develop even the ordinary instincts of the teacher, and other cases where he has lacked the basic elements of personal fitness, have caused a more careful regard to be given to these requirements. It can be safely predicated that a starved and meager personality is not the stock from which to develop the flower of a sympathetic and inspiring teacher, or of an original and forceful investigator. To every alumnus of the University of Virginia it is a source of pride that the value of an invigorating personality has been recognized in its various departments. It is indisputable that the clearer thinking and the higher purpose demanded of college students to-day cannot be obtained unless their instructors point the way by example and by precept. When our faculties in all ranks are made up of men of strong personal and scholarly qualifications, there wil be a corresponding higher degree of attainment possessed by the graduates of our universities. We have next to consider how the candidate desired may be secured. What are we to offer him in the way of financial remuneration, of opportunity for development, and of certainty of advancement that will make it likely that we can secure his service? In the first place, we must face squarely the fact that the time when we could get a competent man for twelve hundred dollars has gone, probably not to return. A minimum sum of eighteen hundred must be offered, if we are to think of bidding for him with the hope of competing successfully for his services. I know of instructors to whom two thousand was paid last year although they had had no experience in university teaching and had not yet received their doctor's degree. It seems clear that we must be prepared to pay according to a much higher scale in starting men than we have been accustomed to in the past. Other considerations than money, of course, will enter into the acceptance of a position. A young man leaving a graduate school will weigh carefully the opportunities for development presented by a position. He will consider in particular the reputation of the men in the department that he is asked to join, the library facilities available, the number of teaching hours required and the character of the work that he is asked to "give." If a department is able to offer a sufficient number of attractions to be sure of adding to its ranks only men of first class attainments, it has open to it the surest way to the development of a strong corps of teachers. It is the department that is not watchful of the instructors that it adds to its teaching staff that finds itself in a few years burdened with men that are blocks to progress. Of such teachers few die and none resign: and the difficulty of dismissing them increases with their length of service. III The English department that has enough men and able men to do its work has still another problem before it. How may it develop among its members that spirit of accomplishment that is not satisfied merely with fulfilling the obligations of teaching, but is determined to win for itself recognition outside of the university in the world of scholarship? How may it, in other words, accomplish the hard task of contributing to the sum of knowledge at a time when the demands made upon it in other directions are many and continuous? I know of no better way of developing such a spirit than by a full realization of the importance to the department and to the university of a faculty of men who are esteemed by their fellow-workers in other institutions as leaders in their especial fields of research. Once the importance of such a spirit has been realized there will be an active and aggressive emphasis laid upon the value of men who are able to show substantial results in scholarship. It is not possible for every man to excel in research work, and to startle his colleagues by discoveries of value. But it is necessary for a department of English to recognize that other calls than those made by his scholarly interest are secondary. The younger teachers especially must be on their guard against spending too much of their time on administrative affairs. The older members on the other hand are more likely to rest upon their oars and be satisfied with a routine of teaching. Threshing old straw year after year, they slip gradually into a condition of ineffectiveness. Security of tenure and seniority of rank invite them to an increasing inactivity that undermines their own ability to teach successfully, and encourages a similar inactivity on the part of their younger colleagues. The members of the English department particularly have to hold constantly before them the importance of scholarly work. They will otherwise find their time consumed with instructing large classes, with the correction of much written work, with speaking engagements both within and without the university, with giving assistance to student publications and dramatic organizations and with many other activities of university life. In the face of these accumulating demands a teacher will fail to attain his greatest effectiveness unless he keep clearly in mind the fact that his duty of imparting the truth goes hand in hand with his second duty of seeking the truth. The chief problems, then, of the English department of the state university are problems of personnel. It must have enough men, without overburdening its teaching force, to give the students a sufficiently intimate instruction to urge them to their best efforts. It is even more necessary that it have able and forceful teachers, who can at the same time add to the sum of human knowledge. The successful English department to-day is the one which has an adequate number of able teachers who are at the same time able scholars. II. The Mathematical and National Science Group PROBLEMS IN SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION By Charles Lee Reese, Ph.D., Sc.D., Chemical Director of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company During the last twenty years, I have had to handle thousands of men, coming from many institutions of learning throughout the country; in fact, during the war I had to do with about ten per cent. of all the chemists in our land, at least forty-five of them being graduates of the University of Virginia. They were men of various degrees of training in chemistry, and consequently I have been able to observe many of their shortcomings. Among these might be mentioned a lack of sufficient training in English to enable them to express their thoughts, and the results of their work, in clear concise language, a tendency toward what I might call "sloppiness" for the lack of a better word, lack of thorough preparation in literature study before entering upon a particular piece of work, and even lack of knowledge as to how to use the literature, and what kind of information can be obtained from the literature; in other words, entering upon a piece of work without a thorough knowledge of the state of the art. The ability to judge the value of information found in the literature is often found wanting, and I might easily go on in such an enumeration regarding sufficient training in methods of research, and lack of judgment in selecting the best method of attack. "Sloppiness," I might almost say is a characteristic of the American people, due to the fact that they are almost always in a hurry to get through with what they are doing in order to take up something else, a tendency which prevents thoroughness. Our primary schools are affected by it, attempting generally to fill the heads of the pupils with knowledge, instead of training the mind to habits of care, accuracy and efficiency. Even our college entrance requirements are possibly responsible for too much pressure for knowledge rather than training. The Germans have overcome this tendency by making machines out of their school children, and it is questionable how far we should go in this direction. When I was at the University it was said that it took all of a man's first year to learn how to study, and some of them never learn, consequently many never reach their senior year. Now to come down to the college work. Most important of all is the personality of the teaching staff, and the effect of that personality on the attitude of the student to his work. I have always felt that the undergraduate should have personal contact with the principal men of the faculty, the men who are most inspiring from a moral as well as a professional standpoint; men who are character builders and leaders who inspire confidence and interest in the work. As a friend of mine once said in speaking of college athletics creating loyalty and college spirit, why should the work not be made just as interesting, and as much enthusiasm be created over it as over athletics. This can only be done by the ability of the professors to create such interest and enthusiasm. Mallet, Remsen and Bunsen were men of this type in my day, and no doubt there are many to-day of the same kind. Owing to our hurried life, and the desire and necessity, in many cases, for men to reach the bread winning stage, too many men enter the profession without that liberal education included in the old-time college course, involving modern and ancient languages, physics, mathematics, arts and letters, history and philosophy, which fit a man for the higher side of life, and I wish to emphasize the importance of such training wherever possible before a man enters upon the pursuit of his professional course. This applies to the chemist, the physicist, the lawyer, the engineer, as well as the business man, or a man in any other walk of life. I am quite sure that the chemist who has had such an education will forge ahead much faster than his less fortunate fellow-chemist. With this kind of training a man is in a much better position to determine the professional career best suited to him. There has been during the past thirty years a tendency to make the training of chemists more practical, as they say, and many committees have been appointed to study and recommend courses of training for technical chemists. I have often been asked by professors and students to outline a course of study for a chemist who wishes to enter the explosives or dyes industry for instance, and my reply has invariably been to teach them chemistry, physics, mathematics and English, and the experience and application will come fast enough when they are up against the problems to be met in any industry. There is at present a tendency to make a compromise between the liberal education and the professional education to meet the undoubted demand, and those of you who will read the Yale Alumni Weekly of April 29th, will see what Yale expects to do in her four-year course in Chemistry. In their Freshman year, besides their usual course in Chemistry, they have English, Language, History, Mathematics and Government. In the Sophomore year much stress is laid on Mathematics and Physics, as well as Mineralogy and Crystallography with English and the Languages, also electives in Drawing and Bacteriology. The Juniors devote seventy per cent of their time to Chemistry, with some Geology, and as new features, very important courses in Economics and Business Finance are introduced. The Seniors devote most of their time to Chemistry, with lectures on Industrial Chemistry, Metallurgy and Metallography, with a chemical seminar and a course in Business Management as a supplement. As electives, they have courses in Statistics, Business Law and Principles of Accounting. When I was here we had General Industrial, Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry, with a short course in Pharmaceutical Chemistry for the "Meds." General Chemistry included lectures on Physics, Organic and Inorganic Chemistry. Industrial Chemistry was a most comprehensive lecture course on the subject, and has proved of inestimable value to me in my career. Physical Chemistry, as a subdivision, was hardly known then, but now has grown to be one of the most important branches of the science, and Organic Chemistry was in its youth in this country. The word "Colloid" was used in contradistinction to "Crystalloid," but Colloid Chemistry was still to be born, and it has hardly yet got out of its swaddling clothes. Catalysis was a name for the unknown, and if you should hear Dr. Bancroft deliver his three celebrated lectures on that subject, you would learn that the theories of Catalysis are mainly postulatory, and most of the postulates advanced can be disposed of, in spite of which many important discoveries and accomplishments have been attained through Catalysis, and I believe I can safely say that it presents as fertile a field for research as any other field in the chemical science. It has been suggested that I say what I think the opportunities of the Universities are in the future, and how they best can be realized, especially as regards graduate work in pure and applied chemistry. What I have already said is perhaps more or less generalization, but it expresses thoughts that I have had for sometime, and you will forgive me if I have taken this opportunity to express them. The fields of natural science covered by the Academic and Graduate Schools at present are Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Geology and Physics, to all of which Chemistry is related to a greater or less degree, for we are able to apply Chemistry even to the stone. Physiological, Biological, Pathological and Pharmacological Chemistry seem to be included incidentally in the Medical Department. In the chemical courses we have General, Analytical, Organic, Physical, Colloidal, Industrial, Agricultural, Theoretical, Metallurgical and Physiological, all covered by a few men, and these same men must take care of the post-graduate work in any of these subdivisions, if required. Attempts are made in other institutions to cover special subjects such as ceramics, cements, dyestuffs and dyeing, electrochemistry, fermentation, photography, etc. Without a very large staff, I doubt the advisability of undertaking such special subjects, and even then a man properly trained in the principles and practice of the science will soon become expert in these special lines after once being connected with the industry, and his future training in these lines can thus be carried on after he becomes a bread winner. The Endowment Fund will assist materially in many ways, but first of all it should be used to increase the compensation of the present members of the teaching staff to give them a living compensation, and the ability to set something aside for a rainy day, and also enable the University to secure the services of able men in the future. Second, to increase the teaching staff to such a point that they will have time to devote to study and research work, and enable them to gain reputations which will induce students to remain at the University for post-graduate work, and attract men from other institutions to study under such men. At present the number in the post-graduate schools is small, but owing to the great impetus which has been given in this country to the pursuit of the natural sciences, especially Physics and Chemistry by the late war, the establishment of the Dye Industry and the Chemical Warfare Service will create increasing demands for many men thoroughly trained in these sciences, especially in the fields of fundamental and applied research, so there is room for growth in the University in this direction. I hope to see the day, or at least the day will come, when the University can have professors who can specialize in each subdivision of the sciences; men who will have only a few hours each week to devote to the lecture room and the seminar, and much time to devote to research and study, and become leaders in research, and developing methods of research which will draw to them a group of students devoted to their particular specialty. It is only by such methods that rapid progress can be made in our search for the truth, and advance in science and the arts. It is as important for our great universities to develop great men in the field of professors and teachers; men who can devote their entire time to the search for truth in the fields of natural science, as it is to develop the young men of our country to practice their profession in their particular fields, for the former is essential to the latter. With the establishment of such highly developed scientific industries as the dye industry, and the recent tendency to utilize science in all industries, many such men as I feel the universities should develop will be utilized in the industries. As the industries become more and more highly developed, they will need more highly trained men in the special subdivisions of the sciences. The present demand for highly trained specialists in the industries is a serious menace to our country and the world, and if our great universities are to maintain their force of such men to train others, this can only be done by ample provision for their support. This brings me to a point where I wish to bring up for discussion a plan which I have been able to follow in a few cases for relieving, to a small degree, this serious situation. It is a plan which has been followed extensively in Europe. An industry, with or without a very complete research organization, can profitably retain professors, who have made reputations, at a salary which, in some cases, may exceed that which they receive from the university, by consulting work. This has proved of great advantage to the professor himself, not only from a financial, but also from a professional point of view in his work for the university, and of great advantage to the university. Of course this should be done with the distinct understanding that the consulting work is not to interfere in any way with duties to the University. The unselfish character of some of our consultants has been demonstrated by the fact that one of them has used his retainer to employ a man to carry on some of his work. The research student is much benefited by the presence of a number of others in the laboratory doing research work, whether in the same or other branches of science, or divisions of his science. It makes it possible for each to be familiar with a number of problems, and the method of prosecuting them, and increases the value of the seminar. In closing I want to thank you for your indulgence, and although there is nothing very striking in what I have had to say I hope it may lead to some discussion which will be constructive, and of value to our Alma Mater in the future. A PLEA FOR THE PERFECT By William Jackson Humphreys, Ph.D., of the United States Weather Bureau The most insistent appeal to the intellect, and the most effective in every line of human progress, is the call of the perfect. The paintings of the great masters arouse an admiration akin to reverence, and inspire us ourselves to work for the faultless in whatever we do. And the same is true of architecture. He that has an intelligence at all measurably above that of the beast of the field is himself ennobled by the presence of a beautiful building. The towering spires of a Gothic cathedral, the stately columns of a Grecian temple, the restful roof of a Buddhist shrine, evoke alike a reverence and a high resolve to live the better life. In statuary, too, and in every other art, the compelling call is the same. Who can behold that most wonderful, perhaps, of all statues, the Daibutsu of Kamakura, and not be thrilled by its magical calm—the peace of Nirvana, the calm of death and eternity? As it is in these few great things and noble arts, so it is likewise with all the others, perfection and perfection alone—accomplishment in which no fault can be found—commands unqualified admiration for the work of others, and sets the satisfying goal of our own endeavors. And now let us come home and be more specific. We here at the University of Virginia are wont to speak of the Sage of Monticello in tones that evidence respect and appreciation. But how did he come to be a sage? Not alone by his invariable honesty of purpose, nor solely by his splendid ability; but in great measure through his transcendent capacity to take trouble—his patience to make perfect. And that over which he labored the longest, the University of Virginia, he loved the most. He realized, as all of us must, that without intellectual training political independence is impossible, and religious freedom only moral chaos. Thus the most patient labor of all his maturer years, the labor of his deepest love and most abiding hope, was the founding of an educational institution perfect in all its plans and purposes. An institution in which the student was from the first trusted as a man of honor, a trust promptly justified and that has become a priceless heritage; an institution manned by scholars of high renown who mingled freely and most friendly with those who came to learn of their wisdom; and, finally, an institution whose very columns and arches and domes, whose harmonious assemblage of much of the architectural glory of Greece and grandeur of Rome, insistently inspires to higher resolves. Here, as nowhere else, one comes under the abiding influence of the father of the University of Virginia, of him who heard so clearly and heeded so well the call of the perfect. Here thousands have heard that same call, and many have heeded in their several ways. Here, we believe, this call was ever present with him who has enriched literature, as long as man shall read, with such compelling and varied classics as The Bells, The Raven, and Annabel Lee. Here, too, all was in harmony with the firm resolve and high purpose of him who but yesterday bade a despairing world to hope—bade it hope by showing so clearly a rational and righteous road every nation can follow, and yet in some fashion will follow, for civilization shall not perish from the face of the earth. Were half the power that fills the world with terror, Were half the wealth bestowed on camps and courts, Given to redeem the human mind from error, There were no need of arsenals and forts. So reasoned the poet Longfellow many years ago, and the case is miserably worse to-day. The burdens of taxation are oppressively heavy. Some say owing to the scientific work done by the National Government, aye, even to the duplication of such work in the city of Washington! "Blind leaders, who strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel." Had the world not been filled with terror, had there been no "wealth bestowed on camps," the present tax on one luxury alone, tobacco, would meet, or nearly meet, the whole of the Government's needs—nor is this tax overly heavy, nor are our people inordinate burners of incense before the goddess Nicotine. The burdens of the world would, indeed, be unbearable were it not becoming clear as the noonday sun that they are avoidable, and that, being avoidable, they soon will be avoided. We are but in the throes of one stage of community evolution, an evolution from the isolated savage through the tribe, the clan, the state and the nation to the federation of the civilized world, an evolution that has always closely followed, and of necessity must closely follow, the development of the arts of travel and communication. That is, as science progresses and its applications are made perfect our relations to each other whether as individuals, communities, or nations, also vary. To the ignorant savage restricted by natural barriers to a small island, or other limited territory, no form of government is desirable or possible beyond that of a primitive tribe. To the most advanced peoples of to-day, however, those who literally can talk to each other though at the ends of the earth, and to whose swift and easy travel there is no obstacle, the restrictions of the tribe and the clan would be intolerable and impracticable. To them nothing short of some form of a universal federation can be satisfactory. One's friends and acquaintances to-day, and his councillors and aids in whatever he is doing, are in every inhabited portion of the globe. We cannot do without each other, neither they without us nor we without them. Hence our plea for the perfect includes the bringing of nations together into that form of mutual support that most encourages the growth of each and makes for the good of all. Now, as is known of the whole world, in the great work of formulating a code adapted to the needs and aspirations of those in the very van of civilization the University of Virginia can claim high honors. First, through her great "father" and again, equally, through her most distinguished alumnus. But let us be critical, for self-criticism is always wholesome. What has been the growth of science and its application to the arts since our Alma Mater began her splendid training of young men, less than one century ago? And what part have we, her alumni, taken in this conquest of nature? Every chapter in the story of modern science is amazing almost beyond belief. We live to-day in essentially a different world from that of our grandfathers, different in many respects from even that of our own boyhood days; and the difference is this, that the world is a better place to live in than it was, so much so, indeed, that many of the things we now regard as common necessities only a little while ago were not possible even as luxuries. Consider some of the more common events in the course of one's daily life. All of us remember, or, at least, know those who do remember, when that morning necessity, the ubiquitous bathtub, was practically unknown. Of course a few buckets of water, carried from the spring and emptied into the old wash-tub, were really worth while, but the undertaking was such a tax on one's moral courage, that baths before breakfast were not then the order of the day. And the cooking of breakfast, what a job it was! Coals, kept alive through the night by a cover of ashes, were scraped out and a wood fire kindled, not in the convenient stove, for no one had such a contrivance, but in a big fire place, and after a time one had something to eat. Rarely, though, did he have fresh meat (cold storage was unknown) nor did he ever have the luxury of fresh fruits and fresh vegetables save those alone that grew in his own locality, nor even these except in their limited season. Who of the first faculty, or early students, of this University ever wholesomely and delightfully began his breakfast with grape-fruit, oranges, pineapples, mangos, or any other of the delicious tropical fruits that now load our tables? And who in the tropics ever then tasted an apple, a pear, a peach, a plum, or a cherry? Who in those days, here or elsewhere, ever feasted on that luscious and most common, perhaps, of all vegetables, the tomato—then regarded as a thing not only unfit for food, but even deadly poisonous? If, as was sometimes the case, you had occasion to write to a friend, you did so with a goose-quill pen, blotted with sand, sealed with wax, and forwarded your letter at the marvelous speed of, perhaps, twenty miles a day. If you had to talk to even a neighbor, and he was beyond hallooing distance, you simply had to go in person to see him, and, whatever the distance, you could only walk, ride horseback, or go in a lumbering carriage. If mother wanted to dye a piece of cloth she herself, most likely, had spun and woven, she did not choose exactly the hue and tint, or shade, she would have and then send us to a convenient drug store to get, for a few pennies, precisely that thing, but sent us to the woods for the inner bark of a black oak. This she steeped according to traditional custom, then dipped the cloth in the decoction thus obtained, and accepted with fortitude whatever stain happened to result. Of course we did not often become ill, for only the most robust survived babyhood, but when we did get sick it generally was the herb doctor that came to see us, and the concoctions he made at least inspired an earnest hope for a rapid convalescence. If, perchance, the case called for surgery, we were indeed unfortunate. What we now call major surgery, and even much that is essentially minor, was rarely ventured. Small operations of course were made, but on the conscious patient and with a dirty knife. There were no hospitals, except in the largest cities, and even these were at times centers of infection rather than restorative institutions. Whether, however, one got sick in those days and sent for the neighborhood herbist, or stayed well and hoed the corn, pealed bark to dye the home spun, or did whatever other chores the exigencies of a primitive life demanded, the end of the day at last came as it now comes. But when it did come there was then no movie to go to, whether instructive, amusing, or demoralizing; no graphophone to stage a grand opera, materialize a brass band, or set amuck a barbaric jazz, as one's whims and fancies might suggest; no phone to chat over; no good light, electric or other kind, to ready by—only a flickering home-made tallow candle, or sputtering pine torch, that for a few minutes flared up unsteadily and then went out. Finally, at the end of every such "perfect day," one scraped the live embers together and covered them with ashes for starting the morning's fire, saw that all windows were closed tight, the door bolted, and every other possible ventilator sealed up lest any of the "noxious night air" might get in, and then went to sleep, to dream, perhaps, of witches and hobgoblins, in a bed as innocent of springs as a concrete floor. True, we often speak, and speak earnestly, of the good old days of yore, but in so doing we really have in mind the buoyancy of our own vigorous youth and the loved ones of our childhood days. We never mean that we would like to discard the latest conveniences and go back, not to our earlier age, for all of us would like to be young again, but to the way the world lived only a few decades ago. Perhaps this reference to a few decades may seem extravagant, but in reality it is not, for our knowledge of nature and the harnessing of natural forces to our own needs grew so rapidly, and with such acceleration, with the founding of laboratories and the consequent spread of inquiry that men still living have seen half, aye, more than half, of that wonderful evolution from the stick and stone of the cave man to the myriad marvels of the present. Take from the air every aeroplane; from the roads every automobile; from the country every train; from the cities every electric light; from ships every wireless apparatus; from the oceans all cables; from the land all wires; from shops all motors; from office buildings every elevator, telephone and typewriter; let epidemics spread at will; let major surgery be impossible —all this and vastly more would be the terrible catastrophe if the tide of time should but ebb to the childhood days of men still living. Nor do all those marvels exhaust our list. Give us a lump of coal, a piece of sulphur and a bit of salt, and we will now, as but a few years ago we could not, work such wonders as even Aladdin with his magical lamp never dreamed of—make brighter, faster and more varied colors than are found in field or forest; sweeter perfumes than scent the flowers; richer flavors than season the fruit; food for plants that shames the richest soil; explosives that rend the hardest rock; cures for many an ill; and poisons more deadly than ever a Borgia desired. In short, with even these few raw materials, we now raise our food, delight the palate, adorn the body, cure ourselves, and kill the enemy! Oh yes, the scoffer of science may say, but no exploring De Soto has ever found the elixir of life. No, we must confess, not yet in all its perfection, but the persistent biologist has found it for some animals, and has successfully applied it. Already he has made excised portions of the heart of the embryo chick live and grow until the chick itself, had it been permitted to grow up, might well have been dead of age—and still that lone, excised heart lived on. Already well-organized animals have been made to live forwards and backwards from youth to age and from age to youth over and over with never a sign that the end was near. What then is beyond our reasonable hope? But to realize that hope we must heed the call of the perfect, must push those investigations, as surely we shall, and the thousands of others they in turn suggest, to their ultimate conclusion. Finally, what have we, faculty, students, and alumni, of this University, been doing the while this great stream of investigation and discovery has been broadening and deepening into a veritable ocean of knowledge? We have made many contributions to this knowledge, and of that we are justly proud, but not all of us have lived up to our opportunities. Let us, therefore, insist that each important position in this University is an opportunity, as it is in any leading institution, to add to the sum of human knowledge, and that opportunity is only another name for imperative duty. Let it further be recognized, indeed let it become a compelling unwritten law, that opportunity shall be given only to him who has demonstrated his ability to improve it, and that the shirking of duty carries with it the forfeiture of place. Possibly such a custom might seem a little drastic, but it would be no more so, nor is there less reason for it, than is the wholesome honor system among students. Nor let us alumni require ought of others that we do not in equal measure demand of ourselves. But how, it occasionally is asked, can any man both investigate and teach? A far better question is this: How can he teach advanced students, at least, if he has not that love of his subject that compels him to investigate? None but the enthusiast can impart to others an earnest desire to learn—blood does not come from turnips. Furthermore, wherever the spark of genius shows, and if it be accompanied by industry, in the name of humanity fan it—give its possessor every needed aid and encouragement. Fan the live spark. No one ever yet got a glowing fire by fanning dead embers. And here let us once more urge our plea for the perfect. Let an investigation, whether large or small, be given ample time, patience, and trouble. Let it be so worked over, yea, so persistently labored over, that there can be no occasion for any one to repeat it until other discoveries reveal a better line of attack, or greater skill in instrumentation provides a desirable higher degree of accuracy. And let the report, whether of progress or of finished result, be brief. Let not our reasons be, as were those of Gratiano, "as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff," where they are not worth the trouble it takes to find them. Neither let our ideas be muddled like those of the freshman who said he knew who Esau was—"the chap that wrote short stories and sold his copyright for a mess of potash." In short, have something to say, say it, quit talking about it. But above all have something to say. III. The Educational Group THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM OF THE STATE By John Walter Wayland, Ph.D., of the Harrisonburg State Normal School The measuring or even the estimating of influence is a task to engage the powers of a magician or a divinity. It is a task like unto the compassing of the sunlight or the weighing of the perfume of the flowers. Yet at the same time, if one is not able to comprehend fully or to estimate adequately, one can at least be certain that the sun shines, that the flowers are sweet and beautiful, and that the world is happier and better because of them. 1. THE POTENCY OF IDEALS The influence of the University of Virginia upon public education in the State has been in evidence, more or less potently, both directly and indirectly for the full century or more of the institution's history. First of all, it seems to me, we should recognize and appreciate the ideas and the ideals that gave the University birth and that have ever given character to its life. When this institution was conceived in the vision of Mr. Jefferson he thought of it as a part of a great whole: a comprehensive gradation of schools that should include all of our citizens in its liberal provisions. In short, he desired elementary schools and secondary schools as well as a university. He did not perhaps employ the same terminology that we employ to-day, but in his dream he saw schools and teachers for little children, schools and teachers for rank and callow youth, as well as a school and teachers for those older, maturer students who are anxious and able to climb to the sunlit heights. It took many years of waiting, many years of working, to get Jefferson's full plan wrought out and accepted; but we rejoice in this good day in the belief that it is now being perfected and appreciated. And all through the years his ideal was a potent influence, a whisper of inspiration that men heard in their moments of reflection, a mighty call to progress in every day of intellectual and moral action. One may say, therefore, that a complete public school system was part of the program under which the University was founded and under which it has, for the most part, been operated. During the last half-century especially, this program has been unfolded more and more clearly, with more and more definiteness and force, from year to year. 2. THE WORK OF LEGISLATORS AND ADMINISTRATORS For one who loves the University, an interesting task would be to scan carefully the names of all the men who, since 1830 or thereabouts, have composed the General Assembly of Virginia and filled the various responsible offices in our state government—to do this with a view of ascertaining how many of these men have at some time been students here. The number is large, we may be certain; and we may also be certain that some of them, doubtless many of them, have aided effectively from time to time in giving Mr. Jefferson's ideas on education a functioning body in the laws and procedure of the commonwealth. In so doing they have been true disciples of our Alma Mater; and through them, whether in our own day or in the days long past, we see going out a mighty stream of influence, carrying life, dynamic life, to our common schools. For example, since 1902, fifteen members of the Virginia State Board of Education have been alumni of the University; and among these fifteen were Charles W. Kent, Lyon G. Tyler, Joseph L. Jarman, James M. Page, Henry C. Ford, John E. Williams, James S. Wilson, and four governors: Montague, Swanson, Stuart, and Davis. 3. THE SERVICE OF ALUMNI AS TEACHERS Face to face with a mighty host we find ourselves when we attempt to number the teachers of Virginia who, at one time or another, for long or shorter periods, have been students at the University. In the years immediately preceding 1870 and in all the long Olympiads of ante-bellum days, schools were being kept alive here and there in Old Virginia by those whose torches had been kindled at Jefferson's altar and whose vision had been at least in part uplifted with his own. Those men labored provincially, it may be, and often under painful handicaps, but who will deny to them a meed of honor in the better times that have come after them? They labored and we have entered into their labors. We are building better, let us hope, than did they; but they often builded better than they knew. Since 1870, when our present system of public schools was inaugurated, alumni of the University have been enabled to assume more numerous and more definite relationships in the teaching forces of the State. This fact appears with growing distinctness as we proceed with our investigations. Consider, for example, the influence that has been radiated through the thousands of teachers that have attended the University summer schools during the past thirty-odd years. A conservative estimate would place the total number of persons, men and women, who have attended these summer schools within this period at 15,000. Not all of this mighty host, it may be, have been teachers; but many of them have been teachers by profession and by practice; and thousands of them have carried the ideas and the inspiration here imbibed into the public schools of the State. In recent years, as we all know, the deliberate and consistent aim in these summer schools has been to make them the most helpful possible to Virginia teachers. And it would be hard to find any community in the State, however small or however secluded, in which there is not working today at least one school teacher who is proud to speak of the days—the summer days so full of work, so full of play, so full of joy—spent here. The services of University leaders, like Bruce R. Payne, Charles G. Maphis, and others, through the University summer schools, have been of incalculable value to public education throughout the State. 4. THE UNIVERSITY APPRECIATING ITS TASK Not only in the summer schools but also in the regular policies and programs of the University the interests and needs of the public schools of the State have been recognized with constantly increasing purpose and definiteness. This has been especially true during the last half-century. For example, as early as 1886, perhaps earlier, the University faculty arranged for local examinations to be given in the various counties of Virginia and other States for stimulating and evaluating the work of boys and girls in the local schools. These examinations took the place, at least in some instances, of high school graduation. More particular information concerning these examinations and their value to the country schools will appear farther on. In 1905 the Curry Memorial School of Education was established at the University, and ever since that time a regular aim of that department has been to touch and elevate the public schools of Virginia. All who remember the untiring extra-mural activities of Professor Harry Heck, the first head of the Curry Memorial School, and all who know the character and the work of his successors will be able to appreciate the significance and growing influence of this foundation during the past sixteen years. In this connection we cannot forget the potency of the University in the famous "May Campaign" of 1905, when "one hundred of the ablest speakers of the State, including the governor, delivered three hundred addresses in ninety-four counties at one hundred different meetings,"1 1 Heatwole: "A History of Education in Virginia, pages 315, 316. all in behalf of public education. Among the eminent leaders of that campaign were President Edwin A. Alderman, Governor Andrew J. Montague (an alumnus of the University), and Dr. Bruce R. Payne, whose distinguished connection with the University was then just beginning. Another gentleman whose share of honor in this May Campaign was second to none was Professor Ormond Stone, who for thirty years (1882-1912) was a teacher here and whose interest in the public schools of the State was both constant and effective. His activities in behalf of public education have been most generous and untiring, as we all know. The vigorous rise of public high schools followed upon 1905, and much of the vigor and character that they embodied came from the University, through the patience and wisdom of Alderman, Payne, and others. How many of the teachers and alumni of the University took part in this notable campaign cannot now, perhaps, be ascertained; but many participated and all who did so shared in the cherished social gift that our Alma Mater at that time made. Thus by those who live in the University and in their work reach out, as well as by those who have studied here and have gone out into the schools of the commonwealth, the same or related gifts have been bestowed. The workers within and the workers without join hands across the same cheering altar of service. 5. ALUMNI AS ADMINISTRATIVE EDUCATORS AND AS TEACHERS IN STATE INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING In speaking hitherto of the teachers of the State who have been students here, attention has been directed especially to that great army in the common schools. When we enumerate school officials and those teachers in our State institutions of higher learning who bear the University's seal the number is smaller, to be sure, but no less influential. Consider, for example, the division superintendents of schools in the counties and cities of Virginia. Twenty-eight of them, almost exactly one fourth of the whole number, are on the rolls of our alumni. Ten members of the Virginia State Normal School Board, the body which since 1916 has had the oversight and the direction of our four state normal schools for white women, have been University men. Prior to 1916 there were separate boards for these four institutions, and a goodly proportion of the members of those separate boards were also alumni of the University. The first of these four normal schools was established at Farmville in 1884. The second was opened at Harrisonburg in 1909; the third at Fredericksburg, in 1911; and the fourth at East Radford, in 1913. From official records it appears that up to this date 20,551 different students have been enrolled in these institutions. Most of this great multitude have been teachers for shorter or longer periods in the public schools of Virginia, and they have been distributed in every county and every city of the State. The significance of all this in our present study appears in a moment when we observe the fact that almost or quite forty members of the four normal school faculties that have trained these 20,000 teachers have been graduates of the University or sometime students here. For many years past the contribution of the College of William and Mary to the life and administrative efficiency of our state public schools has been so great as to win general acknowledgment and appreciation. To this historic institution the University of Virginia herself owes much. Jefferson, Monroe, and others saw to it that the rich legacies of the older foundation became really and truly the younger school's inheritances. But may we not say, speaking truly and gratefully, that in some measure, through the century that is closing, the talents that were received have been invested and returned? For instance, during twenty-one years (1898-1919) the honored president of William and Mary was Lyon G. Tyler, an alumnus of the University of Virginia; and contemporary with him, or at least serving the same generation with him, we may count twelve other distinguished sons of the University on the faculties of William and Mary. Surely, therefore, one may be justified in saying that, in this splendid contribution that William and Mary has made to our public schools, the University has had some cordial share. The coöperation of kindred can certainly be no robbery. It would doubtless be possible, if one had time, to trace relationships of wholesome coöperation between the University and every other State institution of higher learning in Virginia in this laudable task of uplifting the common schools; but a reasonable limit must be our law. 6. INFLUENCE THROUGH PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING And what shall we say with reference to these same relationships as between the University and those institutions of higher learning not owned by the State? Between the University and some of them the bonds have perhaps not been so close or so strong as to be discerned or acknowledged; but with regard to others the coöperation has been both conscious and deliberate. Two examples must suffice. In 1839 Charles Lewis Cocke, a college senior nineteen years old, determined to dedicate his life to the higher education of women in the South. "Inspired by the University of Virginia—opened fourteen years before—he resolved `to give to Virginia women the same thorough mental training as that afforded to young men.' "1 1 The Virginia Teacher, April, 1921, page 93. In 1846 he moved to Botetourt Springs, near what is now Roanoke City, to take charge of a school. "The educational ideals of Thomas Jefferson became the inspiration of his youth"; and throughout an eminent career he cherished them. For more than fifty years he labored in the light of his splendid hopes; and for three-quarters of a century, now, Hollins College has been his growing monument. In many counties and cities of Virginia the graduates of Hollins College have taught worthily in our public schools. Some in this capacity have served well two generations. One of them, Mrs. Betty Chandler Snead, who graduated in 1868, taught in Halifax, in Essex, in Northampton; had a family; returned to the schoolroom, and in 1915 was still at the post of public service. Another, Edwina Chandler (Mrs. Walter Jones), who graduated in 1870, taught in Fluvanna. She married and reared a large family. Then she took up teaching again. She was one of those teachers who used the University local examinations to "standardize" her pupils. Miss Mary Miller Snead, now the valued principal of a Fairfax County high school, another Hollins graduate, is one of the number who testifies to having taken the "University locals" in "Old Flu" under Mrs. Jones. Hollins records show a long roll of alumnæ who have served Virginia effectively and worthily in her public schools. Many other names might be recited, but we must content ourselves with a very few more. Miss Bessie Randolph of Farmville, Miss Elizabeth Cleveland of Harrisonburg, Miss Lucy Puryear of Radford, Miss Berta Miller of Lynchburg, Miss Sully Hayward of Roanoke, and Mrs. Ellie Marcus Marx of Norfolk are all alumnæ of Hollins. They are eminent yet typical examples of the Hollins graduate as a vital force in the public schools of Virginia. And it was one of them who said: "Recalling how often we heard the name of the University from Mr. Cocke's lips and how bracing was the constant touch with its standards, we are not surprised to find his biographer writing: `The educational ideals of Thomas Jefferson became the inspiration of his youth, and with astonishing tenacity and unity of purpose he pursued them until he worked out Hollins College.' "1 1 The Virginia Teacher, April, 1921, pages 93, 94. Hollins College, therefore, is a notable example among the so-called private schools of the State that have deliberately aided the University in giving to the public schools their delayed birthright. Another school of this same class, younger than Hollins but eminent in the same way, is Bridgewater College. This school dates its beginnings only forty-one years ago, yet within the period of its brief history it has sent out hundreds of efficient teachers into the public schools of the State. And every one of them has carried to his work some gift that is openly and generously credited to the University. The reason at once becomes obvious when we note the fact that eighteen different members of the Bridgewater faculties have been students here. For thirty-three years the presidents of the college have been University alumni. Daniel C. Flory, the founder of the school and its head for six years was a student here two sessions. Walter Bowman Yount, president for eighteen years (1892-1910) was a student here six years. And John S. Flory, who was president for nine years (1910-1919), and whose entire service at Bridgewater to date totals twenty-four years, was a student here three years and holds from the University his degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Every Bridgewater student is able to testify that the bond between his school and the University is very close. This bond and source of influence upon our public schools appears not only in the rank and file of teachers trained at Bridgewater, but also in certain notable leaders in education and legislation. John C. Myers, division superintendent of schools in Rockingham County, is an alumnus of Bridgewater and of the University. William T. Sanger, who needs no introduction to Virginia educators, is a graduate of Bridgewater. Frank J. Wright, whose record as a distinguished teacher and as a member of the General Assembly of Virginia is well known, is an alumnus of Bridgewater and of the University. Jacob A. Garber, whose service to public education in the last General Assembly was so conspicuous as to win unusual approval, is merely passing on the fine things that he has received, at least in part, from Bridgewater College and from our Alma Mater. 7. THE UNIVERSITY A SOURCE OF BOOKS FOR THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS And, finally, what shall we say of the books for our common schools that have been written and published by University teachers and University alumni? Bonnycastle's Mensuration, Holmes's United States history, and Venable's arithmetics were widely used for many years; and the famous spelling books and readers by McGuffey have had an influence that is at once potent, far-reaching, and wholesome. It is said that McGuffey's activity in 1870 and later, both in the University and elsewhere in the State, in securing the establishment of public schools and in commanding them to general favor, were most earnest and effective. The excellent series of readers prepared some years ago by President Alderman was a notable contribution to our school libraries and literature. In attractive form and easy grading he has made a fine collection of prose and verse—classics old and new—and placed it at the disposal of our teachers and their pupils. The history of education in Virginia, published in 1916, by Cornelius J. Heatwole, a son of Virginia, cannot be overlooked in this connection; and the biography of J. L. M. Curry, by Alderman and Gordon, while it is not a text book of the ordinary type, is an informing, stimulating story for teachers—the story of a great man who was a teacher and a leader of teachers. And one could not end this catalogue, however brief and fragmentary it may be, without mentioning specially the Library of Southern Literature, a monumental work in sixteen splendid volumes, the compilation of which was directed largely from the University of Virginia and which is a veritable boon not only to Virginia schools but to those also of every state of this nation. To indicate further the influence of the University upon Virginia public schools and to illustrate more particularly some of the statements already made, the following charming story is presented. It is a first-hand contribution to this study, made by one who has recorded definite observations of the influences we are tracing, and who is herself an eminent example of those students and teachers who have received rich gifts from our Alma Mater, even though they have not, as a rule, been numbered among her sons and daughters. "Judge James O. Shepherd, a University man, was the first superintendent of schools in Fluvanna County. He rallied around him a teaching force representative of nearly all the leading families of the county. He thus (and in many other ways) set the standard high and established from the beginning the respectability, and even the gentility, of the public school. I recall playing with a child-visitor from an adjoining county, who spoke so disdainfully of `free schools' that I did not once dream that they were the same thing as our honored public schools—and I now have reason to believe that they indeed were not the same. "Later Judge Shepherd harped on this one string until every child among us caught the note: `We need good public schools devoted to the higher branches. We have the elementary school for the foundation. Yonder we have the University for the top. But we have a great gap between. We need to make the connection by means of a public high school that can prepare the boys for the University.' And he worked the citizens up to contribute liberally to this cause and obtained special dispensation from the General Assembly to establish at the county seat that new thing— a standard rural public high school. I was always led to understand that this was the first of its kind in the State. . . . "Is it at all significant that the lifelong home of Judge Shepherd is `Mountain View?' Certainly it was from that hilltop that they used to point out to us a symmetrical little blue peak, Monticello, adding in tones almost reverent that just beyond was the University. "One more fact about the Judge. When I left for Hollins, he gave me a lead pencil with the parting injunction that I should write and rewrite Latin exercises very carefully, `looking up things' which I did not know. "It was in 1886, when Judge Shepherd and his neighbors, the school trustees, were moving heaven and earth and the State Legislature to establish a rural high school at the county seat—always with the definite ideal of preparing boys for the University—for that was never omitted from the statement of the case—that my teacher read in the Louisville Courier-Journal of certain `University Local Examinations' which would be held at various centers throughout the South just one month later. Her prompt letter of inquiry brought from the University itself a pamphlet definitely stating the subjects, the scope, and the requirements of these examinations. "The next year, perhaps, a center was established in Fluvanna, and for some years thereafter it was the habit for the private schools of Fluvanna, as well as for the new public high school, to stir their students' ambition to pass these examinations. No doubt this was true in many other sections also,—these local examinations taking the place of high school graduation. "First there was a preliminary examination in elementary subjects— geography, grammar, oral reading, etc.—which must be passed before the candidate could be considered for the `higher branches' of geometry, Cicero, Shakespeare, etc. Fireworks on the Lawn: The Closing Scene "I think I shall go on now that I am recalling this occasion and set down some of my own experiences of that new era for me, as a sample of what these examinations might mean in inspiration. "My teacher said that I was to go to the University and take these examinations instead of my own `finals.' The delight of it—the thing that made it a great adventure instead of a heavy task—was that she said if I passed she would consider it a success, but if I should not pass she would not judge it a failure, under the circumstances of the brief four weeks of preparation. "Such a sense of the greatness of this quest! Such a reviewing of geometry (and geography)! I had never heard of the Manilian Law, but it read very much like parts of Cicero that I had been taught. I had never studied `literature' except Shaw's History of English Literature. Neither my teacher nor I knew that there was such a thing as an annotated edition of a play or a poem. But there was a leather-backed Shakespeare in the house, of course, which people read, and sometimes read aloud, though the required play, The Tempest, was new to me until that full month when, armed with the unabridged dictionary, I hammered at the bard's meaning. "Upon reaching Charlottesville (the first night I ever spent in a town) I found the other candidate for the examination to be a girl attending Mrs. Meade's school—Emma Moser, afterwards for many years a valued teacher in the Charlottesville High School. This girl mentioned her Hudson edition of The Tempest, with notes. I soon had it in my possession, and studied it all night long (the noise of the great city of C. being too much for a wink of sleep anyway). Why, Hudson told you everything you had wondered about! He seemed the friendliest writer in the world. "Again, the gracious dignified Mrs. Meade, in gold-pinned cap, having to leave me in her library when her class bell rang, asked whether she could do anything for her timid guest. `If you could lend me a history of England fuller than Goodrich's.' `Why, yes; here is one sent me lately by one of my former pupils.' "Thus I was introduced to Green's Short History of the English People. I devoured its pages about Pitt's plans for applying among his countrymen the great principles of Adam Smith's Political Economy, and how the French Revolution broke into his high hopes. The book was so different from Peter Parley! Best of all, the writer of the examination questions for the next day had evidently just been reading Green also, for he followed his lines exactly, and I could write voluminously in answer, and love Richard Green as a friend evermore. "At last the hour actually came for the examination. Charles S. Venable was in charge—the first professor of the revered University that my eyes had rested upon—and even then they rested only upon his shoes. I was too much abashed to look into the face of the great man `who had made the arithmetic and who understood exactly why you invert the divisor, and everything.' So I gazed at his feet. I recall now just how they looked and that I felt distinct satisfaction and almost a touch of wonder that they rested upon the earth. He was kindness itself, and the thought of that good and wise man still brings always an upward pull. "The first thing in the preliminary examination was to read aloud some page from some book. Professor Venable walked casually to one of the many shelves and just as casually pulled out a volume, turned its pages and chose one at random. Would it all dance before me like hieroglyphics? It was the only page in that book I had ever seen. The winter before I had been studying in my teacher's room one evening. An old lady was visiting her. My teacher was reading to her from this very book. The old lady dropped a stitch in her knitting. It misbehaved sadly, that stitch. It ran back row after row. The teacher had to stop and pick it up. She handed me the book that the reading might not break off. I read aloud a page, and then the stitch was all right and I went back to my lessons. And now that page was handed me to read as a first omen at the University of Virginia. . . . "At the end of the last examination there was a question that seemed to invite my opinion. (It was on Shakespeare.) Could I dare to offer what nobody thought but just ME? I recall saying to myself, `I'm twenty-five miles from home. They'll never hear of the audacity of it. I'll never see these professors again. I believe I'll do it. I'll take a fling.' "And I did. I remember feeling as if I were flying—as if for once and in some far off way—and never to be dared again—I were flying —and in the atmosphere of those whom my imagination ranked the highest. "He must have laughed—whoever looked over that examination. One could easily laugh at the importance which I attach to it now. But I go back to that day when I see the word Renaissance. That examination was the enfranchisement of my thought. However pitifully little that has meant to anybody else, it has meant a good deal to me, and I thank the University and Thomas Jefferson for it. "There was a student who brought his books and `sat with' the candidates when Professor Venable could not be there. In spite of my high respect, I must have looked him over from toe to top, for I recall distinctly his red head. He hesitated when I asked him how to spell Guinea, but I thought it was because his mind was on higher things. I asked him whether I'd better write fully or concisely. `If it's literature,' he said, `I think you'd better chat along'; which I thought a delightfully familiar and condescending mode of speech for one whose own daily words must all be exalted far above `chat along.'
