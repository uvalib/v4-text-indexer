      <field name="fulltext">PART I. HISTORY AND ORGANIZATION: OFFICERS AND STUDENTS: DEGREES CONFERRED. HISTORICAL SKETCH. By an act of January 12, 1803, of the Legislature of Virginia, certain citizens of Albemarle County were incorporated under the style of "Trustees of Albemarle Academy," and were empowered to take such steps as seemed practicable to raise the funds necessary for erecting buildings and putting the Academy into operation. Albemarle Academy was destined never to exist except on paper, but under the guidance of Thomas Jefferson, who was elected to the board of trustees on March 23, 1814, a process of development was begun leading first to the organization of Central College, and afterwards to that of the University of Virginia. On August 19, 1814, the committee of the trustees appointed to select a site, reported that it would be desirable to locate the Academy in the vicinity of the town of Charlottesville, distant not more than one-half mile therefrom. By an act of February 14, 1816, the Legislature authorized the establishment of "Central College, in the County of Albemarle, at the place which has been, or shall be, selected by the trustees of Albemarle Academy, and in lieu of such Academy." All rights and claims of Albemarle Academy were, by the same act, vested in Central College. The board of visitors of the college consisted of six members, of whom Jefferson was the only one who had been a member of the Academy board. The other five members were James Madison, James Monroe, Joseph Carrington Cabell, David Watson, and John H. Cocke. On May 5, 1817, Jefferson was elected Rector of the board, and, on the same day, the board authorized the purchase of a farm of about two hundred acres lying one mile west of Charlottesville as a site for the College. This tract now forms a part of the grounds of the University of Virginia. The cornerstone of Central College was laid on October 6, 1817, in the presence of Thomas Jefferson, Rector, and of James Madison and James Monroeâthe latter then President of the United States. This building, located on what is known as the West Lawn of the University, is now utilized as a professor's residence. Jefferson's plan was to erect a distinct building, a pavilion for each individual professorâbuildings to be arranged around a rectangular lawn. Each pavilion was to contain "a school room and apartments for the accommodation of the professor"; and one-story dormitories for the students were to be erected adjacent to the pavilions. Jefferson drew most of the sketches for the buildings with his own hands, basing them upon designs by Palladio; and his ideas of architectural effect and grouping were carried out in detail when Central College was merged in the University of Virginia. The prime object in Jefferson's mind, while Rector of the board of visitors of Central College, was to get the college well under way, and then have it adopted by the Legislature as the State University. Accordingly, in the first report of the visitors to the Legislature, of date January 6, 1818, it is recommended that a state university be established on the site of Central College. By an act of February 21, 1818, the Legislature authorized the appointment by the Governor of a board of twenty-four members, to be known as the "Board of Commissioners of the University." It was the duty of this board to meet on August 1, 1818, at the Tavern in Rockfish Gap, on the Blue Ridge Mountains, and report upon the following points regarding the organization of a state university: 1. A proper site for the projected university. 2. A plan for the building thereof. 3. The branches of learning which should be taught therein. 4. The number and description of professorships; and 5. Such general provisions as might properly be enacted by the Legislature for the better organizing and governing of the University. Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe were present at the meeting of the Commissioners, and their able and elaborate report to the Legislature (indicating much careful thought) had probably been prepared by Jefferson before the meeting was held. This report, recommending, among other things, the site of Central College as the most advantageous one for the University, was forwarded in duplicate to the Speaker of the House and the Speaker of the Senate on August 4, 1818. On January 25, 1819, the Legislature adopted a formal act "for establishing an University," and this date must be reckoned as the year of the origin of the University, although the institution was not opened to students until March 7, 1825. Although Jefferson's was the dominant spirit and the shaping hand in the whole movement for the establishment of a state university, it should be stated that but for the influence and efforts of Joseph Carrington Cabell, the close personal friend of Jefferson, the acts of February 21, 1818, and January 25, 1819, would probably have failed of adoption by the Legislature. The act of January 25, 1819, establishing the University, is as follows: "1. Be it declared by the General Assembly of Virginia, That the conveyance of the lands and other property appertaining to the Central College in the County of Albemarle, which has been executed by the proctor thereof, under authority of the subscribers and founders, to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund, is hereby accepted, for the use and on the conditions in the said deed of conveyance expressed. "2. And be it enacted, That there shall be established, on the site provided for the said college, an University, to be called The University of Virginia; that it shall be under the government of seven visitors to be appointed forthwith by the Governor, with the advice of Council, notifying thereof the persons so appointed, and prescribing to them a day for their first meeting at the said University, with supplementary instructions for procuring a meeting subsequently, in the event of failure at the time first appointed. "3. The said visitors, or so many of them as, being a majority, shall attend, shall appoint a rector, of their own body, to preside at their meetings, and a secretary to record, attest, and preserve their proceedings, and shall proceed to examine into the state of the property conveyed as aforesaid; shall make an inventory of the same, specifying the items whereof it consists; shall notice the buildings and other improvements already made, and those which are in progress; shall take measures for their completion, and for the addition of such others, from time to time as may be necessary. "4. In the said University shall be taught the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages; French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Anglo-Saxon; the different branches of Mathematics, pure and physical; natural philosophy; the principles of agriculture; chemistry; mineralogy, including geology; botany; zoÃ¶logy; anatomy, medicine; civil government; political economy; the law of mature and nations; municipal law; history; ideology; general grammar; ethics; rhetorick; and belles lettres; which branches of science shall be so distributed, and under so many professors, not exceeding ten, as the visitors shall think proper and expedient. "5. Each professor shall be allowed the use of the apartments and accommodations provided for him, and those first employed such standing salary as the visitors shall think proper and sufficient, and their successors such standing salary, not exceeding one thousand dollars, as the visitors shall think proper and sufficient, with such tuition fees from each student, as the visitors shall from time to time establish. "6. The said visitors shall be charged with the erection, preservation, and repair of the buildings, the care of the grounds and appurtenances, and of the interests of the University generally; they shall have power to appoint a bursar, employ a proctor, and all other necessary agents; to appoint and remove professors, two-thirds of the whole number of visitors voting for the removal; to prescribe their duties and the course of education, in conformity with the law; to establish rules for the government and discipline of the students, not contrary to the laws of the land; to regulate tuition fees, and the rent of the dormitories occupied; to prescribe and control the duties and proceedings of all officers, servants, and others, with respect to the buildings, lands, appurtenances, and other property, and interests of the University; to draw from the literary funds such monies as are by law charged on it for this institution; and, in general, to direct and do all matters and things which, not being inconsistent with the laws of the land, to them shall seem most expedient for promoting the purposes of said institution; which several functions they shall be free to exercise in the form of by-laws, rules, resolutions, orders, instructions, or otherwise, as they shall deem proper. "7. They shall have two stated meetings in every year, to-wit, on the first Mondays of April and October; and occasional meetings at such other times as they shall appoint, or on a special call, with such notice as themselves shall prescribe by a general rule; which meetings shall be at the University; a majority of them constituting a quorum for business, and on the death, resignation of a member, or failure to act for the space of one year, or on his removal out of the Commonwealth, or by the Governor, with the advice of Council, the Governor with like advice shall appoint a successor. "8. The said rector and visitors shall be a body corporate, under the style and title of `The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia,' with the right, as such, to use a common seal; they shall have capacity to plead and be impleaded in all courts of justice, and in all cases interesting to the University, which may be subjects of legal cognizance and jurisdiction; which pleas shall not abate by the determination of their office, but shall stand revived in the name of their successors; and they shall be capable in law, and in trust for the University, of receiving subscriptions and donations, real and personal, as well as from bodies corporate or persons associated, as from private individuals. "9. And the said rector and visitors shall, at all times, conform to such laws as the legislature may, from time to time, think proper to enact for their government; and the said University shall in all things, and at all times, be subject to the control of the legislature. And the said rector and visitors of the University of Virginia shall be, and they are hereby required to make report annually to the president and directors of the literary fund (to be laid before the legislature at the next succeeding session), embracing a full account of the disbursements, the funds on hand, and a general statement of the condition of said University. "10. The said board of visitors, or a majority thereof, by nomination of the board, shall, once in every year at least, visit the said University; enquire into the proceedings and practices thereat; examine the progress of the students, and give to those who excel in every branch of science, there taught, such honorary marks and testimonies of approbation as may encourage and incite to industry and emulation. "11. On every twenty-ninth of February, or, if that be Sunday, then on the next, or earliest day thereafter on which a meeting can be effected, the Governor and Council shall be in session, and shall appoint visitors of the said University, either the same or others at their discretion, to serve until the twenty-ninth day of February next ensuing, duly and timely notifying to them their appointment, and prescribing a day for their first meeting at the University; after which, their meetings, stated and occasional, shall be as hereinbefore provided: Provided, that nothing in this act contained shall suspend the proceedings of the visitors of the said Central College of Albemarle; but for the purpose of expediting any objects of said institution, they shall be authorized, under the control of the Governor and Council, to continue the exercise of their functions, and fulfil those of their successors, until the first actual meeting of their said successors. "12. And be it further enacted, That the additional sum of twenty thousand dollars shall be, and the same is hereby, appropriated to the education of the poor, out of the revenue of the literary fund, in the aid of the sum heretofore appropriated to that object, and to be paid in the same manner and upon the same conditions in all respects as is prescribed by the fourth section of the act, entitled `An act appropriating part of the revenue of the literary fund, and for other purposes, passed the twenty-first day of February, eighteen hundred and eighteen.' "13. This act shall commence and be in force from and after the passing thereof." (Revised Code, 1819, ch. 34, p. 90.) The first Board of Visitors consisted of four members of the old board of Central College,ânamely, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Joseph Carrington Cabell, and John H. Cocke; the additional appointees were James Breckenridge, Chapman Johnson, and Robert Taylor. The board met for the first time on March 29, 1819, and elected Thomas Jefferson Rector. Henceforth, until his death in 1826, Jefferson was the dominating and directing power of the University, not only evolving the entire system of education introduced, but actually devising, to the minutest detail, every feature of construction and administration. GOVERNMENT AND ORGANIZATION. The organization of the University, its government, discipline, and methods of instruction, were virtually prescribed by Jefferson alone; and in many respects they still retain the impression derived from him. By virtue of its charter, the supreme government of the institution, under the General Assembly, is invested in the Rector and Visitors. Under the general direction of this board, and subject to its regulations, the affairs of the University were administered, for the first eighty years of its existence, by the Faculty and its Chairman, the latter being a member of the Faculty, who occupied temporarily the position of chief executive officer of the institution. As the University grew, it became more and more difficult for a member of the teaching staff to fill the position of chairman, and attend to the manifold executive duties attached to that office. In October, 1903, the Visitors decided that modern conditions rendered necessary the creation of the office of president; and in June, 1904, Dr. Edwin Anderson Alderman was elected first president of the University of Virginia. The scheme of instruction organized by Jefferson contemplated no fixed uniform curriculum of studies to be pursued by every student alike, without discrimination. Each distinct branch of knowledge was, as far as was practicable, assigned to an individual "School" with its own instructors; and the University was to consist of a collection of independent Schools. The origin of the elective system at the University of Virginia is found in the fact that students were permitted to matriculate in any School or Schools of the University for which they were prepared. The original organization consisted of eight independent Schools,â namely, Ancient Languages, Modern Languages, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Moral Philosophy, Chemistry, Medicine, and Law. The first seven Schools mentioned were opened to matriculates on March 7, 1825,â with an aggregate attendance, during the first session, of 123 students. The School of Law was not opened until 1826. This original organization was, of course, gradually enlarged and modified. As early as 1837 the School of Medicine was elevated to a Department, consisting of three individual Schools; while in 1850 the School of Law was enlarged to a Department consisting of two Schools. Other Departments and Schools have been added from time to time, until the University organization arrived at its present condition, as described elsewhere in this catalogue. It was provided by the first Board of Visitors, in accordance with Jefferson's wishes, that but two degrees should be conferred by the University. The lower degree, characteristic of the institution for many years, was conferred upon a student who had completed all the work offered in any one School; to such a candidate the untitled degree of "Graduate" in the School in question should be given. The other, the higher degree, was to be the Doctor's degree, and was to be given to the graduate in two or more Schools who had, in addition, exhibited welldeveloped powers of research. There is abundant evidence that, in planning the organization of the University of Virginia, Jefferson had in mind the so-called continental type of university. The first faculty were, however, with one or two exceptions, Oxford or Cambridge men. Naturally they had in mind the English type of university: the result of which was that they soon substituted (in 1831), for the Doctor's degree proposed by Jefferson, the Master's degree, common in England. The degree of "Master of Arts of the University of Virginia" was accordingly, for more than half a century, the leading degree conferred by this institution. As at present organized, the University comprises twenty-five distinct and independent Schools. The courses of instruction given in these are so coÃ¶rdinated as to form six Departments, two of which are academic, and four professional (or technical). The Academic Departments are The College: with the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The Department of Graduate Studies: with the degrees of Graduate in the School; Master of Arts; and Doctor of Philosophy. The Professional Departments are The Department of Law: with the degree of Bachelor of Law. The Department of Medicine: with the degree of Doctor of Medicine. The Department of Engineering: with the degrees of Civil Engineer; Mechanical Engineer; Electrical Engineer; and Mining Engineer. The Department of Agriculture: with the degree of Bachelor of Science. THE CORPORATION OF THE UNIVERSITY. Legal Title: "THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA."

      <field name="fulltext">PART II. ANNOUNCEMENTS AND REGULATIONS: EXPENSES: SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS. ANNOUNCEMENTS. Charlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The Sanitary Arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about six hundred and fifty feet above the sea level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete; there are two athletic fields; the Fayerweather Gymnasium affords ample facilities for bathing and exercise; and in all ordinary cases of illness students receive treatment from the members of the Faculty of Medicine, with skillful nursing, when necessary, in a well equipped hospital. Equipment.âThe equipment possessed by the University for the work of instruction, alike in the Academic and in the Professional departments, has been much augmented in recent years, and is now excellent in quality, as well as extensive. In scientific studies large facilities are offered by the Leander McCormick Observatory, the Rouss Physical Laboratory, the Chemical Laboratory and the Museum of Industrial Chemistry, the Lewis Brooks Museum, the Biological Laboratory, the Anatomical Laboratory, the Pathological Laboratory, Physiological Laboratory, and the Hospital and Dispensary. The Engineering Department possesses a well equipped Mechanical Laboratory and Machine Shop. In addition to the Law and other Departmental Libraries the general University Library is common to all Departments. Originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, it has since been much enlarged by purchases and donations, and contains at present upwards of sixty thousand volumes. These have been arranged and classified by the Dewey system, and are catalogued. Students are allowed the use of the books under the usual restrictions, and the Librarian is present in the Library for eight hours daily to attend to their wants. The Courses of Instruction are comprised in six Departments, two of which are Academic, and four professional. The former include the College and the Department of Graduate Studies: the latter the Departments of Law, Medicine, Engineering, and Agriculture. In the various departments there are altogether twenty-five distinct Schools, each affording an independent course, under the direction of professors who are responsible for the systems and methods pursued. The Summer School of the University of Virginia, under the management of the President and Faculty of the the University of Virginia, begins June 19th, and continues six weeks, to July 31st. Instruction will be given in the following subjects: English Grammar, Rhetoric and Composition, English Literature, American Literature, Ancient History, Medieval and Modern History, American History and Government, Algebra, Plane Geometry, Solid Geometry, Nature Study, Botany, ZoÃ¶logy, Physical Geography, Physics, Chemistry, Agriculture, Manual Training, First year Latin, CÃ¦sar, Cicero, Vergil, Sallust, Plautus, First year German, Second year German, First year French, Second year French, School Administration, Methods of teaching, Psychology, and Logic. For further information address the Director of Summer School, University of Virginia. Elective System.âThe system of independent Schools assumes that opportunities for study and instruction are privileges to be sought voluntarily and eagerly. Students are therefore allowed to elect for themselves the courses of study to which they are led by their individual tastes and proposed pursuits in life, as far as the time appointed for lectures and examinations permits. Nor is it alone to those who wish to make special attainments in single departments of knowledge that this freedom of election commends itself. It has decided advantages also for most of those students who seek the common goal of liberal education by ways which varying aptitude, varying preparation, or varying opportunities render of necessity different. The wisdom of the founder in establishing such a system has been amply vindicated in the history of this University; and in recent years many schools of higher education throughout the country have adopted methods involving this principle. The Session begins on the Thursday preceding the seventeenth of September, and continues, with a recess of ten days at Christmas, until the Wednesday before the nineteenth of June. The first three days of the session are given to registration, and all students, both old and new, are required during that time to place their names upon the books of the University and the rolls of their respective classes. Lecture courses begin upon the following Monday, and absences will be recorded against any student not present, from the opening lecture of each course. Students entering after the first three days will be charged a fee for registration. Admission.âThe age of the candidate for admission must be at least sixteen years. A certificate of honorable discharge from the school last attended by him, or other evidence of general good conduct, must be presented by each applicant. Those who satisfy these requirements will be admitted to the University of Virginia by the diploma of a recognized institution of learning, the certificate of an accredited school, or by written examination. Further information concerning Entrance Examinations and admission to advanced standing will be found upon pp. 78-89. Students who are more than twenty years of age are admitted without examination to pursue approved special courses of study under conditions stated on page 83. Conduct.âThe laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or not. They require from the student regular and diligent application to his studies, and if, in the opinion of the Faculty, any student be not fulfilling the purposes for which he ought to have come to the University, and be not likely to fulfill them, either from habitual delinquency in any of his classes, or from habitual idleness, or from any other bad habit, the President, upon recommendation of the Faculty, may require him to withdraw from the University, after informing him of the objections to his conduct and affording him an opportunity of explanation and defense. The regulations of the University concerning attendance upon lectures and examinations, absences, withdrawal, etc., will be found upon pages 92-93. Religious Worship.âMorality and religion are recognized as the foundation and indispensable concomitants of education. The discipline of the University is sedulously administered with a view to confirm integrity, and to maintain a sacred regard for truth. Great efforts are made to surround the students with religious influences; but experience having proved that it is best to forbear the employment of coercion, the attendance on religious exercises is entirely voluntary. Divine service is conducted twice on Sunday in the University Chapel by clergymen invited from the principal religious denominations; and other religious exercises are directed by the Young Men's Christian Association. The Examinations in each class at this institution have, from the beginning (A. D. 1825), been held in writing. Oral examinations are held in some departments, but they are auxiliary to the written examinations, which, in conjunction with the class standing as determined by the daily work of the student, are the main tests of the student's proficiency. A special examination may be granted upon physician's certificate of sickness on the day of examination, or other cause which the Faculty of the Department in question may accept as adequate ground. See also pp. 92-93. The written examinations are, in every case, of a public character, and are conducted by a committee of three professors, one of whom is the professor whose class is examined. This committee is expected to remain in the room during examination, supervise the proceedings, determine doubts, grant special examinations in cases covered by law, and make report to the Faculty of the results of the examinations. The committee, not the professor solely, is responsible throughout. Reports.âReports are sent, at stated intervals, to the parent or guardian of each student. These reports give the number of times the student has been absent from lectures; and indicate, as nearly as is practicable, the nature of the progress made by him in his work at the University. Honor System.âFor eighteen years after the opening of the institution, honesty at the written examinations was sought to be secured by the strict surveillance of the committee alone. This was often found to be ineffectual. In June, 1842, Judge Henry St. George Tucker, Professor of Law, offered the following resolution which the Faculty at once adopted: Resolved, That in all future written examinations for distinction and other honors of the University, each candidate shall attach to the written answers presented by him on such examination a certificate in the following words: "I, A. B., do hereby certify on honor that I have derived no assistance during the time of this examination from any source whatever, whether oral, written, or in print, in giving the above answers." This was the beginning of the honor system at this institution. In subsequent years the pledge was extended so as to preclude the giving as well as the receiving of assistance. The system has been in operation since 1842 without interruption. Its wisdom and its beneficial results have been abundantly demonstrated. Its administration imposes no burden upon the Faculty. Experience shows that the students themselves are its sternest guardians and executors. Violation of examination pledges has been of rare occurrence. In every case the culprit has been quietly but promptly eliminated without need of Faculty action. The spirit of truth and honor, thus fostered in the examinationroom, has gradually pervaded the entire life of the institution, and all the relations between the student and professor. It is not believed to be essential to the honor system, nor indeed to be right, to expose the examinee to unnecessary temptation to violate his pledge. The student is regarded as one to be shielded from such influences and to have his honorable tendencies carefully reinforced and not wrecked. Hence the examination is held in one place where all candidates are assembled, and in presence of a committee of the Faculty. Conversation among the candidates and absence from the room are discouraged. They are cautioned to avoid even the appearance of evil. These safeguards have been found to be in entire harmony with the absence of espionage. The fact that the candidate is not suspected, has been found to lead always to the avoidance of conduct which would give rise to suspicion. Degrees are conferred only upon examination after residence. Certificates are conferred on the satisfactory completion of B. A. courses in the Academic Schools, and the student who completes both the B. A. and M. A. courses in any School is entitled to a diploma of graduation in the M. A. course in that School. In each School, major and minor courses are offered candidates for the Ph. D. degree. Each major course requires at least two years of work after the completion of the corresponding M. A. course. Any student completing successfully a major course in a school (with or without thesis) is entitled to a diploma of graduation in the School. The titled degrees conferred are Bachelor of Arts, p. 107; Master of Arts, p. 117; Doctor of Philosophy, p. 118; Civil Engineer, Mining Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, pp. 189-195; Bachelor of Science, p. 205; Doctor of Medicine, p. 177; and Bachelor of Laws, p. 170. The requirements for these degrees are given under the several departments. No merely honorary degree is ever given by the University of Virginia. Licentiates.âAny person of unexceptionable character and habits, upon producing to the Faculty satisfactory evidence of suitable capacity and attainments, may be licensed by the Faculty to form classes for private instruction in any School of the University, in aid of and in conformity to the public teachings of the professor upon any subject taught therein. The employment and compensation of any such Licentiate are matters of private agreement between him and the student. Students whose preparation is defective for the work of the University classes may often economize time and energy by securing the services of a Licentiate at the same time that they are attending the regular course of lectures. Directions for New Students.âNew students will find it greatly to their advantage if, as soon as possible after reporting to the Dean of the University, they will go to Madison Hall, where a committee of students will be found who will gladly be of any service in assisting them to get settled as quickly as possible. A general information bureau, a complete list of boarding houses with prices of board, a directory of the students with their addresses, a list of all forms of employment open to students, copies of the University Handbook, and other things of interest to the new men will there be accessible to all. The General Secretary of the Association, Dr. Hugh M. McIlhaney, Jr., will be pleased to correspond with prospective students during the summer with regard to all such matters, and it is suggested that every man who expects to enter the University inform him of that fact. See p. 218. ADMISSION AND CLASSIFICATION. ADMISSION TO THE COLLEGE. All candidates for admission to the University of Virginia are required to present satisfactory certificates of honorable dismissal from the institution last attended, or of good moral character. With the exception of Special Students over twenty years of age, as hereinafter defined, all applicants for admission to the University of Virginia are required to present a diploma of graduation or a certificate from a recognized institution of learning of collegiate rank, or a certificate from an accredited school, or to stand a written examination.

In addition, the candidate may be required to answer questions involving the essentials of English grammar, and questions on the leading facts in those periods of English literary history to which the prescribed works belong. The books set for this part of the examination will be: 1909, 1910, 1911: Shakespeare's Macbeth; Milton's Lycidas, Comus, L'Allegro, and Il Penseroso; Burke's Speech on Conciliation with America, or Washington's Farewell Address and Webster's First Bunker Hill Oration; Macaulay's Life of Johnson, or Carlyle's Essay on Burns. Other courses equivalent, in character and scope, to these may be offered in their stead. [The systematic study of the Authorized Version of the Bible is particularly recommended as an acceptable substitute.] 2. Mathematics.âThe requirements imply a thorough knowledge of Arithmetic, and in addition of either (a) Algebra through Quadratics, or of (b) Algebra to Quadratics and three books of Plane Geometry. A thorough practical acquaintance with ordinary Arithmetic is assumed as underlying all preparation in Mathematics. The requirements in Algebra to Quadratics include the following subjects: the four fundamental operations for rational algebraic expressions, factoring, highest common factor, lowest common multiple, complex fractions, the solution of equations of the first degree containing one or more unknown quantities, and of problems depending upon such equations; radicals, including the extraction of the square root of polynomials and of numbers, and fractional and negative exponents. The requirements in Algebra through Quadratics include the preceding, together with: quadratic equations, equations involving one or more unknown quantities that can be solved by the method of quadratic equations, and problems depending upon such equations. The requirements in Plane Geometry include the subjects usually treated in the first three Books; viz., the properties of the triangle and the parallelogram, loci of points, the circle and the measurement of angles; simple original exercises in construction and demonstration. 3. Latin.âThe requirements for the General Entrance Examination presuppose about four years of competent instruction in Latin, involving the Roman pronunciation, habitual observance of quantity and accent, regular drill in grammar and prose composition through all preparatory years, elementary Reader, Nepos, CÃ¦sar, and the easier orations of Cicero. 4. Greek.âThe requirements for the General Entrance Examination in Greek will be satisfied by a good knowledge of the paradigms and the main rules of syntax, and of four books of Xenophon's Anabasis. Any good elementary grammar may be used, or any good beginner's book, such as White's, Ball's, or Gleason and Atherton's, containing the inflections; and any edition of the Anabasis. 5. German.âThe General Entrance Examination in German presupposes not less than one year's preparation: it includes Translation: MÃ¼ller and Wenckebach's GlÃ¼ck Auf; GerstÃ¤cker's Irrfahrten or Germelshausen; Heyse's Das MÃ¤dchen von Treppi; Zschokke's Das Wirtshaus zu Cransac. Grammar: A general knowledge of the declensions of nouns, pronouns, and adjectives; of the conjugation of weak, strong, and irregular verbs and the modal auxiliaries; of the rules of German syntax, with especial attention to the arrangement of sentence-elements, is necessary. Prose composition: Translation of English sentences into German. The work required in grammar and prose composition is such as will be found in any elementary German grammar, such as Whitney's, Thomas's, Joynes-Meissner's, Bierwirth's Elements of German. Instructors in preparatory schools are urged to devote at least one hour a week to pronunciation and conversation, as a large part of the work in the German classes of the University is oral and requires some knowledge of spoken German. 6. French.âThe requirements of the General Entrance Examination in French presupposes a knowledge of Elementary Grammar âforms, pronunciation, composition; and the translation of La M&amp;eacute;re Michel et Son Chat (Bedolli&amp;egrave;re), Colomba (M&amp;eacute;rim&amp;eacute;e), La Poudre aux Yeux (Labiche et Martin). 7. Spanish.âThe General Entrance requirements in Spanish will be satisfied by a knowledge of the elements of the grammar, including forms, pronunciation, and composition; and of representative selections from the literature. 8. United States History.âThe General Entrance requirements in United States History imply a good knowledge of this subject as treated in any of the text-books used in the public high schools of Virginia; such as those by Bruce, Fisher, Hansell, Larned, and White. 9. Physical Geography.âThe General Entrance requirements in Physical Geography will be satisfied by a competent knowledge of the subject as it is made known in Maury's Physical Geography, or in any other work of equal grade and scope. 10. Algebra (Quadratics and beyond).âThe requirements in this subject include a knowledge of simultaneous quadratics, and equations solved like quadratics; properties of quadratic equations; the binomial theorem for positive integral exponents; ratio and proportion; inequalities; variations; arithmetical and geometrical progression, and simple problems in permutations and combinations. 11. Geometry and Plane Trigonometry.âThe requirements in geometry include a knowledge of the usual constructions, theorems, and problems given in an ordinary text-book on Plane Geometry, together with a knowledge of the relations of planes and lines in space; the properties and measure of prisms, pyramids, cones, and cylinders; and the sphere and spherical triangles. In Plane Trigonometry the requirements include the definition of the six trigonometric functions as ratios, the relations between these functions, values of these functions for angles of 0Â°, 30Â°, 45Â°, 60Â°, 90Â°, 120Â°, etc.; formulas for sine, cosine, or tangent of sum or difference of two angles, formulas for sum or difference of two sines or cosines, expressions for the functions of double or half angles, trigonometric identities and equations, and the solution of triangles. 12. Astronomy.âThe requirements in this subject will be satisfied by a good knowledge of the elements of General Astronomy, involving as a basis the ordinary high school mathematics, such as may be obtained from a careful study of such text-books as Todd's New Astronomy, Young's Elements, or Comstock's Text-book. 13. Physics.âThe requirements will be met by a good elementary knowledge of the subjects of Mechanics, Hydrostatics and Hydrokinetics, Sound, and Light; as treated, for example, in the first volume of Carhart's University Physics. 14. Chemistry.âThe requirements in this subject imply a thorough elementary knowledge of Chemistry as a part of a general education such as is represented by the intelligent study of such text-books as are mentioned in a subsequent portion of this catalogue. 15. Botany.âThe requirements in this subject imply a thorough knowledge of the elements of Botany, including the practical study of the structure and development of representatives alike of the flowering and the flowerless plants: students offering Botany as an elective are required to submit the notes and drawings of the laboratory work done by them. Examinations for Classification.âNeither of the General Entrance Examinations (Nos. 2a or 2b, 10 or 11) in Mathematics, if passed singly, will admit the applicant to the first or lowest course in that subject. For admission to the School of Mathematics he must pass upon Algebra through Quadratics (No. 2a) and the whole of Plane Geometry. For admission to the School of Physics the applicant must pass the same examination for classification as that required for the School of Mathematics. For admission to the School of Historical and Economical Science the applicant must pass an examination for classification which covers the first three hundred and eighty-six pages of West's Ancient History: the examination for classification may be waived if the applicant (a) is twenty years of age at the beginning of the academic year; or (b) has already passed in at least two full courses in other subjects at this University; or (c) can convince the Professor by a certificate from a reputable school or college that his historical knowledge and mental discipline are adequate. Applicants for admission to the first course in Latin must pass the General Entrance Examination in that subject. Students who enter upon certificates must in each instance satisfy the professors whose classes they desire to enter of their fitness to enter upon the work of the course proposed. Conditional Admission.âAny applicant who succeeds in at least two of his entrance examinations, but fails in one or both of the others, may be allowed to enter on condition that he pass successfully the remaining examinations on such date as the Faculty shall appoint. Division of the Entrance Examination.âEach applicant for admission to the University will be permitted to take the entrance examinations either in June or in September, or part in June and part in September, as he may elect at the time of his application. A pass certificate upon any subject will be valid for the ensuing session or for the beginning of the following session, but no longer. Delayed Entrance.âAll applicants for admission to the University are required to pass the entrance examinations at one or the other of the appointed periods except for good and reasonable cause. In cases where the application has not been deferred upon merely frivolous grounds the applicant may, for reasons that are approved by the President of the University, be admitted to a special examination, for which a fee of five dollars will be charged. This fee is payable in advance, and will in no case be returned to the applicant. Special Students.âApplicants for matriculation who are more than twenty years of age, and who desire to enter for the pursuit of special studies, may, with the approval of the Dean of the University, and upon evidence of needful maturity and training, with adequate preparation for the courses to be pursued, be registered as Special Students, and admitted without formal examination to the privileges of the University, but not as candidates for any titled degree: such Special Students must pass the required examinations for classification before entering upon the work of any School for which such an examination is prerequisite. Entrance upon Certificates from Accredited Schools.âApplicants for admission who present diplomas or certificates showing that they have completed the work of any Public High School of the State of Virginia whose course is in accordance with the published requirements of the State Board of Education will not be required to stand the General Entrance Examination. The same privilege is extended to applicants coming from approved Public High Schools of other States or from approved Private Schools of any State; provided, in each case, that the work done in the school in question is fully the equivalent of, or of higher grade than that defined above: of schools outside of Virginia, the Dean of the University is authorized to recognize as accredited those, and those only, which present satisfactory proof that they are on the accredited list of their own State University or of some institution of higher instruction maintaining standards of admission not inferior to the minimum of the Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of the Southern States. The following is a list of the schools within the State of Virginia at present accredited by the University, duly attested certificates from which will entitle the holder to admission without examination: Amherst High School, Amherst, Va. Augusta Military Academy, Fort Defiance, Va. Bedford City High School, Bedford City, Va. Bellevue High School, Bellevue, Va. Berryville High School, Berryville, Va.

Each person entering upon a certificate may be required to stand examinations for classification in the courses which he expects to pursue, or may be exempted therefrom in any instance at the discretion of the professor concerned, his decision in each case being based upon his personal knowledge of the work done in the subject in question in the school from which the applicant enters. Applicants seeking such exemption from examination for classification are required in each instance to bring a certificate from the instructor under whom the work was done, stating fully the extent and character of the work and the standing of the applicant in his classes. Entrance from other Colleges.âApplicants for admission coming to the University from recognized institutions of collegiate rank, whose requirements for admission are equal to or greater than those prescribed by the Southern Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools, will, on presentation of certificates showing that they are members in good standing of such institutions, be exempted from the General Entrance Examinations and also from examinations for classification under the same conditions as are stated in the preceding paragraph. Advanced Standing.âApplicants from other colleges will be provisionally admitted to advanced standing as candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Arts upon presentation of satisfactory certificates covering the courses for which credit is desired. Whether a certificate is or is not satisfactory will in each instance be determined by the professor or professors in this University responsible for the study or studies in question, each case being decided upon its own merits. No candidate for the degree of Bachelor of Arts may, however, thus obtain credit for more than seven of the ten electives required for the attainment of that degree, as elsewhere stated; and in all cases the courses for which credit is obtained and those pursued here must together satisfy all the requirements for the degree as here established. The certificates presented should, in the case of each subject for which credit is desired, describe the character and scope of the course previously pursued by the applicant, stating the text-books used, the authors read (with amount of reading required) in the case of a language, or the amount and kind of laboratory work (with the notebooks of the applicant) in the case of a science; and the standing of the applicant in his class, with the marks received. ADMISSION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. While Special Students, and College Students desirous of pursuing advanced courses in particular subjects, will be admitted to graduate courses after having in each instance satisfied all the conditions prerequisite, only those are admitted to this Department of the University who hold baccalaureate degrees from recognized institutions of learning of collegiate rank; or, in the case of any institution of such rank that does not confer a baccalaureate degree, on the presentation of a certificate of graduation in a course of study accepted by the Committee upon Academic Degrees as fully equivalent to that ordinarily required for the degree in question. ADMISSION TO THE PROFESSIONAL DEPARTMENTS. To the Department of Law.âApplicants for admission to the first year of the Course in Law are required either to present the diploma of an institution of collegiate rank, a certificate of good standing in the classes of such an institution, a diploma of graduation from a good high school, either public or private, or an equivalent personal certificate from the principal of such a school; or to pass the General Entrance Examination described on a previous page. No provision is made for admission to advanced standing in this Department of the University. To the Department of Medicine.âApplicants for admission to the work of the first year of the Course in Medicine are required to present the diploma of a recognized institution of collegiate rank, a certificate of good standing in such an institution, the diploma of a recognized public or private high school having at least a three years course, or acceptable certificates which represent work equivalent in amount and character to such a high school course as defined by the Virginia State Board of Public Instruction (see below); and, in addition, to complete the college courses at this University in Physics, Inorganic Chemistry, and Biology; or to present acceptable college certificates showing that they have completed elsewhere courses in these subjects equivalent to (though not necessarily identical with) those at this institution, the validity of such certificates being decided by the professors here in charge of the classes in these subjects. The curriculum of a three-year high school as prescribed by the Virginia State Board of Public Instruction is as follows: FIRST YEAR. Mathematicsâ5 periods a week. Advanced Arithmetic, Elementary Algebra to Quadratics. Scienceâ3 periods a week. Physical Geography. Lessons in Botany. Historyâ3 periods a week.

The above curriculum contains 65 "counts," a count being one period per week for a school year. Of these subjects the applicant for admission to the Medical Department must have completed the entire course of three years in Mathematics and English, two years in language other than English, two years in History, and one year in scienceâ49 counts in all. The remaining 16 counts may be furnished at the option of the applicant by further credits in the various branches of the curriculum. Applicants unable to satisfy these requirements by acceptable certificates, in part or in whole, may remove their deficiencies by satisfactory examinations. To the Department of Engineering.âApplicants will be admitted to the first year of the Course in Engineering, either on the presentation of the diploma of a recognized institution of collegiate rank, of a certificate of good standing in the classes of such an institution, of a corresponding diploma or certificate of a recognized school of engineering, or the diploma of graduation of a good high school, either public or private, or of an equivalent personal certificate from the principal of such a school; or on passing the General Entrance Examination described on a preceding page. Applicants for admission to this Department who stand this examination are advised to offer, as their two electives, Advanced Algebra (10) and Geometry and Trigonometry (11). Advanced Standing.âApplicants will be provisionally admitted to advanced standing as candidates for degrees in Engineering upon presentation of certificates from recognized institutions of learning covering the courses for which credit is desired. Whether a certificate is or is not satisfactory will in each instance be determined by the professor or professors in this University responsible for the study or studies in question, each case being decided upon its own merits: provided, that a degree in Engineering will in no case be conferred upon any candidate who has not attended at least one full session at this University. To the Department of Agriculture.âApplicants will be admitted to the course leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science upon presentation of a diploma or a certificate from a recognized institution of collegiate rank, or a good public or private high school; or on passing the General Entrance Examinations. Students so admitted will for the present be registered as College Students, and will be under the jurisdiction of the Dean and Faculty of that Department. REGISTRATION Registration of New Students.âApplicants seeking admission to the University for the first time are required to present themselves to the Dean of the University at his office in the Administration Building at some time during the first three days of the session. Each candidate for admission must be at least sixteen years of age. In each instance a certificate of good moral character must be presented, signed by the proper official of the institution attended during the previous session, or by some person of known standing. Each candidate who satisfies these requirements, and also those for admission by diploma, certificate, or examination previously stated, will be directed to the Dean of the Department which he purposes to enter. The Dean in question will, upon being satisfied that the candidate is fitted to enter upon the work of the Department, issue to him a card containing the names of the courses which the candidate proposes to pursue during the session: this card must be presented in turn to each professor concerned, who will, on satisfying himself that the applicant is prepared to pursue the course in question with profit, sign the card and enter the applicant's name upon the roll of the class. The card must then be returned to the Dean of the University, who will endorse upon it the amount of fees to be paid to the Proctor. On payment of these fees the registration (for the session) of the applicant as a student of the University will be completed. Registration of Matriculated Students.âStudents who have already been matriculated as members of the University are required to present themselves directly to the Dean of their respective Departments upon one of the first three days of the session, and to conform, as regards their registration in their respective classes, and the payment of fees, to the requirements stated in the preceding paragraph. Delayed Registration.âStudents are not permitted to delay their registration through carelessness or for inadequate reasons. Any student, new or old, who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session will (except in the case of an applicant admitted to special examinations, as provided in a previous paragraph) be admitted to registration only upon the consent of the President, and will be charged a special registration fee of three dollars. RESIDENCE. The Academic Year extends from the morning of the Thursday preceding the seventeenth of September to the evening of the Wednesday before the nineteenth of June. Thanksgiving Day is a holiday, and there is a Christmas recess beginning on the morning of the twenty-fourth of December and closing on the evening of the second of January. Attendance is required of each student throughout the entire session, with the exception of the days above indicated, unless he has received permission to be temporarily absent, or to withdraw before its close. Leave of absence is granted by the Deans for sufficient reasons, and must in every case be obtained in advance. Voluntary withdrawal requires the written consent of the student's professors and of the Dean of the University. While in residence each student is required to attend regularly all lectures and other prescribed exercises and all examinations in the courses which he pursues (unless excused for cause) and in every way to conform to the regulations of the University. Students may reside in the University dormitories, in private houses approved by the President, or in their homes. Any change of residence during the session should be reported at the office of the Registrar. Physical Culture.âNo student is permitted to undertake an amount of work greater than he may reasonably be expected to do well without detriment to his physical health: and every student is advised to take a due amount of daily outdoor exercise, for which ample opportunities are afforded upon the athletic fields, the tennis courts, the golf course, and in other forms; and, in addition, to make systematic use of the facilities afforded without cost for definite and judicious physical training at the Fayerweather Gymnasium, under the advice and instruction of the Director and his assistants. Further information upon this important subject will be found upon a subsequent page. Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the member of the Faculty of Medicine for the time detailed as University Physician; and, if necessary, to skillful nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for his maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, chronic cases, or to constitutional disorders of long standing from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Students who take the responsibility of boarding at houses not approved by the Board of Health forfeit the right to this exemption. Students residing at their own homes, who waive this right, are entitled to the remission of a portion of the University fee. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the University Physician for the time being will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. GENERAL REGULATIONS. Dormitory.âThe occupant of a dormitory has first right to it, and may reserve it for the next session by registration with the Bursar before the end of the current session; thereafter any vacant dormitory is assigned to the first applicant. But unless a deposit of fifteen dollars is made with the Bursar on or before September 1, the room is forfeited. No dormitory may be sublet or used for other than its proper purpose. Boarding.âStudents may board and lodge either in the University precincts or at their homes, or in houses licensed by the Faculty. It is the duty of the President to withdraw the license from any house in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Change of lodging should be reported at the Registrar's office. Change of Schools, with transfer of fees, cannot be made except by special order of the Faculty. But a student may change from one class to another of the same School with the advice and consent of the professors concerned. Absence from the University is permitted upon the written leave of the Dean of the Department in which the student is registered, obtained in every case in advance. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or musical clubs on excursions will not be granted, except to the officers and members of the organizations. Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors, but only for sickness or like providential cause. Such excuses must be rendered on the day of the first lecture attended after the absence. Unexcused absences from lectures render the student liable to be disciplined by the Faculty. In case of delayed entrance the student is regarded as having been absent from all lectures or other exercises that have been given, in the courses which he enters, since the beginning of the session. Absence from Examinations will not be excused except for sickness on the day of examination (attested by a physician's certificate) or other cause which the Faculty of the Department by special order may approve. An unexcused absence, or the presentation of an unpledged paper, is counted as a total failure in the examination in which it occurs. A student whose absence from examination is excused is admitted to the Fall Examination in the subject in question in each of the departments where such examinations are held. Where necessary, he is admitted to a special examination. Class Standing in any course is determined by the regularity of attendance of the student upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercises where included) in the course in question, and by the faithful performance of his work as indicated by his answers when questioned, by his written exercises, notebooks, the faithful performance of laboratory (or other similar) work, etc. Students are regarded by the Faculty as under the law of honor in matters affecting class standing, as in examinations. The Grade of the Student in any course, either for a term or for the session, is determined by the combined class standing and the result of examination, each being considered in such proportion as the professor in charge may decide for the course in question. Probation.âAny student in the College or the Department of Engineering whose term grade is below forty per cent. at either the December or the March examination in each of two subjects will be put upon probation until the following examination: a like failure at that time will make it necessary for him to withdraw from the University. Any student whose term grade is below forty per cent. in all courses at any examination will be required to withdraw from the University. A student in any Department of the University who is evidently making no real progress in one of his courses of study may at any time, after due admonition, be required to drop the course in question. A student in the College or the Department of Engineering who falls under this rule will be put upon probation if he fails to attain a grade of forty per cent. in a single one of his remaining courses at a succeeding examination. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the student's professors and of the Dean of the University. When a permit is granted upon the University Physician's certificate that withdrawal is necessary on account of the student's ill-health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct, the fees are returned pro rata. Under no other circumstances will there be a return of fees. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the Faculty for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also "Probation" above. Conduct.âDrunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University for the residue of the current session every student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. The Keeping of Dogs by students within the University grounds is forbidden. In all cases of Discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. Prohibition of Credit.âAn act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting minor students. The license to contract debts, which the President is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity. Athletic Teams and other Student Organizations.âThe laws relating to absence from the University of members of the Athletic teams are found in the section upon Physical Culture (pp. 213-216). The same resolutions apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. EXPENSES. A student's expenses consist of the following: I. University Charges, which are the same for all students, except College and Graduate students from Virginia, as stated in a following paragraph; II. School Fees, which depend upon the course of study pursued; III. Cost of Living, board, etc. I. Under the first head are included the University fee, $40 ($10 for Virginians in Academic Departments), and the contingent deposit, $10; as well as the special Entrance Examination fee of five dollars, or the delinquent registration fee of three dollars, or a fee for reÃ¶xamination in any subject, where either of these is incurred. The University Fee goes to the fund intended to defray the general expenses of the University. Payment of this fee entitles the student, without additional charge, to the use of the Library; to the privileges of the Gymnasium, with baths, private lockers, etc., and the advice and aid of the Instructor in Physical Culture; and to free medical attendance by the members of the Medical Faculty in cases of illness, including, if needed, care and nursing in a well-equipped hospital maintained on the University grounds, under the limitations stated in a preceding paragraph. It also covers all regular examination and diploma fees. The Contingent Deposit is liable for any damage to the University property for which the student is responsible, or for violations of Library or other University rules. It is returned at the end of the session, less any charges that may have been made against it; it is, therefore, not necessarily an expense, although mentioned in this connection. From this deposit there will be deducted the sum of $2 for the support of the Chapel Services and General Religious Work of the University, unless within one month after registration the student shall request the Bursar not to deduct this contribution. It will be observed that this amount also (which is less than the average contribution made by the students who have given toward the Chapel Fund in past years) is not a necessary expense, as the support of the religious work of the University is left entirely to the option of the students and professors. This method of collection is intended merely as a substitute for the canvass formerly made, and it is the desire of the Faculty that the students will thus unite with them in sustaining the religious work of the University. II. Under the second head is comprised the charge for instruction, including the Tuition Fees proper, and in some cases, the cost of apparatus and materials consumed in laboratory work. In the Academic Departments the tuition fee for one School is $50; for two, $30 each; for three or more, $25 each; except that in Analytical Chemistry the charge for tuition and materials for one course is $50 and for apparatus about $10, and for both courses $100, and for apparatus, about $15; the charges for a graduate course in Chemistry are, tuition $50, materials about $10, apparatus about $10; the fee for Agricultural Chemistry is $15, but this course is free to students in the Schools of Chemistry, to Virginia students and to unmatriculated farmers; and in ZoÃ¶logy or Comparative Anatomy there is a laboratory fee, for materials, of $10 in the undergraduate courses and $20 in the graduate courses. The tuition fees in the Academic Departments are remitted to Virginia students, to public school teachers of the State, and to ministers of the gospel, under conditions which are stated at length at the close of this section. In the Department of Law the fee for each regular year's course, or for any six classes, is $100; more than six classes (combining first and second year's course), $115; five classes, $85; four classes, $75; three classes, $60; two classes, $45; one class, $25. The fees for students who return for a third year are considerably less. In the Department of Medicine the fee for the first year is $110; second year, $100; third year, $80; fourth year, $60. The special fees for single subjects are, Medical Chemistry, $30; Biology (including materials), $35; Anatomy (including materials), $45; Regional Anatomy (including materials), $10; Pathology, $25; Bacteriology, $35; Physiology, $30; Materia Medica, $20; Therapeutics, $10; Embryology, $10; Obstetrics (with manikin work), $20; Gynecology, $20; Surgery, $20; Practice of Medicine, $30; Clinical Diagnosis, $10; Dermatology and Diseases of the Eye and Ear, $15; Hygiene, $10; Medical Jurisprudence, $10; Clinics (collectively), $30. In the Department of Engineering the fee for Applied Mathematics is $25 for one course, $50 for two or more; for other subjects, the same as in the Academic Departmentsâexcept for students who attend the regular course of instruction for a degree in Engineering as laid down in the programme, pp. 191-195. For these students the fee for tuition is $80 for the first year, $70 for the second, $60 for the third, and $50 for the fourth. An additional charge of $60 is made for materials and instruction in Analytical Chemistry to students of Mining Engineering. The payment of the Department fee entitles the student not only to attend all the regular courses for one year, but also to take over, without additional charge, such courses of any previous year as he may have failed to complete. Virginians are entitled to a reduction of $45 a year from these charges. (Compare pp. 96-97.) In the Department of Agriculture the fees are the same as in the Academic Departments. III. Under the third head fall the expenses of living and the cost of books and stationery. A student may, either alone or with a room-mate, rent a dormitory, and take his meals with a Mess Club, or in the University Commons, which is in course of construction, or in an approved private boardinghouse; or he may take both room and board in such boarding-house, in which case he pays no room-rent or servant's hire to the University. The price of University rooms ranges, according to their desirability, from $25 to $50 for the session: the large majority rent for $30; but there are a few single rooms at $25, and a few whose price is above that of the majority. If two students occupy one room each pays half the rent; the University charge for service is $9 per session for each student, whether there be one or two in a room. The minimum cost of furnishing a room may be placed at $15, fuel and lights combined cost about $25 for the session, and washing from $1.50 upward per month. With strict economy the cost of board, fuel, lights, service, and laundry can be brought within $18 a month as an average for the session. Rooms and board may be had in private families or boarding-houses at varying prices. The cost of books and stationery varies much with the branches studied. It is probably greatest in the Department of Law, where, for the entire two years' course, it amounts to about $90. But in this department, as in that of Medicine, the books purchased form the necessary nucleus of a professional library, and their cost does not belong to transient expenses. The following table will enable the prospective student to form an approximate estimate of the cost of a year at the University. It of course makes no account of clothing and other personal expenses, or of the cost of travel. The Contingent fee is omitted, as not necessarily involving expenditure: Univ. Fee. Tuition. Books, etc. Living. Total Academics: * * The remission of the tuition fees and three-fourths of the University fee to Virginia students reduces the estimated total to $160 as a probable minimum. $40 $75 $15 to $25 $135 to $270 *$265 to $410 (for three schools) Law: $40 $100 $55 $135 to $270 $330 to $465 Medicine: $40 $88 $20 $135 to $270 $283 to $418 (average) Engineering: $40 $75 $15 to $25 $135 to $270 $265 to $400 Agriculture: $40 $75 $15 to $25 $135 to $270 $265 to $400 All tuition fees, University fees, the contingent deposits, rents of rooms in the University buildings, and charges for service in the same, are payable upon entrance. Under special conditions the President is authorized to allow credit; but these deferred payments are in all cases to be properly secured. Students from Virginia.âIn compliance with the statute (Virginia Code 1887, Ch. 68, Sec. 1554), the University offers to white male students from Virginia who are sixteen years or more of age, instruction, without charge for tuition, in all the Schools of the Academic Departments (excepting the laboratory courses in Chemistry), subject to the conditions stated below. Such students are required to pay the University fee (by the recent action of the legislature, three-fourths of the University fee is also remitted to such students) and make the usual contingent deposit. They are also required to pay the regular laboratory charges for materials, etc., in the courses of study where such charges occur. If they occupy rooms on the University grounds they are of course subject to the usual charges for rent and service. The saving to Virginia students varies from $90 to $130, according to the number of Schools elected. The Faculty are required by the law mentioned above to satisfy themselves in the case of each applicant, either by actual examinations or by a diploma or certificate from some college or preparatory school, that he has made such proficiency in each branch of study which he proposes to pursue as will enable him to avail himself of the advantages offered by the University. Examinations for admission, in accordance with the terms of this law, are, therefore, required as described in a preceding section. To be entitled to free tuition as a Virginia student it is necessary that the applicant's parents be bona fide residents of the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; if he has attained his majority it is necessary that he be a bona fide resident. A resident of the State is one who is living in it at the time the application is made and has no present intention of removing therefrom in the future. No other person can honestly avail himself of this privilege. Privileged Students.âMinisters of the gospel may attend any of the Academic Schools of the University without the payment of tuition fees. The same privilege will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet the expenses of education at the University without aid. White Male Teachers and Superintendents of the Public Schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Schools of the Academic Departments of the University without payment of fees, upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the Public Schools of the State during the year. Immediately after the Spring Examinations any of the following courses may be entered upon with profit by an applicant prepared for them: Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, German, English, English Literature and Rhetoric, History, Moral Philosophy, Mathematics, Astronomy, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Geology, and Descriptive Botany. Special courses for teachers will be offered in English and Mathematics, and perhaps in several other subjects during the approaching spring term, if the demand for them is sufficient. Applicants for admission as teachers are required to send in their names to the President of the University not later than March 5th. Lodgings can be had near the University. The only necessary expense will be for board, lights, and washing, which will together cost from $5 to $7 a week. Pecuniary Aid to Students.âEffort is now being made to provide a fund, the income of which will be applied in rendering financial assistance to deserving students. In the meantime opportunity is afforded as far as possible to those who are desirous of helping themselves by their own industry. Among positions now held by University students who are in part earning their living here are those of organist, choir leader, assistant librarian, mechanician, table waiter, clothes presser, reader, stenographer, typewriter, and clerical assistant. Among other positions that may be open are those of lecture-room or laboratory attendant, gardener, bookstore keeper, etc. Students have also from time to time found employment in Charlottesville as telegraphers, teachers, newspaper carriers, and in other ways. While it is difficult for any student to be assured of a position of the sort before he reaches the University, correspondence with reference to such employment may be had by addressing Dr. Hugh M. McIlhany, Secretary of the Committee on Student Self-Help, Madison Hall. The University Commons.âThis building is now in course of construction and is designed to provide an attractive Dining Hall with all modern conveniences and comfort, and at the same time to furnish board at such reasonable rates that students in straitened circumstances need not thereby be deprived of daily association with their more fortunate fellows. This Dining Hall will be the means of greatly reducing a student's living expenses. CoÃ¶perative Store.âDuring the session of 1905-1906, under the auspices of the CoÃ¶perative Society, a coÃ¶perative store was opened on the University grounds, with the purpose of supplying books and other student necessaries at a minimum cost. The enterprise has the sanction of the University authorities, and is under the management of a directorate composed of three members of the Faculty, the General Secretary of the Young Men's Christian Association, and four students selected from the Academic, Law, Medical, and Engineering departments. Books and other needful supplies are sold to members as nearly as possible at first costâ a small percentage being added to pay operating expenses. Membership in the Society is open to all students on payment of a fee of one dollar. Sales are made for cash only, and in no case is credit extended. The latter feature should especially commend itself to parents and guardians, as the purchasing of supplies on credit is one of the evils which it is the design of the CoÃ¶perative Society to eliminate from student life. SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS. GENERAL SCHOLARSHIPS. The following regulations with regard to the General Scholarships offered by the University have been adopted by the Board of Visitors: The Faculty is authorized to prepare a list of such schools and colleges tributary to the University as by the regularity of their patronage, or the success of their graduates, may deserve special recognition. To each one of these Schools, the Faculty is authorized to award a scholarship in the College, or the Department of Graduate Studies, to be known as the University of Virginia Scholarship in â School or College. The scholarship shall entitle the holder, who must be a graduate of his institution of the preceding session, to the remission of all tuition and University fees, if he be a Virginian; and if he be not a Virginian, to the remission of all tuition fees, and one-half of the University fee. The contingent fee must be deposited in either case. This list of Schools and Colleges may be extended from time to time and further scholarships assigned as above. In accordance with this regulation, the Faculty has selected the following institutions for such recognition, and pending the consideration of other institutions, invites application for enrollment in this list from such schools as fall within the conditions prescribed above: Atlanta University School, Atlanta, Ga.

William and Mary College, Williamsburg, Va. All other regulations for scholarships for private schools and colleges in Virginia, and schools outside the State, are hereby abrogated. VIRGINIA PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL SCHOLARSHIPS. The University offers to accredited Public High Schools of Virginia, one scholarship each, in either the College, or the Department of Graduate Studies, on the conditions prescribed below. This scholarship, for one session (that following the incumbent's graduation from the High School), when awarded by the designated High School to a white male graduate, who has pursued and completed with credit the High School course, and who is endorsed by the principal of the High School in question as to both preparation and character, shall entitle the holder to a remission of all fees payable to the University. The holders of these scholarships are required to deposit the contingent fee. Any school accepting this scholarship shall make due announcement of it both to the scholars of the school and through the local papers; and at the end of the session shall, during the graduating exercises and through the public press, announce the award; and these appointments shall be duly certified to the Dean of the University. This list of Virginia Public High Schools may be extended from time to time and further scholarships assigned as above. In accordance with this regulation of the Board of Visitors, the Faculty has selected the following institutions for such recognition, and, pending the consideration of other institutions, invites applications for enrollment in this list from such schools as fall within the conditions prescribed above: Amherst High School, Amherst, Va. Bedford City High School, Bedford City, Va. Bellevue High School, Bellevue, Va. Berryville High School, Berryville, Va. Big Stone Gap High School, Big Stone Gap, Va.

Staunton High School, Staunton, Va. Suffolk High School, Suffolk, Va. Tazewell High School, Tazewell, Va. ALUMNI SCHOLARSHIPS. At the meeting of the Board of Visitors on March 2d, 1899, the following system of Alumni Scholarships was created: 1. The Scholarships shall be known as Alumni Scholarships. 2. These incumbents shall be appointed by such local Alumni Associations as are members in good standing of the General Alumni Association and are so reported from year to year by its Secretary: and to such of these only as may have ten or more active members who are entitled to vote on the appointment of an incumbent. 3. No incumbent shall hold such Scholarship for more than one year; but one who has passed satisfactory examinations at the University in one or more of his classes may be eligible for reappointment the following session upon the recommendation of the Faculty. 4. These Scholarships shall be confined to those courses in the Academic Schools of the University to which Virginia students are now admitted without charge under the laws of Virginia (that is, all Academic courses, save the course in Analytical Chemistry). The Scholarship shall entitle the incumbent to exemption from tuition fees in the Schools referred to, and to the remission, if he be a Virginian, of the University fee; if he be not a Virginian, to one-half of the University fee. The Contingent fee must be deposited in all cases. 5. Only such persons may be appointed as actually stand in need of such aid, and such as otherwise would not, in the judgment of the Association making the appointment, be able to attend the University: and no student will be permitted to enjoy the privileges of an Alumni Scholarship while holding an endowed Scholarship or Fellowship. 6. The incumbent must be at least eighteen years of age, and must be one who, in the judgment of the Association naming him, is studious, of good moral character, and prepared to enter the University. He shall be subject to the same entrance requirements as other students. 7. Every local Alumni Association, as above described, having ten or more active members, shall be entitled annually to have one appointee at the University; if hereafter such Association ceases to have as many as ten active members, it shall not be entitled to make an appointment until that number be restored. 8. Every such local Association having fifty or more active members shall be entitled to fill two such scholarships annually, as long as it shall continue to have as many as fifty such members, or as soon as it shall have reached that number. 9. By "active" members as herein used, is meant Alumni of the University, who have been admitted by the Association as active members thereof, in accordance with the rules laid down by the Association. No Alumnus shall be entitled to vote upon the appointment of an incumbent in more than one Association during the same year, nor for this purpose shall an Alumnus be considered as an active member of more than one Association, at the same time. But graduation in any Department or School of the University is not hereby required. 10. Only one Association in any city or town shall be entitled to appoint incumbents to the Scholarships hereby created. 11. The final appointment of each incumbent shall be made by a vote of the whole Association, a majority of the active members voting for the applicant. It shall not finally be made by any committee or by any officer or officers of the Association. But such committee or officers may be appointed by the Association to nominate or examine candidates, and to report to the Association. 12. A statement, which shall include the full name and address of the successful candidate, the fact of his appointment, and the specific compliance of the Association and the candidate in question with conditions above stated, must be certified to the President of the University of Virginia, attested by the signature of the Secretary of the Association making the appointment. This certificate must be in the hands of the President on or before the fifteenth day of August preceding the opening of the session for which the incumbent is appointed. The President will send printed forms of such certificates upon application. 13. The above requirements having been complied with, the person or persons so appointed shall be entitled in each instance to attend the University for the session immediately following the appointment without payment of any tuition fees (save for the course in Analytical Chemistry) and to the remission, if he be a Virginian, of the University fee; if he be not a Virginian, of one-half of the University fee: the Contingent fee being deposited in each case: and shall enjoy the same privileges and be subject to the same restrictions as other students. 14. To guard against any possible ill-feeling or sense of injustice on the part of the local Associations in respect to the construction of these provisions, all such matters shall be referred to the Executive Committee of the General Alumni Association, the decision of which, when approved by the President of the University, shall be final. SPECIAL SCHOLARSHIPS. One of the Miller Scholarships is awarded, at the close of each session, to the candidate who passes with the highest aggregate of marks, in Physics 1, Chemistry 1, and Biology 1. The tenure is for two years, and the emolument is two hundred and fifty dollars a year, with free tuition in the Scientific Schools. Other conditions are stated in connection with the Department of Agriculture. The McCormick Scholarship, established in honor of the late Leander J. McCormick, the founder of the Astronomical Observatory, is awarded by Mr. Robert Hall McCormick, of Chicago. The emolument is free tuition in any Department of the University, with remission of the University fee. The Isaac Carey Scholarship is awarded by the Carey Trustees. Its value is about three hundred dollars a year. The Thompson Brown Scholarship is awarded by its founder. Its value is one hundred and twenty dollars a year. The Birely Scholarship, founded upon the bequest of the late Mrs. Evalena Seevers Birely in honor of her husband, Valentine Birely, Esq., of Frederick, Maryland, is awarded by the Visitors to some student from the State of Maryland. Its value is about one hundred dollars a year. The Henry Coalter Cabell Scholarship is awarded by the Visitors to a graduate student upon the recommendation of the Committee of the School of English Literature. Its value is fifty dollars a year. FELLOWSHIPS. The Vanderbilt Fellowships are supported out of the working fund of the Leander McCormick Observatory. They are assigned to advanced students who take Astronomy as their major subject and occupy a portion of their time in work connected with the Observatory. They are appointed upon the recommendation of the Director of the Observatory, to whom applications for further information should be made. The value of each Fellowship is three hundred and fifty dollars a year, with the remission of all fees. The John Y. Mason Fellowship, founded upon the gift of Archer Anderson, Esq., of Richmond, Va., is awarded by the Visitors to some competent and deserving graduate student, born in Virginia and in need of such assistance. The value is two hundred dollars a year. The William Cabell Rives Fellowship, founded in honor of the distinguished statesman of that name by his grandson, Dr. William Cabell Rives, of Washington, D. C., is awarded by the Board of Visitors, on the nomination of the President of the University, to a graduate student in History. The value of the fellowship is two hundred and fifty dollars, with remission of all fees. The Board of Visitors Fellowships.âThe Board of Visitors makes annual appointment, upon the recommendation of the professors in charge of certain designated Schools, of four graduate students to Fellowships. Each incumbent is required to occupy a portion of his time in work connected with the School from which he is nominated. The value of each Fellowship is two hundred dollars a year, with the remission of all fees.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART III. SCHOOLS AND DEPARTMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY: THE LIBRARY. THE COLLEGE. EDWIN ANDERSON ALDERMAN, D. C. L., LL. D., President. JAMES MORRIS PAGE, M. A., Ph. D., Dean. Required for Entrance upon the Work of the Department.âThe General Entrance Examination, or admission to the University by certificate or diploma, as stated in a preceding portion of this catalogue (p. 78). The General Entrance Examination must be supplemented, in the case of certain of the College courses by examinations for classification: the nature of these is in each case stated in its proper connection. These are the minimum requirements for admission to the College; and any candidate for admission who has received a preparation more ample than is thus represented will be admitted to advanced standing on satisfactory evidence of his attainments: candidates entering from other colleges will be admitted to advanced standing in accordance with the conditions stated on page 86. Every student is required to undertake the work of three courses, each consisting of three or more lectures or exercises a week throughout the year; and only three, unless otherwise authorized by the Faculty. Hence the time necessary for the attainment of the Degree of Bachelor of Arts by a student with the minimum preparation above indicated is four years. All undergraduate academic students, with the exception of Special Students, as defined in the preceding part of this catalogue, are regarded as members of the College. Full opportunity has in the past been, and will in the future be, given to any student to carry out any definite plan of work which he may have in view on coming to the University, or which may have been prescribed for him by those under whose direction he is completing his education. Every student is, however, expected to come to the University for a definite purpose: and when no well considered plan, as above indicated, has been outlined in advance, and the end in view is that for which the great majority of students enter college, namely, the attainment of a liberal education, the student in question will be expected to enter upon the regular work of the College, which leads to the bachelor's degree. BACHELOR OF ARTS. The requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Arts of the University of Virginia are such as to permit of the large measure of freedom of election on the part of the individual student which has characterized the work of the University from the beginning: such restriction only being placed upon this liberty as is necessary to insure at the same time the thoroughness and the breadth of culture for which this degree stands. In order to secure to the recipient of this degree in due measure an acquaintance with the methods of study and of thought characteristic of each of the leading departments of knowledge, as well as with their subject matter, as far as possible, his choice of work leading thereto is subject to the following conditions: The candidate for this degree is required to choose ten B. A. electives (save in the cases presently to be mentioned): these electives consist in some cases of a single course, in others of two or more courses. One elective must be chosen by every candidate from each of the seven groups defined below: the other three are to be taken at large from the courses indicated as open to such election in the brief summary which immediately follows the statement of the groups, or from the graduate courses open to candidates for the Master's degree. The electives at large consist in each case of single courses. Students who complete the work of both of the B. A. electives in group I (namely, Latin and Greek) are required to choose but seven other electives (or two electives at large). Students who have completed seven or more B. A. electives, satisfying the requirements of the group system, may offer in lieu of the three electives at large the work of the first year in the Department of Law or of Medicine, or three technical courses in the Department of Engineering. Candidates who enter with advanced standing from other colleges must spend one full year in academic work and must complete at least three B. A. electives here in order to be admitted to the privilege last stated. Any student in good standing who satisfies the requirements above stated, under the prescribed conditions, is entitled to the degree of Bachelor of Arts of the University of Virginia.

The dates of these examinations are given in the schedule which follows. They begin in each case at 9 a. m., and are limited to eight hours. III. Fall Examinations.âThe regulations concerning Fall Examinations in the College courses, granted for partially successful work, are as follows: A student who fails to pass on one of his courses, but attains a grade of sixty-five per cent. (or more) on that course, may be admitted to the regular Fall examination on the course at the beginning of the following session. But the student who has attained the required grade, and who desires to be admitted to the Fall examination, must apply in writing to the Dean of the College for that privilege not later than September 1. The Fall examinations in the College shall be held (for 1907) between the 9th and the 14th of September, inclusive.

THE DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. EDWIN ANDERSON ALDERMAN, D. C. L., LL. D., President. RICHARD HEATH DABNEY, M. A., Ph. D., Dean. Required for Entrance upon the Work of the Department.âThe possession of a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank: or, in the case of a graduate of an institution of such rank that does not confer a baccalaureate degree, presentation of a certificate of graduation in a course of study accepted by the Academic Faculty as fully equivalent to that ordinarily required for the degree in question. A candidate entering the University under these conditions will be registered as a Graduate Student if he is pursuing one or more graduate courses: he may, however, be permitted, or, if he is a candidate for a degree who enters from another college, be required to take in addition such strictly undergraduate courses as may be desirable or necessary for his purpose. To students in this Department who are not candidates for advanced degrees the fullest freedom in the choice of their studies is granted: and a minimum of restriction is placed upon the choice of a candidate for an advanced degree. I. Graduates in Schools. Any student who successfully completes all the courses offered in any Academic School is entitled to a diploma of graduation in that School: but a student thus pursuing graduate studies will not be registered as a member of this Department unless he has satisfied the conditions above stated. II. Masters of Arts. The degree of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia will be conferred upon a Bachelor of Arts who has completed the four M. A. electives in the Academic Schools, chosen by himself and approved by the Faculty. The course selected must in each case be submitted for confirmation by the Faculty at least one scholastic year before the degree is conferred. Each M. A. elective consists of a single course (involving, where necessary, the completion of any course or courses prerequisite). A brief summary of the courses open to candidates for the Master's degree is given upon a following page, together with a schedule of the hours of lectures and examinations: a description of each is given in its proper connection in the portion of the catalogue, immediately following, which treats of the work of the independent Academic Schools. The courses indicated are also, in the majority of cases, included among the advanced courses that may be offered as electives at large for the degree of Bachelor of Arts: credit can, of course, be obtained for any such course in but one of these capacities by the same candidate; work done for the lower degrees in Arts being in no case counted again as part of the work required for the attainment of the higher degree. The preliminary degree required of candidates for the degree of Master of Arts may be that of this University or some other chartered institution of learning. But in the latter case the degree shall be submitted for approval to the Faculty, who may accept or reject the degree offered. Bachelors of Arts of other colleges or universities may, in the discretion of the Academic Faculty, be required to pursue such supplementary undergraduate courses as may be necessary for the effective pursuit of the M. A. courses elected. Such candidates for the Master's degree are required to complete the B. A. electives in the four schools elected for the degree, unless excused from this undergraduate work by the professors in charge of these schools. III. Doctors of Philosophy. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy of the University of Virginia is offered to students who propose to devote their energies to special study and research in some of the various departments of letters, or of science. The candidate for this degree must hold the degree of Bachelor of Arts, or other degree of like value, from this University or from some other college or university of good standing, or must exhibit to the Academic Faculty, by examination if necessary, satisfactory evidence of having a collegiate education equivalent to that represented by the degree of Bachelor of Arts of a college or university of good standing. If the applicant has received his collegiate education at an institution other than this, the Academic Faculty will pass, if necessary, upon the standing of the institution in question. The preparation of the candidate for entrance upon Ph. D. courses in the particular subject selected shall be passed upon by the Academic Faculty on the basis of a report from the professors in charge of the Schools involved. These professors may satisfy themselves as to such preparation by any test they see fit to apply, including a formal examination, if they deem this necessary. The work offered for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy of the University of Virginia shall in all cases embrace three cognate subjects; namely, a major subject, a primary minor, and a secondary minor. The three subjects must be chosen from at least two Schools. The candidate shall in all cases submit his choice of, at least, his major subject to the Academic Faculty for approval, before entering upon his work. The instruction open to candidates for the Doctor's degree in each of the Academic Schools is described in its proper connection in the portion of the catalogue immediately following. The minimum time limit set for the acquisition of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at this University, is three years' residence after the B. A. degree has been conferred. The major subject shall be pursued during the whole time, the primary minor during at least two years, and the secondary minor during at least one year. No undergraduate work can be counted for this degree. Each candidate for the degree shall be required to show, by examination if necessary, that he possesses a reading knowledge of French and German; and such knowledge of other subjects considered fundamental as may be prescribed by the individual Schools. Graduate work done in other universities of high standing may be accepted in lieu of resident work done here, provided sufficient evidence is furnished that such work has been of a grade similar to that required here, and has been satisfactorily performed. It is also provided that a candidate who is a professor in charge of the subject selected by him as major in a chartered college or university, may be allowed by the Academic Faculty to spend only two years in resident work at this University. The graduate work of the last year of candidacy shall in all cases be done at this University, unless the Academic Faculty shall for special reasons direct otherwise. Upon the completion of the approved courses, the candidate shall submit to the Academic Faculty a dissertation exhibiting independent research in some branch of his major subject. The dissertation must be submitted not later than April 15 of the year in which the candidate applies for graduation. If approved, the dissertation must be printed before the degree is conferred and two hundred copies deposited in the Library of the University. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses at the University for a Virginia student in the Department of Graduate Studies may be estimated at from $160 a year upward, according to the mode of living; for students from other States this minimum should be increased by a sum ranging from $90 to $130 for tuition fees. A fuller statement of expenses, including the conditions under which Virginia or other students are entitled to free tuition, will be found on pp. 94-97. Applicants for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy who are granted the privilege of non-residence during a portion of their candidacy, under conditions above stated, are required to matriculate and to pay the annual University fee of $40 if not Virginians, and $10 if Virginians, during such period of non-residence. COURSES IN THE ACADEMIC SCHOOLS WHICH ARE OPEN TO COLLEGE STUDENTS AS ELECTIVES FOR THE SECOND DEGREE IN ARTS. A brief summary is here presented of the courses open to election by candidates for the Master's degree. A description of each of these courses will be found in the statements of the Academic Schools upon subsequent pages (109-114). Where an undergraduate course is stated to be prerequisite to a graduate course, the latter may be taken parallel with the former if, in the judgment of the professor concerned, the circumstances justify such a privilege.

Each of these Schools offers one or more undergraduate courses of instruction, comprising the work required of students who choose an elective in the subject in question as one of the requisites for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. These are followed in each School by graduate courses, the completion of all of which, together with that of the undergraduate course or courses preceding it, entitles the student to a diploma of graduation in the School in question, as already stated on a preceding page. A detailed account of the courses and equipment of the Schools is given; the relation of these courses to the academic degrees of the University has already been stated. The professors and instructors in the Academic Schools compose the Academic Faculty, which deals with questions related to the work of both the College and the Department of Graduate Studies. SCHOOL OF LATIN. Professor Fitz-Hugh. Mr. Myers. Mr. Bolling. Mr. McLemore. Required for Admission to the Work of the School: The General Entrance Examination including the examination in Latin (p. 81). Preparation.âThe Latin work of the University finds its logical place in the public school system as the continuation of the Latin work of the High School. It presupposes accordingly four years of competent instruction in Latin, involving the Roman pronunciation, habitual observance of quantity and accent, regular drill in grammar and prose composition through all preparatory years, elementary Reader, Nepos, CÃ¦sar, Cicero's easier Orations, and Vergil. If the preparation of the student justifies it he will be admitted to advanced standing, with due credit for all work done elsewhere by him. Attention is further called to the importance of beginning Greek for all who wish to reap the full cultural benefit of the University courses in Latin. The study of at least one Romanic language also is very desirable. The Greek illumines incomparably all parts of Latin study, which bears in turn a like relation to the Romanic. General Statement.âThe first three years of University Latin are devoted to the broad cultural study of the language, literature, and life of the Romans. In the course of the instruction the effort is made to exhibit as far as possible the relation of Roman civilization to the Greek, on the one hand, and to Romanic and modern, on the other, and thus to emphasize the unity and continuity of all human culture. The desirability of a knowledge of Greek, and of at least one Romanic language, is therefore especially commended to the student of Latin. The work is organized in all years as follows: A. In Language: Systematic study of Latin Grammar, with oral and written exercises in prose composition. One hour a week. B. In Literature: Reading of authors in culture-historical sequences. Two hours a week. C. In Life: Systematic study of Roman culture-history in English, hand in hand with the study of the Latin authors. Primarily for Undergraduates. Course 1: Entrance Examination in Latin prerequisite. A. In Language: General grammar (Hale-Buck), with oral and written exercises (Moulton-Collar, Mather-Wheeler, Gildersleeve-Lodge). B. In Literature: Historical, Sallust's Jugurthine War and Conspiracy of Catilineâepic, Vergil's Ãneid (Bks. VII-XII) and Ovid's Metamorphoses, with study of the hexameterâphilosophic, Cicero On Friend- ship, Old Age, and Immortality (Tusculan Disputations and Somnium Scipionis). C. In Life: The geography, history, and private life of the Romans (Tozer's Classical Geography and Kiepert's Atlas Anticus, Botsford's Story of Rome, Johnston's Private Life of the Romans). Course 2: Course 1 (or its equivalent) prerequisite.âEither Course 2 or Course 3 may be offered as the elective from group I, and the other may be offered as an elective at large. A. In Language: General Grammar (Gildersleeve-Lodge), with oral and written exercises (Gildersleeve-Lodge, Nutting, Bennett). B. In Literature: Historical, Livy's Early History of Rome (Bks. I-II) and Tacitus' Germaniaâlyric and didactic, Catullus' Odes and Vergil's Georgics, with study of the rhythms of lyric and didactic poetry ârhetorical and philosophic, Cicero's De Oratore and Seneca's Moral Essays. C. In Life: The public life, religion, and mythology of the Romans (Gow's Companion to School Classics, Fairbanks' Mythology of Greece and Rome.) Course 3: Course 1 (or its equivalent) prerequisite.âEither Course 2 or Course 3 may be offered as the elective from group I, and the other may be offered as an elective at large. A. In Language: General grammar (Gildersleeve-Lodge), with oral and written exercises (Gildersleeve-Lodge, Nutting, Bennett). B. In Literature: Historical, Livy's Hannibalic War (Bks. XXIXXII) and Tacitus' Agricolaâepic and lyric, Vergil's Ãneid and Horace's Odes, with study of the rhythms of epic and lyric verseâdidactic and critical, Quintilian's Training of the Orator and Tacitus' Dialogue on the Orators. C. In Life: The art life of the Romans (Tarbell's History of Greek Art, Goodyear's Roman Art). For Undergraduates and Graduates. Course 4: Course 2 or Course 3 (or the equivalent of either) prerequisite. A. In Language: History of the Latin Language and its survival in the Romanic tongues. Oral and written exercises (Gildersleeve-Lodge, Peters: Bennett, Moore, Nettleship). B. In Literature: Historical and epistolary, Tacitus' Annals and Cicero's Lettersâdramatic and satirical, Plautus' Captivi and Terence's Andria, and Horace's Satires and Epistles, with study of the rhythms of scenic and satiric verseâphilosophic and critical, Lucretius' De Natura Rerum and Cicero's De Claris Oratoribus. C. In Life: The history of Roman literature (Mackail's Latin Literature and Laing's Masterpieces of Latin Literature). Course 5: Course 2 or Course 3 (or the equivalent of either) prerequisite. A. In Language: History of Roman Metric Art. Oral and written exercises (Gildersleeve-Lodge, Peters: Bennett, Moore, Nettleship). B. In Literature: Historical and epistolary, Tacitus' Histories and Pliny's Lettersâdramatic and satirical, Plautus' Mostellaria and Terence's Phormio, and Juvenal's Satires, with study of the rhythms of scenic and satiric verseâphilosophic, Lucretius' De Natura Rerum and Cicero's De Natura Deorum. C. In Life: The history of Roman philosophy (Mayor's History of Ancient Philosophy from Thales to Cicero and Pater's Marius the Epicurean). For Graduates Only. Course 6: Course 4 or Course 5 prerequisite.âThis course is intended for those who desire to specialize in classical philology, and especially for those who choose Latin as their major elective for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Roman civilization is the link between the Hellenic and the Romanic, and hence, Latin philology, which is the science of Roman civilization, has vital points of contact with Greek philology on the one hand, and with Romanic on the other. If the candidate's main subject be Latin, a repectable familiarity with Greek is required, since the language, literature, and higher culture of the Romans are saturated with Greek influence. If the candidate's main subject be Romanic, the Greek requirement is waived as far as practically possible, and he is guided into the hitory of the Roman folkspeech, the common source of the Romanic tongues, and into acqnaintance with the authors who illustrate it in literature. Plan of Work.âIt is the aim of this course, as far as the teaching force and the resources of the School permit, to prepare the candidate to investigate independently the sources of our knowledge of the language, monuments (literary and objective), and life of the Romans. The following is therefore an outline of the course: A. In Language: Elements of comparative grammar (Giles, supplemented by Hirt and Sommer on Sounds and Inflections and by Brugmann and Schmalz on Syntax)âintroduction to Latin historical grammar (Lindsay, supplemented by Landgraf)âsystematic grammar (KÃ¼hner) with stylistic exercises, oral and written, in conjunction with Cicero's De Oratoreâreading of authors illustrating the history of the Latin language. B. In the Literary and Objective Monuments of the Romans: Reading of authors in groups systematically planned to illustrate the literary life of the Romansâhistory and interpretation of textsâelements of palÃ¦ography (Johnston, supplemented by Thompson), epigraphy (Lindsay, supplemented by Egbert and Cagnat), numismatics (Gnecchi, supplemented by Hill), topography and remains (Platner, Mau, Strack, Furtwaengler). C. In Roman Life: Constructive study of Roman culture-historyâ reading of authors illustrating the development of Roman civilizationâ study of modern authorities in Roman culture-history (Philippson, Nissen, Mommsen, Marquardt-Mommsen, Preller-Jordan, Springer-Michaelis and Winter, Schanz, Windelband). Aids.âFor the sake of first-hand access to important modern authorities in Latin philology, the candidate is urged to acquire a good reading knowledge of German, French, and Italian. Such a mastery of German and French is imperative. SCHOOL OF GREEK. Professor Humphreys. Dr. Sears. Required for Admission to the Work of the School: The General Entrance Examination. This school comprises the following courses: Primarily for Undergraduates. Course 1: A course for beginners. Text-books: Benner and Smyth's Beginner's Greek Book; Xenophon's Anabasis. Young men who have the opportunity are urged to prepare themselves for the next course (2) or Course 3 before coming to the University. Course 2: Course 1 prerequisite or the Entrance Examination in Greek (or its equivalent).âA course of easy Attic Prose: Xenophon's Memorabilia and Hellenica, Lysias, Goodwin's Grammar, Elementary Exercises. Course 3: Course 2 (or its equivalent) prerequisite.âA course of Attic Prose and the Drama, Herodotus and Homer, Syntax, Exercises, Literature, History, Meters, etc. The class will begin with Plato's Apology and Crito. For Undergraduates and Graduates. Course 4: Course 3 prerequisite.âA more advanced course, including portions of Demosthenes, Thucydides, Ãschylus, Sophocles, Aristophanes, Lyric Poets; also Meters, Syntax, and Exercises. For Graduates Only. Courses 5 and 6: Course 4 prerequisite.âDesigned for those who wish to devote themselves to classical scholarship, and especially for those who choose Greek as their major elective for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. For admission to these courses, proficiency in Courses 2 and 3, or equivalent preparation, is required. The course 4 may be taken as the first year Ph. D. course. At present the additional work consists of four special courses, each comprising three hours per week during a half session. The lectures will be employed chiefiy in directing the private study of the students. The four special courses offered at present are as follows: I. A course of selected readings extending over the whole field of Greek literature in the order of historical development. This course is intended as a general survey. II. A course in Attic Prose, especially the orators, directed partly to questions of grammar, and partly to the artistic form and style. III. A study of the Attic drama, including the special study in class of the Ådipus Tyrannus of Sophocles and the Frogs of Aristophanes. IV. A study of the Greek poets, with special reference to music, rhythm, meter, and structure. The ancient doctrine of meter and rhythm will be carefully examined, and portions of the Lyric poets, including Pindar, read in class. For all the classes of this School private reading is prescribed, and the examinations will be partly upon this and the work done in class, and partly upon passages selected from the Greek authors at will. Text-Books.âGoodwin's Greek Grammar; Goodwin's Moods and Tenses; Veitch's Verbs; Liddell and Scott's Lexicon (intermediate, and in Courses II and III, unabridged edition); Morey's History of Greece; Fowler's Greek Literature. Any editions of Greek authors may be used, except when particular ones are specially prescribed; but students should always have at hand Teubner's texts for reference, and for use on examinations. At present Rhythm and Meters and some other subjects are taught wholly or partly by lecture. SCHOOL OF TEUTONIC LANGUAGES. Professor Harrison. Adj. Prof. Faulkner.* * Absent on leave. Adj. Prof. Setzler. Required for Admission to the Work of the School: In English; the General Entrance Examination, and, in addition, preparation equivalent to Course 1 in English Literature: in German; the General Entrance Examination. The subjects taught in this School are the English and German languages (including Old and Middle English, Gothic, Old and Middle High German). I. English. Primarily for Undergraduates. Course 1: Course 1 in English Literature prerequisite.âCourse 1 in English is designed to lay a broad foundation for the intelligent study of the language on both the historical (philological) and the literary side. The opportunity is seized from the beginning to interest the student in the history and etymology of current English words and phrases, to point him by a general course of Anglo-Saxon (Old English) and Middle English to the gradual evolution of Modern English as we have it now, and to furnish him with ample material for the prosecution of further study and research. A carefully graded series of texts and text-books will lead the student from the language of Alfred through Chaucer and the Elizabethans to the English of Victoria. Text-Books.âFirst Term:âSweet's Anglo-Saxon Primer; Bradley's The Making of English. Second Term:âMorris and Skeat's Chaucer's Prologue and Knightes Tale; Baskervill and Harrison's Anglo-Saxon Reader (prose); Greenough and Kittredge's Words and their Ways in English Speech; Lectures on Early English Literature.

For Undergraduates and Graduates. Course 2: Course 1 prerequisite.âThis course is a more specialized form of Course 1 on the same general lines; a knowledge of Anglo-Saxon is essential to its profitable prosecution. The historical study of the language is pursued in greater detail; the student's attention is concentrated on the history and origins of English; lectures on the Poetry and Life of the Anglo-Saxons are given; Fourteenth Century English receives detailed attention, and selected works of the Elizabethan period will be examined and studied critically. The effort will constantly be made to make these courses in the English Language run parallel on the linguistic side with the courses in English Literature, so that the two may profitably be taken together. Text-Books.âFirst Term:âSweet's or Bright's Anglo-Saxon Reader (prose); Morris and Skeat's Specimens, II; Toller's Outlines. Parallel Reading. Second Term:âSkeat's Principles, I; The Student's Chaucer; Brooke's History of Old English Literature; Professor's Lectures on Anglo-Saxon Meters; Anglo-Saxon, continued (poetry). Parallel Reading. Third Term:âBeowulf; Skeat's Principles, II; Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (completed); Spenser's FaÃ¶rie Queene; Brooke (completed); Lectures on Anglo-Saxon Poetry. In 1904-5 and 1905-6 this class discussed once a week in the English Seminary, second term, written reports on points connected with Chaucer's language, vocabulary, proverbs, learning, versification, etc. During the third term Spenser formed the center of the Seminary work. A piece of technical work, such as the construction of a vocabulary, the examination of particular points in syntax or grammar, or the discussion of a particular author, may be required of a student in this course. Parallel reading is required. For Graduates Only. Course 3: Course 2 prerequisite.âA course in Anglo-Saxon Poetry. Course 4: Course 2 prerequisite.âA course in Anglo-Saxon Prose. Course 5: Course 2 prerequisite.âA course in Middle English Poetry. Course 6: Course 2 prerequisite.âA course in Gothic.â(All of these courses except Course 6 were given in 1906-7.) Courses 3, 4, 5, and 6 are open to students who desire to specialize in the subject of English, and especially to those who choose this subject as their major elective for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. A general statement only of their character can be given, each course being adapted to the needs and preferences of the student. The foundations will be laid in a thorough knowledge of Gothic, Old and Middle High German, and Old French to the Sixteenth Century; phonetics will be carefully studied; and the principles of comparative grammar and syntax will be duly explained. Frequent conference, stated examinations, and original research will form essential parts of work in these courses. The professor's large and choice collection of Anglo-Saxon, English, German, and French philological works is open to the students. II. German. Primarily for Undergraduates. Course 1: In this course the students begin with elementary grammar, reading, and composition. About six hundred pages of German prose are translated, and thirty pages of German in the form of weekly exercises are written. One hour a week is given to conversation. Text-Books.âFirst Term:âBierwirth's Beginning German; MÃ¼ller and Wenckebach's GlÃ¼ck Auf. Second Term:âSealsfield's Die PrÃ¤rie am Jacinto. Third Term:âDas MÃ¤dchen von Treppi; Das Wirtshaus zu Cransac; GerstÃ¤cker's Irrfahrten; Baring-Gould's Story of Germany. Course 2: Course 1 (or its equivalent) prerequisite.âCourse 2 in German is, like the corresponding course in English, designed to lay a broad foundation for the intelligent study of the language on both the philological and the literary side. A carefully selected series of text-books will gradually introduce the student to the pronunciation, grammar, syntax, and translation of the language; exercises once a week in German script will familiarize him with grammatical analysis; and appropriate texts on the history and literature of Germany will introduce him to these important sides of the study. Parallel reading is required. Text-Books.âFirst Term:âBierwirth's Elements of German; Stern's Geschichten von Deutschen StÃ¤dten; Von Klenze's Deutsche Gedichte; Moore's or Hosmer's Short History of German Literature; Kron's German Daily Life. Second Term:âHauff's Lichtenstein; Werner's Heimatklang; Goethe's Die Neue Melusine; Zschokke's Der Tote Gast. Third Term:âGoethe's Hermann and Dorothea; Schiller's Jungfrau von Orleans and Maria Stuart; Freytag's Die Journalisten. Course 3: Scientific German: Course 1 prerequisite.âStudents taking this course will, during the first term, take the work of Course 2, outlined above, and will then read Gore's Dippoldt's, or Brandt's Scientific German Reader (at least two of these). For Undergraduates and Graduates. Course 4: Course 2 prerequisite.âThis course is a more specialized continuation of Course 2 in German, on the same general lines. The historical study of German is taken up; the masterpieces of German literature are systematically studied in critical annotated texts; exercises continue throughout the year; and the literature and life of Germany are studied in some detail. Parallel reading is required, and one hour a week is given to conversation. Text-Books.âFirst Term:âWhitney's Compendious German Grammar; Behaghel's Historical Grammar; Stein's Exercises; Goethe's Meisterwerke (Bernhardt's); Lodemann's Germany and the Germans; Francke's Social Forces in German Literature. Second Term:âWhitney, Stein, Francke and Behaghel, continued; Wenckebach's Meisterwerke des Mittelalters; Scheffel's Ekkehard; Freytag's Soll und Haben. Third Term:âAnnotated Editions of Lessing, Goethe, Heine, Grillparzer, Kleist. For Graduates Only. Course 5: Courses 2 and 4 prerequisite.âA course in the Middle High German Epic. Course 6: Courses 2 and 4 prerequisite.âA course in German Prose of the Eighteenth Century. Course 7: Courses 2 and 4 prerequisite.âA course in Old High German. Course 8: Courses 2 and 4 prerequisite.âA course in Gothic. (Courses 1-6 were given in 1906-7.) Courses 5, 6, 7, and 8 are open to students who desire to specialize in the subject of German, and especially to those who choose this subject as their major elective for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. German and English combine admirably for the doctorate as "major" and "primary minor," either from the German or from the English point of view. Conference with the Professor is requested for the purpose of arranging the student's studies. If German is elected, Gothic, systematically studied through Wright's Primer, Bernhardt's Gotische Bibel, and Skeat, is the foundation. Behaghel's Heliand (Saxon) may well follow this. A course in Old and Middle High German, studied in the works and editions of Braune, Wright, Sievers, Erdmann, and Henry, connects the Gothic and modern High German, and gives ample philological as well as literary training to the German specialist. Conversation Clubs.âAn opportunity for practice in German conversation is given to students who desire it in the conversation clubs connected with the work of the school. These clubs are open to all students of German in the University, and meet, under the direction of the adjunct professor, one hour a week each. Attendance is voluntary, and membership in each club is limited to twelve. SCHOOL OF ROMANIC LANGUAGES. Professor Wilson. Mr. Bardin. Dr. Dargan. Mr. Smith. Mr. Jones.

In the discussion of the Ordinary Differential Equation, particular attention is paid to the theory of integration of such equations as admit of a known Transformation Group, and the classic methods of integration are compared with those which flow from the Theory of Transformation Groups. A similar method is adopted in the study of the Simultaneous System, with its equivalent Linear Partial Differential Equation of the First Order. As far as the time admits, the theories of integration of the Complete System, as well as those of the General Partial Differential Equation of the First and Second Orders, will be discussed. Prof. Page. Course 7: A Course in the Theory of Functions: Course 3 prerequisite.âIn this class is offered to advanced students a course in Mathematical Analysis. The treatment of the subject is arranged under three heads, as follows: The design of the numbers of analysis and the laws of the operations to which they are subject are studied after the methods of Dedekind and Tannery, Cantor and Weierstrass, as introductory to the study of functions. The study of the Theory of Functions of a Real Variable, including series, products, and continued fractions, the Calculus of Finite Differences and of Variations, lead up to the need of the complex variable. The General Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable is studied after the methods of Cauchy, Riemann, and Weierstrass. A special study is made of the series of Taylor and of Fourier. Prof. Echols.

In both courses there are one or more reviews each week of the subjects under discussion, involving questions put by, as well as to, the students; and exercises in writing are given out to afford practice in the calculations which are needed by the chemist. For Graduates Only. For admission to a Ph. D. course in the School of Chemistry or in the school of Analytical Chemistry, the previous completion of Courses 1 and 2 in both the Schools named will be required; but this part of the requirement may be waived, provided satisfactory evidence be furnished that the student has already made equivalent attainment elsewhere. Graduate work is offered in either course, and either or both may be taken by the candidate for the Ph. D. degree. Laboratory work will be applied to subjects involving original investigation. It is desirable that the student shall, himself, as far as possible, select subjects for investigation, but when he cannot do so, suitable questions will be presented to him, and he will be encouraged to work them out for himself, with only such aid and guidance as may prove to be indispensable. Advanced reading may also be prescribed, especially in the shape of the literature of particular topics, to be looked up from various sources and condensed by the student. No one can join the medical section of the class in General Chemistry, or stand the corresponding examinations, unless he be a regular student in the medical department of the University. ? An important change in the programme of this School is in contemplation and will probably become effective for next session (1907-8). Due notice of this will be given by a separate published circular at as early a date as possible. SCHOOL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY. Professor Dunnington. Mr. Sloan. Required for Admission to the Work of the School: The General Entrance Examination. The regular work of this School, constituting a complete course in Practical Chemistry, is divided into two courses, as follows: Primarily for Undergraduates. Course 1: This course consists of three lessons a week throughout the session, on each occasion the student spending three or four hours in practical experiments in the Laboratory. A course in Chemical manipulation is first given, then Blowpipe Analysis, Fire Assaying of Ores of Lead, Gold, and Silver, and a systematic course in Inorganic Qualitative Analysis, followed by practice in analysis of salts, alloys, and ores, determination of minerals and the examination of potable water, coal, clay, and so on, together with some simpler quantitative determinations. Weekly written exercises are required. For Undergraduates and Graduates. Course 2: The work of the second course is also given in three lessons a week throughout the session, each being followed by four hours or more of practical laboratory work. This course is primarily one in Quantitative Analysis. After some training in manipulation and gravimetric estimations, the class pursues volumetric estimations and a full course in Quantitative Analysis of minerals, ores, coal, soil, technical products, and so on. Weekly written exercises are required. As the student advances in the course he is encouraged to undertake original research and assist in its prosecution; and in determining his fitness for graduation, work of this kind is considered as having much weight. The Laboratory is open to students six days in the week, during all the working hours of the day. Students may register either for the first course, or for both courses at the same time; candidates for the M. A. elective are required to complete both courses. Those who accomplish this are prepared for work as Analytical Chemists, Assayers, Druggists, or Teachers of Chemistry. Among the works recommended to laboratory students are: Fresenius's Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis, A. I. Cohn; Olsen's Quantitative Chemical Analysis; Venable's Qualitative Analysis (3d ed.); Greville William's Hand-Book of Chemical Manipulation; Woehler's Examples for Practice in Chemical Analysis; Foye's Hand-Book of Mineralogy. A course of lectures in Agricultural Chemistry is given in this School (see p. 206). For Graduates Only. The graduate course is designed for those seeking the degree of Ph. D., and also for such students as desire to increase the range of their experience as analysts, and to cultivate their powers of original investigation. It is required of those who enter this course that they shall have previously completed Courses 1 and 2, both in this School and in that of General Chemistry, or that they shall have previously made equivalent attainments elsewhere. Laboratory work will be conducted daily, and suggestions and due assistance will be given in its prosecution. While the work is adapted to the special aims or tastes of each student, it will in all cases comprise some practice in the more elaborate processes of analysis, ultimate and proximate organic analysis, some study in analytical methods and some original problems, also the reading and the summarizing of extracts from current journals, and for all who are seeking the degree of Ph. D., a dissertation embodying the results of some original research. The Chemical Laboratory is a building planned and erected for the purpose. It is warmed throughout by hot water, completely fitted with the most approved appliances, and stocked with apparatus, models, materials, and specimens. The commodious lecture-room, with work and store-room attached, is provided with every convenience for exhibiting a complete series of experiments illustrating the lectures on General Chemistry. The Laboratory will accommodate forty working students, and is furnished with work-tables, gas, water, and all proper laboratory fixtures; smaller rooms are devoted to weighing, evaporations, assaying, etc., and all requisite apparatus, chemicals, minerals, materials for analysis, etc., are kept constantly supplied by home purchases and importation. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF NATURAL HISTORY AND GEOLOGY. Professor Fontaine. Required for Admission to the Work of the School: The General Entrance Examination. In this School two subjects are taught, Geology and Descriptive Mineralogy. There are two courses, as follows: Primarily for Undergraduates. Course 1.âThree lectures a week will be given throughout the session. The design of the course is to enable the student to obtain such a knowledge of the science of Geology as should be possessed by a welleducated man. As full an exposition of the fundamental principles will be given as the time will allow. Text-Books.âLe Conte's Elements of Geology, and Notes of the Professor's lectures. For Undergraduates and Graduates. Course 2: Course 1 prerequisite.âThis course consists of two divisions, one in Mineralogy, the other in Geology. Mineralogy.âThe course in Mineralogy closes in February. Three lectures a week are given in it. In this course attention is paid to crystallography, and especially to the physical properties of minerals. In Descriptive Mineralogy the relations, geological occurrence, and history of the individual species are made prominent. Text-Books.âDana's Manual of Mineralogy and Petrology. The instruction will be in part by lectures. Geology.âThis division of the course begins after the completion of Mineralogy in February. The more general and complicated problems in all the branches of Geology will be dealt with in this course. As thorough a treatment as possible will be given of Stratigraphy, Lithology, and Paleontology. More stress will be laid on the methods of field-work and the application of geological principles. The aim will be to give such a knowledge of the subject as may be useful to the student in bread-winning pursuits, or may serve as a basis for the more specialized course required for the attainment of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Text-Book.âChamberlin and Salisbury's Geology in part. For reference: Geikie's Text-Book of Geology. The instruction will be in part by lectures. For Graduates Only. The advanced course in this School is intended to give the student as large a stock of useful information as possible, to teach him methods of investigation, and to train him in habits of observation. Original research will be insisted on, and opportunity will be given for the student to concentrate his efforts in some line of special study. Topics for study will be taken from both of the subjects taught in this School. The abundant material in the Lewis Brooks Museum, mentioned below, gives unusual facilities for the pursuit of graduate work. Descriptive Mineralogy.âThe course of Mineralogy is so selected as to give the student a good knowledge of as wide a range of the principles as possible, and at the same time to cause him to acquire a practical knowledge of the various mineral species. In the practical study, the more common minerals, and those of more importance from an economic and geologic point of view, will have preference. A practical knowledge of the crystal forms and of the characteristic groupings and massive forms of minerals, will be required. Special attention will be paid to the relations of minerals, their association in nature, and their geological occurrence. The student will be trained to determine minerals, as far as possible, by their obvious characteristics, without the help of tests, and practical examinations will be held, from time to time, to test his skill. One or more theses will be required. Dana's Text-Book of Mineralogy, and Weisbach's Mineral Tables will be used; and topics from various authors will be assigned for study in special cases. Geology.âIn Geology the aim will be to fit the student for independent and original research. He will study as thoroughly as possible the broader problems of the science, involving the knowledge of stratigraphical principles. Special attention will be given to imparting a practical knowledge of the various rocks, and of the animal and plant fossils of the different eras, with the view of using them in determining unknown formations. Stress will be laid upon field work, and the methods of determining and describing the geology of new regions. To impart such knowledge, the student will be required to work up some particular region or formation, and report his results. Topics involving a knowledge of the literature and growth of opinion in relation to particular questions may be assigned to form the subject of theses. Chamberlin and Salisbury's Geology will be used as a text-book, and selected books of other authors will be used when necessary. The Lewis Brooks Museum contains collections illustrating the main subdivisions of Natural History. Each of the collections is arranged so as to exemplify the principles of the science, and at the same time offers a large variety of subjects for advanced study. In Geology the specimens show all the different kinds of rocks, classified according to mineral character and the formation in which they occur; the collection of fossils, plaster casts, maps, etc., is exceptionally fine, and fully illustrates Historical Geology. In Mineralogy the principles of the science are made plain by well-chosen suits of specimens, models of crystals, etc. The general collection of minerals contains all the important minerals, and many of the rarer ones, in good specimens. ZoÃ¶logy is well illustrated by a fine and large collection of mounted skeletons, stuffed animals, dried specimens, plaster casts, etc. In Botany the collections contain charts, papier-mach&amp;eacute; models of flowers and fruits, sections of wood, etc.: the bulk of the collection is in the form of an herbarium, selected from the most important and interesting botanical regions of the world. In addition to the above, a beginning has been made of a collection to illustrate the geology and mineralogy of the State of Virginia, and this will be increased as rapidly as possible. These large and carefully selected collections of geological and mineralogical objects afford unsurpassed facilities for the full illustration of the principles taught. As free access to these collections is allowed the student, he can find in their study an opportunity, rarely obtained, for gaining a practical acquaintance with natural objects acquired from various parts of the world, and chosen for their typical character. These collections are especially useful to students pursuing advanced work in Geology and Mineralogy. MILLER SCHOOL OF BIOLOGY. Professor Tuttle. Mr. Kepner. Required for Admission to the Work of the School: The General Entrance Examination. The work of this school is designed to meet the wants of students who desire such knowledge of the principles of Biology and of the methods of biological research as should properly form part of a liberal education, or who desire such training as will fit them for independent work as students or as teachers in that department of knowledge; and of those who seek such acquaintance with the facts and laws of Biology as will prepare them for an intelligent study of the relations of the biological sciences to the art of Agriculture as described in another portion of this catalogue (p. 204). Each student who enters upon the work of either of the courses described below is required to provide himself with a section razor, a good pocket magnifier, a small case of dissecting instruments, and a note book of approved pattern. All other necessary apparatus, reagents, etc., are furnished by the laboratory. There is a laboratory fee for materials consumed in connection with the work of all but the first three courses. Primarily for Undergraduates. Course 1: General Biology.âIn view of the fact that no elementary instruction in either of the biological sciences is now given in the majority of the schools tributary to the University, and that by far the greater number of its students have therefore had no preliminary training in the methods of experiment and observation necessary for their pursuit, provision is for the present made for an introductory course in Biology. This is intended primarily to make the student familiar with the laboratory method of study, and at the same time to impart to him some direct knowledge of the most readily discernible facts of structure and laws of functions concerning a series of representative plants and animals. In it he is taught to observe, to record the results of his observations, and to make deductions therefrom; is made familiar with the microscope and with the simpler and more frequently used processes of biological technique. A brief survey is made of both the vegetable and the animal kingdom, preparing the student for the systematic study of either of the great divisions of the organic world. Course 2: Botany: Course 1 prerequisite.âThe course in structural and Systematic Botany is largely given to the study of anatomy and histology of representatives of the principal divisions of the Vegetable Kingdom, beginning with the lowest and passing to the highest plants; as far as possible, representative life-histories are also studied and discussed. The concluding portion of the course is devoted to the specific study of the classification and distribution of the higher plants, and of the local flora. Course 3: ZoÃ¶logy: Course 1 prerequisite.âIn this course a study is made of a series of forms representative of the principal divisions of the animal kingdom. The practical work of the laboratory is supplemented by lectures upon the organization and life-history of the forms examined, and that of allied forms, and upon their relations as indicated thereby. The course is devoted chiefly but not wholly to the study of the invertebrates, and one or more of the leading groups will be discussed and studied somewhat in detail in such a manner as to illustrate the principles and the meaning of zoÃ¶logical classification as based upon structure and development. Courses 2 and 3 are not both given the same year at present. For Undergraduates and Graduates. Course 4: Histology and Cytology: Course 1 prerequisite.âThe course comprises a comparative study of the elements of structure in the lower and the higher animals, and of their embryological development, in such manner as to elucidate the evolution of the tissues and tissue elements; together with a study of the phenomena of cell organization and cell life in both plants and animals. It includes practice in the more advanced methods of technique, and a critical discussion of the microscope and its intelligent use, as means of attaining the end in view. Course 5: Plant Morphology: Courses 1 and 2 prerequisite.âAn advanced course based on Course 2, the completion of which, or its equivalent, is necessary as a preliminary. In it the student is required to make special study of at least one group of AlgÃ¦ and one of Fungi; of one division of the ArchegoniatÃ¦, and of one family of Seed Plants. Careful examination will be made in each case of the structure and life-history of as many species of the group as possible. Assignment of work among the members of the class will be so made as to avoid as far as possible the duplication of work by students of the same class, each member working altogether independently. Course 6: Invertebrate Morphology: Courses 1 and 3 prerequisite.âIn this course the student will be required to make detailed and critical study of at least one class of the Protozoa; of one order of the CÅlenterata; and of the anatomy, histology, and as far as possible the embryology of representative members of one phylum of the cÅlomatous Metazoa. As in the preceding course, work will be assigned independently to the different members of the class. Courses 4 and 5 are not both given the same year at present. For Graduates Only. Course 7: Vertebrate Morphology: Courses 1, 3 and 4 prerequisite. âThe work of the course begins with a study of Vertebrate Embryology: this is followed by the detailed comparative study of the structure and development of one or more systems of organs as existing in the vertebrates and in those forms which may be regarded as phylogenetically related to the vertebrate stock. The library of the department contains a large amount of standard and periodical literature bearing on the subject matter of this course, and the reading of the student will be directed as far as possible in accordance with his individual needs. The more advanced work in Biology will be devoted chiefly to Vertebrate Histology and Morphology, each of the systems of organs being in turn critically studied; it will in substance be an extension of the work of Course 6. Such lectures will be given and such reading assigned as may be deemed advisable, but the larger part of the work will be done in the laboratory of the University and at such seaside or other laboratories elsewhere as may be designated, the principal object of the course being to train the student in methods of original investigation while he is becoming acquainted with the present state of our knowledge of the vertebrates and their allies. THE JOHN B. CARY, MEMORIAL SCHOOL OF BIBLICAL HISTORY AND LITERATURE. Associate Professor Forrest. The instruction in this department will be planned to furnish students that general acquaintance with the history and literature of the Bible which should constitute a part of every liberal education. The course will be accepted as an elective at large for the B. A. degree. Course 1: For the session of 1906-7. Old Testament History.â Special attention will be devoted to Hebrew origins, and the history of the Hebrew people will be sketched through its stages of nomadic life, early settlement, monarchy, dissolution of the state, exile, and restoration. The American Revised Version of the Bible will be the text-book. Instruction will be chiefly by lectures. Students will be required to do parallel reading, and to prepare frequent written exercises or reports on subjects assigned. Course 2: For the session of 1907-8. History and Literature of the English Bible.âThe history of the original documents from which our Bible has been derived will be traced. This will be followed by a more detailed study of the history of the various English Versions that have culminated in our present Authorized and Revised Versions. The literature of the Bible will then be examined in the light of modern literary canons, comparison being instituted between the various forms of Biblical literature and recognized masterpieces from general literature. Text-books and lectures. But one of these courses will be offered in any one session. The class will meet in the Bible Study Room at Madison Hall, three hours a week throughout the session. Days and hours of meeting will be determined to suit the convenience of students electing the course. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. EDWIN ANDERSON ALDERMAN, D. C. L., LL. D., President. WILLIAM MINOR LILE, LL. D., Dean. CHARLES ALFRED GRAVES, M. A., LL. D., Professor of the Law of Contracts, Torts, and Civil Procedure. WILLIAM MINOR LILE, LL. D., Professor of the Law of Persons, Mercantile Law, Corporations, and Equity. RALEIGH COLSTON MINOR, M. A., B. L., Professor of the Law of Real Property, and Public Law. Among the original schools contemplated in Mr. Jefferson's plan for the organization of the University of Virginia, was "Law: Municipal and Foreign; Embracing the General Principles, Theory, and Practice of Jurisprudence, together with the Theory and Principles of Constitutional Government." Accordingly the School of Law was established in 1826, and has been in continuous operation since, even during the four years of the civil war. The aim of the Department of Law has always been to maintain a high standard as a requirement for graduationâthe degree being conferred only upon such students as are thorough masters of the prescribed course of study. This policy has been rigorously enforced, and its wisdom has been vindicated by the high position to which the graduates of the law school are accustomed to attain at the bar or in public life. The course of instruction has been extended from time to time to conform to changing conditions and to meet the increasing needs of the profession. It is confidently believed that the enlarged course now offered will enable those who complete it more surely to maintain that rank at the bar which the University has always expected of her sons. Formerly it was possible for the law student to begin and complete his professional studies in the office of some friendly member of the bar âBlackstone's Commentaries and the Code of his State forming the main portion of his curriculum. Then the authorities were few, the leading principles alone were settled, and their application was comparatively simple. In more recent times, so widened is the scope of the law, so complex its principles, so nice and yet so important its distinctions, so numerous and conflicting the authorities, that it is scarcely practicable for even the most diligent student to master the subject, in its multiform phases, without the systematic instruction of skilled teachers. Furthermore, the increased and increasing scope and rigor of the examinations for admission to the bar in the several States call for a more extensive course of study than was afforded in former days by the law school, and a wider and more intimate knowledge of legal principles than can generally be acquired by private study. These considerations have led to a general conviction among the leaders of professional thought throughout the country that no student should essay the practice of the law who has not spent at least two years in close and attentive study in a law school. Indeed, the decided tendency is toward requiring even a longer period of study, as essential either to graduation or to admission to the bar. Required for Entrance upon the Work of the Department.âThe General Entrance Examination, or admission to the University by certificate or diploma, as stated in a preceding portion of this catalogue, pp. 78-87. For exemption from this rule in the case of Special Students not candidates for the degree in Law, see p. 83. All candidates for the degree must have attained the age of eighteen before entering the Law School. Course of Study.âThe course is planned with a view to acquaint the student familiarly and practically with the principles of his profession. Care is taken to teach him to think for himself, and to rely upon reason and principle, rather than upon memory; it being considered better that the student follow principle to its legitimate conclusion, though this be at variance with the decisions of the courts, than that he should arrive at a faultless result by the exercise of memory or by accident. The instruction is as thorough as possible, and is given partly through text-books and partly through lectures (on some subjects with the addition of illustrative cases), with careful daily examinations upon both. The daily quiz has long been a marked and, as experience has proved, a most valuable feature of the system of instruction. As cross-examination exposes error and develops truth, so the daily quiz enables the instructor to discover and rectify misconceptions of legal principles on the part of the student. The course occupies two years, and it is not permissible to apply for graduation in less time. Indeed, since future professional success depends upon complete mastery of elementary principles, it is not advisable for the student to devote less time to preparation for practice, even though he be not a candidate for graduation. It is a maxim sanctioned by long and wide experience that "he who is not a good lawyer when he comes to the bar, will seldom be a good one afterwards." In order to acquire such thorough knowledge of the elements of the law, thought as well as reading is requisite; and, for the purpose of thought, there must be time to digest as well as industry to acquire. One cannot gorge himself with legal principles and digest them afterwards; the process of assimilation, if it is to proceed healthfully and beneficially, must accompany the reception of knowledge. Arrangement of Classes.âThe course of instruction in the Department of Law comprises twelve separate classes. Six of these classes constitute the first year's studies, and six the studies of the second year. In the work of each year, there are nine lectures a week. The lectures occupy an hour and a half each, so that each year's course demands thirteen and a half hours of class-work each week, besides the work of the Moot and Practice courts. The following table exhibits an outline of the course: * * The first year Law Course may be substituted for certain electives in the College by candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. First Year. 1. The Law of Persons; Personal Property (including Sales); Wills of Personalty, and Administration. 2. The Law of Contracts. 3. The Law of Crimes and Criminal Procedure. 4. Mercantile Law: Negotiable Paper; Partnership; Insurance. 5. Torts, Bailments, and Carriers. 6. Theory of Government; Constitutional Law; International Law. Second Year. 7. Equity Jurisprudence and Procedure; Bankruptcy. 8. Pleading and Practice in Civil Cases. 9. The Law of Real Property. 10. The Law of Corporations. 11. The Law of Evidence. 12. Conflict of Laws. FIRST YEAR COURSE. 1. Law of Persons; Personal Property; Wills and Administration. Professor Lile. The preliminary lectures in this class are devoted to the nature, sources and evidences of the law; the absolute and relative rights of persons, and their constitutional guaranties; citizenship and naturalization; and subordinate magistrates. This is followed by a thorough drill in the subjects of principal and agent; husband and wife, including their common law property rights, with the modern statutory modifications; parent and child; and guardian and ward. Later, the study of the law of personal property (including the law of sales) is pursued in its various phases, followed by that of wills of personalty and administration. Under the latter classification are included the execution of wills; the qualification of personal representatives and the settlement of their accounts; the law of legacies and of distribution; and the complete administration of estates.âSeptember 16 to March 1âThree times a week. Text-Books.âLong's Domestic Relations; Mechem's Principles of Agency; Rood on Wills; R. M. Benjamin's Principles of Sales (2d ed.); The Professor's Printed Notes. 2. The Law of Contracts. Professor Graves. In this class, coming appropriately at the beginning of the Junior year, an effort is made to give a thorough, though elementary, course in the fundamentals of contract lawâthe formation, operation, and discharge of contractsâwith a full discussion of the doctrine of consideration, the requirements of the Statute of Frauds, and the consequences of the various kinds of illegality, whether at common law or by statute. The important subject of Quasi-Contract also receives adequate attention. The textbook on Contracts (Clark, following the analysis of Anson) is accompanied by a volume of Illustrative Cases, and is supplemented by the Professor's Printed Notes, explaining obscurities in the text, and calling attention to the recent cases in Virginia and elsewhere.âSeptember 16 to December 21 âThree times a week. Text-Books.âClark on Contracts (2d ed.); Hopkins's Cases on Contracts; The Professor's Printed Notes. 3. The Law of Crimes and Criminal Procedure. Professor Minor. In the study of this subject the student is made familiar with the general principles enforced by the courts in the administration of criminal justice. He is instructed as to the nature and elements of the more important crimes, both common law and statutory. Attention is given rather to the acquisition of a thorough knowledge of the leading principles than to the less important details, which, with a knowledge of the former, may readily be acquired. The course of instruction further embraces a study of the forms of procedure, the nature, organization and duties of the courts, and of grand and petit juries; arrests and bail; indictments, presentments, informations, and the various defenses, by way of demurrer, plea, or otherwise; together with the ordinary incidents of a criminal trial, such as challenges of jurors, motions for a new trial, bills of exceptions, motions in arrest of judgment, and writs of error. The last lectures of this course are devoted to the practical work of drawing indictments, pleas in abatement and other criminal pleading, and the making of motions for new trial, in arrest of judgment, etc.âSeptember 16 to January 20âThree times a week. Text-Books.âClark's Criminal Law; Beale's Criminal Pleading and Practice; The Professor's Notes. 4. Mercantile Law. Professor Lile. Under this head are grouped the subjects of Negotiable Instruments, Insurance, and Partnership. The instruction is made as practical as possible, by frequent use of the various mercantile instruments, as exhibits, in the course of the lectures. In the study of the law of negotiable paper, constant reference is made to the Negotiable Instruments Law, recently enacted in many States, including Virginia, and likely to be adopted throughout the country. In addition to the study of the general principles of the law of insurance, attention is devoted to particular clauses most usual in life, marine, and accident policies, and the New York Standard fire policy is studied, clause by clause, in the light of judicial construction.âMarch 1 to end of sessionâThree times a week. Text-Books.âBigelow on Bills, Notes, and Cheques (Student's Seriesâ2d ed.); Vance on Insurance; Mechem on Partnership; The Negotiable Instruments Law; The Professor's Notes. 5. Torts, Bailments, and Carriers. Professor Graves. The Law of Torts (or Non-Contract Law) is first taken up, and is studied in the order of Professor Bigelow's analysis, viz: (1) Breach of Duty to Refrain from Fraud or Malice; (2) Breach of Absolute Duty; and (3) Breach of Duty to Refrain from Negligence. In connection with the text-book, a volume of cases is used, which serve to illustrate and impress the abstract principles by concrete examples. On the completion of Torts, the subject of bailments is entered upon, and after an outline of the doctrines concerning the several kinds of Bailees (including Innkeepers), the Law of Carriers (of goods and passengers) is begun, and is considered with the fulness and thoroughness due to this important topic. No case-book is used, as the text and notes of Hutchinson on Carriers furnish abundant illustrations.âFrom January 3 to end of sessionâThree times a week. Text-Books.âBigelow on Torts (7th ed.); Chase's Cases on Torts (2d ed.); Hutchinson on Carriers ((2d ed.); The Professor's Notes. 6. Theory of Government; Constitutional Law; International Law. Professor Minor. The first lectures of this course are devoted to the Theory and Practice of Government. It is traced from its generally accepted originâthe familyâthrough its various stages to the modern forms, and effort is made by reasoning and comparison to point out the benefits of good government, the dangers of the bad. This is followed by Constitutional Law, in the study of which close attention is given to the judicial interpretation of the Federal Constitution, and to the great constitutional principles prevailing throughout the Union. As occasion demands, attention is called to the policy of various acts of legislation, and the student is warned against such as tend to exceed the limits of safe and constitutional restrictions. The checks and balances of the constitution are pointed out, and by comparing it with other constitutions, notably that of England, its weak as well as strong points are developed. Especial attention is given to such important subjects as ex post facto laws, laws impairing the obligation of contracts, due process of law, trial by jury, the power of taxation and of eminent domain, the police power, interstate commerce, etc. In the lectures upon Public International Law are considered the various rules which regulate the intercourse of one nation with another âsuch as the principles governing the origin, recognition, and equality of States; their rights in time of peace, and the means whereby they peaceably procure the enjoyment of those rights; the laws of war, and the rights and duties of belligerents, and the rules regulating the relations of neutral and belligerent States.âJanuary 20 to May 8âThree times a week. Text-Books.âCooley's Principles of Constitutional Law (3d ed.); Davis's International Law (2d ed.); The Professor's Notes. SECOND YEAR COURSE. 7. Equity Jurisprudence and Procedure; Bankruptcy. Professor Lile. After consideration of the origin and rise of the chancery jurisdiction, the student is led carefully through the usual subjects of equitable cognizance, and thence into the methods of procedure, as recognized in the High Court of Chancery in England, and as modified by statute or by rules of court in America. The contrast between legal and equitable principles and procedure is constantly adverted to, and the student is incited to the appreciation and cultivation of the fine sense of moral right underlying the doctrines of technical equity. The procedure in the Federal courts of chancery and in the Chancery courts of Virginia (where the distinction between legal and equitable procedure is still maintained) is made the basis of instruction. Practical work is required in draughting the various forms and pleadings, from the subpÅna to the final decree. In the law of Bankruptcy, sufficient instruction is given to afford to the student a fair working knowledge of general principles, and effort is made to secure as great familiarity as possible with the specific provisions of the National Bankruptcy Act of 1898, and the prescribed rules of procedure thereunder.âSeptember 16 to February 1âThree times a week. Text-Books.âMerwin's Equity; Text-books on Equity Practice and Bankruptcy (to be announced); The Professor's Notes. 8. Pleading and Practice. Professor Graves. In this class the subjects are Pleading and Practice at common law, and under the Virginia Statutes; and Federal Jurisdiction and Procedure. These are all confined to civil cases at law; criminal procedure and equity jurisdiction and procedure being taught elsewhere in the course. An outline of the instruction in this class may be given as follows: (1) The principles and rules of pleading at common lawâan intimate acquaintance with the common law rules and principles being insisted upon as essential to a proper knowledge of pleading under any system. (2) The organization and jurisdiction of the Virginia courts, and the proceedings in a law suit from beginning to end, including appellate proceedings; and the law of attachments, executions, homestead exemptions, etc. (3) The organization and jurisdiction of the Federal courts; removal of causes from State to Federal courts; the conformity or nonconformity of the procedure at law in the Federal courts with that in the courts of the State wherein they are held; and appellate proceedings in the Federal courts.âSeptember 16 to March 9âThree times a week. Text-Books.âAndrews's Stephen on Pleading; Hughes's Jurisdiction and Procedure of the United States Courts; The Professor's Printed Notes on Pleading, and Printed Questions; Burks's Printed Notes on Pleading, and Printed Questions. 9. The Law of Real Property. Professor Minor. The instruction in this class covers a detailed and careful study of the subject of Real Property Law, in all its branches. The nature and several kinds of real estate, and the various interests therein, with the principles appertaining to each, curtesy and dower, the relations of landlord and tenant, co-tenancies, the feudal tenures and principles, uses and trusts, the far-reaching effects of the Statute of Uses, the conditions, covenants, and other qualifications attached to conveyances of land, are reviewed at length. The historical connection between ancient and modern doctrines of conveyancing, with the statutory changes, are carefully traced. Remainders, reversions, and executory limitations, and the principles governing their creation, validity, and effect, together with the sources of title to lands, whether by descent or by the manifold forms of purchase, and the principles controlling each, the subjects of conveyances, contracts to convey, wills of lands, adverse possession, the registry of instruments of title, and the principles regulating the acquisition and validity of taxtitles, are investigated in detail. Throughout this course, emphasis is placed on common law principles, and effort is made to give the student a clear comprehension of these, by tracing them to their feudal or other sources, and by following them into the modern forms they have assumed under the guiding hand of courts and legislatures. Several lectures are devoted to the practical drafting of deeds, contracts, and wills, as these subjects are presented.âSeptember 16 to March 24 âThree times a week. Text-Books.âTo be announced. 10. The Law of Corporations. Professor Lile. In view of the modern development of the law of corporations, both in extent and importance, increasing attention is devoted to this branch of the curriculum. Among other subjects of lesser import, the lectures embrace the promotion, organization, and management of business corporations; the formation and enforcement of subscriptions for shares; corporate duties, powers, and liabilities; the relations between the corporation and the State, between the corporate body and its shareholders, officers, agents, and creditors, and the reciprocal relations of these with one another; the consolidation, dissolution, and winding up of corporations; and the appointment, duties, and powers of receivers. The principles applicable to municipal corporations, whether in their public or their proprietary characters, are fully elucidated; the subjects of municipal taxation, municipal bonds, franchises, rights and liabilities in connection with streets, as affecting the municipality, the public generally, and the abutting proprietors, are dealt with in detail.âFebruary 1 to end of sessionâThree times a week Text-Books.âMarshall on Corporations; Clephane on Business Corporationsâtheir Organization and Management; The Professor's Printed Notes on Private Corporations; The Professor's Printed Notes on Municipal Corporations. 11. Law of Evidence. Professor Graves. The principles of this subject are sought to be elucidated by the aid of the latest and most philosophical expositions of evidence, notably those of the late Professor James B. Thayer, of Harvard University, to whose work, "A Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law," constant reference is made. The text-book usedâVolume I of Greenleafâis edited by Professor Wigmore, and in it have been incorporated the results of the historical research and scientific analysis of Professor Thayer and others. But while great attention is paid to the rationale of the law of evidence, as indispensable to a mastery of its principles, the practical character of the rules of evidence is not overlooked, and an earnest effort is made, by careful consideration of the statutes and decisions, to give the student such a working knowledge of the subject as will enable him to apply its principles in the course of judicial investigations.âFrom March 10 to end of sessionâThree times a week. Text-Books.âGreenleaf on Evidence (16th ed., by Wigmore); The Professor's Printed Questions. 12. The Conflict of Laws. Professor Minor. As the facilities of commerce and intercourse between the various States and countries of the world increase, this subject becomes of graver importance, though as yet it has received rather scanty recognition at the hands of text-writers and law-schools. The course includes a discussion of the nature and various kinds of domicil; the law governing status, and the conveyance of personal property abroad; the validity, construction, and effect of foreign wills, successions, and administrations; foreign marriages and divorces; transactions relating to real estate; the execution, interpretation, and validity of foreign contracts; the law governing the effect of foreign judgments in rem or in personam; the recovery of damages for foreign torts; the situs of crimes; the application of the lex fori; and the modes of pleading and proving foreign laws.âMarch 24 to end of sessionâThree times a week. Text-Book.âMinor on Conflict of Laws. MOOT COURT. A Moot Court is organized by the students in the First Year's course for the discussion of legal questions. Its meetings begin at the opening and continue to the end of the session, with such interruptions only as are incident to the proximity of the examinations. Attendance is voluntary, as presence during the debates is intended to be a privilege and not a burden. But every candidate for the degree is required to argue at least one case in the Moot Court, and to hand in a carefully prepared brief of his argument, with a digest of the authorities relied on. The questions are chosen by the Law Faculty, one or more of whom preside over the discussions. Interest and life are added to the proceedings by the open debate held after the argument, the presiding judge acting as interlocutor, and leading into the debate those whom diffidence prompts to silence. The following gentlemen served as officers of the Moot Court during the session of 1906-1907: Associate Judges Herbert M. Peck, Beaver Dam, Wis. Russell L. Bradford, Norfolk, Va. Clerks Robert N. Wilkin, New Philadelphia, Ohio. Joseph A. Harvey, Providence, R. I. PRACTICE COURT.* * Practice Court Hour.âIn Pleading and Practice at Law, the hour will be on Thursday, from 1 to 2 p. m., the term of the court continuing from October 1 to December 21. In Equity Procedure, the hour will be on Thursday, from 10 to 11 a. m., the term of the court continuing from January 3 to March 15. The Practice Court, presided over by one or more members of the Law Faculty, and designed for students of the second year, is organized October 1, two weeks after the beginning of the session. Its sessions are held weekly. Attendance is obligatory on candidates for graduation. The object of the Practice Court is to afford to the student practical facility in the procedure which he will be called on to apply at the bar, and to familiarize him with the whole proceedings in actions at law, and suits in equity. PRIZES. Edward Thompson Company Prize.âThis prize for the best thesis on a subject assigned by the Law Faculty is awarded annually in a competition open to members of the second year class, who are candidates for graduation. It is donated by the Edward Thompson Company, of Northport, N. Y., and consists of a set of the second edition of the American and English Encyclopedia of Law (32 volumes), of the estimated value of $240. LIBRARYâLEGAL BIBLIOGRAPHY. The Law Library is accommodated by its own library rooms, separate from the general University library. The rooms are heated by steam and lighted by electricity, and are located with special reference to the convenience of the law students. A librarian is in attendance during working hours. The library contains complete sets of the decisions of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, United States Supreme Court, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. It contains the National Reporter System, complete; the American Decisions; American Reports; American State Reports; Law Reports Annotated; a valuable collection of English Reports; and all the modern search-books, in the form of general digests (including the Century) and Encyclopedias, besides a large collection of text-books. While the student is not encouraged too early to venture for himself into either cases or text-books, save for the purpose of verifying or clearing up some proposition of the lecture, or for the preparation of opinions or briefs, he is incited to familiarize himself not only with the leading cases to which his attention is called, but especially with the bibliography of the law and the use of the books. To the latter subject, in addition to the instruction incidentally given, several lectures are specially devoted. The student is taught that books are the working tools of the lawyer, and that facility in handling them, in the office and in the court room, is an indispensable professional acquirement. He is instructed how to consult authorities and run down cases; to distinguish doctrine from dicta; to analyze, criticise, and compare cases; to distinguish imperative authority from that which is persuasive only; to prepare briefs; and, generally, so to accustom himself to law books and their use as to enable him to investigate, with intelligence and skill, any question that may come within the scope of his duty at the bar. EXAMINATIONS AND DEGREES. The degree of Bachelor of Laws (LL. B.) is conferred upon such students as have attended two full sessions of nine months each (for provision as to late entrance see page 171) of the law school, and who manifest an intimate acquaintance with all the subjects embraced in the course, evidenced by successfully passing all written examinations, and who have satisfactorily performed the work of the Moot and Practice courts and other assigned work. Any one of the classes of the first or second year may be completed separately. Upon the satisfactory completion of any class, a certificate is issued to the student, followed by the diploma of graduation when (and not until) all the examinations have been successfully passed. Candidates for the degree, who in any session have less than one full year's course to complete, may be required to take such additional work, and to stand such additional examinations as shall be prescribed. Fall Examinations.âThe privilege of standing Fall examinations is granted to candidates for graduation who have fallen slightly below the required standard, and who have not more than two classes to complete. These Fall examinations for the session of 1907-1908 will begin September 17, 1907, and will continue from day to day until completed, in the following order: (1) Equity Jurisprudence and Procedure; (2) Pleading and Practice; (3) Conflict of Laws; (4) Corporations; (5) Evidence; (6) Real Property Admission to Advanced Standing.âNo credit is given for attendance at another law school, nor for time spent in private reading. The candidate for graduation must spend both the Junior and Senior year in residence here. Preliminary Education.* * For entrance requirements see pp. 78-87 âStudents, and their parents or guardians, are warned that the Law is peculiarly an intellectual profession, and demands for its successful prosecution, whether at the Law School or in the broader fields of professional life, a well-trained mind. If it be true that untrained intellects, in rare instances, under diligent and persistent effort, develop after entrance upon practice, such exceptional cases but serve to illustrate the rule, that out of a given number of young men entering upon the study of the Law, those with sound preliminary training will have incomparably the advantage, while those without it will be seriously handicapped, and are likely never to rise above mediocrity in their profession. The experience of the Law Facultyânay, of all law teachersâis, that the standing and progress of law students are, in large measure, in the ratio of their academic preparation. Young gentlemen are therefore advised not to begin their legal studies until they have completed an academic course approximating that ordinarily required for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. Special Students.âStudents who can attend but a single session are advised to take special courses, which the arrangement of the classes readily permits. Over-zealousness, by which an ambitious student is beguiled into the assumption of more work than he can thoroughly master in a single year, leads to cramming and inaccuracy, and often to complete failure. With this admonition, the special student is free to select his own work. The following course is suggested for students who propose to attend for a single session only: First year classes 1, 3, and 4 (see p. 162); second year classes, 8, 9, and 11; or, if the student has already had some legal training, numbers 7 and 10 of the second year may be added. The first course suggested would require 15 hours, and the second 19Â½ hours, of class-work a week. Late Entrance.âRegistration commences Thursday, September 12, and the work of the Law School begins promptly September 16, and continues until the middle of June. Students are advised that late entrance is a serious hindrance to progress. The student who enters late must begin his work at the point to which the work has advanced at the time of his entrance, and credit for a full year's attendance cannot be given in case of entrance after November 1. As regards conditions of admission in case of late entrance, reference is made to the General Entrance Requirements, as stated on a preceding page. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses at the University of a student in the Department of Law may be estimated at from $330 upwards, according to the mode of living, for each session. A fuller statement regarding expenses may be found on preceding pages of this catalogue. SCHEDULE OF LECTURES AND EXAMINATIONS. 1907-1908. Law Department.

(b) GermanâGrammar Review and Syntax, German Classics. (c) FrenchâGrammar Review and Syntax, French Classics. (d) SpanishâGrammar Review and Syntax, Spanish Classics. Bookkeeping and Business Forms. If time permits, more than one of the above elective studies may be taken. In high schools of two or more teachers other subjects may be added if it can be done without infringing upon the time of required subjects. The above curriculum contains 65 "counts," a count being one period per week for a school year. Of these subjects the applicant for admission to the Medical Department must have completed the entire course of three years in Mathematics and English, two years in language other than English, two years in History, and one year in Scienceâ49 counts in all. The remaining 16 counts may be furnished at the option of the applicant by further credits in the various branches of the curriculum. Applicants unable to satisfy these requirements by acceptable certificates, in part or in whole, may remove their deficiencies by satisfactory examinations. Further information concerning the character of these examinations may be obtained by addressing the Dean of the University, or Mr. Howard Winston, Registrar, at the University. The work of each of the four years of the course in Medicine continues through the nine months of the University session, beginning on the twelfth day of September and closing on the Saturday immediately preceding the fifteenth day of the following June. The studies included are arranged as follows: During the first session: Medical Chemistry; Normal Histology and Embryology; Descriptive Anatomy and Anatomy of Nervous System; Physiological Chemistry. During the second session: Physiology; Bacteriology; Pathology; Anatomy; Pharmacognosy. During the third session: Obstetrics; Materia Medica; Practice of Medicine; Surgery; Clinical Diagnosis; Diseases of the Eye and Ear; Dispensary Clinics. During the fourth session: Neurology; Pediatrics; Therapeutics; Hygiene; Abdominal Surgery; Dermatology; Gynecology; Medical Jurisprudence; Dispensary and Hospital Clinics. An examination of this system will show that the work of the first year is given to those sciences which are fundamental to the entire work of the remaining part of the course; that of the second year includes the study of those sciences, more distinctively medical, which are based upon the work of the previous year, while they in turn underlie the more strictly professional subjects of study; these latter are begun in the second year, while the third and fourth years are devoted wholly to them. The larger part of the work of the first year is accompanied by practical work in the laboratory; the same is true in great measure of the work of the second year, while in the third, and especially the fourth year, the time of the student is devoted largely to practical clinical instruction. The facilities afforded by the University for such work will be more fully described in the statements which follow concerning the different subjects included in the course. Relations of the Student in the Second and Succeeding Years.â For the purposes of this Department the attainment of a grade of eighty per cent. upon a subject is regarded as satisfactory, and students who obtain such grades are excused from further attendance upon the subjects in question. Students who attain a grade less than eighty per cent. but as much as seventy per cent. on one or more subjects are entitled to admission to the Fall Examinations of the following session as explained in a subsequent paragraph, when deficiencies may be removed by satisfactory examinations. Those who receive a grade of less than seventy per cent. on one or more subjects are regarded as having failed thereon, and are required to take such subject or subjects over during the succeeding year, without, however, the payment of any additional fee. Students whose failures extend to all the subjects of a given year are not permitted to go on to the work of the succeeding year, but are required to confine themselves to a repetition of the work of the year upon which they have failed. Students will not be allowed to undertake the work of the third or fourth year until they have completed that of the first year, save by special consent of the Medical Faculty based in each case upon a careful examination of the student's real interest. A student may not be examined upon the entire course in any subject more than three times. Failure upon the third trial involves withdrawal from the Department of Medicine. Advanced Standing.âStudents are admitted to advanced standing in the second and third years under the following conditions: 1. Satisfaction of the requirements for entrance into this Department. 2. The presentation of a certificate from an accredited school of medicine showing that the applicant has completed work equivalent to that maintained by this Department with a grade of at least eighty per cent. in each subject for which credit is sought. Applicants complying with these conditions will be admitted to advanced standing without examination. Applicants who have not completed all of the work of the year or years preceding that to which they seek admission are admitted to the Fall Examinations under the conditions stated in the preceding paragraph. The right is reserved in every case to obtain satisfactory evidence of the genuineness of a certificate by correspondence with the proper authority of the school from which the applicant comes. No credit can be allowed for time not spent in a regular school of medicine; except that applicants holding the degree of A. B. or B. S. from a reputable college or university will be admitted to the second year, provided their academic course has included the equivalent of the first-year medical course. A student who is already a graduate of a reputable school of medicine may be received as a student in this Department for the fourth year. Certificates of Attendance.âStudents who attend the whole regular course of one or more of the four years are entitled to certificates of attendance. Requirements for Graduation.âThe degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred by the University of Virginia upon candidates who have complied with the entrance requirements of this Department; attended a regular medical course of four years of at least eight months each, the last two of which must have been at this institution; and passed satisfactory examinations upon all of the subjects included in the medical course. Examinations.âThese are in writing, accompanied in most subjects by individual practical examinations. The regular examinations are held during the session. In addition, examinations are held each year during the week immediately preceding the beginning of lectures. To the latter are admitted: 1. Students of the previous session, who from illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty, were unable to present themselves for examination in any particular subject at the regular time. 2. Students who at the regular examination of the preceding year have attained a grade less than eighty per cent. but as much as seventy per cent. on one or more subjects, as explained in a preceding paragraph. 3. Certain applicants for advanced standing, as explained in the paragraph under that heading. The Fall Examinations for 1907-8 begin September ninth, and close September fourteenth. Application for admission to them should be made in writing to Dr. R. H. Whitehead, Dean of the Department of Medicine, not later than September first. A General Oral Examination for Graduation is held at the close of the session on all the different branches on which the candidate for the degree of Medicine has passed during either that session or some preceding one. This is intended to test the permanent acquisition of such general knowledge as every practitioner of medicine should possess. Expenses.âThe tuition fees are $110 for the first year, $100 for the second year, $80 for the third year, and $60 for the fourth year. The annual expenses exclusive of tuition are $40 for the University fee (which entitles the student to the use of the library, the gymnasium, to medical attention, etc.), an average of about $200 for living expenses, and of $20 for books. The special fees for single subjects are, Medical Chemistry, $30; Histology and Embryology (including materials), $35; Anatomy (including materials), $45; Pathology, $25; Bacteriology, $35; Physiology, $30; Materia Medica, $20; Therapeutics, $10; Embryology, $10; Obstetrics (with manikin work), $20; Gynecology, $20; Surgery, $20; Practice of Medicine, $30; Clinical Diagnosis, $10; Dermatology and Diseases of the Eye and Ear, $15; Hygiene, $10; Medical Jurisprudence, $10; Clinics (collectively), $30. CHEMISTRY. Professor Mallet. Professor Dunnington. In this course the students are taught Chemical Physics and the general principles of Chemistry, and are carried through a course of Descriptive Chemistry, inorganic and organic; their attention is directed, whenever an occasion presents itself, to the application of chemical principles to Physiology, the Practice of Medicine, Therapeutics, Toxicology, and Sanitary Science. A course of laboratory exercises in Practical Chemistry, with especial relation to the needs of the medical student, is given by Professor Dunnington, and is a part of the prescribed general course in Medicine. ? An important change in the programme of this School is in contemplation, and will probably become effective for next session (that of 1907-8). Due notice of this will be given by a separate published circular at as early a date as possible. HISTOLOGY AND EMBRYOLOGY. Professor Tuttle. Mr. Goodwin. Adjunct Professor Flippin. Mr. Fletcher. Each lecture of the course is accompanied by two hours of practical work in the laboratory illustrative of the topics discussed. The laboratory is convenient, well lighted, and amply equipped; thirty desks are provided with microscopes, accessory apparatus, and all necessary reagents, and the class is divided into working sections not exceeding that number; desks are assigned by lot at the opening of the session, and apparatus issued as needed from time to time. Each student is required to provide himself with a section razor, a set of dissecting instruments, and with slides, covers, and labels for microscopical preparations; all other appliances are provided by the laboratory without charge. The lectures of the course are devoted in part to the allied subjects of Histology and Histological Anatomy, and in part to Embryology. In the first part of this division of the course the tissues and their component elements are carefully examined, both singly and in their primary aggregations, as are also those organs which consist largely of one form of tissue. This is followed by a discussion of the essential structure of the animal cell and of the phenomena of cell-division. The reproductive elements, the process of fertilization, and the formation of the blastoderm and its primary layers are then considered. The remainder of the course is devoted to an examination of the more complex organs and systems of organs, their constituent tissues and the relations between them being studied; and to a description of the embryological development of each system in connection with the study of its adult structure. The attainments of the student are tested by both written and practical examinations; his standing for the year is determined by an average of the total marks received. ANATOMY. Professor Whitehead. Dr. Norford. Adjunct Professor Byrnes. The course of study in this subject extends through the whole of the first year and the first six months of the second year. It is divided as follows: Anatomy 1.âThis consists of a systematic study of the bones, joints, and viscera; on the completion of which a "part" (either the head and neck, upper extremity and thorax, or lower extremity and abdomen) is assigned to each student for dissection and study. Anatomy 2.âThis consists of the study, in some detail, of the anatomy of the central nervous system, both gross and microscopic. It is pursued during the last ten weeks of the first year. Anatomy 3.âDuring the first six months of the second year each student finishes his study of the structure of the body by dissecting the two parts which he did not dissect during his first year. Throughout the course there are occasional lectures, frequent quizzes and demonstrations, and several written examinations. Much importance is attached to the daily work in the laboratory. PHYSIOLOGY. Professor Hough. Dr. Austin. The work in Physiology begins in the spring term of the first year with the fundamentals of physiological chemistry. Occasional lectures and frequent recitations are accompanied by extensive laboratory work, for which ample facilities are provided. The student is expected to acquire during this term a practical acquaintance with the more important compounds occurring in the body, especially with their chemical structure, relation and reactions. Practical laboratory tests during the course, as well as a written examination at the end, are required. During the second year functional physiology is studied;âthe blood and lymph; muscle and nerve; the circulation; respiration; alimentation, digestion, and nutrition; the sense organs, and the central nervous system. The subject is taught by lectures, recitations, demonstrations, and constant laboratory work. The applications of physiology to personal hygiene are discussed in conferences. The satisfactory completion of the laboratory work is as necessary to a clear record in this school as is the passing of a final examination. BACTERIOLOGY. Professor Bunting. Dr. Meloy. Bacteriology is taught as a laboratory subject during the fall term of the second year. In it the students are acquainted with the methods of the modern bacteriological laboratory, through their actual employment, and acquire a working knowledge of the more important pathogenic organisms. The laboratory is well equipped with the apparatus necessary for such a course. The practical laboratory work is supplemented by lectures and recitations on the general biology of bacteria, on their relation to infection and disease, and on immunity. PATHOLOGY. Professor Bunting. Dr. Meloy. The course in Pathology is a direct continuation of the course in Bacteriology, instruction being given in it from the Christmas recess until the close of the year. Pathological Anatomy and Pathological Histology are taught in the laboratory by the study of gross and microscopic specimens following a descriptive lecture, and with personal demonstration by the instructing staff. The principles of General Pathology which cannot be fully treated in the laboratory are considered in lectures and recitations throughout the course. The conduct of autopsies and the recording of results are taught in the post mortem service at the University Hospital. An optional course in Surgical Pathology and Pathological Technique is offered to second year students. OBSTETRICS. Professor Macon. This subject is presented to the student by lectures, with frequent oral examinations, by a series of manikin demonstrations, by work with the living subject in the wards of the Hospital, and by attendance on patients in the out-patient obstetric service connected with the Dispensary. The manikin course forms an important part of the work not only for teaching presentation, position and posture, but also the mechanism of normal and abnormal labor, and application of forceps. The class is divided into sections of five each, and a knowledge of the manikin work will form a part of the examination for graduation in this department. After a section has finished the manikin course, it is taken into the wards of the Hospital where the methods of examination, particularly abdominal palpation, are practised on the living subject. Each section is required to fill up a carefully prepared form so that all the details of the case of the patient before labor is made familiar to the student. The number of out-patient cases is increasing year by year and is becoming an important part of the teaching. The clinical assistant in obstetrics is prepared at any time to accompany a student to the home of a patient, and is provided with the necessary armamentarium for conducting a case. The large negro population in the neighborhood of Charlottesville affords a class of patients which presents all the difficulties to clean work that are offered by ignorance and poverty. No better practice can be had for one who is trying to educate an "aseptic center." If asepsis can be secured in a hovel it can be preserved in a palace. The student is thus taught how to manage cases by himself and at the same time avoids falling into the slovenly habits he is sure to form without proper guidance. PHARMACOGNOSY. Professor Lambeth. The Department is provided with a good collection of drugs, both crude and prepared, with which the students are made familiar as dealt with in the lectures. Exercises in prescription-writing are given weekly for several months, these exercises being required both in the ordinary English or apothecary system and the French or metric system. The course is in part a laboratory course, students working in sections which vary in size according to the work in hand. The practical experience given is intended to acquaint the student as thoroughly as possible with the physical and chemical properties of the materials used in the treatment of disease, to which he will find it much easier to add the physiological action, than if he had approached the subject first from the medical side. SURGERY. Professor Randolph. Professor Browning. General Surgery, embracing the Principles of Surgery, Surgical Diseases, Surgical Diagnosis, and Orthopedic Surgery, is taught in a series of lectures given three times a week extending throughout the third year. Amputations and ligations, the application of splints, bandages and apparatus for the different fractures, are shown upon the cadaver. This is supplemented by daily surgical clinics conducted in the amphitheater and wards of the Hospital by Professors Randolph and Browning. Each student is required to pass a practical examination on the application of splints and bandages in addition to the regular written examination upon the subject. ABDOMINAL SURGERY. Professor Browning. A series of lectures upon the principles of this subject is given during the latter half of the fourth year. Methods and procedures difficult of demonstration in the surgical amphitheater are illustrated to the class in small sections upon cadavers and the lower animals. Students are required to act as assistants in laparotomies as a part of their instruction in this courese. PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. Professor Davis. Dr. Magruder. Adjunct Professor Flippin. The Theory and Practice of Medicine is taught in a systematic course of lectures, which are supplemented by clinical teaching at the Dispensary and Hospital, during the third and fourth years. Neurology is taken up in the fourth year, and in connection with it instruction in electro-therapeutics is given. The students of the graduating class are taken daily in sections through the wards of the Hospital and individually instructed on the cases present. At the Dispensary case histories are taken and management indicated by the students of the third and fourth years, whose methods and results are then criticised by the teacher. A practical examination in diagnosis and treatment is required of each student at the end of his last session. PEDIATRICS. Professor Davis. This course of lectures is intended to point out in a brief way how disease is modified by childhood and to indicate how the difficulties of diagnosis and treatment due to an early age may be best encountered. The student is taught how to prepare food for infants. Instruction in the practical details of the subject will be given as far as possible by work in the wards of the Hospital. MATERIA MEDICA. Professor Barringer. This course embraces not only the most important drugs of the last revision of the U. S. PharmacopÅia, but also such members of the newer materia medica as bid fair to become official. In addition to the physiological action of the drugs, stress is laid upon the chemistry of all active principles that may influence their administration or combination. CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS. Adjunct Professor Flippin. The purpose of this course is to familiarize the student with modern laboratory methods as applied to the diagnosis of disease. The systematic examination of blood, sputum, vomitus, urine, fÃ¦ces, exudates, transudates and milk is first practiced; after which, specimens from selected cases in the wards of the Hospital are studied with reference to the application of information thus obtained to the recognition of specific diseases. THERAPEUTICS. Professor Barringer. The subject of Therapeutics is taken up among the studies of the fourth year. The range of the work embraces both general and special therapeutics, whether rational or empirical, but a constant effort will be made throughout to trace those general underlying principles, the existence of which alone enables this subject to be called a science. The method pursued will be that of taking up in order the perversions of the various organs and functions rather than the specific forms of disease. HYGIENE. Professor Lambeth. The course begins with an historical sketch of the development of preventive medicine, including short biographical sketches of the pioneers of Hygiene. With this introduction the story of the natural history of contagious and infectious diseases, modes of propagation and methods of prevention engage the attention of the student. With this preparation, the chemical and bacteriological contamination of food, water, air, and soil is made an important study. Instruction is also begun in the proper location and construction of habitations, hospitals, schoolhouses, etc., with especial reference to the modern methods of heating, ventilating and draining. Notice is taken of the special relations involved in military and naval hygiene. DISEASES OF THE EYE AND EAR. Professor Barringer. Dr. Hedges. The study of the Diseases of the Eye and Ear is here solely from the standpoint of the general practitioner. No attempt is made to prepare a "specialist" and no instruction is given in refraction. In the belief, however, that a good practitioner should have a reasonable knowledge of any disease he is likely to meet, a two months' course on the above subjects is given. The elementary use of the ophthalmoscope as an instrument of diagnosis, as well as the use of the head mirror, etc., is practically taught. GYNECOLOGY. Professor Randolph. In Gynecology instruction is given by lectures and recitations, and the plastic operations necessary to repair injuries of the pelvic structures are shown during the course. Practical training in the details of gynecological treatment is given at the Dispensary. MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE. Professor Mallet. In this course the student is instructed in the principles of the science, and taught how to apply these principles when he is summoned as a witness in a court of law. DERMATOLOGY. Professor Barringer. Dr. Venable. A brief course of lectures is given on this subject, embodying a consideration of the commoner diseases met with in general practice. At the Dispensary one clinic a week throughout the session is devoted to the diseases of the skin and a fair working knowledge of the subject is thus obtained by the student. CLINICAL INSTRUCTION. Dr. Davis. Dr. Browning. Dr. Magruder. Dr. Venable. Dr. Randolph. Dr. Macon Dr. Hedges. Dr. Nelson. Dr. Flippin. Dr. Burke. Dr. Rea. Dr. Crenshaw. DISPENSARY. The Dispensary has been remodeled and refitted along modern lines so that the material is utilized for purposes of instruction to a much greater extent than is usually done in clinical teaching. The amphitheater is so arranged that no student is over fifteen feet from the clinical chair, and each can thus understand and appreciate all that is shown him. Sections of the graduating class assemble in turn before the hour for the clinic and examine the cases, on which they report and are questioned by the instructor. A record is kept of their proficiency in this respect; to which special importance is attached when estimating their fitness for graduation. About fifteen hundred cases are treated each year. There is a daily clinic at the Dispensary, in each case occupying the entire afternoon, distributed through the week as follows: Monday, Dr. Davis, Medical. Tuesday, Dr. Venable, Dermatologic. Wednesday, Dr. Magruder, Medical (Physical Diagnosis). Thursday, Dr. Randolph, Gynecological. Friday, Dr. Hedges, Ophthalmic. Saturday, Dr. Nelson, Genito-urinary. In addition to the work at the Dispensary, the class in sections have seen numerous important surgical operations outside (besides those at the Hospital), under the care of the clinical teachers. A large number of the students have been in a similar manner brought into intimate contact with cases of serious illness of various kinds. In obstetrical work, most of the class have been able to see at least one case each, while some members have had as many as eight or nine cases; it is believed that more systematic arrangements can now be made, and that in the future every member of the class can have one or more cases during the session. Regular attendance upon the daily clinics is required in the last two years of the course. THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HOSPITAL. This hospital is the property of the University and is under the exclusive control of its Medical Faculty. It was designed and is administered as a teaching hospital, being so arranged that free use can be made of its clinical material without in any way disturbing or violating the privacy of other patients. The buildings are arranged upon the pavilion system, consisting of a central structure four stories in height, devoted to the purposes of administration. This building contains, on the main floor, reception and consultation rooms; an amphitheater, with sterilizing and anÃ¦sthetizing rooms attached, and an X-ray room. The upper floors furnish accommodation for the nurses of the training school, while the basement contains the heating plant, laundry, kitchen, etc. From this building corridors three stories in height lead out to the wards. These wards, having a capacity of about 18 beds each, are beautifully lighted, have direct indirect hot water radiators, and forced ventilation. Opening from each ward on the east, is a large protected porch, of great value to convalescents. The South wing is complete and has been in use for several years. The North wing, now in process of construction, will be completed and equipped by the beginning of the coming session (1907-08). This will give the hospital a capacity of about 120 beds. The equipment throughout is new and conforms in all respects to the best usage of the day. During the past year the number of patients has steadily increased and the range of influence of the hospital has been greatly widened, patients being received from all parts of the state. Attention is particularly called to the fact that this hospital, with its associated dispensary, constitutes a valuable adjunct to the teaching facilities of the Medical School. The variety of cases presented, and more especially the opportunities offered for a thorough study of the individual case, afford unusually satisfactory conditions for clinical instruction.

UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HOSPITAL TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES. This School was established in 1901 and turned out its first graduating class in June, 1903. Its aim is to give young women, desirous of acquiring the art of nursing, the same care and thorough training in their calling which is now afforded young men studying the science of medicine. Instruction in the primary branches of medicine is given to pupil-nurses by the professors in the medical department of the University of Virginia, while the clinical instructors at the University Hospital give lectures upon their respective courses. Three years is the required time for graduation, and all candidates must enter prepared to go through the full course of instruction and hospital training. Candidates for the school should apply in their own handwriting to the Superintendent of Nurses, University Hospital, Charlottesville, Va. These applications must be accompanied by certificates of good character, good health and sufficient education to profit by the instruction offered. No candidate under twenty-one years of age, or over thirty-five, will be received. Pupil Nurses: Misses Elizabeth Baker, Caroline Bragg, Evelyn Mackreth, Georgia Nottingham, Caroline Watson, Myrtle Smith, Willie Morrow, Fannie Fry. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HOSPITAL NURSES' EXCHANGE.

To insure this, students are examined in the following subjects: 1. English, including grammar, composition, elementary rhetoric, and courses of reading equivalent to those prescribed from year to year by the Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of the Southern States. 2. Arithmetic and Algebra, including a complete course in numerical Arithmetic and Algebra through Quadratics. Equations and problems will be given involving not one unknown only, but two or more. 3. Plane Geometry, embracing the whole of the usual five books (the mensuration of the circle being included). Not only the classical propositions of the text-books will be required, but original exercises will also be set. 4. Solid Geometry and Elementary Plane Trigonometry, embracing the usual propositions in Solid Geometry on planes and lines, prisms and pyramids, the regular polyhedra, and the three round bodies, with Spherical Geometry; also the fundamental principles of Plane Trigonometry and their application to the solution of triangles and the reduction of trigonometrical formulÃ¦. The applicant may substitute for the last of these examinations any one of the Entrance Electives as given in the General Catalogue. The substitution is not, however, advised. Ample mathematical preparation is most desirable. Applicants for admission may present in lieu of the above examinations equivalent certificates from some accredited preparatory school. Such certificates must guarantee the adequacy of the student's preliminary training. From and after June 1st, 1908, the revised entrance requirements will be in force. A special circular giving the details of the new requirements will be sent on application. The regular entrance examinations are held at the University in June (1907, 4th-7th) and in September (1907, 10th-13th). Certificates of preparation should be submitted to the Dean of the University not later than September 1st. Sample Entrance Examination papers will be furnished on request. For admission as a student the age of the applicant must be at least sixteen years. A certificate of honorable discharge from the school last attended by him or other evidence of general good conduct must be presented. Candidates, who have furnished such certificates, and have satisfied the entrance requirements as above stated, will be registered by the Dean with the concurrence of their several professors as students of Engineering. The formal registration must be made during the first four days of the session (1907, September 11th-14th). Late entrance is forbidden except by special consent of the President and then with an additional fee. The lectures begin on the first Monday of the session, on and after which day all classes meet in exact accordance with the official schedule. No excuse for absence at lecture or other required exercise will be granted, except by reason of sickness or upon the written leave of the Dean. The laws of the University require from every student regular and diligent application to his studies, as well as decorous, sober, and upright conduct, as long as he remains a member of the school, whether he be within the precincts or not. It any student fails to fulfil the purposes for which he ought to have come to the University and be not likely to fulfil them, the Dean will inform him of the objections to his conduct and afford him reasonable opportunity of defense and amendment. If the student continues delinquent, the Faculty will request his withdrawal. METHODS OF INSTRUCTION. The Department of Engineering is conducted by a Faculty of sixteen professors and other instructors. It furnishes complete four-year courses leading to degrees in each of the four great divisions of Engineeringâ Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, and Mining. Their common basis is the axiom that clear understanding and firm grasp of scientific principles furnish the only sure foundation for the labors of the modern scientific engineer. Their aim is to secure: First, thorough drill in Pure and Applied Mathematics, without which no engineer can justly pretend to a sound knowledge of his profession. Second, broad, accurate and thorough training in those Pure and Applied Sciences, of which rational engineering is simply the concrete expression. Third, adequate knowledge of the Special Elective Topics, which constitute the subject matter of each great division of Engineering Science. The methods of instruction employed to effect this aim are thorough, rational, and modern. The courses are given by the joint use of text-books and lectures. They are made objective by parallel practical courses in the drafting room, the shop, the laboratory and the field. They are enforced by daily oral examinations, by frequent written reviews, by copious exercises in drafting and computation, and by abundant illustration from experiments and specimens. At the end of each term the student's mastery of the course is tested by a rigid written examination, and his fitness for graduation is judged by the combined result of term work and examination grades. The object pursued throughout is to give to the thoughtful student an intelligent mastery of scientific method and with this aim in view certain departures have been made from the more ordinary routine processes of engineering education. The Drafting Exercises are not separated from and independent of the theoretical studies, designed to give merely a technical mastery of the draftman's tools. They run parallel with the lecture course, and are used to illustrate and enforce its lessons. Each problem assigned is made, if possible, an exercise not only in drawing but in design, and serves to cultivate power of analysis as well as manual skill. The Shop-work is planned for engineers and not for artisans. The equipment is of the best quality, but the time and energies of the student are not wasted on too extended a course. Enough is done to give intelligent ideas as to constructive materials and shop methods, and the manual dexterity necessary for laboratory research is in some measure secured. After that the student turns to higher problems. The Laboratory Exercises begin with the beginning of the Student's work and continue to the end. Like the drafting exercises they run parallel with the lecture course, or are the objective prelude to it. As far as is possible each student verifies for himself by actual tests and measurements the fundamental laws of engineering science. In Field-work enough practice is required from every student to give him clear understanding and ready use of the standard field instruments. Students of Civil Engineering have ample practice in the later years of the course, in conjunction with the special elective topics pursued by them. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. The following condensed summary gives by title the various courses of instruction offered in the Engineering Department, arranged in an orderly curriculum of four years. Those courses, for which no special note is given, must be taken by all candidates for degrees. The special elective courses are in each case followed by a note, showing the degree for which they are required. The name of the professor and the lecture hour follow in brackets after each title; Arabic numbers are for lectures on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; Roman for lectures on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The courses are so ordered that the specified entrance requirements are adequate for the work of the First Year. Each succeeding year presupposes the completion of the work for all the foregoing years. Students are advised to adhere strictly to the regular programmes. The arrangements specified in them have been carefully planned and are the best. Haphazard election is discouraged and in extreme cases will be prohibited. No student will be registered for a course unless in the opinion both of the Dean and of the professor his preliminary training has fitted him for the successful pursuit of that course. FIRST YEAR.

Every candidate for a degree in Engineering will be required at the beginning of his graduating year to submit to the Dean some subject for independent study suited to the student's especial course and aims. After such subject has been approved by the Dean and the Professor in charge, the student will be expected to carry out for himself the necessary literary and laboratory researches and to present his results in the form of a thesis. Such thesis must be typewritten on standard sheets, bound in a proper cover, and handed in for final approval not later than May 25th. All necessary computations and drawings must accompany the thesis. Serious weight will be given to this work in estimating the student's fitness for graduation. EQUIPMENT. The equipment of the Engineering Department for the work of instruction includes shops, laboratories and museums, an excellent outfit of field instruments, and ample facilities for engineering drawing. SHOPS. The Wood-shop contains a full outfit of hand-tools, lathes for ordinary turning and for pattern-making, machine-saws for ripping and slitting and cross-cutting, band-saw, jig-saw, planer, jointer, and trimmer. The Machine-shop is supplied with the necessary hand-tools for bench-work, engine lathes, planer, shaper, sensitive drill, power drill, universal milling machine, universal grinding machine, cut-off saw, gas forge for tempering tools, and the accessory instruments needed for exact work in metals. Two new engine lathes of the finest construction have been recently added to the equipment. The Forge-shop has a full outfit of smith's tools, and is equipped with forges having down draft and mechanical exhaust operated by a special engine and fan. The Foundry has a cupola furnace for work in cast iron, and a brass furnace for soft metal castings. The cupola is operated by a blower, driven by a special engine. The necessary appliances for moulding are also provided. LABORATORIES AND MUSEUMS. The Sinclair Laboratory for work in Strength of Materials was equipped through the generosity of Mrs. John Sinclair, of New York City, as a memorial to her late husband. The outfit comprises Riehle and Olsen machines, each of 100,000 pounds capacity, for tests of tensile, compressive and transverse strengths and elasticities; a Ewing machine for testing the elasticity of rods; an Olsen torsion machine of 50,000 inchpounds capacity; hand machines for tensile and transverse tests; Fairbanks and Olsen cement testing machines of 1,000 pounds capacity each; an Olsen compression machine of 40,000 pounds capacity; special apparatus for impact tests and tests of reinforced concrete; moulds for briquettes, scales, graduates, flasks, and other fittings; and the necessary extensometers, compressometers, and micrometers for delicate measurements. The John Waverly Scott Laboratory for Electrical Engineering was both equipped and endowed by Mrs. Frances Branch Scott, of Richmond, Virginia, as a memorial to her late son, a former student and a loyal alumnus of this University. It is provided with generators of both direct and alternating currents, with transformers of various types and capacities, with direct current motors and induction motors, with electric meters of all the requisite ranges, and with the laboratory standards needed for testing and calibrating them, and the brakes and rheostats used in testing the electrical machines. The equipment contains also a full outfit of apparatus of the best and most modern construction for delicate electrical measurements, together with a full supply of the necessary electrical standards. Two storage batteries have been provided, one for pressure and one for current. A Duddell oscillograph is used for the study of alternating current phenomena, and is arranged to permit the projection of the wave forms on a screen. A well equipped photometer cabinet is used for the testing and study of electrical lamps. For Steam Tests the equipment contains a full series of pressure gauges, gauge testers, thermometers, steam calorimeters, fuel calorimeters, apparatus for chimney gas analysis, indicators, friction brakes, apparatus for testing the thermal qualities of steam, apparatus for measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat, and the heat equivalent of electrical energy, and all the appliances needed for the proper utilization of this outfit. A machine for testing lubricants and apparatus for measuring the density, viscosity, and flash point of oils has also been provided. The laboratory engine has been equipped with rope brake and indicators, steam calorimeters and steam separator, and is connected with a condenser, so that tests of indicated and brake horsepower may be made both with and without condensation. In addition, the boilers and engines of the electric light and heating plant of the University are available for testing purposes. For Thermodynamic Tests an Otto engine and Remington ice machine have been recently installed. The engine, which develops 15 I. H. P. and 12 B. H. P., is arranged for operation with gas, gasoline, or alcohol. Provision has been made for accurate measurements of fuel consumption, indicated and brake horsepower, speed and explosions, temperatures of gases and cooling water, and for determining the composition of the exhaust gases. A complete experimental study of the motor can thus be carried out. For the ice machine the necessary brine tanks, indicators, meters, thermometers and so on have been provided, so that accurate test runs can be made. These machines, added to the outfit above described, furnish an unusually complete apparatus for practical studies in thermodynamics. For Tests of Road Building Materials there have been installed a ball mill, an abrasion machine, a briquette machine, a small crusher, a diamond drill, and a grinding disc. The University owes the use of this equipment to the generous coÃ¶peration of Dr. Logan Waller Page, director of the United States office of public roads. It will be employed in connection with the outfit of the Sinclair Laboratory for experimental researches on the available road building rocks and gravels of Virginia. The Rouss Physical Laboratory, the Chemical Laboratory and the Brooks Museum, while designed primarily to foster the scientific studies of the Academical Department of the University, are also available and utilized for the instruction of the classes in Engineering. The Physical Laboratory is not only provided with a large collection of apparatus for demonstrative experiments in illustration of the lectures on Physics, but possesses also the necessary instrumental equipment for exact measures in General Physics, in Electricity and Magnetism, and in Photometry. The Chemical Laboratory is furnished with all the appliances and supplies needed for illustrating the lecture course in General Chemistry, and possesses also a remarkable museum of Industrial Chemistry, which is utilized in the lectures on that subject. The analytical work-rooms are well equipped and the course of instruction has been especially adapted to the needs of students of Mining Engineering. The Brooks Museum contains the collections of the University in Geology and Mineralogy, collections of great value and of especial interest to students of Civil and Mining Engineering. These collections are used to illustrate the lectures and are thrown open to students for individual study. FIELD INSTRUMENTS. The outfit of instruments for field-work in surveying, levelling and location contains transits and levels of various approved makes, compasses, hand-levels and clinometers, a plane-table, a sextant, mercurial and aneroid barometers, a current-meter, a hook gauge, a solar transit, and the usual provision of rods, chains, tapes, and like accessories. Instruction is given to all students in the accurate testing and adjustment of the standard instruments, and in their use for the solution of all the ordinary field problems. In addition they are taught and practised in simple but accurate methods for locating the True Meridian, and for determining Latitude, Time, and Longitude. Students of Civil Engineering execute more extended surveys for the location of roads, railways, hydraulic works, and so on. DRAFTING ROOMS. The drafting rooms are abundantly lighted and are provided with solidly constructed tables with locked drawers for instruments and materials. Each student is assigned to a table and has a board and a drawer for his exclusive use. The classes of the First and Second years execute each one plate a week under the supervision of the Instructor in Drawing. The more advanced students have such drawings assigned by their respective professors as are needed for the full development of the courses of study. Careful attention is given to the training of the students in lettering, in the conventional signs of mechanical drawing, in the proper lay-out of drawings, and in neat and accurate execution. Exercises are required also in tracing and in blue-printing, the rooms for which are conveniently arranged and in close contiguity to the drafting rooms. While, however, technical dexterity is demanded, the graphical method is taught and used primarily as a powerful and indispensable instrument of research, the thoughtful mastery of which is essential for the instructed Engineer. The construction and theory of the Polar Planimeter, the Slide Rule, and the Pantograph are carefully taught, and the student is trained in the practical use of these appliances for the rapid and accurate production of estimates and copies from finished drawings. EXPENSES. The expenses of a student of Engineering will vary slightly with his year of residence, largely with his personal habits. The following estimates presuppose a reasonable economy, equally removed from parsimony on the one hand and from profusion on the other. They may be somewhat reduced by strict economy. They may be largely and disastrously augmented by extravagance. REGULAR STUDENTS. The average annual expense of a student who pursues the regular course of the Engineering Department will be: University Fee $ 40 Department Fee (average of four years) 65 Living Expenses (for nine months) 225 Books and Drawing Materials 20 Incidental Expenses 50 Total for outside students $400 Deduction for Virginians 45 Total for Virginians $355 Strict economy may reduce the living expenses from $25 a month, as estimated above, to $18 or $20, and may take off something also from incidental expenses. A more liberal estimate will increase them by about the same amount. We should thus have the following average annual allowances: ANNUAL ALLOWANCES. MIN. MEAN. MAX. Outside students $350 $400 $480 Virginians $275 355 435 These estimates are exclusive of clothing and traveling expenses, items which vary too much to be introduced into any general estimate. The University Fee of $40 is paid by every student. It entitles the student to the free use of the Library, and of the Gymnasium; to the advice and direction of the Instructor in Physical Culture; to free medical advice and attendance by the Health Officers of the University; to the facilities of the University Hospital in case of need; and it covers all fees for examinations, diplomas, and degrees. The Department Fee is $80 for the First Year course, $70 for the Second, $60 for the Third, $50 for the Fourth, and thus averages $65. It covers the tuition and laboratory fees for all the classes (except Analytical Chemistry). It entitles the student also to take over again without additional charge any course of the previous year which he may have failed to complete. Virginians have free tuition in the academical schools, and are therefore allowed a deduction of $45 a year. The item of Living Expenses includes board, lodging, fuel, lights, servant, and laundry. A fair average allowance is $25 a month. Severe economy may reduce it to $18. Ample generosity would place it at $32, but no higher. The Books, Drawing Instruments, Drawing Materials and Stationery will cost about $80 for the four-year course, an average of $20 a year. It is wise economy for the young engineer to buy good instruments and to collect during his college life a few good books, as the nucleus of his professional library. The Incidental Expenses of the student ought to be kept within modest bounds. The allowances made above are liberal enough. Large expenditures as a rule promote idleness and attract companions of the baser sort. The items payable at entrance are the University Fee of $40, the Department Fee, and a Contingent Deposit of $10 to cover library fines and damage to apparatus, if such should occur. The last item is credited in the student's final settlement with the Bursar. The First Year Student of Engineering should bring with him about $200 to meet these charges and cover the initial payments for books, instruments, room, furniture, board, and so on. SPECIAL STUDENTS. Applicants for admission to the Engineering Department, who are twenty years old, and desire to enter for the pursuit of special elective courses, must present adequate proofs of good character and of the needful maturity and training. Such applicants are then registered as Special Students, and are admitted without formal examination to the privileges of the University, but not as candidates for any titled degree. Such students pay the University Fee of $40, a Tuition Fee of $25 for each class attended, and the proper Laboratory Fees ($5 per class in Applied Mathematics and Engineering; $35 in Analytical Chemistry). Virginians have free tuition in the Academic Schools. Under the general elective plan of this University, many young men, who cannot afford to take the regular four-year course, qualify themselves by such studies for highly successful professional careers. Any student, who possesses a good working knowledge of Pure Mathematics, including the processes of the Differential and Integral Calculus, and some acquaintance with the Natural Sciences, may attempt with success the following shorter course in Engineering: First Year.âApplied Mathematics 1 and 2. Engineering 1. Second Year.âApplied Mathematics 3 and 4. Engineering 2. Upon its completion he receives a diploma of graduation in Applied Mathematics and Engineering. No student, who is deficient in mathematics, will be allowed to enter upon this special course. STUDENTS ADMITTED WITH ADVANCED STANDING. Applicants from other colleges will be admitted provisionally to advanced standing as candidates for a degree in Engineering upon presentation of proper certificates covering the courses for which credit is desired. Such certificates must be filed with the Dean, and must be acceptable both to him and to the professors in charge of the accredited courses. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the college; must specify the character and content of the course followed by the student; must give his marks, which should not fall below the standard seventy-five per cent. of this University; and must recommend the student as worthy of admission to the University of Virginia in respect of both character and scholarship. The final validation of such a certificate is effected by the successful completion of the courses attended in this University. CREDITS FOR PRACTICAL WORK. Students, who have accomplished courses equivalent to those given at this University in Drawing or in Shop-Work, will not be required to repeat such courses here. To secure credit for such work the student must make written application to the Dean of the Department, and with this application must file the official certificate of the chief draftsman or other instructor, under whom the work was done. In default of such certificate the applicant must take and pass a practical examination on each course, from which he seeks exemption. A student who fails in one of his courses, but attains a grade of sixty-five per cent. on the work of the whole year, may be admitted to reÃ¶xamination on such course at the beginning of the next session. To secure this privilege the student must make application to the Dean of the Department before September 1st. It will then be the duty of the Dean to arrange the schedule of dates for these examinations, and to communicate these dates to the applicants and to the professors concerned. All such examinations must be held in the week preceding the initial lectures of the session. Students, who on reÃ¶xamination fail to pass, will not be admitted to graduation, until they shall have again attended the lectures of the course and passed examination on it.

The Department of Agriculture is founded on the gift of one hundred thousand dollars by the late Samuel Miller, of Lynchburg, Va.; this sum having been given to establish a fund, the income of which should be applied, as far as practicable, to the maintenance of experiments in agriculture, training in the art of farming, and instruction in those sciences which underlie that art, as well as in their practical relations thereto. Since the income in question is manifestly inadequate to provide for all these important ends in an efficient manner, it has become necessary for those directly charged with its administration to decide how it can be most usefully applied within the limits indicated. Agriculture is the art of cultivating the soil with a view to profit; as usually applied, the term implies the successful raising and marketing of crops of plants or of animals, or of their products. Its theory is based directly upon the sciences of Chemistry, Botany, and ZoÃ¶logy; and also, but less directly, upon the allied sciences of Physics, Mechanics, and Geology. Education adapted to the prosecution of this vocation calls, therefore, at the outset, for sound and thorough instruction in these sciences; and subsequently for the discussion of its principles and processes as based upon them. The experience of some years has shown conclusively that neither agricultural experimentation nor instruction in the routine of farm work can be profitably conducted here with the means at command; nor is such application of these means in accordance with the needs or expressed desires of students who come to the University for the purpose of entering this Department. It seems wisest, therefore, as well as most consonant with the other functions of the University, to apply the income of this fund to the enlargement, as far as possible, of the opportunities here afforded to those who desire to acquire a knowledge of the sciences on which the art of agriculture is based, and of which it is the practical application; to understand their theoretical principles, as well as their economic relations; and to be capable of following their progress in all its bearings. Instruction is therefore offered in this Department to all who desire such training in the descriptive and experimental sciences as this would imply, together with a knowledge of the closely affiliated mathematical sciences, and of the modern languages of immediate importance to the scientific student; in accordance with the following plan. Required for Entrance Upon the Work of the Department.âThe General Entrance Examination, or admission to the University by certificate or diploma, as stated in a preceding portion of this catalogue. Based upon this preparation the degree of Bachelor of Science will be conferred upon students who satisfactorily complete one B. S. course each in General Biology, Botany, Physics, General Chemistry, ZoÃ¶logy, Geology, and Analytical Chemistry; together with an advanced course in each of any two of the Schools represented by these courses; of one B. S. course (to be elected by the student) from the group of mathematical sciences, viz., Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, or Astronomy; and of the B. S. courses in French and German. The B. S. courses are the same as, or the equivalent of, the B. A. courses described in a previous portion of this catalogue; the advanced courses in the various scientific Schools have also been previously described. Agricultural Chemistry.âThere is offered in connection with the graduating course in Analytical Chemistry a course of lectures in Agricultural Chemistry, including a discussion of the chemical and physical properties of the atmosphere, of soils, and of plants; the chemistry of the processes of vegetable life so far as they are related to Agriculture; the chemical composition and preparation of manures; the chemistry of stock feeding, and of fungicides and insecticides. This course is open without charge to students who have registered in Analytical Chemistry, to Virginia students, and to farmers who are not matriculated students. For Reference: Johnston's Elements of Agricultural Chemistry, 17th Edition; London, 1894. In addition to the courses in Biology described in a previous portion of this catalogue, there is offered in the School of Biology and Agriculture the following course, which provides for the discussion of the relation of the biological sciences to the art of Agriculture. Practical Biology and Agriculture.âThe relations of Biology to Agriculture are so manifold, and the subdivisions of the latter subject so numerous, that it would be impossible to exhaust the discussion of either in the work of any one year. A course consisting in part of lectures and in part of an equivalent amount of practical work and collateral reading will be offered yearly. It will include the discussion of selected topics pertaining to Economic Botany (such as the bacterial and fungous diseases of plants, the natural history of cultivated varieties, and the like); to Economic ZoÃ¶logy (such as the life-history and treatment of injurious or beneficial insects, external or internal parasites, the special anatomy and physiology of the domestic animals, etc.); and to questions connected with the Principles of Agriculture (such as the laws of growth and nutrition of crops, the drainage and tillage of soils, systems of rotation and allied topics). The topics discussed in such a course will be, to some extent, selected in accordance with the objects in view of those electing it in any year. The following literature will indicate a possible arrangement of subjects. Text-Books for 1906-1907.âSorauer's Physiology of Plants (Weiss tr.); Tubeuf's Diseases of Plants induced by Cryptogamic Parasites (Smith tr.); Chauveau's Anatomy of the Domestic Animals (Fleming tr.); Vorhee's Principles of Agriculture. Candidates for a diploma of graduation in Biology and Agriculture are required to complete the courses in Botany, ZoÃ¶logy, and Comparative Anatomy, and also the course in Practical Biology and Agriculture above described. In this Department, as in the College, the order in which studies shall be taken is left largely to the discretion of the student (subject to the restriction that not more than three classes may be undertaken in any one session without the consent of the Faculty): the following is, however, suggested as a convenient arrangement of a four years' course for this degree; and as one of several combinations of subjects possible under the requirements above stated. First Year: Geology 1; Physics 1; General Biology 1; Second Year: French 2; General Chemistry 1; Botany 2; Third Year: German 3; Analytical Chemistry 1; ZoÃ¶logy 3; Fourth Year: * * Substitution may be made of either Pure Mathematics 2 or Astronomy 1 for Mechanics; each of these three courses requires the previous completion of Mathematics 1. Mechanics 1; â  â  Substitution may be made for either of these advanced courses by advanced courses in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, or Geology. Analyt. and Agri. Chem. 2; â Agriculture 1. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses at the University of a student in the Department of Agriculture may be estimated at from $290 a year upwards, according to the mode of living. A fuller statement of expenses, including the conditions under which Virginia students are entitled to free tuition, may be found in a preceding section. (See pp. 94-104.) MILLER SCHOLARSHIPS. A scholarship is awarded at the end of each session to the candidate who at that time passes the graduation examinations in the B. S. courses of General Biology, Chemistry, and Physics with the highest aggregate of marks. The scholarship is tenable for the following two years. The emoluments consist of $250 a session, with free tuition in the Schools of the Department of Agriculture. The holder of a Miller Scholarship is required to elect at least one-third of his work in Biology and Agriculture, Analytical Chemistry, or Applied Mathematics. The tenure of the scholarship depends upon the good conduct and studious diligence of the scholar, the Faculty being authorized to withdraw its benefits from any student who does not avail himself of the opportunities for study which it is intended to secure. Candidacy should be announced at the beginning of the session. THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY. JOHN SHELTON PATTON, Librarian. ANNA SEELEY TUTTLE, B. A., Assistant Librarian. The General Library is open daily from 9 a. m. to 1:30 p. m., and from 3 to 5 p. m. The collection contains more than sixty thousand volumes, and books are available for use by the officers and students and some others under the following regulations: 1. All visitors are expected to preserve order, and to avoid noise or conversation. 2. Books of the Reference Collection are not to be removed from the Library, but may be freely consulted at the tables. All bound mgazines are classed as reference books. Books in current use in connection with the courses of instruction will be temporarily placed on the shelves of the Reference Collection, and will then be subject to the above rule. Works of special value or specially liable to injury on account of their rarity, illustrations, etc., are not to be removed from the Library, except by permission. New periodicals cannot be borrowed within two weeks after they are placed on the shelves. 3. The Librarian is required to make an entry of every book removed from the Library with the time when the same is due. 4. Students may borrow books upon the following terms: No student can have more than three volumes at the same time. Each book must be returned by the borrower within two weeks from the date of its withdrawal. The loan may be renewed unless some other person entitled to books has signified his need of it. Ten cents a volume will be charged for each day that a volume remains unreturned after the two weeks for which it was withdrawn. Before a student can honorably withdraw from the University he must present to the Bursar a certificate from the Librarian to show that he has settled with that officer. 5. Members of the Faculty have at all times free use of the Library within its walls, and borrow books under the following regulations: Each book borrowed is to be presented to the Librarian to be charged to the borrower. Each book borrowed is understood to be taken out for a period not exceeding one month, but this time may be extended unless the Librarian notify the borrower that some one else desires the book. Not more than two volumes at any time may be borrowed for the use of any other person than the professor himself, and the Librarian is always to be notified at the time of borrowing that the book is not for individual use. 6. All books borrowed from the Library must be returned and on the shelves by the fifth day before the close of each session. 7. The Librarian may permit persons residing at the University for the purpose of studying during the vacation to use the Library, with the approval of the President, and under the above general regulations, but at such hours as may be specially arranged for, on condition that each such person pay to the Librarian a fee of $3 and make a contingent deposit of $15, against which may be assessed any charges for loss of or injury to books. 8. The Librarian is charged with the general duty of maintaining order in the Library, preserving the room and its contents from damage and reporting to the Bursar any fines and penalties which may have to be enforced.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART IV. PHYSICAL CULTURE: RELIGIOUS WORK: LITERARY SOCIETIES: ALUMNI ASSOCIATIONS: INDEX. PHYSICAL CULTURE. WILLIAM ALEXANDER LAMBETH, M. D., Ph. D., Director of the Gymnasium. HENRY HADEN LANNIGAN, Associate Director of Athletics. HERBERT MASSEY PECK, Instructor in Physical Training. CHARLES EDWARD MORAN, Student Assistant in Gymnasium. The method of instruction pursued does not adhere blindly to any system, so called. Proper recognition is given to any method the whole or parts of which have been useful or which indicate efficacy; for, however valuable any system may be, it cannot be maintained in its entirety without the consideration of hereditary tendencies, and of individuality in physical possibilities, physical conditions, and physical tastes. The plan of individual training is encouraged in every case, and especially where an examination discloses the student's inability to pursue general or concerted exercises, either from threatened injury or inability to profit by such work. Students, upon entering the University, are entitled, without cost, to a thorough physical examination by the Director. The examination includes an accurate measurement of his physical proportions, a careful examination of the condition and action of the heart and lungs and the strength of the principal muscular groups; at the same time information is solicited concerning his heredity. Upon the basis of the information so gathered instruction will be given as to particular exercises and the use of the various developing appliances, as indicated. The examinations are repeated at intervals, the changes noted and new work suggested, if desirable. In addition to individual work, daily classes are given in light gymnasticsâmarching, figure running, calisthenics, dumb-bells, and clubs, adapted as nearly as possible to individuals of all ages and physical conditions. The exercises are gradual and progressive, commencing with the simplest movements and proceeding to the more complicated and arduous when the more rudimentary forms have been mastered. During the winter months gymnastics which require great strength and agility are indulged in by those who are fitted for these classes by previous training. This work, of admitted spectacular character (yet having its usefulness), is terminated by an annual gymnastic tournament, usually in the first half of March. The Faculty regulations on athletics require that members of the University athletic teams shall give evidence of satisfactory physical condition by making the following strength tests when deemed necessary, in addition to the regular physical examination: Members of the football teams are required to make a strength test of 1300 points; members of the baseball team a test of 1100 points. The points are reckoned as follows: The strength of back in pounds, the strength of legs in pounds, strength of chest in pounds, strength of forearms in pounds (pressure), added to one-tenth of the weight (in pounds), multiplied by the number of times the body is lifted by the upper arms. The Fayerweather Gymnasium, the gift of Daniel Fayerweather, of New York, is a handsome and commodious structure on classical lines, situated on the eastern slope of Carr's Hill, overlooking the Athletic Campus. The first floor contains a spacious exercise hall, equipped with the best and most approved developing appliances, as well as apparatus for light and heavy gymnastics, a one-twentieth mile concave-inclined running track, a visitor's gallery, lavatory, trophy-room, and the various offices. The basement floor is concrete throughout and contains the baths âneedle, shower, spray, tub, and plungeâsupplied with both hot and cold water; bowling alleys, ball-cage, boiler-room, lockers, locker-room, dressing-rooms, and barber shop. The building is heated by a hot water system, ventilated by airshafts, registers, and skylights, and lighted by gas and electricity. The gymnasium is open from 8 a. m. to 7 p. m. every day except Sunday. Attendance is voluntary and free of cost to every regularly matriculated student. Classes are arranged at such hours as not to conflict with other University duties. The Athletic Park contains twenty-one acres, a part of which has been laid out into a driving park, set with trees and hedges, containing the site for the proposed Athletic Clubhouse. Two hundred thousand surface feet have been perfectly graded, drained, and fenced for football, baseball, and track work. This surface was completed at a cost of about ten thousand dollars, and the removal of forty-eight thousand cubic yards of earth. A grand stand and bleacher have been erected, each seating a thousand persons. The work of turfing, protection, and decoration is going steadily on, and will, it is estimated, cost ten thousand dollars more. ATHLETICS. Games and sports of all kinds are under the special direction of the General Athletic Association, a student organization whose object is to promote this class of physical exercises. The Faculty, by means of its committee on athletics, exercises a general advisory control, endeavoring to foresee and avert dangerous tendencies or excess in physical exercises, while giving to the student, as far as possible, entire liberty of management: a strict limit is placed upon the character of intercollegiate games and the number played away from the University. REGULATIONS CONCERNING ATHLETICS. 1. The Faculty Committee on Athletics is intrusted with the general oversight of field and track athletics, and is authorized to forbid any features in these exercises which endanger the health and morals of the participants. 2. No student will be permitted to play upon the University football and baseball teams except after physical examination by the Director of the Gymnasium, and with his approbation. 3. No student under twenty-one years old will be permitted to play with either team in games away from the University, either as a regular member of the team or as a substitute, except upon written permission from his parent or guardian, addressed to the President of the University. 4. Only students who act as regular or substitute members of the athletic teams will be permitted to accompany them on trips away from the University, except during vacations and holidays. 5. Special monthly reports will be made to the President with respect to Class standing and progress in study of each player on the athletic teams during the football and baseball seasons, whether such player be a regular or substitute member of either team, or an applicant for either position. 6. Any member of an athletic team who is reported for neglect of his studies or non-attendance on lectures may be required by the President to sever his connection with such team. 7. The athletic teams shall not have contests elsewhere than upon the University grounds with any except teams from other institutions of learning. 8. Experts for purposes of instruction and professional teams for purposes of practice may be employed on the University grounds, but only with written permission from the President of the University. 9. Before any student can become a member or a substitute member of any athletic team in the University, and take part in any intercollegiate contest, he must make application in a prescribed form in writing to the Committee on Athletics in the University and secure the endorsed approval of that Committee to his application. It shall be the duty of the Athletic Committee to have the executive officers of the University endorse such application to the effect that the applicant is an unconditionally registered student of the University. 10. It shall be the duty of the Athletic Committee to enquire into and make a record of the athletic experiences of the applicant, and it shall be the duty of the applicant to appear before the Committee and answer on his honor such questions as the Committee may see fit to ask. 11. It shall be the duty of the Athletic Committee to require a pledge in writing of the applicant certifying on his honor that he has never accepted directly or indirectly remuneration, compensatory gift, valuable consideration, or promise thereof, for his athletic services, and that he is in the proper and strict sense of the word an amateur player in collegiate athletic sports, before the Committee endorses his application. 12. No student of this University who has been a member or substitute member of any athletic team at another college or university, shall be permitted to become a member of such athletic team at this University, unless and until he shall have been a student at this University for at least five months. The "five months previous residence rule" shall also apply to all students who enter the University without entrance certificate or examination. 13. No person whose name is in the faculty list or appears in the catalogue list of officers of instruction and administration of the University, and who receives a remuneration therefrom, shall be a member of any athletic team representing the University. 14. It shall be the duty of the President of the Athletic Association, the Advisory Board of that Association, the Manager of the team, the Captain of the team, the Director of the gymnasium and the Treasurer of the Association to furnish, on request, a statement to the effect that each member of an athletic team is above their suspicion as to his eligibility to represent the University as a proper amateur player, before such player shall be allowed to take part in a contest. 15. Whereas, a member of an athletic team of this University is a representative student and enjoys special honor in thus representing the University, this privilege shall be withheld from any student whose scholastic standing is discreditable. 16. After September 15th, 1907, no "coach" or "trainer" not an alumnus or officer of the University shall be employed for the purpose of instructing or training any athletic team in this University. 17. That the Faculty Committee on Athletics should be authorized and instructed to establish a maximum period after which a player in any branch of athletic sport shall be ineligible to play on the corresponding team of this Unversity. 18. The members of any athletic team may be allowed not more than eight days leave of absence from the University for the purpose of engaging in athletic contests; but no student who is a member of more than one athletic team shall be allowed more than sixteen days leave of absence during the entire session. The College Topics is a weekly newspaper, published under the auspices of the General Athletic Association. devoted to the interests of Athletics and the University at large. Editor-in-Chief for 1906-1907. William Fitzhugh Carter, Jr. RELIGIOUS WORK. I. YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION, Incorporated. REV. HUGH MILTON McILHANY, Jr., M. A., Ph. D., General Secretary. THOMAS DWIGHT SLOAN, B. A., Assistant Secretary. Object.âThe Young Men's Christian Association, founded in 1858, is the largest student organization in the University, and is the oldest student Young Men's Christian Association in existence. It stands for a higher spiritual life among the members, and for united effort to help others in the attempt to live consistent Christian lives. Work.âThe distinctive work of the Association consists in promoting individual study of the Bible and Foreign Missions by means of small classes under student leaders, in maintaining a weekly Prayer-Service, held on Wednesday night at seven thirty o'clock, in assisting, through some of its members, the work of the Churches and Sunday Schools in the vicinity of the University, in inviting eminent Christian workers to address the students on religious matters, and in promoting social intercourse among the students by means of lectures, entertainments, and other social events. The English Bible.âThe Young Men's Christian Association offers the following courses in Bible Study, open to all students: Studies in the Life of Christ. Studies in the Acts and the Epistles. Studies in Old Testament characters. Studies in the Teaching of Jesus and His Apostles. These courses, arranged by the International Committee of Young Men's Christian Associations, are intended to form a four years' cycle of study, and are conducted by student leaders. The Y. M. C. A. Equipment.âThrough the munificence of Mrs. William E. Dodge and family, of New York City, the Association possesses one of the handsomest and most conveniently arranged college association buildings in the world, which was recently erected at a cost, including furnishings, etc., of about $75,000. The students, alumni, and friends of the University have subscribed an endowment fund of nearly $20,000 for the maintenance of the property. This building, called "Madison Hall" in honor of President Madison, who was so intimately connected with the early history of the University, faces the north front of the Rotunda. It contains editorial rooms for the college periodicals, game rooms, kitchen, club room, exercise room, elaborate bathing facilities, reception room, reading room, meeting room, parlor, office, writing room, auditorium, guest room, bed rooms for the secretaries, and rooms for the Bible and Missionary departments of the Association. A full equipment of current literature for the reading room, and a library of nearly a thousand volumes of the best religious works and fiction, have been donated by a member of the Dodge family. The tennis courts, nineteen in number, for the use of the students of the University, are on the Association grounds immediately in the rear of the building, and form one of the most beautiful tennis fields in the country. Help for New Students.âThe Association publishes early in the summer a Handbook of useful information concerning the University and community, and also a detailed report of the religious work of the session. The General Secretary will gladly send either of these publications, or give any further information desired, upon application of any prospective student. New students are requested to come direct from the trains to Madison Hall, where the Association conducts a general Information Bureau, including a complete boarding house register, a directory of the students, and a list of all forms of employment open to students. Membership.âThe membership of the Association consists of two classes, active and associate; any member of an evangelical church, who wishes to take some part in the work of the Association, may become an active member of the Association; any young man of good moral character may become an associate member. The annual fee is $2.00 for all members, an extra charge being made for the use of the baths and tennis courts. Indorsement.âThe Visitors and the Faculty of the University heartily commend the work of the Association, and it is earnestly desired that every parent or guardian see to it that the student under his care be encouraged to join the Association as soon as he reaches the University. II. CHAPEL SERVICES. The religious services of the University consist of the regular preaching services in the Chapel on Sunday morning and evening, which are conducted by representative ministers of all evangelical denominations, invited mainly from Virginia and adjacent States. The general oversight of the Christan work is entrusted to the Association Secretary. All the details of this plan, which takes the place of the chaplain system used in former years, are entrusted to a Committee on Religious Exercises composed of five members of the Faculty. The list of the University preachers for the year 1906 is given on page 27. STUDENTS' LITERARY SOCIETIES. There are two Literary Societies of long standingâthe Jefferson and the Washington Societyâconnected with the University. They hold weekly meetings in their respective halls and give exhibitions of public speaking at intervals during the session and at its close. There is an annual contest during the session between the two Societies for the Harrison Trophy. The Society winning this trophy retains it until it is recaptured by the other Society. Each Society offers several medals for excellence in debate and oratory. The Debating Union is an organization composed of the Washington and the Jefferson Literary Societies. The purpose of the organization is to conduct at least two debates each session with other colleges or universities situated in the Middle or Southern States. During the session of 1906-1907 debates will be held with Johns Hopkins University and the University of North Carolina. The officers of the Debating Union for 1906-1907 are A. J. Saville, Manager; L. B. Way, Assistant Manager. MEDALISTS. 1905-1906.

The purpose of these examinations is to secure in the applicant adequate mental maturity for entrance upon a course of University study, as well as the specific training needed to prosecute with success the work of the school or department in which the student is registered. It is not and has never been the policy of the University of Virginia to deny its opportunities and privileges to any young man able to profit by them. The test imposed at entrance is designed as much to protect the candidate as to safeguard the school. Every applicant for admission is therefore required as a proof of maturity and fitness to pass examination in certain selected studies, or to present valid certificates covering courses of instruction equivalent to these.

These examinations are held under the Honor System, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge. All candidates, who take their examinations at the time appointed, are tested free of charge. In case of delayed entrance, where the grounds of postponement are good, the President of the University may admit the candidate to a special examination, for which an additional fee of five dollars is charged. This fee is payable in advance and is in no case returned. Candidates conditioned on not more than four blocks of the entrance requirements are permitted to register and proceed with the work of their classes; but such students will in no case be admitted to formal matriculation until these conditions have been removed. All conditions must be passed off before the opening of the session succeeding the student's initial registration. ADMISSION BY CERTIFICATE. In lieu of the foregoing examinations the candidate may be admitted upon certificate from 1. A recognized institution of collegiate rank. 2. A Virginian public high school accredited by this University. 3. A Virginian private academy accredited by this University. 4. The American College Entrance Examination Board. 5. A properly accredited high school outside Virginia. In the last class are included only such high schools as are accredited by their own state universities or by institutions of higher learning with equivalent rank. The best certificate in all cases is a diploma of graduation from the college or high school. If the candidate has not completed the course required for graduation, the certificate presented must bear the official signature of the head of the school; must specify the character and content of each course offered as the equivalent of one of the entrance examinations of this University; must give the length of time devoted to the course; and must state the candidate's grades, which must be at least seventy-five per cent. These certificates of preparation should be submitted to the Dean of the University not later than September first. In default of an acceptable certificate presented in due time the candidate will be required to take the regular entrance examinations before being registered as a student. ADMISSION WITH ADVANCED STANDING. Applicants from other universities and from colleges affiliated with the University of Virginia will be admitted to advanced standing as candidates for degrees from this University upon presentation of proper certificates, covering the courses for which credit is desired. Such certificates must be filed with the Dean of the Department in which the student is registered. They must be acceptable both to the Dean and to the Professor in charge of the course accredited. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the college; must specify the character and content of the course followed by the student; must give his marks, which should in no case fall below the standard seventy-five per cent. of this University; and must recommend the student as worthy of admission to the University of Virginia in respect of both character and scholarship. The final validation of such certificates is effected by the successful completion of the courses attended in this University. The College.âThe programme of studies offered by the candidate for the degree of Bachelor of Arts must satisfy all the requirements of that degree as here established. He must devote at least one full session to the studies of the College and at least three of his ten electives must be taken here. Department of Graduate Studies.âApplicants for admission to this department as candidates for the degree of Master of Arts or Doctor of Philosophy must present the baccalaureate degree of an affiliated institution of collegiate rank, or in cases of incorporated institutions of learning which confer no such degree, the certificate of graduation on a course fully equivalent to the ordinary collegiate course. No diploma or certificate can be accepted except by vote of the Faculty, based on the recommendation of the Committee on Academic Degrees. Department of Engineering.âThe programme of studies offered by the candidate for a degree in Engineering must satisfy all the requirements of that degree as here established. He must devote at least two full sessions to engineering studies in this University. SPECIAL STUDENTS. Applicants for registration who are twenty years old, and desire to enter for the pursuit of special elective courses, must present adequate proofs of good character and of the needful maturity and training. Such applicants may then be registered by the Dean of the University as Special Students, and will be admitted without formal examination to the privileges of the University, but not as candidates for any titled degree. Such students must in all cases meet the specific entrance requirements as prescribed for the courses elected by them. ANNOUNCEMENTS. From and after June 1st, 1909, the entrance requirements will be still further advanced, as follows: The College.âThe candidate must pass in fifteen blocks, of which at least three must be in English, three in Mathematics, two in History, and three in Latin, and the residue elected at will. In place of the three blocks of Latin the candidate may offer four blocks of the Modern Languages (French, German, Spanish). The Department of Engineering.âThe candidate must pass in fifteen blocks, of which at least three must be in English, four in Mathematics, and two in History. One block of questions will be set in Plane Trigonometry. The remaining five blocks may be selected at will. A candidate may be admitted in spite of some deficiencies, provided these are not such as will impair the integrity of his academic work. But no such candidate will be conditioned except upon subjects actually taught in this University; and all conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the next session after initial registration.</field>
