      <field name="fulltext">2 A STATEMENT OF THE COURSE OF INSTRUCTION, EXPENSES, &amp;C., IN THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. MATRICULATION. To be admitted into the University, the student must be sixteen years of age; but the Faculty are authorized to dispense with this requisition in the case of application for admission by two brothers, one of whom is under the age of sixteen. If the applicant for admission has been a student at any other incorporated seminary, he cannot be received, but on producing a certificate from such seminary, or other satisfactory evidence to the Faculty, with respect to his general good conduct. Every student is free to attend the schools of his choice, and no other than he chooses; with the condition that he shall attend at least three Professors, unless he has the written authority of his parent or guardian, or the Faculty shall for good cause shown allow him to attend less than three. But should he be twenty-one years of age, or more, he is exempt from this condition as to the number of his schools. Before a student matriculates, he is furnished with a copy of the laws, which he is required to read. On matriculating, he signs a written declaration, that he will conform to those laws, and, if he be a resident student, that he has deposited with the Patron all the funds in his possession. COURSE OF INSTRUCTION. The session commences on the 1st of October, and continues without interruption until the 29th of June. The mode of instruction is by lectures and text-books, accompanied by rigid daily and stated examinations. In each school there are three regular lectures a week, besides many others suited to the several subjects into which the school is divided. SCHOOLS. I.âANCIENT LANGUAGES. PROFESSOR HARRISON. In this school are taught the Latin and Greek languages; the Greek and Roman History, Geography, and Literature; and the Hebrew language. The instruction is given partly by lectures and examinations, and partly by comments on portions of the text-books appointed to be read by the student. It embraces the following subjects, distributed according to the classes. I. Junior Latin.â1. General principles and doctrines of the Etymology. 2. The application of these general principles in the explanation of the formation and composition of the words of the language, considered individually, and without regard to their relations to other words in a sentence. The doctrine of the primary and secondary significations of words is considered in connection with this branch of the subject, and is illustrated in the lectures from day to day as occasion may offer. 3. The accidence, or inflectional forms of words, expressing the relations in which they stand to other words in a sentence. These modifications of the forms of words are in like manner explained by the application of the general principles of the Etymology. 4. The Syntax, or laws which govern the relations existing between the several parts of a sentence or discourse, whether indicated by the inflections of words, or by particles. This subject is treated of partly in lectures specially devoted to it, partly by way of prelections and comment on the portions of authors read in the lecture-room, and partly in connection with the written exercises. For the above subjects the text-books are the Professor's printed notes, Zumpt's Latin Grammar, and Krebs' Guide. 5. The doctrine of the quantity of Syllables, and the metres. The students are advised to use Carey's Latin Prosody, and Munk's Greek and Roman Metres by Professors Beck and Felton. 6. The Latin authors used as text-books are Horace, Virgil, Cicero's Orations, and his Epistles ad Diversos, Terence, and CÃ¦sar's Commentaries. The last chiefly with a view to the written exercises. II. Senior Latin.â1. Prelections and commentaries on portions of the classic authors, embracing besides the other matters necessary for the better understanding of these, a further development of the doctrines of philology taught in the Junior Class. The text-books are Horace, Juvenal, Livy, Tacitus, Krebs' Guide and Zumpt's Latin Grammar. 2. Geography of Ancient Italy. The maps of ancient and modern Italy, published by the "Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge," are recommended. 3. Roman History. This subject is taught by prelections, and by examinations on the text-book, Schmitz' History of Rome. The History of Rome published by the "Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge," Niebuhr's History of Rome, and Arnold's History of Rome are referred to. III. Junior Greek.â1. The Etymology, considered in its general principles and its applications, the Syntax, and the Prosody and Metres, are taught to this class in the same way as to the Junior Latin. For these subjects, KÃ¼hner's Elementary Greek Grammar is the text-book. 2. The Greek authors read and explained in the lecture-room, are Xenophon's Anabasis, Herodotus, and a play of Ãschylus or Euripides. The Greek and English Lexicon of Liddell and Scott is that preferred. IV. Senior Greek.â1. Prelections and commentaries on portions of the Greek classic authors, in the same way as in the Senior Latin class, and embracing the like subjects. The Greek authors used as text-books in this class are Euripides, Sophocles, Thucydides, and Homer. The student should have KÃ¼hner's Larger Greek Grammar. 2. Ancient Geography of Greece. The printed notes of the Professor form the text in part. 3. Ancient History of Greeceâtaught by prelections, and by examinations on the text-books. These are Thirlwall's History of Greece, or the History of Greece in the Library of Useful Knowledge. It is expected of the students of Latin and Greek that they shall read in their rooms such authors and parts of authors, prescribed by the Professor, as cannot be read in the lecture-room; e. g.: Cicero's Epistles to Atticus, his Orations (selected), and Treatise "De Republica;" Sallust, Virgil, Terence, Plautus, Ãschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Demosthenes, Ãschines, Thucydides, Plato, &amp;c. As an essential part of the plan of instruction, the students of each class are required to furnish written exercises; which consist in the conversion of Latin or Greek into English, and of English into Latin or Greek. The exercises are examined by the Professor, and their errors marked; they are then returned to the students, and the corrections stated and explained in the presence of the class. For these exercises the classic authors are used as a text, aided in Latin by Krebs' Guide. V. Hebrew.âThe text-books are Biblia Hebraica, Nordheimer's, or Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar, and Gesenii Lexicon Manuale Hebr. et Chald., or Sauerwein's edition of Rehkopf's Lex. Hebr. Chald. In the written translations required as a test of the qualifications of candidates for degrees, the passages used are selected by the committee of examination, not from the portions of authors which have been read and explained in the lecture-room, but at will from the classic writers generally. II.âMODERN LANGUAGES. PROFESSOR SCHELE DE VERE. The subjects taught in this school are: 1. The French, Italian, Spanish, and German Languages, the English in its Anglo-Saxon form, and their literature. 2. The History and Geography of Europe from the fall of the Roman Empire to the present day. There are two classes in French, one for beginners, the other for more advanced students; and the same arrangement is made, when necessary, in the other languages. Opportunity is also given to practice speaking the languages. The method of instruction is by lectures, examinations, written exercises, and comments on the text-books as read in the lecture-room, the principal classic authors in each language being used for this purpose. Two degrees in this school are required as a condition for obtaining the degree of A. M. III.âMATHEMATICS. PROFESSOR COURTENAY. In this school there are four classes. Of these, the Junior commences with the theory of Arithmetic, the student being supposed to have rendered himself practically familiar with its various rules before entering the University. The elements of Algebra are then taught, and after the first difficulties are mastered, the subjects of Algebra and Synthetic Geometry are pursued simultaneously. In the second or Intermediate Class, after completing the course of Algebra, commenced in the preceding class, there are taught successively the theory of Plane and Spherical Trigonometry, with the application of the former to the measurement of heights and distances, and of the latter to nautical Astronomy, the theory and practice of Land Surveying and Levelling, Navigation, and Descriptive Geometry, with its applications to Spherical Projections, Shadows, and Perspective. The Senior Class begins with the subject of Analytical Geometry, and subsequently studies the Differential Calculus, concluding the course of Pure Mathematics with the Integral Calculus. There is also a class of Mixed Mathematics, designed exclusively for such of the more advanced students as may desire to study the subjects taught therein. The course embraces the mathematical investigation of the general laws of equilibrium and motion, both of solids and fluids, with a variety of applications, especially to Physical Astronomy. The instruction in each class is conveyed partly by lectures, and partly by the systematic study of approved text-books, the student being assisted by full and frequent explanations from the Professor, and being constantly subjected to rigid examinations. The progress of the student in every class is also tested by his being required to perform written exercises, in which the principles acquired are applied to the solution of particular problems. The text books used are: for the Junior Class, Lacroix' or Davies' Arithmetic, Davies' Bourdon's Algebra, and Legendre's Geometry. For the Intermediate Class, Bourdon's Algebra, Legendre's Geometry and Trigonometry, Davies' Surveying, and Descriptive Geometry. For the Senior Class, Davies' Analytical Geometry, Young's Differential Calculus, and Young's Integral Calculus. Any student entering the school has the privilege of attending all or any of the classes, as he may elect, and if prepared to enter an advanced class, may often find it highly advantageous to review his previous studies by an attendance on a lower class also. IV.âNATURAL PHILOSOPHY. PROFESSOR WILLIAM B. ROGERS. There are three classes in this school: the Junior and Senior classes of Natural Philosophy, and the class of Geology and Mineralogy. In the Junior class the illustrations are experimental and graphical, with references to the simpler truths of Geometry. In the Senior Class the subjects, where they admit of it, are discussed mathematically. The aim of the course being a comprehensive view of general Physics, the instructions are given chiefly by lectures, though aided from time to time by text-books. The following is the plan of the course. TERRESTRIAL MECHANICS. 1. General or Rational Mechanics; consisting of Statics and Dynamics, or the doctrines of Equilibrium and Motion, and their various applications. 2. Mechanics of Solids.âMolecular Structure of Solids, Excitement and Transfer of Force, Elements of Machinery, Friction, Strength of Materials, Motive Powers, &amp;c. 3. Mechanics of Liquids.âMolecular Structure, Resulting Laws of Equilibrium and Pressure, Flotation, Specific Gravities, Waves, Motions through Pipes, &amp;c., Resistance, Hydraulic Machines, &amp;c. 4. Mechanics of Airs.âMolecular Structure, Elasticity, &amp;c.; Atmosphere, Barometers and FormulÃ¦, Resistance, Pneumatic Machines, Hydro-Pneumatic do., &amp;c. 5.

Electro-Magnetic Phenomena and Laws, Thermo-Electricity, &amp;c. 10.âOptics.âPropagation, Reflection, Refraction of Light; Chromatics, Dispersion, Polarization, &amp;c.; Theories, Optical Instruments, Photography, the Eye, &amp;c. CELESTIAL MECHANICS OR ASTRONOMY. 1. Descriptive Astronomy.âGeneral View of Celestial Phenomena, Modes of Observing and Computing the Places and Motions of the Heavenly Bodies, Theory of Celestial Motions, &amp;c. 2. Physical Astronomy.âInvestigation of Forces, Planetary Gravitation, Perturbations, Tides, Nebular Theory, &amp;c. In the class of Geology and Mineralogy especial attention is given to the structure and mineral products of our own country. The great mineral zones are described by reference to maps and sections, the order of stratification pointed out, the nature of the materials shown by specimens, and the relations of all these features to the agriculture and other resources of the country particularly dwelt upon. Modes of exploring are taught and methods given for the analysis of ores, rocks, and soils. Text Books.âReference is made in the Junior Class to the works of Herschell, Brewster, Lardner, &amp;c.; in the Senior, to Young's Analytical Mechanics, and Norton's Astronomy; in Geology, to Lyell, Trimmer, or De La Beche; and in Mineralogy, to Allen, Dana, or any of the leading works. V.âCIVIL ENGINEERING. This school comprises the following branches of instruction, viz: I.âGraphical Mathematics, embracing Descriptive Geometry, Perspective Mensuration, &amp;c. II.âTheory of Levelling and Surveying, both ordinary and topographical. III.âTheory of Roads, Railroads, Canals, Bridges, &amp;c. IV.âTheoretical Mechanics, Hydrostatics, and Hydrodynamics, as connected with engineering. V.âLaws of Heat and Steam, Theory and Construction of the Steam Engine. VI.âGeology and Mineralogy. VII.âLevelling, Surveying, &amp;c., taught practically in the field. VIII.âPlan Drawing, Plotting, Topographical Drawing and Sketching. The subjects named under the six first heads are divided between the Professors of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. Those included under the 7th and 8th heads are taught by the Teacher of Drawing, under the superintendence of the Professor above-mentioned. VI.âCHEMISTRY AND MATERIA MEDICA. PROFESSOR R. E. ROGERS. CHEMISTRY. This subject, included in the medical as well as the general academic course, and forming a department of the School of Chemistry and Materia Medica, may be studied separately, or in conjunction with the latter. The Lectures, which are delivered twice a week throughout the session, embrace a very full illustration of all the topics of theoretical or practical importance in the science, and in its applications to Mineralogy, Geology, the Chemical Arts, Agriculture, and Physiology. Beginning with an account of the phenomena and laws of Heat, Light, and Electricity, Mechanical and Voltaic, the course next takes up the doctrines of chemical reaction, presenting a full and minute view of the principles of definite combination, with their hypothetical expression in the form of the atomic theory, and illustrating these doctrines by numerous experiments and drawings. To this succeeds Pneumatic Chemistry, in which are discussed the preparations, properties, and applications of the various gaseous bodies and their compounds. This is followed by the detailed account of the metals, their oxides, chlorides, and other compounds, connecting with each metal the chemical history of its important salts. A rÃ©sumÃ© is now given, accompanied by illustrations of the various processes of analysis deduced from the preceding facts. Organic Chemistry is next taken up, embracing an account of all the more important organic acids, alkaloids, and neutral principles, together with a view of the alcoholic, aceteous, and other fermentations; the Chemistry of nutrition, growth, respiration, &amp;c., in the vegetable and animal economy; and that of soils and manures, as connected with agriculture. In connection with these topics, experimental illustrations are given of all the valuable processes for detecting poisons and for counteracting their effects. The more important operations of analysis, as applied to ores, marls, &amp;c., are also described and exemplified. Throughout the course, use is constantly made of ample diagrams illustrating the chemical reactions, according to the method of equivalents; and the bearings of the recent generalizations of Dumas, Liebig, Kane, Graham, and others, are particularly referred to.âText-Book, Rogers' Turner. MATERIA MEDICA. The course of Materia Medica embraces: I.âGeneral Therapeutics, or an account of the effects of the various classes of remedies on the organism, and their modus operandi, so far as understood. II.âSpecial Therapeutics, or the application of these agents to individual diseases, as suggested by experience or the theory of the particular disease. III.âA detailed account of the medical agents, in their commercial history, physical properties, chemical habitudes, pharmaceutical preparations, doses, and the medical applications. To aid the student in arranging the multifarious details of the subject, and to abridge the labor of note-taking, a tabular digest of all the topics treated of, is at each lecture placed before the class. Upon this and the details of the lecture, the student is expected to be prepared, as well as upon the corresponding parts of the text-book. The means of illustration in Materia Medica are unusually ample, embracing a very full series of specimens of medicines in their various states, and an extensive suit of colored drawings of medical plants, on an enlarged scale. Text Book: Dunglison's Therapeutics and Materia Medica. The lectures on Chemistry are delivered twice a week; those on Materia Medica once a week, throughout the course. Meetings for examinations are held separately generally three times a weeks Frequent examinations are held on the lectures and text-book. in both departments of this school. 3 VII.âMEDICINE. PROFESSOR HOWARD. In this school are taught Medical Jurisprudence, Obstetrics, the Principles and the Practice of Medicine. It is composed of two classes. One of Medical Jurisprudence, and consisting of law, academical and medical students. The other of Obstetrics, the Principles and the Practice of Medicine, and consisting wholly of medical students. To allow the Medical student time to attain proficiency in Anatomy and Physiology, Chemistry, and Materia Medica, before he is required to apply these branches in the study of the Principles and the Practice of Medicine, the course is opened with Medical Jurisprudence, which is followed by Obstetrics, and both are completed before the Principles or the Practice of Medicine are entered upon. MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE. The lectures on this branch show the aid which legislation and the administration of the laws derive from medicine, and consist chiefly of the application of the principles of medical science to the elucidation and administration of the laws, and the legal decisions in cases of insanity, every variety of mental impairment, crime, &amp;c., &amp;c. Text-Booksâthe Professor's Outlines, and Beck or Taylor. OBSTETRICS. The lectures on this branch comprehend an account of all labors, natural, preternatural, and instrumental, the professional assistance to be afforded in each, the treatment of a female before, during, and after delivery, and the diseases of infancy. The lectures are amply illustrated by specimens and plates, and all manual evolutions, and the application of instruments, are demonstrated on the improved phantom of Hebermehl. The students also practice manual and instrumental delivery on the mannikin. Text Booksâthe last edition of Meigs' Midwifery. THE PRINCIPLES OF MEDICINE. The Principles of Medicine, as taught in this school, comprise General Pathology, and a brief view of General Therapeutics; also Etiology, Nosology, Semeiology, Diagnosis, and Prognosis. The nature and division of causes are first considered, which introduces the student to their effectsâdiseases. Pathology proper is next considered under the two forms, Functional and Structural diseases. Functional diseases, being composed of elements, ultimate and proximate, are analyzed into their constituent parts, and the elements considered separately before they are contemplated in combination. Structural diseases being rarely confined to one anatomical element, cannot be strictly distinguished into ultimate and proximate elements, and are therefore arranged under the three heads, increased, diminished, and perverted nutrition. After the student thoroughly understands the nature of the causes of diseases, their divisions, modes of operation, and the resulting effects upon function and structure in the ultimate and proximate elements of disease, a general view is given of the influences that can be brought to remove or counteract their elements. And the course on the Principles is then concluded by the consideration of nosology, semeiology, diagnosis, prognosis, and the different modes of death. Text-bookâWood's Pathology. PRACTICE OF MEDICINE, OR SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SPECIAL THERAPEUTICS. As the most natural and practically useful arrangement, all local diseases are classified and treated of according to their locality, or the organ or set of organs which they affect, whilst general diseases are arranged altogether pathologically. Much attention is given to Physical Diagnosis. Pathological Anatomy occupies a conspicuous place in the course, and is illustrated by Carswell's large and splendid colored plates, and, when practicable, by specimens. Text-bookâWood's Practice of Medicine. VIII.âANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY, AND SURGERY. PROFESSOR CABELL. There are two classes in this School, one of Anatomy and Surgery, the other of Physiology. In the former the lectures are illustrated by the demonstration of wet and dry anatomical preparations, by the use of the splendid anatomical plates of Bourgery and Jacob, and especially by dissection of fresh subjects with which the School is abundantly supplied. A full course of lectures on Anatomy is completed before the course on Surgery is commenced, each course embracing a term of about four and a half months. In the lectures to the class on Physiology are considered the functions of the various organs of the body, the mode in which they are accomplished and the influence of external agents, as well as of the reactions of the organs on each other, whether as healthy vital stimuli or as sources of disease. The Professor aims to adapt his lectures in this class to the wants of the unprofessional student, who may desire to include in a course of liberal education an acquaintance with the general principles of the Science of life. In both classes the students are subjected to rigid examinations on the lectures and occasionally on portions of some approved text book. Books recommended: On Anatomy: any one of the treatises in the subjoined list: Goddard's Wilson's AnatomyâHorner's Special Anatomy and HistologyâPancoast's Wistar's AnatomyâPattieson's Cruveilhier's Anatomy. On Surgery: Druitt's Modern Surgery and Miller's Principles of Surgery. On Physiology: Carpenter's Elements of Physiology or Human Physiology by the same author. DEPARTMENT OF PRACTICAL ANATOMY. J. S. DAVIS, DEMONSTRATOR OF ANATOMY. This department is under the immediate charge of the Demonstrator with a general supervision on the part of the Professor of Anatomy and Surgery, and is abundantly provided with fresh subjects for the use of the members of the class. As, owing to the length of the session, the medical students attend but two lectures a day, ample time is allowed them for private dissection by day-light. MEDICAL SCHOOL. From the foregoing announcement it will be seen that by the organization of the University, provision is made for teaching all the branches of Medical Science. A joint committee of the two houses of the Legislative Assembly, appointed to investigate the affairs of the University, having had their attention directed to the peculiar features of this school, appended to their Report a notice of the advantages resulting from the direct connection of a Medical School with a general University, from which the following statement is extracted. 1. Length of Session.âNearly all the medical schools of this country are located in our cities or larger towns, and have only a nominal connection with the colleges from which they borrow their names and chartered privileges. In these schools the usual length of a term of instruction by courses of lectures is four months. In order to embrace all the important branches of Medical Science in a course of instruction compressed into so short a term, it is found necessary to employ the services of six or seven Professors, who deliver six lectures a day. By this arrangement the students, if they attend all the lectures, are required to spend nearly the whole of the day in listening to lectures delivered in rapid succession, and treating of diverse topics. None but those who have had personal experience in this matter, can fully appreciate the troubles and difficulties which beset a tyro at the commencement of his attendance upon lectures, the fatigue of body and perplexity of mind which he inevitably experiences in his painful efforts to hear every lecture, and master every subject. In attempting, after the close of the lectures for the day, to bring in review the topics discussed by his teachers, he finds links in the chain here and there broken, he flies from one subject of thought to another, without adequately mastering any, and confounded by their number and the utter impossibility of keeping pace in his private reading at night with the lectures of six Professors, he despairs of doing more than retaining such portion of the facts stated in the lectures as may happen to make the strongest impression on his mind. In the Medical Department of this institution, the length of the session, which is nine months, enables three Professors to perform all the duties which are elsewhere assigned to six. The students attend but two lectures a day, and thus have ample time for private reading and for pursuing their Anatomical dissections. 2. System of Daily Examinations.âImmediately before each lecture, the students in every school of the University are subjected to a rigid examination on the subject of the preceding lecture, or on portions of some approved text-book. Experience has shown this to be an almost necessary adjunct to the system of teaching by lectures, and it is felt to be of such importance that the students in other Medical Schools into which its introduction to any adequate extent is precluded by want of time, resort to the expedient of employing the services of private instructers by whom they may be examined at night on the topics discussed each day in the lecture-room. The fee paid by the students for this necessary but extra-collegiate instruction, varies from $30 to $50 in each case for the four months term of lectures, and is usually about $100 for the whole year. These fees are often received by the Professors themselves, in addition to the usual collegiate fees. The enactments of the Visiters of the University prescribe that no Professor shall engage in pursuits of emolument unconnected with the service of the University, or shall receive from the members of his class any compensation in addition to that provided for by the laws. They further require every Professor to reside within the precincts, both for the purpose of assisting to enforce the discipline of the college and of being accessible to the students who may seek assistance in their private hours of study. These students, then, enjoy here advantages which elsewhere are purchased at a high price over and above the heavy necessary collegiate expenses. 3. Order of Studies.âAll Medical Colleges aim to place Medical education on a scientific basis. Indeed, if the practice of the healing art does not depend on general principles, embodied in the fundamental sciences of Anatomy, Chemistry, Physiology, Pathology, and Therapeutics, these branches of Medical Science had as well be altogether omitted in a course of professional education. If, however, it does so depend, the propriety and necessity of laying a good foundation before the superstructure can be reared, are too obvious to need illustration. This cannot be done in city schools, in which, as above stated, the lectures on the different branches of medicine are carried on simultaneously. This system takes for granted that the students have "read," as it is termed, with a private practitioner of medicine for a year at least before he commences his attendance on lectures. This, however, is not always the case, and when it occurs is not always an advantage; for it is to be observed that the fundamental branches of Medical Science are precisely those which demand for their illustration the apparatus only to be found within the walls of colleges. It is one of the peculiar advantages of the University Medical School, that it unites, as may have been inferred from the preceding remarks, the plan of instruction by private pupilage with that of public lectures, while the length of the session puts it in the power of the Professors to pursue a philosophical order of studies, the students having an opportunity of mastering the elementary branches before their attention is directed to their practical applications. 4. Conditions of Graduation.âThe regulations for graduation of the Medical schools in cities require that the student shall have attended two full courses of Medical lectures, and shall have been the private pupil for a year or two of a respectable practitioner of medicine. The latter part of this requisition is, however, rarely insisted upon, although, as above stated, the fact of such previous study is taken for granted. At the University a consecutive course of nine months being more than equivalent to two courses in the city schools in respect to the time employed and the advantageous distribution of the subjects of study, the students are permitted to take their diploma at the end of one session, if they show themselves worthy. The rigidness of the examinations deters the majority of the class from making the trial, and none but the perseveringly diligent attain the honor, which is here truly a testimonial of attainments. 5. Location in a Village.âThis has been urged as an objection, while in point of fact it is the circumstance on which most of the advantages just cited depend. A residence in a country village is, moreover, free in a large degree from the objections that apply to a city in view of the temptations to extravagance and dissipation in its worst forms. The importance of the advantages attributed in the foregoing notice to the Medical Department of this Institution has been tested by the experience of near twenty years, during which time about one thousand medical students have been educated. 6. It will be noticed that those students who desire to take their diploma at a city school will yet find an advantage in attending the first course in an institution organized on the plan of the Medical Department of the University, by which they avoid the expense of employing a private instructer, whose other avocations may and commonly do disqualify him for the proper discharge of his duties as a teacher. IX.âMORAL PHILOSOPHY. PROFESSOR M'GUFFEY. There are three classes in this school. The Junior Class studies Rhetoric, Belles-Lettres, and Philosophical Criticism. Text-Books.âBlair's Lectures, Campbell's Philosophy of Rhetoric, (Alison on Taste), (Montgomery's Lectures), and Kames' Elements of Criticism. The Intermediate Class studies Political Economy, Statistics, and the Philosophy of Social Relations, or "Ethics of Society." Text-Booksâon Political Economy, (A. Smith), Say, (McCulloch), Tucker and (Carey); on the progress of Society, (Ferguson), Guizot, (Taylor), and (McKinnon.) The Senior Class studies Mental Philosophy, Logic, (inductive and deductive), together with Theoretical and Practical Ethics. Text-booksâon Mental Philosophy, Brown's Lectures, Cousin's Psychology, in connection with Locke's Essay. On Logic, (Mill), and Whately. On Ethics, (Butler), Stewart, (Whewell), and Jouffroy. The lectures will be carried on concurrently during the session, two a week, to each class. The examinations will be on the Professor's Lectures and the text-books, that is, those books enumerated above, the names of which are not included in parentheses. Those so included are to be consulted, but are not required to be studied as text-books. X.âLAW. PROFESSOR MINOR. This school is arranged into two classes, Junior and Senior. The Junior Class studies the Law of Nature and Nations, the Science of Government, Constitutional Law, and the elementary principles of Municipal Law. The text-books used by it are Vattel's Law of Nations, the Federalist, Madison's Report of 1799, and Blackstone's Commentaries; in addition to which lectures are delivered on Government, and on various topics of National and Constitutional Law, not discussed in the text-books. The subjects studied by the Senior Class are the Common and Statute Law, the Principles of Equity, and Maritime and Commercial Law. The text-books in this class are Coke upon Littleton (Thomas' edition), Stephen on Pleading, Greenleaf on Evidence, Chitty on Contracts, Smith's Mercantile Law, Matthews on Executors, Fonblanque's Equity, and Mitford's Equity Pleading. The student, for purposes of reference, should also be provided with Gordon's Digest of the Laws of the U. States, and Tate's Digest of the Laws of Virginia The design of this arrangement of the school into two classes, is, in part, to embrace in the Junior Course those studies which not only form an essential part of a liberal professional education, but which, from their universal interest and importance, constitute a highly useful branch of general education, whilst the Senior Course is occupied exclusively with the study of the theory and practice of Law, as a profession. Students may attend either class or both, and those not wishing to study Municipal Law at all, can enter for that portion of the Junior Course which includes National Law, Government, and Constitutional Law. Candidates for a degree are required to attend both classes. Comments are delivered by the Professor on the text-books of both classes, the purpose of which is to supply what is deficient, and explain what is obscure in the text, and to induce a thorough practical comprehension of the subject under consideration. In his observations on Municipal Law, the Professor refers to the leading cases and authorities, American and English, which tend to illustrate the topic in hand, and particularly explains, in its approprate connection, the Statute Law of Virginia, and of the United States, and its effect on the preÃ¶xisting law. Each daily lecture is preceded by an examination on that of the preceding day, together with its text. A moot-court is instituted in connection with the school, upon a plan conforming minutely to the organization of the courts of the country, the exercises of which are directed, under the immediate superintendence of the Professor, with a view to familiarize the student with the practical details of his profession. His opinion is required on supposed cases; he is called upon to devise and to institute remedies, by suit or otherwise, to conduct suits at law, and in chancery, from their inception, through all their stages, to draw wills, conveyances, and assurances; and, in short, to discharge most of the functions devolving upon a practitioner of the law. Graduates in the school of Law, have the title of Bachelor of Laws, and, by Act of the Legislature, the diploma is equivalent to a license from the Judges. EXAMINATIONS. These are of three kinds; first, the daily examinations, which precede or alternate with the lectures; second, the public examinations, two in number, held the one about the middle of the session, the other at its close; and third, the examinations for graduation, held towards the end of the session. DAILY EXAMINATIONS. In the daily examinations the student is questioned both upon the subjects of the preceding lecture and such portions of the textbook as may have been designated by the Professor. His preparation thus tested is noted at the time of examination, and if the student shall exhibit material delinquency, the fact is communicated to his parent or guardian in the printed circular which is sent home at the close of every month. PUBLIC EXAMINATIONS. The two public examinations, embracing respectively all the subjects treated of in the first half, and all those treated of in the second half of the session, are thus conducted: The Professor of the school prepares in writing a series of questions to be proposed to the class, and affixes to them numerical values, according to his estimate of their relative difficulty. On the assembling of the class for examination, these questions are for the first time presented to them; and they are required to answer in writing in a prescribed time, without communication with one another or with other persons, and without any reference to books. Their answers are subsequently carefully examined and compared, and a value attached to each, not exceeding that of the corresponding question. In the schools of languages subjects may also be selected for oral examination, and the values of these exercises are marked at the time. The students are then arranged into four divisions, according to the merit of their examination, as determined by the following method: The numerical values attached to all the questions are added together, and also the values of the answers given by each student. If this last number amounts to three-fourths of the first, the student is ranked in the first division; if it be less than three-fourths, and as much as one half, in the second; if less than one-half, and as much as a fourth, in the third; if less than a fourth, in the fourth division. The examinations are conducted and the results ascertained by a committee, consisting of the Professor of 4 the school and two other Professors. The standing of the student at these examinations is communicated to his parent or guardian in the last circular of the session. Those who attain the first division receive in public, at the close of the session, a printed certificate of their distinction at one or both of the examinations, as the case may be, and their names are mentioned in the published account of the proceedings which terminate the course. These public examinations, though less thorough than the examinations for graduation, are sufficiently comprehensive and difficult to render it impossible for the student, without steady diligence, to secure a place in the first division. EXAMINATIONS FOR GRADUATION. These are partly oral and partly in writing, and are conducted by the Professor of the School, in the presence of two other Professors, forming with him the committee of examination for the school. Here the student is subjected to searching interrogations upon the details and niceties as well as the leading principles of the subject, and he is expected to be accurately versed in all the topics treated of in the lectures and the correlative texts. As a due acquaintance with our own language is made indispensable to the attainment of even the inferior honors of the University, all candidates for degrees are subjected to an examination, in order to test their qualifications in this respect. At this, which is called the English Examination, and is held near the close of the session, the student is called upon to correct in writing numerous errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation, and is required to prepare at the time a short composition on some appointed theme. DEGREES. These are of two classes, Academical and Professional. The Academical degrees are first, that of Proficient in certain special departments of a school; second, that of Graduate in a school; and third, that of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia. The degree of Proficient, otherwise called a certificate of proficiency, applies only to those branches of some of the schools which by the regulations the student is allowed to attend separately. These are Geology and Mineralogy, Political Economy, Belles Lettres, Medical Jurisprudence, Physiology, National Law, Constitutional Law and Government. The degree of Graduate in a school embraces, in the school of Ancient Languages, the Latin and Greek languages, in that of Modern Languages, any two of the languages taught in the school; in that of Mathematics, all the studies of the school except the mixed mathematics; in that of Natural Philosophy, the same, omitting Geology and Mineralogy; in that of Chemistry, the same, omitting Materia Medica; in that of Moral Philosophy, the same, omitting Political Economy. The degree of Graduate is also conferred in each of the languages separately, and in the Mixed Mathematics. None are admitted to these degrees who fail to give satisfactory evidence of their attainments at the public examinations and the examinations for graduation. THE DEGREE OF MASTER OF ARTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. To merit this, the highest academical honor of the institution, the student must have already become a graduate in the following schools: ANCIENT LANGUAGES, MODERN LANGUAGES, MATHEMATICS, NATURAL PHILOSOPHY, CHEMISTRY, MORAL PHILOSOPHY. He must moreover give proof of an accurate and comprehensive acquaintance with his entire course of studies, by an examination on all these subjects, in the presence of the whole Faculty; at the close of his academical career. And lastly, he must prepare and submit to the Faculty an essay or an oration, exhibiting a due degree of literary ability, and this, if so directed, he is required to read or deliver on the Public Day. The Professional degrees are that of Doctor of Medicine, conferred on graduates in the Medical Department; and Bachelor of Laws, on graduates in the School of Law. To merit the degree of Doctor of Medicine, the student must prove by his examinations, that he has made satisfactory attainments in Anatomy, Surgery, Physiology, Principles and Practice of Medicine, Obstetrics, Materia Medica, Chemistry, and Medical Jurisprudence. To attain the degree of Bachelor of Laws, he must in the same manner give evidence of a due acquaintance with the Law of Nature and Nations, the Science of Government, and Constitutional Law, Municipal Law, including the Common and Statute Law, the principles of Equity, and Commercial Law. Honorary Degrees are forbidden by the laws of the University. THE PUBLIC DAY. On the closing day of the session, which, unless that day be Sunday, occurs on the 29th June, the Visiters, Faculty, Officers, and Students, and the Society of Alumni, assemble in the Rotunda, whither also are invited the friends of the students, and the public generally. On this occasion the certificates and diplomas are awarded to the successful candidates, the results of the examinations are announced, and addresses are delivered by one or more of the Masters of Arts, and by the Orator appointed by the Society of Alumni. EXPENSES. The expenses for the session of nine months, (commencing the 1st of October, and ending the 29th June following), are as follows: Board, including diet, bedding and other room furniture, and attendance, $100 Fuel and candles, to be furnished by the Proctor at cost, and 5 per cent. commission, estimated, if only one student in the dormitory, at $30, if two students in the dormitory, at 15 Rent of an entire dormitory $16; for half, if occupied by two students 8 Matriculation fee and public rooms, 15 Feesâif one Professor be attended, $50; if two, each $30; if more than two, each $25âsay, 75 Total, exclusive of books and stationary, clothing and pocket money, $213 When the student attends only the class of Geology and Mineralogy, in the School of Natural Philosophy; of Physiology, in the School of Anatomy; of Medical Jurisprudence, in the School of Medicine; or of National Law, Government, and Constitutional Law, in the School of Law, the fee is fifteen dollars each. Ministers of the gospel, and young men preparing for the ministry, may attend any of the schools of the University, without payment of fees to the Professors. The expenses of the students resident in the University, are limited as follows: 1. For board, the use of the dormitory and public rooms, and tuition fees, the sums before stated. 2. For clothing during the session, an amount not exceeding one hundred dollars. 3. For pocket money during the session, a sum not exceeding forty-five dollars. 4. For books and stationary, whatever the parent or guardian may think fit to allow. 5. For medicine and medical attendance, whatever may be necessary. These are in no case to be exceeded, unless under special circumstances the Faculty shall allow it. PROHIBITION OF CREDIT. The Act of the Legislature prohibiting merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting students, is here strictly enforced. The license to contract debts, which the chairman is authorized to grant, is confined (except where the parent or guardian otherwise in writing requests), to cases of urgent necessity; and these it is hoped that parents and guardians will, as far as possible, prevent from arising by the timely supply of the requisite funds. HOTELS OR BOARDING-HOUSES. Hotels or boarding-houses are provided within the precincts for the accommodation of students; and no student is permitted to board or lodge out of the precincts, unless in the family of his parent or guardian or of some particular friend, approved by the Faculty. Except that students above the age of twenty-one years may reside out of the precincts, in such private boardinghouses as the Faculty may approve. The charges at the private boarding-houses, those licensed by the Faculty, are required by the regulations not to exceed those of the hotels within the precincts. The hotel-keepers are bound to maintain good order among their boarders during meals, and to report all cases of misconduct of which they have knowledge, whether occurring in their own houses or elsewhere. KEEPING OF STUDENTS' FUNDS. Every student resident within the precincts is required, on matriculating, to deposit with the Patron all the money, checks, bills, drafts, and other available funds, which he shall have in his possession, or under his control, in any manner intended to defray his expenses while at the University, or on his return from thence to his residence. Nor shall he matriculate till he shall have deposited a sum at least sufficient to pay for the use of his dormitory and the public rooms, to pay the fees of the Professors, whom he may design to attend, to pay three months' board to his hotel-keeper, to purchase the text-books and stationary which he may want at the commencement, twenty dollars on account of fuel and candles, and ten dollars to cover contingent charges and assessments against him for injuries to the buildings, &amp;c., which two last mentioned sums are credited in the final settlement of his accounts. In like manner, he shall deposit with the Patron all the funds which he shall receive while a student of the University, for the purpose aforesaid. At the end of the first three months of the session, he shall deposit enough to pay his board and other expenses for the next three months; and at the expiration of the second period of three months, he shall deposit enough to pay his board and other expenses for the residue of the session. Students resident out of the University, are required, on matriculating, to deposit with the Patron funds sufficient to pay the fees of Professors whom they may propose to attend, the sum charged for the use of the public rooms, and ten dollars to cover contingent charges. PRIVILEGED STUDENTS. The Faculty, at their discretion, may allow any man, of undoubted moral character, above the age of twenty-three years, to attend lectures in any of the schools of the University, and to reside out of the precincts, exempt from the rules and regulations prescribed for the government of students; except only, that he shall pay the usual Professors' fees, and the usual compensation for the use of the public rooms, and shall observe all those laws of the Institution which enjoin respectful and orderly deportment. But the privilege so allowed may be withdrawn by the Faculty, at any time, when in their opinion it has been used to the evil example of the students, or otherwise to the injury of the Institution. MONTHLY CIRCULAR. At the end of every month, a circular letter is addressed by the chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from lecture and examination, and any other irregularities of which he may have been guilty; together with such further information as to the student's progress and conduct, as it may be deemed proper to communicate. The object of such report being on the one hand to incite the student to steady diligence by eliciting the commendation and encouragement of his friends, and on the other to restrain him from idleness and disorder, or to urge him to amendment by their admonition and advice, the usefulness of these circulars greatly depends upon the prompt and judicious attention they receive from those to whom they are addressed. Parents and guardians therefore cannot be too earnest in communicating such advice or encouragement as the monthly reports may suggest. LIBRARY. The Library of the University, originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, has since been augmented by two very valuable donations, the one a legacy from Mr. Madison, the other from a generous and enlightened citizen of Richmond, the late Christian Bohn, Esq. Through these additions, and the annual increase by purchase, it now numbers upwards of 17,000 volumes, comprising an unusually large proportion of standard literary and scientific works, in the principal European languages, together with a rich and extensive collection of engravings. Under certain restrictions, students are allowed the use of the books, and the Librarian is in attendance at stated hours to comply with their orders and to receive the books returned. SOCIETY OF ALUMNI. This association is composed of such former students of the University as, having finally left the Institution, have on nomination been elected members, at the annual meetings. Its objects are the promotion of letters and general education, as well as the renewal from year to year of the pleasing associations of academic life. The society holds its meetings at the close of the session, commencing business usually on the 28th and terminating on the 29th of June. An orator or essayist is annually appointed by the society from among its members, and the oration or essay is generally delivered in the Rotunda on the Public Day, at the conclusion of the academical proceedings. RELIGIOUS EXERCISES. Divine service is performed in the chapel every Sunday morning and evening during the session, by the Chaplain of the University, who is appointed in turn from the principal religious denominations. Students also have the opportunity of attending service at any of the churches in Charlottesville. STATE STUDENTS. To render education at the University available to meritorious young men of limited means, the Visiters have provided that one student from each senatorial district of the Commonwealth, shall be admitted without payment of Professor's fee, or University charges, fines and penalties excepted. The advantage is meant to be restricted to those who are not themselves, and whose parents are not in a situation to incur the expenses of education, otherwise. Their connection with the University is to continue two years, but for extraordinary proficiency the Board may prolong the term. They stand, in all respects, except expense, on the same footing as other students, enjoying the same privileges, and subject to the same laws. By way of remuneration to the State for the assistance thus afforded, they are expected to teach in some public or private school within the limits of Virginia, for two years after leaving the University. With a view further to reduce the expenses of such students, provision has been made at the expense of the University, that the sum paid by them for board, shall not exceed sixty dollars for the session of nine months. The whole expense, independently of clothes and pocket-money, is estimated at 100 dollars. The cost of text-books in the Academic Schools (included in the $100) is about $25 each, in the Medical Department it is about $35, and in the Law-school, about $55. Text-books in any of the schools may be procured on reasonable terms, at a book-store near the University. The selection of students, on this foundation, is made by the Faculty on the first day of July, annually. Applications for vacancies, accompanied by proper testimonials, should reach the University by the 25th of June. ? Persons interested will be pleased to observe the following particulars: 1. The applicant is requested to state his age, which must be over sixteen years, and to designate the several schools of the University, he may wish to enter, observing that the enactments require him, if under the age of twenty-one years, to attend at least three, unless, for good cause, the Faculty permit him to attend a less number. 2. In order to be admitted, the applicant must exhibit satisfactory testimonials; 1st. Of irreproachable moral character; 2nd. Of capacity, as well by partial cultivation, as original vigor of mind, to profit by the instruction given at the University; 3rd. If he desires to enter the schools of Mathematics, or of Natural Philosophy, that he possesses a familiar acquaintance with all the branches of numerical Arithmetic, or if he desires to enter the School of Ancient Languages, that he is qualified to commence the study of the higher Latin or Greek authors; and 4th. That neither he, nor his parents are in a situation to incur the expense of his education without aid. ?
