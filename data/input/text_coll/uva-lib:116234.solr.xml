      <field name="fulltext">THE CURRY MEMORIAL DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. Edwin Anderson Alderman, Ph.B., D.C.L., LL.D. President. John Levi Manahan, M.A., Ph.D. Dean. CHARLES GILMORE MAPHIS Professor of Education JOHN LEVI MANAHAN, M.A., Ph.D. Professor of Educational Administration WILLIAM ROYALL SMITHEY, M.A., Ph.D. Professor of Secondary Education GEORGE OSCAR FERGUSON, JR., M.A., Ph.D. Professor of Educational Psychology HISTORY. The Curry Memorial School of Education was founded in 1905 as one of the academic schools of the University. It was endowed by gifts of $100,000 from John D. Rockefeller and $50,000 from the General Education Board, and was named in honor of Dr. J. L. M. Curry, the Southern educator. There were originally two professorships in the School, the Curry Memorial Professorship of Education and the Professorship of Secondary Education. In 1914 a chair of Educational Psychology and Principles of Teaching was added to the School, and two years later a Professorship of School Administration was established. In 1919 the School was organized into a Department of the University, with four professorships, and was placed upon a professional basis similar to that of the Departments of Law, Medicine and Engineering. The relation of the Department of Education to the various academic schools of the University remains close, however, since the academic training of students of Education is obtained in the academic schools, and courses in Education are credited toward the academic degrees. PURPOSE. The rapid development of educational science and practice has made it necessary that ample provision be made for the professional training of those who expect to teach or to administer school affairs. It is the main purpose of the Department of Education to provide opportunity for such professional training. Since education is of great importance as an agency of Democracy and as an aspect of civilization, the Department also aims to provide courses of cultural value for citizens generally. In addition to affording opportunities for study and training, the Department, as a part of the State University, offers its services to school authorities throughout Virginia, with a desire to coöperate in the solution of practical educational problems and in the furtherance of public education. PEABODY HALL. Peabody Hall, the Education Building, was named in honor of George Peabody, who in 1867 made his great gift to the cause of education in the South. The building was made possible through a gift of $40,000 from the trustees of the Peabody Education Fund. This amount was supplemented by an appropriation of $12,000 from the Rector and Visitors of the University. The building was completed in 1912, and is the home of the Curry Memorial Department of Education. The plans were drawn by a modern school architect, and approved by the leading authorities on school architecture in this country who were consulted before its erection. It is, therefore, a model of excellence in this regard. It is one of the best equipped buildings in the University, and has ample classroom and laboratory facilities, and an excellent auditorium equipped with a modern motion picture machine. Modern requirements in heating, lighting and ventilation are exemplified in its construction without sacrificing conformity to the general style of classic architecture prevailing in the University. THE HECK MEMORIAL LIBRARY. The Department of Education maintains its own library in Peabody Hall, named in honor of the first professor of Education in the University, the late Professor William Harry Heck. The library consists of numerous select books covering every field of Education, a complete file of the publications of the United States Bureau of Education, various national, state and foreign documents, State School Laws, State Superintendents' Reports, City Superintendents' Reports, etc. Files of the leading educational magazines are available for free use of the students. Extensive exhibits of school textbooks are at hand for comparative studies. OBSERVATION AND DIRECTED TEACHING. Ample laboratory facilities are made available through the coöperation of the public schools of the City of Charlottesville and the County of Albemarle. Arrangements have been made whereby students in Education will do observation work and directed teaching in the city schools under close supervision by the City Superintendent of Schools and the Education Faculty. This arrangement gives the Department adequate facilities for effective practical work by every candidate for a degree in Education. The city school system consists of three schools, two elementary schools, one for whites and one for colored, and one high school. The new McGuffey Elementary School is a model of modern school architecture. The Midway High School has an enrollment of 400, a teaching staff of 20, and has 81 classes meeting daily. Besides work in observation and directed teaching, the city schools are also available for studies in school administration, secondary education and educational psychology. Certain well-qualified students will be assigned special problems to study under the direction of the Superintendent of Schools and the Education Faculty. Arrangements have been made whereby the schools of Albemarle County become a part of the laboratory system of the Department of Education. Students in School Administration and Secondary Education will be required to study the organization and supervision of the county system of schools. Advanced students may be assigned to make special studies under the supervision of the Division Superintendent of Schools and the Education Faculty. CLASSES OF STUDENTS. Candidates for the Degree of Bachelor of Science in Education.—To be admitted to regular standing as candidates for the Bachelor of Science in Education, students must have satisfied the entrance requirements of the College. Students who have decided to enter the teaching profession at the time of entering college should register with the Dean of the Department of Education in order to be advised by members of the faculty in planning their curricula. Holders of State Teachers' Scholarships are required to register with the Department of Education. Three courses in Education (Education B1, Education B2 and Education B3) are especially suited to the needs of first-year students. These courses count as group electives in Group VI toward any degree offered in the College. Requirements for the Admission of Women.—To be admitted to the Department of Education, women must be twenty years of age, must meet the entrance requirements of the University and must have completed two years of college work aggregating thirty session-hours in academic subjects. Candidates not able to meet these requirements may make up their deficiencies during the summer quarter. Special Students.—Graduates of colleges and universities other than the University of Virginia, desiring to secure the necessary professional training to qualify for the Collegiate Professional Certificate, may register in the Department of Education and upon completion of the required courses receive a certificate which will entitle them to the Collegiate Professional Certificate issued by the State Board of Education. Graduate Students.—Students meeting the entrance requirements of the Graduate Department of the University of Virginia may take the advanced courses in Education by meeting the prerequisite requirements in the individual courses. STUDENT ADVISERS. Each student registering in the Department of Education will be assigned an adviser by the Dean of the Department. Students should feel free to consult their advisers regarding their courses and any other problems arising in their university life. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE OF BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN EDUCATION. Candidates for the Degree of Bachelor of Science in Education must complete 63 session-hours, divided among Group Electives, Education, and Electives-at-large. A. Group Electives: 33 session-hours, distributed as follows: Group I: (Foreign Languages.) 6 session-hours, in two subjects. Group II: (Mathematical Sciences.) 3 session-hours in Mathematics A1. Group III: (Natural Sciences.) 6 session-hours. Group IV: (Social Sciences.) 6 session-hours. Group V: (English.) 9 session-hours, of which 3 must be English A1. Group VI: (Philosophical Sciences.) 3 session-hours in Philosophy B3 or Education B1. B. Education: 15 session-hours in Education, which must include Education B2, B5, B7, B10 and B11. Candidates having had successful experience in teaching may be permitted to substitute other work for Education B11. It should be noted that Education B10 and B11 give one session-hour and two session-hours credit, respectively, thus leaving one course in Education to be elected. Students taking Education B1 to fill the requirement in Group VI will elect some course other than Education. C. Electives-at-Large: Exclusive of Education: 15 session-hours, of which 3 should be in Physical Training B1. Not less than 9 session-hours must be in some group to be known as the candidate's major group, including one C course. GRADUATE WORK IN EDUCATION. Graduate Study.—Graduate courses in Education leading to the degrees of Master of Arts, Master of Science or Doctor of Philosophy may be pursued in the Department of Graduate Studies. Students who desire to undertake graduate work in Education must meet the entrance requirements of the Department of Graduate Studies. The Department of Education offers the following graduate courses: Education C1, Advanced Educational Psychology; Education C2, Educational Surveys, State, City and County; Education C3, Standard Tests in School Subjects; Education C4, Problems in Secondary Education; Education C5, Sociology and Education; Education C6, Mental Tests and their applications; Education D1, Seminar in Educational Psychology; Education D2, Seminar in School Administration; and Education D3, Seminar in Secondary Education. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. Required for Admission to the Department.—A candidate for admission to the Department of Graduate Studies must have a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank or from a standard state normal school offering a four year course; or, in case the institution he attended does not confer such a degree, he must present a certificate of graduation in a course of study accepted by the Academic Faculty as fully equivalent to that ordinarily required for the degree in question. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN EDUCATION. A candidate who has received a baccalaureate degree from the University, or who has fulfilled the conditions above specified under entrance requirements, is entitled to the degree of Master of Science in Education upon the successful completion of four graduate courses in Education in three fields with the restrictions detailed below: No C course which a candidate has offered as a part of the work credited for a baccalaureate degree may be counted for the Master's degree. A candidate must take at least two graduate courses in Education during the last year of his work for a Master's degree, and no candidate may receive this degree until at least one year after he has received his baccalaureate degree, except by special consent of the faculty in Education. A candidate may register for the degree of Master of Science in Education who holds the degree of Bachelor of Arts, the cultural degree of Bachelor of Science or the Bachelor of Science in Education of this University. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY. A candidate for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy must hold a baccalaureate degree of this university, or, if he be a graduate of some other institution, he must have fulfilled the conditions above specified under Entrance Requirements. The requirements for the degree are as follows: (1) A reading knowledge of French and German, attested by the successful completion of the B courses in these languages, or else by examinations held at the beginning of the first year of the candidate's work for the doctorate, by committees consisting of the professor in charge of the candidate's major subject and the professors of French and German, respectively. If the candidate fails on one or both of these examinations, he will be required to enter the appropriate course in one or both of these languages. No student will be regarded as a regular candidate for the doctorate until he has fulfilled this requirement. (2) The successful completion of at least three years of graduate work in Education in three fields, to be known, respectively, as the candidate's major, primary minor and secondary minor. The major must be pursued for at least three years, the primary minor for at least two years, and the secondary minor for at least one year. No C course may be counted toward the doctor's degree unless preceded by B work in the same subject aggregating at least 6 session-hours; or, in case only one 3 session-hour course is offered in that subject, by one B course in that subject and a second B course in the same Group, chosen with the approval of the professor in charge of the C course in question. Any student taking a D course in Education may be required by the professor, with the approval of the Education Faculty, to attend such lectures or courses in any of the Academic Schools as the professor may deem necessary. Graduate work done in other universities may be accepted in lieu of resident work, provided sufficient evidence is furnished by examination, written or oral, or both, that such work has been of a grade similar to that required here, and has been satisfactorily performed, and provided also that the candidate takes in this university at least one graduate course in his primary minor, and does at least one year's resident work in his major subject. A candidate who is a professor in a chartered college or university, of the subject selected by him as major, may be allowed by the Education Faculty to spend only two years in resident work. In all cases the work of the last year of candidacy shall be done in residence, unless the Academic Faculty shall for special reasons direct otherwise. (3) A dissertation exhibiting independent research in some branch of the candidate's major subject. The dissertation must be submitted to the Education Faculty not later than April 15 of the year in which the candidate applies for the degree. Moreover, the copy presented for the faculty's approval shall be written (typewritten, if feasible) on paper of prescribed quality and size, shall be bound, and shall have certain prescribed phrases on the cover and title page. If the dissertation is accepted by the faculty as satisfactory the copy submitted shall immediately become the property of the University. Before the degree is conferred the dissertation must be printed at the candidate's expense, and one hundred copies deposited in the library of the University; or, if this be impracticable on account of lack of time, the candidate must deposit with the Bursar a sum of money sufficient to have a hundred copies of the dissertation printed. (4) A candidate for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy with any field of Education as a major subject, shall (a) pass, at least two terms prior to receiving the degree, preliminary written examinations in each of the following fields: History of Education, Educational Psychology, Educational Administration, Secondary Education, Education Sociology; and (b) pass a final oral examination upon his dissertation and the general fields of his major and minor subjects.

Candidates for the B.A. and cultural B.S. degrees may fulfill the requirements of Group VI by selecting two of these courses. The other courses in Education count as Electives-at-large toward the above degrees. COLLEGIATE PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE. Recipients of the Bachelor of Science in Education will receive the Collegiate Professional Certificate, the highest form of certificate for high-school teachers issued by the State Board of Education. This certificate is valid for ten years, renewable for a similar period, and entitles the holder to teach in both high and elementary schools in Virginia. Holders of Collegiate Certificates, the certificate of second rank issued by the State Board of Education, may obtain the Collegiate Professional Certificate by attending the University one session and taking four three-session-hour courses in Education. Curricula organized to meet the requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Education will fulfill the professional requirements for the highest form of professional and collegiate high school certificates issued by the state departments of education in the other southern states. SPECIAL CERTIFICATES IN HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS. Students who find it necessary to leave college to teach before completing their full course may be issued special certificates by the State Board of Education to teach any high-school subjects in which they have completed two full years of study of college grade. These students should plan to take two courses in Education during their second year in order to become familiar with school problems. COURSES FOR TEACHERS IN SERVICE. Saturday courses in any subject offered in the Department of Education will be arranged at the University for teachers in service, if requested by at least five teachers. Degree credit will be allowed on the same basis as in the regular courses, provided that not more than one and one-half session-hours' credit shall be given for the work in any course for one year. EXTENSION CENTERS. The Department will encourage the organization of extension courses in convenient centers, for teachers in service. Members of the Education Faculty will personally instruct any such classes organized. Arrangements can be made to offer courses in Educational Psychology and Mental Tests, Secondary Education and Educational Tests and Measurements. The professors in charge will meet the classes regularly, probably once each week. Credit toward meeting the professional requirements for certificates will be allowed by the State Board of Education. BUREAU OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS. Educational Tests.—The Department of Education maintains a Bureau of Tests and Measurements as a feature of its extra-University service. Select standard tests in school subjects will be supplied to cities, counties and individual schools at cost. Members of the Faculty of Education will visit the schools to be tested, train teachers in the use of the tests and personally direct the giving and scoring of them, provided the necessary traveling expenses are borne by the schools served. Mental Tests.—In connection with its work in educational psychology, the Department undertakes to assist school authorities in the diagnosis and training of backward and gifted children. Assistance will be rendered in the making of mental surveys and the establishment of special classes. A clinic will be maintained for the study of cases accessible to the University and the services of the professor in charge will be available to any community in Virginia at the cost of the necessary test materials and traveling expenses. Any school official desiring the services of the Bureau of Tests and Measurements should address the Dean of the Department. BUREAU OF APPOINTMENTS. The University of Virginia maintains a Bureau of Appointments in charge of a committee consisting of Professors J. L. Manahan, W. R. Smithey, J. C. Metcalf and I. F. Lewis. The services of the bureau are free to all teachers and prospective teachers seeking positions in secondary schools (both public and private), normal schools, and colleges. Correspondence with regard to appointment should be addressed to the Bureau of Appointments (J. L. Manahan, Director), University, Virginia. EDUCATION CLUB. An Education Club is conducted for the purpose of fostering a scientific study of educational problems. Membership is open to all students taking courses in Education, teachers, principals and superintendents now in service, and members of the faculty of the University who are willing to lend their influence and efforts toward placing the teaching profession in Virginia and the South on a professional basis. SCHOLARSHIPS. In order to encourage the training of teachers, the General Assembly of Virginia, in 1918, founded one hundred and nineteen Virginia State Teachers' Scholarships, one for each School Division in the State. The emolument is free lodging, heat, light and janitor service in the university dormitories. The holder of one of these scholarships must be a Virginian needing financial assistance in order to attend the University, and he must pledge himself to engage in some form of school work in the State for at least two years, or, failing this, to repay to the University the value of the scholarship. Appointments are made prior to September 1, upon the recommendation of Division Superintendents of Schools. If any Superintendent fails to make a recommendation, the vacancy thus created may be filled from the State at large by the President of the University. Blank forms of application will be sent upon request. In addition to the Virginia State Teachers' Scholarships, there are a number of other scholarships in the University available for students of Education. A detailed description of them is given in the General Catalogue of the University. LOAN FUNDS AND STUDENT SELF-HELP. The University is in possession of funds from which loans are made to deserving students in need of such assistance. An account of these loans is given in the General Catalogue, page 97. Inquiries concerning them should be addressed to the Bursar. Opportunities for obtaining remunerative employment are afforded to students who are desirous by this means of partially paying their way through the University. It is difficult to give definite assurance of employment to a student before he reaches the University, but it may be stated that any student with sufficient resources to carry him through the first half of the session can be reasonably sure of obtaining work which will help defray his expense for the rest of the academic year. Information as to employment may be obtained from the secretary of the Committee on Student Self-Help, Madison Hall, University, Virginia. APPROXIMATE SUMMARY OF NECESSARY EXPENSES. The figures in the following tables may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of nine months. As necessary expenses are reckoned here university and tuition fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. Three estimates are given—a low, an average, and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundry— in other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. If a student shares a room with another student, and practices the strictest economy, he may possibly reduce his expenses below the low estimate.
