Sufficient Age.âThe minimum legal age is sixteen years. 2. Good Character.âThis must be attested by a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended, or by other valid proof. 3. Adequate Preparation.âThis must be such as will enable the candidate to meet the requirements for admission to the several departments of the University. ADMISSION BY CERTIFICATE For admission by certificate from a secondary school the applicant should file with the Dean, a certificate of preparation, made out on a blank form furnished by the University. This certificate must come from an accredited public high school or from an accredited private secondary school. For admission from an institution of collegiate rank, an official transcript of the applicant's record, made out on the form used by the institution in question, must be submitted. In addition, each applicant, whether from a secondary school or a college, must submit a formal application for admission, on a blank form supplied by the University. The candidate for admission from a public high school must be a full graduate of an accredited four-year high school. The candidate for admission from a private secondary school must be a full graduate of the school, or must present a certificate showing that he has completed at least the equivalent of four years of satisfactory secondary school work of standard grade, covering at least 15 entrance units. Certificate credit for any unit is invalidated by failure in a college entrance examination on the unit in question in the year admission is desired, unless the applicant ranked in the highest quarter of his class. An applicant for admission who ranked in the lowest quarter of his class, or who failed on more than two subjects in secondary school, will not be admitted unless he presents positive evidence that he is likely to succeed in college in spite of his secondary school record. An applicant for admission from outside of Virginia may be required to supplement his application by an interview with a representative of the University. In every case the applicant must have a general character recommendation from the principal of his school, and personality and promise, as well as scholarly attainment, will be considered in determining admission. The University accredits all four-year public high schools and all private secondary schools which are fully accredited by the State Board of Education of Virginia. Schools outside of Virginia which are fully accredited by their own state universities or institutions of equal rank, by their own state departments of education or by recognized regional associations of secondary schools, are also accredited by the University. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must in all cases pass the entrance examinations. ADMISSION BY EXAMINATION For admission by examination, the candidate must present himself at the University in September, according to the dates given in the Schedule of Entrance Examinations. The examinations are held under the Honor System, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge, and they are held only on the dates given in the Schedule. A fee of on dollar is charged for each examination taken. This fee is payable in advance and is in no case returned. In order to take the examinations it is only necessary for the candidate to register for them at the Dean's Office, after his arrival here. The entrance examinations of the University are similar, in many respects, to those of the College Entrance Examination Board. The University does not furnish sample copies of its entrance examinations. Official records of the examinations of the College Entrance Examination Board or of the University of the State of New York may be submitted in lieu of taking entrance examinations here.

Thursday Spanish 2: Two years 9:00 a. m. Wednesday Spanish 3: Third year 11:00 a. m. Wednesday Spanish 4: Fourth year 2:30 p. m. Wednesday ENGINEERING ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS For admission to the First-year Class in the Department of Engineering the candidate must be at least sixteen years old. He must present a certificate of honorable withdrawal from the school last attended, or other valid proof of general good character. He must further satisfy the Dean of the Department of Engineering as to his adequate preparation for the work by passing the Entrance Examinations specified below or by the presentation of equivalent certificates of preparation signed by an official of a recognized institution of collegiate rank, or by the principal of an accredited public high school or of an accredited private secondary school. An applicant for admission from outside of Virginia may be required to supplement his application by an interview with a representative of the University. The topics required for entrance and their values in units are as follows, the unit being one year's work on the subject in an accredited high school: English A.âGrammar and Grammatical Analysis 1 English B.âComposition and Rhetoric 1 English C.âCritical study of Specimens of Literature 1 Mathematics A.âAlgebra through Quadratics, Progressions, Binomial Formula 2 Mathematics C.âPlane Geometry 1 Mathematics D.âSolid Geometry Â½ Mathematics E.âPlane Trigonometry Â½ History.âAncient; Medieval; English; American (any one) 1 Electives 7 Total 15 High school students who expect to study Engineering are advised to include among their electives at least one Foreign Language (Latin or French or German), one Science (Chemistry or Physics with adequate laboratory work) and an additional unit of History. Other electives which may be profitably offered are History of English and American Literature, Greek, Botany, ZoÃ¶logy, Physical Geography. Conditioned Students.âA candidate may be admitted as a Conditioned Student in spite of some deficiencies in required entrance subjects, provided these are not such as will impair the integrity of his work, but he must submit not less than 15 units. No such candidate will be conditioned except upon subjects actually taught in this University, nor will any candidate be conditioned on more than 2 units; and all conditions must be absorbed before the beginning of the next session after initial registration. Courses taken for the removal of entrance conditions may in no case be counted as part of the work credited for any degree. No conditions will be allowed in English A or B or C or in Mathematics A or C. As the table of Entrance Requirements shows, the full High School course in Mathematics is required for entrance to the Department of Engineering, but unfortunately the graduates of the High Schools are often deficient in Solid Geometry and Plane Trigonometry and can be admitted only upon conditions in those subjects. High School principals are advised to urge their graduates, with this status, to attend a Summer Session at the University before entering the Department of Engineering so that these deficiencies may be overcome. If the prospective student finds it impossible to attend a Summer School previous to his regular matriculation, a course has been planned which will allow him to make up his deficiencies by taking work in the Summer School following his first year in Engineering. Such a program will prepare the student for Second-year standing and will save him from the failure usually encountered by students who attempt to make up the deficient work in regular session in addition to the full course of required subjects. Special Students.âA candidate may be admitted as a Special Student, without formal examination, provided he is more than twenty years old if a Virginian and not less than twenty-three years old if a non-Virginian, and gives evidence of serious purpose and of fitness to pursue with profit the course for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for any degree. No conditioned student may register later as a special student. ADMISSION OF WOMEN Women are admitted as candidates for the Engineering Degrees but not as Special Students. A candidate must be at least twenty years old on the birthday preceding matriculation; must present certificates showing graduation from an accredited public high-school, or not less than four years' attendance in an accredited private school, with credit for not less than 15 college entrance units obtained at least two years before admission to the University; and must in addition show by proper certificate the completion in a standard college, subsequent to the credit obtained for 15 entrance-units, of at least 30 session-hours (60 semester-hours), of courses of college grade, in not less than eighteen calendar months. ADVANCED STANDING Under the elective system of the University of Virginia, a student who has completed courses of college or university grade in other institutions of learning on mathematical or scientific subjects may be excused from attendance upon these courses by the Dean, with the advice and consent of the professor in charge, and will then be registered for the more advanced work, provided the full entrance requirements have been satisfied. In order to secure College Credit upon such courses toward a degree in Engineering from the University, the applicant must showâ 1. That the courses offered are coextensive with the corresponding courses as given in the University of Virginia. 2. That his grades on them were not below the 75 per cent. pass-mark of this University. Such credits may be granted by the faculty upon the recommendation of the Dean and the professors in charge; but are automatically revoked by the failure of the student to pass in the more advanced courses in the related topics. Advanced standing in the technical engineering subjects of higher grade than those of the Second-year will not be given except to graduates of other institutions offering technical engineering instruction and then only upon special consideration of each application for such advanced standing. No degree in Engineering will be awarded for less than one full year's work in a regular session of this University and the work of a candidate's last year must be performed in residence here. The same rules apply to Credits on Summer School Courses; except that for courses in the Summer School of this University the examination questions must be prepared by the professor in charge of the regular course, and the answers must be read and graded by him. Students, suspended from other universities, are not granted college credits on courses previously passed, except upon explicit recommendation of the suspending university, and after such additional tests as this Engineering Faculty may impose. Credits on Practice-Courses, in Drawing, or Field-work may be granted to applicants who have gained in professional practice the training which these courses represent. Such applicants must file with the Dean proper certificates from the official under whom the work was done and must in every case pass an additional practical test on the subjects for which credit is desired. College credit is not granted for high-school work. PROGRAMS OF STUDY The candidate who has satisfied the requirements for entrance as above defined is matriculated as a student of Engineering and admitted to the First-year Class. The studies of this class comprise lecture courses in English, Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Chemistry with associated laboratory courses in Chemistry, Drawing, and Field-work. All First-year students have the same courses. For advancement to the Second-year Class the student must have completed at least two-thirds of his First-year work. Upon entering this class the students majoring in Chemical Engineering begin their specialized work, while all others pursue identical courses of study through the year, except for courses in the third term. On entering this third term each student elects his specialty. The courses thereafter diverge according to the major subject chosen by the student. At the beginning of the fourth year the students of Mechanical Engineering must choose either the machinery or the aeronautical option. Programs of study for each degree are given below. The courses are so ordered that the specified entrance requirements are adequate for the work of the First Year. Each succeeding year presupposes the completion of the work for all the foregoing years. Students are advised to adhere strictly to the regular programs. The arrangements specified in them have been carefully planned and are the best. Departures from the curriculum will in almost every case produce conflicts in lecture hours or laboratory periods and may cost the student a year's time. Haphazard election is discouraged and in extreme cases will be prohibited. No student will be registered for a course unless, in the opinion both of the Dean and of the professor, his preliminary training has fitted him for the profitable pursuit of that course. Students are especially advised against the attempt to crowd too many studies into their scheme of work, and are warned that admission to advanced courses will be granted only to those who have adequate mathematical and scientific training to profit by them. Men overloaded with work, too great in volume or in difficulty for their powers, suffer inevitable discouragement and incur almost certain failure. Changes of classes with transfer of fees may be made, subject to the approval of the Dean, within two weeks after the beginning of any term. Thereafter such changes may be made only by special order of the faculty, and then without transfer of fees. Upon the completion of the four years' course as defined in any one of the Programs of Study, the faculty will award to any student in regular and honorable standing the degree of Bachelor of Science in Engineering. Upon the completion of the additional Graduate Course in a satisfactory manner the faculty will award the appropriate degree of Chemical Engineer, Civil Engineer, Electrical Engineer, or Mechanical Engineer. The five-year curriculum has been adopted at the University of Virginia in view of the impressive and growing demand from practicing engineers and industrial leaders that Schools of Engineering should enlarge the field of study to embrace more of the humanities and better opportunities for student research, to the end that the graduates may be better fitted to undertake their duties as engineers and citizens. GENERAL REGULATIONS REGISTRATION Registration.âApplicants seeking admission to the University must present themselves to the Deans of their respective Departments at some time during the first three days of the session. Delayed Registration.âAny student who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session will not be admitted unless he can explain his delay in a manner satisfactory to the Dean and will be charged a delayed registration fee. Registration after the Christmas Recess and the March Examination Period.âOn the first week-day after the Christmas Recess and the March examination period, every student is required to register by attending the first meeting of each class and laboratory section for which he is enrolled. No further formality is necessary. Any student failing to register thus will be required to pay the delayed registration fee, and will be liable to penalties imposed for unexcused absences. But if the delay is due to illness or other providential cause the Dean is authorized to remit the fee. RESIDENCE AND ATTENDANCE The Academic Year begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September and continues for thirty-nine weeks. Thanksgiving Day and Jefferson Day are holidays, and there is a Christmas recess beginning on the last week-day before the twenty-third of December and closing on the evening of the second of January. Attendance is required of each student throughout the entire session, with the exception of holidays, unless he receives permission to be temporarily absent, or to withdraw before the close of the session. While in residence each student is required to attend regularly all lectures and other prescribed exercises in the courses which he pursues, or else suffer such penalties as may be imposed for unexcused absences. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the Department in which the student is registered. For the conditions governing the return of fees upon withdrawal, see later section. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the several departmental faculties for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also the regulations as to delinquent students in the various departments. Absence from Examinations.âWritten examinations are an essential part of the work of every course in the University, and attendance upon them is required of every student. Absence may be excused only on the ground of sickness on the day of examination (attested by a physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause which may be approved by the several faculties of the University. Special Examinations are granted only upon prompt application therefor, and in case the applicant's absence from the regular examination has been excused. See the preceding paragraph. Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the Honor System, and an unpledged paper is counted a total failure. In matters of class standing as well, students are expected to regard themselves as governed by the law of honor. Prohibition of Credit.âAn act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting minor students. The license to contract debts, which the President is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity. CONDUCT Conduct.âThe laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or anywhere else. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University for the residue of the current session every student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. The President will dismiss from the University every student convicted of public drunkenness, or of other conduct reflecting serious discredit upon the University. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objection to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The publication or sale of anonymous publications is forbidden. Motor driven vehicles either owned or operated by students are prohibited from parking in the roadways or elsewhere on the University grounds between the hours of 9:00 a. m. and 3:30 p. m. At no time may they park in the alleys, near fire hydrants, or on curves. However, students suffering from serious physical disability may be granted permits to park. MEDICAL ATTENDANCE Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the University Physician; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for his maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, treatment of the eye, ear, nose and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of students, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Students who take the responsibility of boarding at houses not approved by the Board of Health forfeit the right of medical attendance. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the University Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. EXPENSES OF REGULAR STUDENTS The average annual expense of a student who pursues the regular course in Engineering will be: NonVirginians First-year Virginians Other Virginians University Fee $ 60.00 $ 50.00 $ 50.00 Tuition Fee 200.00 65.00 130.00 Athletic Fee 15.00 15.00 15.00 Topics Fee 1.50 1.50 1.50 Laboratory Fees (average) 35.00 45.00 35.00 Living Expenses (for 9 months) 375.00 375.00 375.00 Books and Drawing Materials 30.00 30.00 30.00 Incidental Expenses (for 9 months) 60.00 60.00 60.00 Total annual for average conditions $776.50 $641.50 $696.50 The charges for Tuition are uniform to all students, except that Virginians are relieved of tuition on certain courses, this exception saving regular Freshmen from Virginia $135 and all other Virginia students $70 each year in comparison with non-Virginians. The laboratory charges are $15 per class for the year's course in Physics, and $20 per class for a year's course in Chemistry. A deposit for breakage of $5 is required for each laboratory course in Chemistry. A fee of $5 for the year's course in Engineering Geology is charged. The fee for each practice course in the Engineering Department, Drawing, and Engineering Laboratories is $5 per term for each course. The fees for Field-work and Bridge Drafting are each $10 per term per course. These fees include all charges for laboratory materials; but the student is held further responsible for breakage. The Living Expenses include board, lodging, fuel and lights, servant and laundry; the average is $10.00 per week, the minimum $7.50, and a reasonable maximum $12.50. Books and Drawing Materials will cost about $120 for the four-year course. Incidental Expenses ought to be kept within modest bounds; the above estimate is sufficient; large allowances of pocket money promote idleness and attract companions of the baser sort. No allowances are included for clothing and travel, the expenses for which vary too much to be introduced into any general estimate. The charges payable on entrance are the University Fee, the Athletic Fee, the Topics Fee, and the Tuition and Laboratory Fees. Payment of Fees.âWhen the aggregate charge for University fee, tuition fee, laboratory fees, and room rent does not exceed $50 for the session, the total amount shall be paid upon registration. If said fees aggregate more than $50, but do not exceed $100, one-half thereof shall be paid upon registration and the remainder at the beginning of the second term. When the fees aggregate more than $100, payment shall be made one-third upon registration; one-third at the opening of the second term and the remainder at the opening of the third term. If any payment remain unpaid for fifteen days after the date on which it is due, the Bursar shall immediately notify the Dean of the Department in which such student is entered of the delinquency, and such student shall by him be required at once to cease attending lectures, using laboratories, library, gymnasium, athletic grounds or buildings, boarding at the dining hall, and making use of any other privileges as a student until his financial relations with the University have been arranged satisfactorily with the Bursar. Return of Fees.âA student withdrawing within five days after registering shall have his fees refunded in full, except the sum of $5 to cover cost of registration, and his name shall be stricken from the rolls. If he withdraw or is dropped from the rolls for any cause after the fifth day of the term and before the middle thereof, his fees shall be returned pro rata. If he withdraw or be dropped from the rolls for any cause after the middle of any term no refund shall be made for that term, except in case of sickness when the refund shall be pro-rated upon certificate of the University Physician or other reputable medical practitioner. In any case a minimum charge of $5 shall be made to cover cost of registration. Laboratory fees shall be refunded upon statement of professor in charge except where the withdrawal is within five days after registering. Regulation Concerning Registration as Virginia Student.âIn order to be considered a Virginia student, it is necessary that the applicant's parents be domiciled in the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; or if he has attained his majority, that he himself be domiciled in said State; and that either his parents or the applicant for admission shall have been bona fide taxpayers in the State of Virginia for at least two years prior to said application. Sons of Regular Officers of the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or Public Health Service, whether on the active or retired list, irrespective of the location of their posts of duty, are accorded the privilege of registering under the rules applicable to the registration of Virginia students. SCHOLARSHIPS The Accredited School Scholarships from accredited public or private secondary schools may be assigned to the Department of Engineering. Tenure, one year. Emolument, for Virginians, the remission of $60 in fees; for nonVirginians, the remission of $150 in fees. The holder must be a graduate of his school, he must rank in the highest quarter of his class, and he must enter the University the session immediately following his graduation. The Alumni Scholarships may be assigned to the Department of Engineering. Tenure, one year, but an incumbent may be eligible for reappointment upon recommendation of the Dean. Emolument, for Virginians, the remission of $60 in fees; for non-Virginians, the remission of $150 in fees. The holder must need financial aid in order to attend the University, and must file a written statement to this effect, together with a similar statement from his parent or guardian. He must have ranked in the highest quarter of the graduating class of his school, and must enter the University the session immediately following his graduation. The Philip Francis duPont Scholarships: Founded in 1928 upon the generous bequest of Philip Francis duPont, '00: In the Department of Engineering a number of these scholarships are awarded annually to both new and old students of the department. The emolument will vary from $100 to $150, depending upon the income available, with apportionment at the discretion of the Faculty of Engineering. The tenure of each scholarship is one year, but any incumbent may be reappointed upon recommendation of the Dean. Applicants for these scholarships who have not previously attended the University must have complied with the entrance requirements before their applications can be considered; they must give evidence of financial need; and they must have ranked in the highest quarter of their class. Preference is given to applicants who ranked in the highest tenth of their class. Applications must be made on a blank form supplied by the Dean. Students who have not attended the University must submit their applications not later than July 1; students attending the University must apply not later than May 1. The Isabella Merrick Sampson Scholarship in the Department of Engineering, with an income of $100: Founded in 1910 upon the gift of Mr. W. Gordon Merrick, of Glendower, Albemarle County, Virginia. Appointments are made upon the recommendation of the trustees of the Isabella Merrick Sampson Endowment. Preference is given to an applicant from Albemarle County. A limited number of additional scholarships may be granted in the Department of Engineering from those general scholarships open to any department of the University. A complete statement regarding all scholarships will be found in the General Catalogue. LOAN FUND AND STUDENT SELF-HELP The University is in possession of funds from which loans are made to deserving students in need of such assistance. An account of these loans is given in the General Catalogue. Inquiries concerning them should be addressed to the Bursar. Opportunities for obtaining remunerative employment are afforded to students who are desirous by this means of partially paying their way through the University. It is difficult to give definite assurance of employment to a student before he reaches the University, but it may be stated that any student with sufficient resources to carry him through the first half of the session can be reasonably sure of obtaining work which will help defray his expenses for the rest of the academic year. Information as to employment may be obtained from the Director, Bureau of Student Self-Help, Box 1487, University, Virginia. BOARD AND LODGING Dormitories.âStudents may reside in the University dormitories, in their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. The President will withdraw from the approved list any house in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Any change of residence during the session should be reported at the office of the Registrar. The Halls are reserved for first-year college and engineering students from high schools or preparatory schools who are required to live in them unless excused for special reasons by the Dean of the University. Supervision is provided by Counselors living in each unit of the Halls. These counselors are responsible to the Dean for maintenance of order and the enforcement of University regulations, and are prepared to be of assistance to the occupants in an advisory capacity. For rules governing the rental and occupancy of University dormitories, and the rates charged for the same, see below. For list of private lodging houses, with rates, apply to Bursar. The University Dormitories The dormitories of the University of Virginia consist of The Halls, East Lawn and West Lawn, East Range and West Range, Dawson's Row, and Randall Building. Hot water heat and electric light are furnished throughout the dormitories. Each occupant of a dormitory room must provide a pillow, pillow cases, single sheets, blankets, towels, etc., and whatever rugs, curtains, etc., he may desire. Description and Rates The Halls.âThe most comfortable, best-equipped, and most modern rooming accommodations in the University or in the city are to be found in the new University dormitories, erected in 1929. This group of eight buildings stands on the crest of the slope west of Monroe Hill, with an outlook on the Ragged Mountains and the range of the Blue Ridge, and is within less than three minutes walking distance from the gymnasium, the academic, engineering and law class-rooms, and the University Commons. These eight buildings are divided into twelve separate units, known as Halls, each with its individual entrance, and each bearing the name of some professor, distinguished in the history of the University. The buildings are of three stories and of full fire-proof brick and cement construction throughout. They provide one hundred and fifty-three two-room apartments, of living-room and bedroom, each apartment intended to accommodate two students. All of the rooms are approximately fifteen feet square. Each living-room has an open fire-place and is furnished with a desk with drawers, a table with drawer, a steel waste-basket, two rocking-chairs, two straight chairs and floor-plugs for reading lamps. Each bedroom has two large built-in clothes closets, and is furnished with two single beds, two chiffoniers, and two straight chairs. All furniture is new, of excellent quality and attractive design, the bed-springs and mattresses of especially high grade. There is an average of one bathroom to every five students. The bathrooms, each equipped with showers and an individual built-in steel locker and a medicine chest with mirror for each student using it, are so placed that every bed-room, with one sole exception, opens directly into a bath. Telephone service is provided in each Hall. Trunks and packing cases will not be permitted in the apartments of The Halls dormitories. They must be delivered to the trunk room in each Hall from which the student will remove the contents to his room. Trunks and packing cases will be stored in dry racks located in the basement. Each apartment will ordinarily be occupied by two students. The rental for the nine months of the regular session in $125 per student (or $250 for each apartment). East Lawn and West Lawn are of one-story brick construction. They contain thirty-eight rooms, each approximately twelve feet square, located between the pavilions and opening into colonnades running the entire length of "The Lawn." The rental of twenty-seven of the rooms, for the session, is $125 for one occupant or $170 for two occupants. The remaining nine rooms, called Bachelors' Row, rent for $115 to one occupant, or $160 for two occupants. These rooms are reserved for applicants for senior degrees. East Range and West Range consist of forty-six one-story brick rooms, approximately twelve feet square, built in sections running the entire length of "The Ranges," and opening into arcades. In addition, there are two two-story brick houses called the Old Gymnasium and the Club House, containing fourteen rooms, approximately fifteen feet square. The rental of the rooms on the Ranges, for the session, is $125 for one occupant or $170 for two. The rooms in the Old Gymnasium and the Club House rent for $80 for one occupant or $110 for two. Dawson's Row consists of a series of four eight-room two-story brick houses and a six-room one-story brick house, located on the southwest side of the grounds. The rooms are approximately fifteen feet square. The rental of fifty-one of the rooms, for the session, is $95 for one occupant or $130 for two. Four of the rooms rent for $60 for one occupant or $80 for two. All of the rooms on the Lawns and Ranges and in Dawson's Row are provided with running cold water. For each of the Lawns and Ranges one bath-house is provided and there is a bath-house in Dawson's Row. Randall Building.âA two-story brick building, located at the south end of East Range, containing thirty-one single rooms ten by fourteen, ten by fifteen and ten by sixteen; eight double rooms fourteen by fifteen, fifteen by fifteen and fifteen by seventeen; one double room with study-room attached. Single rooms rent at $80 to $90; double rooms $125 for one occupant or $150 for two occupants. Double room with study-room attached, for one occupant $135, or $180 for two occupants. The furnishing of the rooms on the Lawns and Ranges, in Dawson's Row and Randall Building is as follows: For one occupantâan enamelled iron bed with comfortable springs and mattress, a chiffonier, a table, a straight chair and a rocking-chair. For two occupantsâtwo single beds or one double-deck bed with springs and mattresses, one chiffonier, one desk or two tables, one rocking-chair and two straight chairs. BOARD Board.âStudents may board at the University Common, at their homes, or in private boarding houses or restaurants approved by the President. For cost of board at the University Commons, see below. For list of private boarding houses, with rates, apply to the Bursar. University Commons Meals may be had at the University Commons, a handsome building overlooking the McIntire Theatre and within two minutes walk of the dormitories. The interior of the beautiful panelled main room makes a charming atmosphere for dining and the furnishings are attractive. The meals are prepared by an experienced chef under the supervision of a trained dietitian and careful attention is given to quality and service. Board is supplied at cost and it is expected that the rate will in no event exceed $25 per month. Since the capacity of the Commons limits the number accommodated to about 350, it is essential that students make early application for reservations to Dr. E. A. Kincaid, Manager, 15 Monroe Hall. STUDENT ACTIVITIES JEFFERSON SOCIETY Connected with the University is the Jefferson Society founded in 1825 to provide for common improvement in debate, to promote general culture among its members and the student body, and to drill its members in all those exercises which strengthen for the free duties of citizenship. All students in regular attendance upon one or more of the schools of the University of Virginia who are not members of any similar organization in this institution shall be eligible to regular membership. Such candidates shall make written application on forms provided by the Membership Committee. These forms may be obtained at any of the literary meetings of the Society all of which are open to the public. They are announced in College Topics. PUBLICATIONS College Topics is a tri-weekly newspaper published by the students and devoted to the interests of the University at large. Corks and Curls is the University Annual, its aim being to present some record of the scholastic, religious, athletic and social activities of the college year. Its publication is in the hands of a chartered corporation formed by the fraternities and literary societies of the University. The Virginia Law Review is a journal devoted to the discussion of general questions of American jurisprudence published monthly from October to May, inclusive, by the students of the Law Department. The University of Virginia Magazine is a literary journal published seven times a year by students and is sponsored by the Jefferson Society. Engineering News is a monthly publication devoted to general news of the Department of Engineering and edited and managed by the students. STUDENT UNION The Student Union was organized in 1932. The University has taken over Madison Hall for use as a center of student activities under the supervision of the Union of which all students are considered members. The affairs of the Union are conducted by the Student Senate. Facilities are offered for meetings of student organizations and groups and a social program is carried forward throughout the session. In the reading room are newspapers from many of the cities in the South and East. Recreation rooms are also provided. Offices of College Topics, the Magazine, Corks and Curls, the Dulaney Memorial Library and the Student Self Help Bureau are located in the building. ATHLETICS It is the objective of the University to offer every student an opportunity to engage in sports according to individual interest and ability. Many intramural activities are supported enthusiastically by students who find therein stimulating contacts, exercise, and associations that might otherwise be denied them. The University is represented in intercollegiate athletics by both varsity and first-year teams in football, baseball, basketball, track, boxing, tennis, golf and swimming. Its athletic plant is one of the finest in the South. Memorial Gymnasium contains three basketball courts, a swimming pool, a running track, boxing and wrestling rooms, and adequate locker facilities, in addition to equipment necessary to gymnastic training. Scott Stadium, which seats 22,000 spectators, is considered one of the most beautiful in the country. Lambeth Field has excellent facilities for baseball and track. Twenty-two tennis courts and four intramural fields are located near Memorial Gymnasium. All intercollegiate athletics, physical education activities, and intramural sports are under the supervision of the Director of Athletics and Physical Education, who is responsible under the President for the administration of the entire sports program of the University. An Athletic Council (the 3-3-3) composed of three faculty representatives, three representatives of the Alumni Association, and three student representatives, serves in an official advisory capacity in the administration of athletics. At least four meetings of this Council are held each year. STUDENT BRANCHES OF NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES There have been established at the University of Virginia Student Branches of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (1912), the American Society of Civil Engineers (1921), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (1922), and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (1934). These societies hold regular meetings for the discussion of periodical literature and the exposition by resident and visiting engineers of the present-day problems in Engineering. A valuable feature of the meetings is the opportunity presented for practice in public speaking and debate. At stated meetings the Branches hold joint sessions for the discussion of mutually interesting questions. ENGINEERING COUNCIL In 1934 was established the students' Engineering Council with representatives of the Student Branches and a Faculty advisor chosen by the Council. This Council coÃ¶rdinates the activities of the student societies and plans in general to advance the welfare of students in Engineering by every means within the reasonable reach of the Department. TAU BETA PI In May, 1921, a chapter of the National Honorary Engineering Fraternity Tau Beta Pi was granted and the Alpha of Virginia Chapter of Tau Beta Pi will henceforth serve to further inspire high scholarship and integrity. This fraternity is recognized as the leading honorary engineering fraternity of this country and its chapters are found in a limited number of engineering schools of the highest standing. The members are elected with care and the standards maintained are rigid both in respect to scholarship and character. THETA TAU In June, 1923, a chapter of the National Engineering Fraternity of Theta Tau was granted at the University of Virginia. This fraternity has chapters in a score or more of the leading engineering schools of the country and membership is eagerly sought and greatly appreciated by the members of the student body. Elections are made each year based on scholarship and general record of ability and promise of future service to the profession of engineering. TRIGON SOCIETY The Trigon Engineering Society was founded at the University of Virginia early in the spring of 1923. It is a local organization which has for its object the broadening of the education of the engineering student by fraternal and social contact and by encouraging lectures and study on subjects aside from those dealing primarily with engineering. The society is active in the student affairs of the department and is always ready to help in any undertaking for the betterment of the Engineering School. Members are selected for their personality, sociability, and promise of high engineering attainment. ALPHA CHI SIGMA On May 27, 1922, a charter was granted at the University of Virginia, creating the Alpha Kappa chapter of the National Chemical Fraternity of Alpha Chi Sigma. This fraternity recognizes high scholarship, character, and seriousness of purpose in students specializing in chemistry and chemical engineering. As the leading national fraternity in this field, it has 47 active college chapters, 10 professional chapters, and six professional groups, serving to advance chemistry and chemical engineering both scientifically and professionally. Among the regular activities of the local chapter are the sponsoring of the annual Alpha Chi Sigma lecture, the award of a membership in the American Chemical Society to the outstanding student in chemistry and chemical engineering, and general assistance to the faculty in the conduct of official functions. JONES AND BARKSDALE MEMORIAL FUNDS A gift to the Department of Engineering from Messrs. Arthur P. Jones, William Barham Jones (B.A. 1907) and Major Kenneth S. Jones (B.A., LL.B., C.E. 1915, Major U. S. A., Engineer Corps) in memory of their father, the late Walter H. Jones, of Norfolk, Va., and of his deep interest in the University of Virginia, in the form of an endowment fund has made it possible to provide a considerable number of professional periodicals representing the various engineering activities. A gift to the Department of Engineering from Mrs. Hamilton Barksdale in memory of her husband, an alumnus of the Engineering Department, Specifically donated for the purpose of building up the department library, has made possible much needed changes and additions to the library. EXAMINATIONS AND REPORTS Oral Examinations may be held at the beginning of each lecture hour on the topics of the preceding lecture. Written test papers are set monthly, or at such interval as the professor may appoint. Absences from lecture except by reason of sickness are not excused without a written leave from the Dean. Class standing is determined on the basis of the oral examinations and the written tests. Absence from the latter or failure to answer incurs a 0 grade. Absences from laboratory periods, however caused, must be made up by special private arrangement with the instructor. Written Examinations are held at the end of each term on the entire work of that term. The result of examination combined with the student's class-standing gives his term-grade. The pass-mark is 75 per cent. Absence from the written term examination incurs a 0 term-grade, which may not be removed except by the passage of a special written examination on the work of that term. Such special examinations are granted only upon presentation of a written certificate from a reputable physician that the student by reason of sickness on the day of the regular examination was unable to attend. Regular Reports are sent out at the end of every term to the student's parent or guardian. These state for each course followed the term-grade. Further comment may be added by the Dean or the professor, if it appears probable that such comment would be helpful to the student. Parents are urged to examine these reports carefully and to exert such parental influence as may seem needed to establish and confirm the student in habits of industry and order. Special Reports are sent to parents at the end of each month for students delinquent in attendance or studiousness and for delinquents only. When a student is making steady progress and showing due diligence in his work, only the regular reports are sent. The receipt of a special report is evidence that, in the judgment of the faculty, prompt and pointed parental admonition is urgently needed. If in any class in the Department of Engineering a student fails to make satisfactory progress, he is first admonished by the professor in charge. In default of prompt and permanent improvement, he is next formally warned by the Dean. If due amendment is then not immediately effected, the student's name is dropped from the rolls of the Department, on the ground that he is not accomplishing the purposes for which he should have entered upon a University course of study. DEPARTMENT REGULATIONS The following regulations, adopted to define the policy of the faculty, are published for the information and guidance of the students: 1. Practice-courses as well as lecture-courses must be conducted under the Honor System. The student who submits any work to be graded is considered to submit it under pledge. 2. When the lecture-course and the associated practice-course are given in the same term of the same year, no student will be admitted to examination on the lecture-course until he has completed at least three-fourths of the practice-course. 3. No student will be admitted to any practice-course unless he is at the same time pursuing the associated lecture-course, or has already received credit for the same. 4. No student will be admitted to the graduating examination on a lecture-course unless he has been present at more than half the lectures in that course. 5. No averaging of term grades shall be used in courses taken for credit for a degree in Engineering. Failure to make 75 on any term course will necessitate taking the course again. 6. The pass-mark in every course is 75. Class standing and written examination are combined for the term-grade in such proportions as the several professors may determine. 7. No student who fails to make 75 on term-grade shall be granted another examination on the course until he has again attended lectures on that course. 8. A student who fails a second time on any course will be allowed to attempt the course for a third time only by special permission of the faculty; a third failure in a course will prevent such student from acceptance as a degree candidate here in engineering. 9. Special examinations are not given except by reason of sickness on the day of examination, attested by the written certificate of a reputable physician, or for other like providential causes. In every case they must be validated by special vote of the faculty. 10. Any engineering student who fails to attain a passing grade of 75 on at least 9 term-hours will be placed on probation for the following term, probation to continue until at least 9 term-hours are passed in one term. No engineering student shall remain on probation for more than three terms, whether consecutive or not, in his entire engineering course. If probation is imposed a fourth time the student shall be suspended. 11. Any engineering student who passes less than 6 term-hours and whose average grade on all courses taken is less than 65 will be suspended. Suspension during a session continues for the remainder of the regular session. Suspension imposed at the end of a session holds for the whole of a subsequent session, except that such suspension may be absolved by the successful completion of prescribed work in the Summer Quarter. No engineering student suspended for a second time shall re-enter the department. 12. The Dean's List.âA student, who, in any successive three terms, passes on all courses taken, aggregating not less than 18 session-hours, with an average grade on all courses of not less than 82 per cent, will be placed on the Dean's list. A student, who, in any successive three terms, passes on all courses taken aggregating not less than 18 session-hours, but who does not average 82 per cent, and who, in any subsequent term, passes on all courses taken, aggregating not less than 17 term-hours, with an average grade on all 17 term-hours of not less than 82 per cent will be placed on the Dean's List. A student will be automatically dropped from the Dean's List, if, in any term, he does not pass on all courses taken, aggregating not less than 17 term-hours, with an average grade on all courses of not less than 82 per cent. A student dropped from the Dean's List will be again placed on it if he meets the above mentioned standard for a term. A student on the Dean's List is not subject to the regulations limiting the issuance of leaves of absence from the University, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class standing, imposed for absence alone. Students on the Dean's List must attend all laboratory classes and must perform all written problem work and take all written quizzes under the same conditions as all other students. PHYSICAL PLANT FOR ENGINEERING INSTRUCTION DRAFTING ROOMS At present there are available three drafting rooms, one containing 78 individual tables, for the use of first-year students, and two containing 15 individual tables each, for upper classmen. The tables are of special design, with individual drawers for each student, and can adequately hold all of the student's equipment. All tables are provided with padlock hasps, and students are required to furnish their own padlocks, which must be of a type approved by the Department. The tables for upper classmen are provided with parallel rules, for which the student must supply a cord at a nominal fee. Careful attention is given to the training of students in freehand lettering, in the use of standard instruments and special equipment, in engineering drawing expression and convention, and in the use of such media as pencil and ink on drawing paper, and tracing paper and cloth. A photostat machine, and a vertical blue-printing machine comprise a portion of the auxiliary equipment of the Department, and some time is devoted to reproduction of drawings. Technical ability and dexterity is required to the extent of preparing men for positions in industry, but the graphical method is taught and used primarily as an indispensable instrument of communication and research, the mastery of which is essential for the instructed Engineer.

The laboratory is equipped with facilities for building and testing aerodynamic models of all types. Two wind tunnels are available for student use. One of these is a portable model with 10 inch by 12 inch throat, having moderate throat velocity. This is more of a demonstration than a laboratory type tunnel. The large wind tunnel, used for routine and research aerodynamic testing is capable of testing a model of 36 inch wing span at 150 miles per hour. This tunnel is of the rectangular type having a 30 inch by 50 inch test section which may be used with either an open or closed throat. The design is of the high-efficiency return circuit type and the propeller is powered by a direct drive streamlined electric motor developing over 40 horsepower and having external control equipment capable of varying the speed over a wide range. Precision type wood working machinery, bench mounted, and consisting of equipment such as the jointer, sander, jig saw, etc., is installed for the purpose of model making of all descriptions. This equipment is mobile and is available to all divisions of the Engineering Department for wood repair or modeling work. Several aircraft engines including the Whirlwind, Wasp, and Gypsy in the air-cooled field and representative water-cooled engines are available for engine work in the Aeronautics Laboratory. A Consolidated Trainer and a Curtiss Dive Bomber have been loaned to the Department of Engineering and are employed for instruction in airplane structures and rigging. There is considerable detached equipment such as instruments, carburetors, magnetos, supercharger, etc., available for study.

They are also required to make up their field-books in standard forms; to reduce their surveys and execute all the necessary profiles, plans and maps; and to determine lengths, areas, and volumes both from the maps and from the original notes. Polar planimeters are provided for facilitating such estimates, and a pantograph for making reduced copies of finished drawings. MODEL TESTING APPARATUS The Department has apparatus for the determination of stresses in structural and machine parts by the use of models. The Beggs' Deformeter is a specialized set of equipment for the determination of moments and shears in elastic structures by utilizing Maxwell's principle of reciprocal deflections. The work is done on small scale models accurately cut from celluloid or other suitable material. This year the Department is securing modern Photoelastic equipment for the analysis of stresses in elastic members. The equipment consists of an elaborate optical set in which a model of bakelite is inserted. The method is based on certain optical effects imposed on a ray of light by the stressed model. CHEMICAL ENGINEERING LABORATORY A new unit process laboratory for Chemical Engineering is being planned and portions of it will be installed for service during the coming year. This laboratory will occupy space in one end of the second floor of Building C. It will be provided with essential services of air, water and gas as well as electrical outlets and a floor drainage system. Additional facilities exist at the University Power House, where semi-plant scale absorption equipment has been installed for the experimental treatment of flue gas. ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING LABORATORY The Scott Laboratory of Electrical Engineering.âThis laboratory was initially equipped and endowed by Mrs. Frances Branch Scott, of Richmond, Va., as a memorial to her late son, an alumnus of this University. During the year 1910 the equipment was substantially increased through the generosity of the Hon. Charles R. Crane, of Chicago, Ill., a friend of the University. In recent years a large number of new machines, measuring instruments and pieces of auxiliary apparatus have been purchased. Improvements are constantly being made and items of equipment added. As a result the laboratory is now well supplied with the best modern equipment. Power is supplied to the laboratory direct from the 4,000-volt distribution system of the local power company through a modern substation located in the building. This substation forms a part of the main electrical laboratory and all equipment is available for inspection and study. In one end of the laboratory is located the main light and power switchboard for the entire building, consisting of seventeen steel panels containing a complete array of instruments, relays and low tension circuit breakers together with the control switches for the eight electrically operated high voltage circuit breakers which are located in the adjacent fireproof vault. The vault also contains six single-phase induction regulators, a 300-Kv.-a. bank of transformers for the power supply, a 225-Kv.-a. bank of transformers for lighting and a 75-Kv-a. autotransformer. Adjacent to the vault is the battery room containing a 120-volt and a 24-volt storage battery, the former furnishing control current for the substation. Near the main switchboard are located two motor generator sets for supplying direct current to the laboratory. These sets consist of synchronous motors driving three-wire direct current generators of 100 and 50 kilowatts capacity respectively. There is also an alternator of 50-Kv-a. capacity which is provided with a Tirrill regulator. Automatic control for the synchronous motors is provided on the switchboard. From the main switchboard power is conducted through the permanent wiring system to four distribution panels in the electrical machinery laboratory and four panels in the adjacent communications, photometry, and measurements laboratories. These panels make available six different sources of power at convenient locations. The panels and all of the experimental equipment are fitted with universal plug receptacles to facilitate the making of necessary connections. For the machine testing there are available several direct-current motor generator sets with automatic control; numerous series, shunt and compound motors and generators; synchronous and induction motor driven generator sets; high voltage direct-current generator; steam turbine driven three-phase alternator with exciter and control switchboard; two experimental test sets for alternating current single or polyphase generator operation; single-phase induction motor; single-phase repulsion-induction motor; two-phase induction motor; three-phase squirrel cage induction motors of the general purpose, high reactance and double cage types; wound rotor induction motors; induction generator; wound rotor induction motor set for concatenation; FynnWeichsel synchronous induction motor; frequency changer set; synchronous motors; rotary converter; arc welding generator set; constant potential transformers; constant current transformer; polyphase transformer; induction regulator; mercury arc and thermionic rectifiers; a number of different types of A. C. and D. C. fractional horsepower motors; prony brakes for all motors; adjustable resistances, inductances and capacitances. The instrument room is unusually well equipped with all of the types of high grade portable instruments required for the laboratory tests, including frequency and power factor meters, watthour meters, synchroscopes, tachometers, instrument transformers, recording voltmeters, ammeters and wattmeters. For testing and calibrating the portable instruments and for more precise work in electrical measurements there are available a set of laboratory standard instruments with standard shunts and resistances; standard cells; standard condensers, inductances and resistances; galvanometers of the best modern type and numerous other pieces of apparatus of the highest precision such as the Wolff potentiometer, Siemens and Halske-Thomson double bridge, Carey-Foster bridge, Koepsel permeameter, Fahy simplex permeameter and others. For experiments in illumination and photometry there are a Station photometer with Lummer-Brodhun screen, a Macbeth illuminometer, General Electric and Weston portable foot-candle meters. The lighting system for the building has been designed so that it will serve as a complete up-to-date laboratory of commercial and industrial lighting, illustrating the best lighting equipment available at the present time. Equipment for the study of communication and power transmission includes a complete artificial transmission line; an adjustable frequency test oscillator; impedance bridge; vacuum tube voltmeter-ammeter; representative pieces of modern telephone equipment including two central office ringer sets; equipment for the study of vacuum tube performance; model network distribution system; relays of different types; radio transmitting and receiving sets; microphones, amplifiers and other sound equipment; phototubes and amplifier tubes of various types; all with the necessary auxiliary apparatus. In addition the automatic dial telephone system installed in the building is available for examination and study. The laboratory is equipped with three oscillographs which are available for the study of wave forms and transient phenomena. Two of the oscillographs are of the latest portable typeâone a six element and the other a one element. All are complete with the necessary accessories for both visual observation and photographic recording. BUILDINGS The buildings at present wholly or partially devoted to the work of the Department of Engineering are the following: Thornton Hall.âThe new center for instruction in engineering at the University of Virginia, open for use at the beginning of the 1935-1936 session, is named Thornton Hall, in honor of the first Dean of Engineering at Virginia, William Mynn Thornton, whose active service spanned 55 years, from 1875 to 1930. The building plans were perfected by the Architectural Commission of the University upon a skeleton plan for service needs prepared by the teaching staff of the Department of Engineering. The Commission was particularly fortunate in its finished plan in securing two important essentials: harmony with the well-known Jeffersonian architecture of the rest of the University; and at the same time fitness for service as a working home for the activities in class and laboratory of a department concerned with engineering instruction of a professional character. The Setting of the Building The site selected, at the southern end of the main campus, on McCormick Road, affords a pleasing outlook on all sides and secures an unencumbered abundance of light and air for the working areas. The building is designed to accommodate comfortably a student body of 300, normally distributed in the several years of the course, and it is expected that the matriculation in engineering will be restricted to that approximate number, in the belief that it affords an ideal group for the University to train in its engineering school. The building is in a sense three interconnected structures arranged in U-fashion, with a central grass court 150 feet square, closed at the top of the U by an arcaded walk which furnishes ready access between the two wings. The main unit of the group consists of basement and two upper floors; the western wing is of one-story, and the eastern wing of two-story, construction, each unit being approximately 300 feet long. The entire building is erected upon reinforced concrete foundations with the walls of over-size brick of a color to match other campus structures, and is of a simple, dignified design most pleasing from every aspect. Cast stone bands, with the same material as a part of door and window trim, serve to relieve the severity of extensive uninterrupted areas of brick. The arcade motif is used throughout the construction rather than the colonnade, which is a feature of many of the earlier buildings on the campus. Reinforced concrete floors are the rule; partitions of brick, tile or gypsum block predominate, and the slate roof is supported on structural steel trusses. Floors vary from those of concrete in most of the laboratories, through terrazzo in corridors, to mastic-covered concrete in offices, classrooms and library. The classrooms and offices have plastered walls and sound-absorbing ceiling surfaces, while the walls of most of the laboratories and drawing rooms are of painted brick. Basement corridors and lavatories are finished in general with glazed tile walls to a height of about 6 feet. Throughout the building generous window allotment has been secured to insure ample natural light and ventilation. Heating and Illumination The entire building is heated from the central heating plant of the University, which provides a circulating hot-water system, with radiators wall-supported to aid in maintaining cleanliness. The building's water supply is obtained from the main service of the University. All laboratories are piped for the necessary water supply, electric water heaters provide essential service to lavatories, and electric coolers in strategic locations make available a ready supply of cool drinking water. All laboratories which have use for gas are piped for that service from the city mains. The problem of adequate artificial illumination for all purposes was given careful attention, and as a result the planned illumination will be in accord with the best modern practice. An ample arrangement of panel boards with heavy mains together with a finely divided individual control of circuits provides a flexible and entirely adequate system suited to the several uses made necessary in such an all-inclusive structure. Semi-indirect and totally indirect lighting is utilized in most locations, with such a variety of lighting units as will serve both to provide essential illumination and at the same time be an exemplification of several means of obtaining approved illumination of required intensity but free from glare. Incandescent units ranging in size from 100 to 1,500 watts are in the main utilized. A single installation of modern mercury-arc units is applied, however, in the repair shop. In connection with the electrical system, care has been taken to supply, wherever requisite, an ample number of convenience outlets, so that electric fans, projection apparatus, etc., may readily be connected when needed. Interior communication will be afforded between various parts of the building by an intercommunicating telephone system of some 40 stations. A number of electric clocks are installed, and class periods will be announced on an electric program service reaching every portion of the building. Interior Arrangement of Central UnitâBuilding A The central unit of the group is entered from the main walk through an arcaded entrance leading to the lobby in which the main bulletin boards are placed. From this open lobby the main corridor extends in both directions, giving access at each end by stairways to the upper floor level and also by stairways downward to the basement and connecting passageways to the other two units of the building. Arranged along the main corridor are eleven offices for ten professors and the secretary to the Dean, which overlook the central grass court, and in each of which modern steel office equipment is installed. From the main corridor, across from the offices, are three classrooms and a Faculty conference room. Side corridors lead to six other classrooms, to which access is also possible through two side doors from the front plaza. The Faculty conference room is equipped with a conference table and the necessary chairs. Four of the classrooms will seat 30 students each, three seat 27 each, and one larger room is arranged to seat 56. These eight rooms are equipped with individual swivel chairs arranged with table tops on pedestals in front of each row of chairs. The remaining large classroom is equipped with 77 tablet-arm chairs arranged radially. All classrooms are furnished with ample blackboards covering all available wall space, besides bulletin board and special lecture desk. This floor is completed by two small lavatories, one at each end of the office suite, reserved for use of the Faculty and for ladies respectively. The upper floor of this unit is devoted to the library and drawing rooms for the Department. The library is directly above the offices and will constitute a combined library and reading room. This handsome room is pleasingly furnished in oak panels and trim, and is equipped with oak reading tables and substantial chairs. Steel stacks house the present engineering library of some 6,000 volumes, and adequate space is available for growth of the collection. A librarian's office adjoins the library proper, and an additional office for drawing instructors completes one end of the floor. At the opposite end of the reading room are an office and a small room which contains the blueprinting equipment for the Department, with a dark-room attached. The remainder of this floor is assigned to drafting rooms, space being available for something over 150 individual drawing tables and the accessory files. For the present, 108 drawing tables are in place, 78 in one main group for first-year students principally, with two smaller groups of 15 each in partitioned rooms for more advanced classes. The drawing tables are specially built and provide adjustable tilt tops 3 by 4 feet in area; each table is equipped with two drawers, each drawer being supplied with individual combination, master-keyed padlocks. Steel stools, with wooden seats, are supplied for each table. The planned artificial illumination for the drawing room is 30 foot-candles on the working surface. For the present the unoccupied space, later to be equipped with additional drawing tables, will be used as a temporary auditorium, using folding steel chairs, where the entire student group may assemble for lectures and general meetings. The Basement of the Central Unit The basement floor of this unit is occupied in the front by one large and four smaller storage rooms, the photostat and mimeograph room, and the main locker-room and lavatory. More than 200 individual steel lockers, supplied with combination, master-keyed padlocks, are installed here. The sanitary arrangements of the lavatories are of the best modern type. The inner section of this basement will be used by three experimental laboratories. The largest is that for hydraulic testing. This laboratory has adequate headroom and is provided with a built-in trench extending its entire length. Here are assembled the various pumping units, high- and low-pressure, electrically driven and controlled; apparatus for flow experiments; weirs, tanks, scales, meters, etc., with the essential auxiliary apparatus necessary for successful hydraulic testing of motors, pumps and systems. A second laboratory on this floor is that for testing fuels and oils. This is supplied with gas, water and electricity and in its equipment are calorimeters for solid, liquid and gaseous fuels; electric-muffle furnace, electric drying oven, sample grinder and crusher, pyknometers, balances, crucibles, etc. Here also are found flash and chill testers, hydrometers, viscosimeters, etc., used in determining the properties of oils. The third of these laboratories is for concrete testing. It is completely equipped for making tests of cement, cement aggregates, and concrete. It has tensile testers, compressometers of several types, tools for shearing test, steaming oven for accelerated tests, drying ovens with automatic temperature regulation, moist-air closets, sieves, moulds, and the necessary small apparatus required in these tests. The One-Story WingâBuilding B This wing is devoted mainly to three additional laboratories of experimental engineering. One of these is to be used for road materials testing It is equipped with abrasive machine, ball mill, molding press for briquetting impact cementation tester, toughness tester, rock crusher and brick rattler, compression tester, diamond core drill, diamond rock saw, grinding lap, Westphal balance, specific gravity apparatus and sets of sieves. For bituminous road materials there are a penetrometer, ductility machine, viscosimeters extractor, oil tester, pyknometers, flow plates, gas and electric hot plates, and accessory apparatus for testing bituminous road binders. The second laboratory in this wing is the power laboratory. Here are found the units for steam and gas power testing; steam boiler, steam engines, turbines, gas engines, condensers, air compressor, and auxiliary equipment such as indicators, thermometers, gages, planimeters, standards for their calibration and correction, Orsat apparatus, calorimeters, etc. In addition to the above, the complete boiler equipment of the University boiler plant is available for student tests. Also in this group is the structural materials laboratory. Here are placed standard machines for tensile, compressive and transverse tests of both metals and wood; torsion machine, impact testing machine, fatigue test machine, scleroscope, wire testing machines; extensometers, compressometers and tools for shearing tests of metals and timber. On a mezzanine are an office and an apparatus room. An office for the instructing staff in surveying is located in this wing, and directly connecting with it is the instrument room for surveying classes. This equipment includes compasses, transits and levels of various makes, hand levels and clinometers, plane tables, sextant, leveling rods, telemeter rods, signal poles, chains, tapes, pins and so on. For hydraulic surveys there are hook gage and current meter. The facilities of this wing also include a locker room and lavatory easily accessible. The Two-Story WingâBuilding C The ground floor of the two-story wing is devoted entirely to the electrical engineering laboratories. The main room will be used for dynamomachine testing and has the building power plant at one end. The electrical supply is at present secured from the Public Service Company, and the needs of laboratories and building are taken through transformers and motor-generator sets. The dynamo laboratory is well supplied with test units of moderate size, of various makes, and of the general types usual in service, both direct and alternating current. All tests units are direct-driven, and all connections are made by universal plug and receptacle connections with flexible cords. Individual control panels are placed at convenient points throughout the laboratory, and their supply is by conduit embedded in the floor structure. Brakes are furnished for each motor unit, and a complete supply of instruments is at hand for all tests. Transformers of various types, induction regulators, control resistances, inductances and capacitances are included in this equipment. Mercury arc rectifiers, arc welding sets and numerous other units supply additional test service. Oscillographs, single and multiple, make possible a wide variety of tests of transient phenomena. An office for the laboratory instructor, and a large instrument room, adjoin the machine laboratory. As a part of the electrical supply system, there is the transformer room, which houses also the main circuit breakers and voltage regulators. A storage battery room is closely adjacent, and a dark-room for photographic developing is included. Moreover, there are three additional laboratories in the electrical division. One of these is the standardizing laboratory, which is supplied with the usual electrical standards necessary for testing and calibrating portable test instruments. Here are included also several instruments of high-precision type, such as potentiometers, double bridges, galvanometers, permeameters, etc. A second small laboratory is for illumination tests of various kinds. This is equipped with photometers, illuminometers and several types of foot-candle meters. A third unit in this suite will be used for communication and power transmission testing, with electronic testing being developed. Its equipment includes an artificial transmission line, test oscillator, bridge, vacuum tube ammeter-voltmeter, various electronic units and auxiliary apparatus needed in this particular field of electrical testing. This floor is completed by a medium-sized locker room and lavatory adjacent to the main electrical laboratory, and a janitors' room. The upper story of this wing is for chemical and mechanical engineering. A large laboratory is being developed for aeronautical testing. Here are found aeroplanes, aeroplane engines and auxiliary apparatus, and a wind tunnel of moderate proportions. An office and a storeroom adjoin this laboratory, and a locker and lavatory are placed for use on this level. A repair shop will provide facilities for repairing apparatus and for building experimental equipment. This shop communicates with the lower level by freight elevator, which will be installed later, the complete shaft only having been built. A separate tool-room adjoins the repair shop. A wood shop is equipped with the usual motor-driven wood-working machinery. A second shop provides a variety of machine tools. Instead of actual shop practice, however, it will be the policy here to use this machinery to familiarize the student with principles of machine design as well as to introduce him to both possibilities and limitations of such equipment in production. One unit in this division will allow the student to become acquainted with various phases of metallography. The equipment here includes an electric heat-treating furnace, polishers, microscopes, hardness tester, and varied samples of metal and alloys. The remainder of this section will be devoted to a unit-process laboratory for the work in Chemical Engineering. This laboratory is now being planned and will be partially installed during the coming year. Representative units required for an approved laboratory course in this subject will be rapidly put into operation. It may be noted that the major technical instruction in chemical, civil, electrical and mechanical engineering is cared for in this new building group. In addition to the technical instruction, all mathematics and English for the engineering students will be given in Thornton Hall. Physics, chemistry, modern language and certain other humanities will continue to be given in the College of Arts and Sciences. With the facilities made available in Thornton Hall, many restrictions of space under which instruction has been carried on hitherto will be removed. The rigid disciplines of the theoretical courses which have ever been a part of the instruction here will hereafter be supplemented by the advantages of adequate space and equipment for both students and faculty. The Power House is a single story building 130 by 60 feet, in which is housed the University heating plant. The equipment includes two 310 horsepower Heine water tube boilers, equipped with single retort stokers of the underfeed type, supplied by the Combustion Engineering Corporation, two Babcock and Wilcox boilers (Stirling type) fitted with underfeed twin-retort Detroit stokers, two steam and two electrically driven circulating pumps, low pressure heaters, etc. Provision has been made for the future installation of two steam turbine generator sets for the supply of electric current to the University buildings. The entire plant is available for instructional purposes. Plants available for inspection both locally and elsewhere throughout the State include the Bremo Bluff and other generating stations of the Virginia Public Service Company, numerous chemical plants, the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory, Hampton, the Newport News Shipyard, the Norfolk Navy Yard, the Rothwell Cold Storage and Ice Company's plants in Charlottesville and Waynesboro, the Norfolk and Western Railway shops and the works of the Virginia Bridge and Iron Company at Roanoke, the Charlottesville Woolen Mills, etc. Visits of several days' duration are organized to distant points and are made to coincide, if possible, with some event of more than usual interest, such as the launching of a cruiser at the Newport News Shipyard, the visit of an airplane carrier to Hampton Roads or the sea trials of a passenger liner. The Geological Museum is 120 by 50 feet. It is a three-story building. The main floor is devoted to the very extensive geological collection of specimens, charts, relief maps, and so on. The gallery above contains an equally good collection of minerals and numerous models of typical crystallographic forms. The upper floor contains the lecture-rooms and the laboratories of Economic Geology. In the basement are stored subsidiary collections and new material accumulated in more recent geological surveys. The Rouss Physical Laboratory faces the old Mechanical Laboratory on the opposite side of the Lawn, and has almost the same proportions, namely 180 by 70 feet. The main floor contains the lecture-room, the professors offices, and a laboratory for experimental research, and the storeroom for the very large collection of apparatus used in the lectures. On the ground floor is the storage battery room, a well-equipped shop for the repair and manufacture of apparatus, and smaller rooms for the work of graduate students. The laboratory for experimental physics is in the basement of the old Mechanical Laboratory. The Cobb Chemical Laboratory was opened for use in September, 1917. In this fire-proof structure all the work in Chemistry is assembled. The floor area provided is about 45,000 square feet. The lecture-rooms seat classes of 300, 75 and 25 students. The laboratories assigned to General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Qualitative Analysis, Quantitative Analysis and Physical Chemistry contain 110, 60, 40, 30, and 20 desks. Altogether by dividing classes into sections, 600 students may be accommodated. Smaller private laboratories are provided for research workers. Large stock rooms communicating by elevators with the several floors contain ample stores of chemical supplies. The 5,000 volumes of books and bound sets of journals constituting the Departmental Library of Chemistry are so housed as to be accessible to both teachers and students.

Textbooks: Badger and Baker: Inorganic Chemical Technology; Lewis and Radasch: Industrial Stoichiometry; Riegel: Industrial Chemistry. Associate Professor Hitchcock. 374-375-376: Chemical Engineering Laboratory: The student demonstrates to himself essential features of the unit operations of chemical engineering, by constructing and testing with his own hands suitable apparatus for the illustration of principles in the parallel classroom work. Under minimum supervision, he plans, builds, and tests such equipment as orifices and other measuring apparatus, fluid flow devices verifying Fanning's equation, apparatus for determination of heat transfer coefficients in the more common cases, model vacuum pan sufficient to demonstrate the ordinary relationships of evaporation, and packed columns for the absorption of gases in liquids. The primary object of this course is to teach the student how to obtain the data necessary for the interpretation of the unit operations in chemical engineering. It is inevitable that at the same time, he gains a clearer understanding of these operations, as well as facility in shopwork and the use of his hands, the preparation of working drawings, and the reduction of his results to writing in the form of an acceptable report. Whether the apparatus is particularly efficient, or even practicable from a production standpoint, is not regarded as important at this stage. The students work in small groups in order to make better use of the time, and the results obtained by each group are made available to all through dependent problem work in the classroom. 6 hours a week. (Fall, Winter, Spring.) Associate Professor Hitchcock. 383-384-385: Undergraduate Chemical Engineering Research: Opportunity is afforded undergraduate students to obtain an introduction to research methods in problems pertaining to chemical engineering. As a rule the course is open to those who are taking the major portion of their work in senior subjects, and who have had or are taking Chemical Engineering 324-325-326. A minimum of nine hours per week for one term is required in the laboratory, and it is expected that normally the student will continue the work through the entire session. (An elective course for those having the time to apply to it.) Associate Professor Hitchcock. 386-387-388: Chemical Engineering Research: This course is designed for candidates for the Ch. E. degree and affords an introduction to research methods. Fundamental problems are selected, whenever possible, from the field of greatest interest to the student. The method of attack is in general to reduce the selected problem to laboratory scale leading to the collection of basic data susceptible of definite interpretation, rather than to attempt investigations on commercial equipment which usually yield empirical results. The use of the chemical literature as an aid in conducting investigations prefaces and accompanies the laboratory work, as well as practice in the mathematical and graphical treatment of the data obtained. The preparation and submission of a satisfactory thesis marks the completion of this course, and is a partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Ch. E. degree. Two copies of the thesis, typewritten on paper of prescribed quality and size, and substantially bound, must be deposited in the office of the Dean of the Department of Engineering not later than May 15 of the year in which it is expected that the degree will be conferred. The back of the cover must bear the title of the thesis and the writer's name, and the title page must bear the words: A thesis presented to the Engineering Faculty of the University of Virginia in candidacy for the degree of Chemical Engineer. (Fall, Winter, Spring.) Associate Professor Hitchcock. Advanced Courses: A number of advanced courses in Chemistry, not listed above, are described in the catalogue of the College. When time permits, students in Chemical Engineering, who are properly prepared, may take such of these courses as are approved by the Faculty of Engineering. The Chemical Journal Club will meet once a week (hour to be arranged) for the critical review and discussion of various topics of interest in current chemical literature and of such chemical researches as are in progress in the University. All members of the teaching staff and advanced students in chemistry are expected to participate in these meetings and to take part in the discussions.
