      <field name="fulltext">Tenth Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library, for the Year 1939-40 THE CLOSE of a decade of activity in the field of manuscripts and related historical materials by the University of Virginia offers the temptation to review briefly the developments in Virginia during the period and to relate them to the progress of this movement in the South and the nation at large. It seems especially fitting to do so because the 1930's have been a time of unprecedented advance in manuscript and archival work. If this progress has been particularly noteworthy in the southern states, it may be argued that this appears to be the case only because so little had been accomplished hitherto in this region. Undoubtedly the renaissance in southern literature, historiography, and higher education since the World War has created an increasing demand for the basic source materials essential to scholarship. Southern research repositories have profited by the experience of historical agencies of renown in New England, the Middle Atlantic states, and the Middle West. Even the "depredation" of private manuscript collections in the South by northern agents and collectors in the past has resulted in a net gain to research: the manuscripts that were carried off were, in most instances, more safely preserved in northern libraries than in southern attics; resentment over the loss of these records eventually moved southerners to take positive steps towards preservation of the abundant materials that remained; and in so doing, they found much that had been not only undiscovered or overlooked, but even rejected because of the narrow viewpoint of an earlier generation. In an era of perplexing economic and social problems, like the 'thirties, men are inclined to probe the past for the causes of their ills and to demand the original records to fortify their conclusions. This demand, whether by dispassionate scholars or propagandists, was more easily met because of the momentum gained during the preceding decade in the widespread movement for scientific research in the social sciences and humanities and for the preservation of original materials pertinent thereto. Directors and curators of repositories have learned better how to co-operate for the common end of scholarship. The microfilm and other new techniques have provided a broader realm of usefulness for the records and have made libraries more dependent upon and therefore more considerate of one another. A large degree of antiquarianism has been sloughed off. Recent and even current records have come increasingly within our perspective. Repositories of recent origin are least likely to be trammeled by tradition and outworn methods, but one of the most venerable, the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, has redefined its principles and standards in clear and concise terms and has announced its declaration of faith in the knowledge of history as "an essential way of approach to the problems of man in his relation to society," thus justifying the preservation of the raw materials of history and the dissemination of historical knowledge.1 1. "A Statement of Policy by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania," The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, LXIV, no. 2 (April, 1940), pages 153-63. In this nation-wide movement Virginia institutions of learning have endeavored to find their stride and to keep pace. During the nineteenth century and the first quarter of the twentieth century only the Virginia Historical Society and the Virginia State Library were active in the preservation of research materials and the publication of selected documents. The State Library rendered unique service to scholarship in editing and publishing the official executive and legislative records of colonial Virginia and in compiling numerous calendars and bibliographies. Meanwhile it made accessible an ever increasing proportion of the state archives and photostatic copies of numerous county archives antedating 1800. Although in latter years congestion due to lack of space has seriously jeopardized the advancement of this program, the State Library can look forward confidently to a new period of progress when it occupies its new building in the autumn of 1940. Such has been the pleasant experience of the University of Virginia's Alderman Library which was opened in May, 1938. Here no concrete plan for the collection and preservation of historical sources was put into operation until 1930, but it was not the first attempt. In the spring of 1861, a committee of the faculty drafted a letter proposing that the University preserve for future research all documents and other contemporary materials on the war which had just begun. Copies of the letter were sent to various departmental heads and other high officials of the national and state governments, North and South. Ironically, the only reply came from the secretary of war of the United States and no records were ever received.2 2. Southern Historical Society, Papers, XVI (Richmond, 1888), pages 56-58. The emphasis upon contemporary materials in this abortive project, however, has a modern touch. It represents one angle of the University Library's present research program which has imposed no restriction as to period within its special interest in Virginia and southern history. The new library building, with its spacious quarters and modern facilities, has prompted an ever increasing number of persons to entrust their family papers to the University for safe-keeping. It was also a factor in the acquisition of the Tracy W. McGregor Library of rare Americana.3 3. Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library, for the Year 1937-38 (University, Va., 1938), pages 14-15, and post, page 25. "To him that hath shall be given" may seem appropriate to the situation, but it is only a half-truth. The basic importance of personal contacts in the field can hardly be overemphasized. Any historical agency which depends solely upon correspondence and chance offers of manuscripts and imprints has neglected its greatest opportunity by failing to hunt for the buried treasure. Historical research has been encouraged and expanded in other Virginia institutions in similar fashion. No effort was spared in the quest for original materials essential to the accurate restoration of colonial Williamsburg. The physical aspects of this monumental undertaking are virtually completed, but it is significant that the Research Division is no less indispensable to-day in the collection of original materials and compilation of data for further study of colonal Virginia. Near by is the library of the College of William and Mary with its steadily growing manuscript division, developed by Dr. E. G. Swem, whose Virginia Historical Index is the sine qua non of scholars of the Old Dominion. It is obvious that the mutual advantages of research between the College and the Restoration are numerous. A third agency in this area of Tidewater Virginia is the National Park Service, carrying on both historical and archeological research at Yorktown and Jamestown. In Richmond are the headquarters of three leading religious denominations active in preserving their original records: the Episcopal Diocese of Virginia, the Presbyterian Union Theological Seminary, and, most noteworthy, the Virginia Baptist Historical Society at the University of Richmond. A few other libraries in the state attempt spasmodically to gather historical materials, for the most part bearing on the immediate locality.4 4. Cf. L. J. Cappon, "Two Decades of Historical Activity in Virginia," The Journal of Southern History, VI, no. 2 (May, 1940), pages 189-200. Ample evidence of this active interest in historical research and collecting can be found in almost every southern state, usually operating through state supported institutions. Best known, perhaps, because of their policy of gathering materials throughout the South, are the large repositories of the University of North Carolina (a pioneer in the field) and Duke University.5 5. A Guide to the Manuscript Collections in the Duke University Library, Durham, N. C., Prepared by the Historical Records Survey, Works Progress Administration (Raleigh, N.C., 1939). A similar publication for the University of North Carolina will soon be issued and another for the North Carolina State Historical Commission at Raleigh is nearing completion. The University of Texas is interested chiefly in materials of the Lower South and the Southwest;6 6. Concerning the progress of an important project of the University of Texas see B. F. Lathrop, "Microfilming Materials for Southern History," Journal of Documentary Reproduction, II, no. 2 (June, 1939), pages 91-98. Louisiana State University, a more recent entrant, is concerned especially with the lower Mississippi Valley. Other agencies have confined their activity quite strictly within state boundares, as Virginia has done. State universities have launched new projects or revamped old ones in Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama, West Virginia, and South Carolina. Archival programs have been expanded in Maryland, West Virginia, Mississippi, and Alabama; new state archives buildings have been erected in Maryland, North Carolina, Mississippi, and Alabama. The close relationship between archival materials and collections of private, unofficial papers is clearly shown in the dual nature of the contents of these southern repositories, almost without exception. Even in Virginia and North Carolina, where the state archival agency assumes responsibility for the one type of records and the state university for the other, complete exclusion of either type is impossible. The Mississippi Department of Archives and History is purposely acquiring all kinds of historical materials.7 7. Biennial Report of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, July 1, 1937-June 30, 1939, by William D. McCain (Jackson, Miss., 1939), pages 12-21, 26-28. Other examples could be cited as proof that all such custodians, whether archivists in the strict sense of the term or not, have many problems in common, even though the emphasis may vary from one to another. The resources of southern libraries toward the close of the 1930's were set forth in a study sponsored by the American Library Association.8 8. R. B. Downs, ed., The Resources of Southern Libraries; A Survey of Facilities for Research (Chicago, 1938). That this national organization chose the South as the first region for such a survey may be indicative of a growing interest, from without and from within, in its intellectual as well as its economic status. If the report provided its readers with an agreeable surprise, it will serve most effectively as a challenge to build wisely on these foundations. Fortunately the South is no longer so exclusively sectional in its attitude as it was a generation ago. The goodly proportion of southern members in the Society of American Archivists is an encouraging sign. And if the South has more to contribute than formerly to research on a national scale, this is derived from advancement made under stimulating conditions at home. Three events of national importance during the 1930's warrant special comment. In December, 1936, at the annual meeting of the American Historical Association in Providence, Rhode Island, was organized the Society of American Archivists.9 9. The Society of American Archivists, Proceedings . . . 1936 . . . 1937 (Urbana, Illinois [1937?]). It took over the work of the Historical Association's Public Archives Commission which had pioneered in this field and prepared the way for the new national organization. The Society quickly won recognition from historians and other scholars; its annual meetings, its joint sessions with historians and librarians, and its journal, The American Archivist, are ample testimony of its accomplishments. The Public Archives Commission had long advocated the establishment of a governmental agency to centralize and administer the archives of the United States. This dream was realized in 1935-36 when the newly formed National Archives moved into its spacious building in Washington, D. C.10 10. First Annual Report of the Archivist of the United States . . . [1934-35] (Washington, 1936), pages 1-5; Second Annual Report of the Archivist of the United States . . . [1935-36] (Washington, 1936), pages 1-2. This fact in itself served as a substantial incentive to the formation of the Society of American Archivists. The National Archives very soon became the nerve center of archival developments throughout the country. The third event occurred in the same year, 1936—the launching of the Historical Records Survey by the Works Progress Administration under the able directorship of Dr. Luther H. Evans. Any doubts as to the practicability and potential contribution to scholarship of this nation-wide project have been dispelled by the swelling tide of inventories of county and city archives, of church and labor records, guides to manuscript repositories, and calendars of certain collections. Most of these publications are of high calibre. The time they will save for investigators cannot be overestimated. Many fields of research have been expanded as the HRS has brought to light unused and unknown materials, and the project has taught archivists that unskilled as well as skilled labor under adequate direction can be used effectively in archival establishments. The training of archivists is still as vital a question as it was two years ago when discussed in this series of reports.11 11. Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1937-38, pages 1-4. The superiority of graduate work in the social sciences and the humanities over library school courses in craftsmanship as preparation for top-ranking positions in this field was emphasized. The committee of the Society of American Archivists concerned with this problem likewise stressed, in its report of October, 1938, the fundamental importance of graduate training in scholarship, including historical method, history of archives, bibliography, and other necessary auxiliary sciences.12 12. S. F. Bemis, "The Training of Archivists in the United States," The American Archivist, II, no. 3 (July, 1939), pages 154-61. Among the few experimental courses offered thus far by universities, the one given at the National Archives in conjunction with American University shows most promise for two reasons: it requires scholarship on the Ph.D. level and the National Archives provides internships for practical experience in archival technique.13 13. The American University. A Programme for the Training of Archivists in Washington, D. C. . . . 1940-41 [n.p., 1940]. Co-operation with institutions outside Washington may result in similar privileges offered to graduate students from other universities. Few of our universities are equipped to-day to launch a creditable program of training in archives and manuscripts. Indeed, the number of historians and other scholars who have kept abreast of the rapid developments in this field is all too limited. We must guard against planless exploitation and unintentional debasement of this new profession. With few exceptions, the present-day archivist or director of manuscripts got his training in the old school of hard knocks and experience. He had to solve his problems of classification and cataloguing without benefit of consultation and he served as general utility man because he had few, if any, assistants. Whatever his scholarly attainments, he had to contend with dirt and vermin in the transfer and inventory of records one day and settle questions of policy the next. If the reminiscence of his versatility in the days "way back when" makes him a bit contemptuous of our prospective archivist who is primarily a scholar and only incidentally an artisan, he may recall that, under the conditions just described, time for creative work and constructive administration was continually sacrificed to daily mechanical routine. And even the professional archivist will not escape soiled hands in his contacts with the manuscripts. The library school is inclined to view the archives or manuscript collection as merely another division of library service to which the customary technique and mechanics can be adapted. Obviously there are many institutions in which a broader policy would be impracticable. But the library schol puts the cart before the horse if, as in one instance, it capitalizes on the new interest in archives and manuscripts by adding a few courses to its curriculum and advising the student to supplement them by graduate work in history and political science. There is a real need for training of assistants in archival craftsmanship and routine technique which the library school can meet by well selected courses covering a year or two; but, with allowance for the exceptional individual, the professional archivist, in the finest sense of the term, requires the prolonged training in advanced scholarship which is the best guarantee of a "philosophy of archives." Only by keeping this distinction clearly in mind can the archivist be assured of a genuine professional status. The nucleus of the present division of manuscripts of the University of Virginia, now containing some two million pieces, was composed of four collections: the Jefferson, Lee, Cabell, and PoeIngram papers. The small, but significant, Jefferson Collection soon became one of the special interests of Curator John Cook Wyllie, who sought to enrich it not only with original letters and documents but also with photographic copies of isolated and little known items in public and private repositories. The research value of this unique collection will be enhanced by the publication of a calendar which is now nearing completion. During the past year several institutions have co-operated in permitting photostat or microfilm copies to be made from their Jefferson Papers: from the Monticello Foundation, music in Jefferson's library and miscellaneous manuscripts, pictures, and books pertaining to him and his family, including Nicholas P. Trist;14 14. See also post, page 17, n. 43. from the Library of Congress, a sketch of the founding of Virginia, written by Jefferson presumably early in 1776, embodying an attack on Lord North's ministry and on the theory that the American colonies were under financial obligation to the mother country;15 15. Cf. William F. Keller, "Jefferson Refutes a Tory Argument," Americana, XXXIV, no. 3 (July, 1940), pages 447-57. from the Massachusetts Historical Society, Jefferson's account books for 1771-72, 1774, and 1776-78,16 16. The University of Virginia Library now has a complete series of photographic copies of all known Jefferson account books, 17671826; of originals, this library has only the index to the volume for 1779-82. the manuscript catalogue of his library, and the index cards to the Society's collection of his manuscripts; from the Huntington Library, his account book for 1775; from the Virginia State Library, his marriage bond, July (?) 23, 1771, and the original Report of the Rockfish Gap Commission, August 1, 1818, which determined the location of the University of Virginia.17 17. The text of this Report is printed in [N. F. Cabell], Early History of the University of Virginia . . . (Richmond, Va., 1856), appendix, pages 432-47. Cf. E. G. Swem, A Bibliography of Virginia, II (Virginia State Library, Bulletin, X, Richmond, 1917), page 166, item 9083. The first of a series of typewritten transcripts of Jefferson documents recorded in the clerk's office of Albemarle County, Virginia, has been presented to the University Library by the compiler, Mrs. J. N. Burnet. Photographic copies of Jefferson material obtained from individuals include two letters to Edmund Pendleton, 1784, one to James Madison, 1824, and about 100 letters to and from Jefferson, 1788-1826, especially from Randolph Jefferson, Peter Carr, and J. Garland Jefferson, young law students for whom the statesman served as mentor. Among original Jefferson manuscripts acquired, covering the period 1810-23, are two drawings of the house described by Dr. Fiske Kimball as "Shadwell," two preliminary sketches for the governor's house in Richmond, and an important letter to Robert Walsh, Jr., April 5, 1823, regarding a proposed biography of Jefferson. Considerable research has been done in recent years in the University's Lee Collection (eighteenth century, especially Revolutionary), mentioned above. Through the interest and enthusiasm of Mr. Cazenove G. Lee., Jr., of Washington, D. C., and the Society of Lees of Virginia these papers have been augmented by photostatic copies of fifteen letters, owned by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, from Thomas Lee of "Stratford" to Conrad Weiser of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, 1744-50, concerning French and Indian affairs and revealing Lee's keen interest in Indian mores and social life; by photostats from the Lee Collection of Harvard University; and by a typewritten copy of the letter books, 1769-76, of William Lee of "Green Spring," owned by Mr. Cazenove Lee, Jr. The original Register of Cases, 1794, of Charles Lee (1758-1815) before the federal and state courts in Eastern Virginia has been given to the University of Virginia. The expansion of the Jefferson and Lee collections may serve to illustrate what can be done with photographic reproduction by careful planning and the co-operation of libraries and individuals. The eighteenth century manuscripts in the Alderman Library have been enriched by the Hamond Papers,* * In the McGregor Library, University of Virginia. 1771-ca.1799, consisting chiefly of the autobiography, letter-books, and orderbooks of Captain Sir Andrew Snape Hamond, Bart. (1738-1828). He was captain in the Royal Navy during the American Revolution, controller of the Navy, governor of Nova Scotia, and member of Parliament. The papers deal with naval and military operations in North America during 1771-83; a few additional entries were made by Admiral Sir Graham Eden Hamond in 1799. A smaller collection on the British side of the war is composed of "Four Memoranda on the conduct of the War in Virginia and the Carolinas, etc., 1779-1781," submitted to Lord George Germaine by Richard Oswald.* * In the McGregor Library, University of Virginia. One of these discusses the military importance of the Elizabeth River and Hampton Roads, dated June 26, 1779; another is " . . . Relative to the Plan for an alliance with Russia," August 2, 1781. Oswald, a prominent merchant before the Revolution, was appointed British commissioner at the Paris peace conference in 1782.18 18.

To the Latané Deposit19 19. Sixth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1935-36, page 6. of eighteenth century Essex County, Virginia, materials have been added official documents pertaining to land-holdings of Lewis Latané, two letters to Major William Latané, 1794 and 1800, and one of James Whitehead to the Vestry of South Farnham Parish, 1788. The social and political life of a mercantile family of southeastern Virginia is revealed in the Prentis Papers:20 20. Typewritten copies made by Colonial Williamsburg, Inc., from originals in the possession of Professor Robert H. Webb, University of Virginia. Judge Joseph Prentis's (1754-1809)21 21. Cf. William and Mary Quarterly, 1st ser., VI (1897-98), pages 190-91. Garden Book, ca. 1775-88, and "Monthly Kalendar," 1775-79; letters of Robert Prentis (b. 1741), 1775, 1783-1804, concerning commercial dealings in the West Indies; letters of Robert Anderson to Joseph Prentis, 1795-1826; letters of Judge Joseph Prentis to his son Joseph Prentis, Jr. (1783-1851), while the latter was in Williamsburg, 1796-1805, and, from July, 1805, to 1809, attorney in Suffolk; and those of Robert Saunders to Joseph Prentis in the same cities during 1799-1826. On microfilm are copies of legal and business papers of William Prentis, (17011765), native of England, Williamsburg merchant, father of Judge Joseph Prentis and uncle of Robert Prentis, ca. 1733-70, involving members of the Blair, Cary, Nicholas, Whiting, and other families. The Dabney Family Papers, numbering about a thousand manuscripts and photostats, relate especially to Robert Lewis Dabney (1820-1898), M. A. of the University of Virginia, and staff officer and biographer of "Stonewall" Jackson.22 22. R. L. Dabney, Life and Campaigns of Lieut.-Gen. Thomas J. Jackson, (Stonewall Jackson) (New York, 1866). These MSS. were also used by Dr. Thomas Cary Johnson in his The Life and Letters of Robert Lewis Dabney (Richmond, Va., [1903]). They shed light on his life in Louisa County, at Hampden-Sydney College, and at the University, and they include material which he used in writing the life of Jackson. The R. M. T. Hunter Collection,23 23. The gift of Mrs. J. Clayton Mitchell. Cf. Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1937-38, page 6. one of the most valuable in the Library, has been increased by several thousand pieces, including many letters of Hunter to his wife during his long political career, records of the firm of Stone, Hunter &amp; Company in Fredericksburg during the 1790's and of Hunter, Garnett &amp; Company of Essex County during the early 1800's, mill and blacksmith accounts at "Fonthill," Hunter's estate, in the latter 1850's, and letters and note books of R. M. T. Hunter, Jr. (1839-1861), while he was a student in the University of Virginia, 1857-61. The surviving papers of the Honorable Claude A. Swanson (1862-1939), member of the Virginia Legislature, governor of Virginia, member of Congress, United States senator, and secretary of the Navy, have been received recently from the family. Although he was in public life more than half a century, only a very small portion of his political correspondence escaped destruction—four vertical file drawers on Virginia politics, 1921-22.24 24. His records as secretary of the Navy are in the Navy Department, Washington, D. C. The Holland Manuscripts, 1820-90, reveal in considerable detail economic and social life in southside Virginia, especially Franklin County and vicinity, from the planter's viewpoint. The ante bellum material centers around the family of Asa Holland, farmer, mercantile partner, county official, and local postmaster. There are letters on the Rocky Mount Turnpike Company, others on the tobacco business in Danville in which Asa was interested through his brother Smithson H. Holland, others on Hollins Institute, of which Asa's son-in-law, William E. Duncan, was principal in 1858-59, and on Alleghany College, Blue Sulphur Springs, 1860-61. Post office reports, 1854-60, include lists of subscribers to newspapers and magazines and titles of periodicals.25 25. For similar records from Washington County, Virginia, cf. Sixth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1935-36, page 5. The collection is valuable, too, for its Civil War letters— of Asa's son, Mark, who fought in many of the Virginia campaigns throughout the four years, of Duncan in the quartermaster's office at first and later in the artillery under General A. P. Hill, and of two other Holland kinsmen. Three volumes of commissary accounts of the Confederate War Department in the area of Franklin County and southwestern Virginia, 1863-65, are of special interest. The papers after 1865 are less numerous but throw some light on post bellum agricultural and general economic conditions. Another collection, similar in character to the Holland Papers, is that of the Douglass Family of Orange, Greene, and Albemarle counties, 1731-1900. The material on the eighteenth century consists of a few surveys and deeds, a Quaker marriage certificate of the Hanover County Meeting, 1789, and scattered letters, bills, and receipts. Agricultural conditions, business affairs, social life, a few glimpses of politics, are seen in the correspondence and transactions of John Douglass (d. 1828), his son, John B. Douglass (d. 1861), and grandson, John M. Douglass. Among their correspondents were members of the Duke, Graves, Southall, Watts, and White families. The grandson, like Mark Holland, served in the Confederate army in Virginia throughout the war and many of his letters have survived. Economic conditions during reconstruction and afterward are revealed in letters and documents—e.g., in labor contracts of Jason B. Douglass, John M.'s brother, with certain freedmen, 1866-73. There are numerous family letters from Kingston, Georgia, in the 1870's and 1880's and a few comments on Republican politics in Virginia after 1880. The John R. Wingfield (1845-1925) Manuscripts comprise the personal and business papers of this lawyer and politician, a resident of Charlottesville and Albemarle County, ca. 1865-1925. He was a member of the Virginia Senate during 1881-86 and supported the Readjuster Party. His papers, numbering more than 5,000, include letters and documents from Costa Rica where he served as United States consul, 1886-89, records of the Horse Creek Coal Company of West Virginia after 1900, the Minute Book of the Ivy Creek Farmers Club, Albemarle County, 1911-14, and miscellaneous account books. From Fluvanna County come the Winn Papers, of particular interest to students of medical history. Fourteen volumes of account books cover the medical practice of Dr. Philip J. Winn in detail during 1857-87. While a medical student in the University of Virginia, 1873-76, his son, John F. Winn, wrote numerous letters home regarding the faculty, courses, student life, and personal matters. The father also preserved letters from various patients and their families, 1864-87, and from his son, who, as a physician in Richmond, discussed certain case histories and diseases he was treating. Dr. J. F. Winn was editor and proprietor of The Sanitary Monitor, 1886, and of Practice: the Physicians' Monthly Journal, 1887, both published in Richmond.26 26. Established as Richmond Journal of Practice, 1886—cf. L. J. Cappon, Bibliography of Virginia History since 1865 (Charlottesville, Va., 1930), item 4643, page 640. The Account Book and a volume of medical notes of Dr. Austin Brockenbrough, ca. 1780-83, reveal some details of this physician's work in Tappahannock, Virginia, and vicinity. From Staunton, Virginia, come three "Journals" (account books) of the medical practice of Dr. Francis T. Stribling, 1831-38. Also of interest to medical historians is the Jefferson R. Kean Collection of ten manuscript and printed items à propos of William Gorgas's recognition of Dr. Walter Reed's contribution to the scientific knowledge of yellow fever.27 27. Ignored by Burton J. Hendrick in his William Crawford Gorgas: His Life and Work (Garden City, N. Y., 1924). No academic year of the University of Virginia passes without some noteworthy additions to its official records28 28. Cf. W. E. Hemphill, "A Bibliography of the Unprinted Official Records of the University of Virginia," Sixth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1935-36, pages 9-27. or to material about the University in collections of personal manuscripts. One of the most significant is the deposit of Alexander Garrett Papers, 1812-48. As first bursar of the institution, Garrett was most familiar with its finances which were discussed in letters from Jefferson and Madison, 1821-28, preserved in this collection. Here, too, is the six-page order of ceremonies for the laying of the corner-stone of Central College, Oct. 6, 1817, which President James Monroe and ex-presidents Jefferson and Madison attended.29 29. The ceremonies were Masonic. The new University of Virginia succeeded Central College on the same site in 1819, as decided by the Rockfish Gap Commission—cf. ante, page 8. From the death-bed of the "Sage of Monticello" went a brief note from Garrett to his wife on July 4, 1826: "Mr. Jefferson is no more, he breathed his last 10 minutes before 1 o'clock today almost without a struggle. . . ." Letters from Thomas W. Gilmer, 1832, on the nullification controversy, from John H. Cocke, James Monroe, John Minor, and Chapman Johnson are also among these papers. Records of two proctors of the University have been received: letters (typewritten copies, the gift of Professor Robert H. Webb) of Robert Riddick Prentis (1818-1871), son of Joseph Prentis, Jr., for the period 1835-71 (he was proctor during 1853-65), and a small group of bills, receipts, and other papers of Major Green Peyton (d. 1897) while holding that office, 186897. The Virginia Quarterly Review has donated 89 letters from prominent editors, publishers, and writers to the recent editors of the Review, Stringfellow Barr and Lambert Davis, and has lent for microfilming a package of correspondence between Havelock Ellis and Dr. Louise S. Bryant, 1935-39.30 30. A selection of Ellis's letters from this correspondence was published in the Virginia Quarterly Review, XVI, no. 2 (Spring, 1940), pages 175-89. Other acquisitions pertaining to the University are Professor George W. Blaetterman's (1820-1912) reminiscences and "Personal Recollections of Thomas Jefferson"; a copy of Bohn's Album and Autographs of the University of Virginia (Washington, 1859) with numerous additional photographs of professors and buildings inserted; the minutes, constitution, and other memoranda of the Class of 1908; some twentieth century records of the Y. M. C. A. at the University; and further additions to the collection of students' notebooks on lectures by J. P. Emmett (chemistry), James P. C. Southall (mathematics and physics), N. F. Cabell (materia medica), etc. The Civil War theme is apparently inexhaustible. So is the supply of materials newly discovered each year. Although they are seldom novel in their general character, they are always fresh in detail and provide incentive for new research. The viewpoint is modified by successive generations of historians and the picture is never completed. Soldiers' letters continue to come out of hiding. To the University of Virginia's files have been added, besides the Holland and Douglass letters described above,31 31. See ante, pages 11-12. twenty-five written by J. A. Tompkins, 5th Virginia Cavalry, to his mother during 1863-64, the last from Prison Camp, Point Lookout, Maryland. The Elisha F. Paxton (1828-1863) Collection is composed of twelve letters written to his wife in Lexington and to others from the Confederate army in Virginia, a "Stonewall" Jackson letter (A.L.S.), April 12, 1862, and a copy of another dated September 23, 1862, and letters of tribute to General Paxton written to his son, John G. Paxton, by Mrs. M. A. Jackson, William A. Anderson, and other friends and comrades of the general.32 32. Some of these letters were prompted by the receipt of gift copies of Memoir and Memorials: Elisha Franklin Paxton, Brigadier-General, C. S. A. . . . ([n.p.] 1905); also pub. by Neale &amp; Co., 1907. The MS. letters now in this Library represent about one-fifth of those printed in the Memoir with some inaccuracies and omissions. Eight letters of the Reverend Robert William Watts, (1825-1910) Methodist chaplain in the Army of Northern Virginia,33 33. Cf. J. J. Lafferty, Sketches and Portraits of the Virginia Conference (Twentieth Century Edition, Richmond, Va., 1901), pages 46, 51, 53. are extant, written in Loudoun and Fauquier counties, 1861-62, to members of his family. The civilian reaction to invasion is strikingly shown in the diary of Lucy R. Buck (18421918) written at her home "Bel Air," Front Royal, Virginia, December, 1861-May, 1862.34 34. Gift of Messrs. Walter H. Buck and William R. Buck of Baltimore. Typewritten copy, 81 pages. Lucy R. Buck was the daughter of William Mason Buck of Front Royal. With mingled feelings of hatred and tolerance, she describes the Federals' occupation of the town and their encampment at "Bel Air" in May, 1862. A companion piece to this record is the four-volume diary, 1856-70, of Marcus Blakemore Buck, her kinsman, who lived on a farm in Warren County near "Bel Air." Although his diary is concerned chiefly with agricultural routine, he writes at some length on troop movements and war conditions in the lower Shenandoah Valley. Additional letters of Federal soldiers have been acquired: twenty by natives of Maine and Massachusetts while in Washington, D. C., and nearby camps, at Hampton, Virginia, and Roanoke Island, North Carolina, 1861-64;35 35. Written by James W. and Ambrose A. Huntley of Maine, Monroe Thayer of Massachusetts, Daniel Holloway, et. al. a dozen letters written by Captain Henry S. Spaulding, 24th New Jersey Volunteers, to his wife, November 1862-May, 1865.36 36. Cf. Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1937-38, page 7, for other letters of Federal soldiers. Greatly disillusioned by the spirit of selfishness and pettiness in the army, he tells of marauding by northern soldiers in tidewater Virginia, of desertions and life behind the lines, and he criticizes northern press accounts of the Battle of Fredericksburg. The Library is planning to publish a series of calendars of its Confederate material; compilation of the first volume has been completed. The Breckenridge-Watts Papers, 1794-1862, entrusted to the Library as a deposit, contain personal letters from members of these and related families—the Allens, Gambles, Jacksons, Madisons, Morrises, and Sanderses—with references to and comments on social and political life of the Old South. Another deposit is the correspondence of the Hume Family of Virginia, 40 letters, ca. 1835-ca. 1914, but especially those of David Hume (d. 1856 or 1857) of Alexandria, 1853-56. A dozen miscellaneous letters from the correspondence of President Benjamin S. Ewell of the College of William and Mary, 1854-93, have been acquired. The Account and Memorandum Book of William Chapman, long a resident of Waynesboro, Virginia, records occasional notable events in the town during the period 1838-98, and numerous births, marriages, and deaths. In the absence of state vital statistics during the nineteenth century, even fragmentary notes of this kind are not to be despised. The earliest records of the Monticello Guard, a military company of Charlottesville and vicinity organized in 1857, but claiming its antecedents back to the early militia of Virginia,37 37. [Robert E. Culin], A Sketch of the History and Activities of the Monticello Guard [Charlottesville, Va., 1939?] are preserved in the Alderman Library for the Albemarle County Historical Society.38 38. See post, page 26. They consist of two minute books, 1857-61 and 1871-80, a volume of by-laws, resolutions, and list of members, 1871-79, and two account books, 1875-81. Of literary and artistic interest are the 15-page manuscript, "My Recollections of Sarah Helen Whitman," March-April, 1905, in the hand of William Whitman Bailey, the gift of Miss Margaret Emerson Bailey, and photostats of three Edgar Allan Poe letters (in private hands), written from Richmond, in 1835 and 1836. From the Harvard College Library photostat copies have been obtained of eleven letters from Poe to James Russell Lowell, 1842-44. The Samuel W. Marvin Collection of literary autographs consists of 50 letters addressed to Marvin while he was an executive officer of Charles Scribner's Sons, by distinguished authors and editors, covering the period 1879-1917,39 39. Among the writers represented are Edward W. Bok, W. C. Brownell, F. N. Doubleday, A. B. Frost, R. W. Gilder, Arthur T. Hadley J. Lawrence Laughlin, Brander Matthews, Howard Pyle, Henry Van Dyke, and Edith Wharton. and Henry Van Dyke's preface to The Blue Flower40 40. New York, Scribner's Sons, 1902. in his autograph. Two manuscript scores—"Interlude of Good Fellowship" and "Interlude of Athletic Prowess"—by the Virginia composer and pianist, John Powell, who composed them for the University of Virginia's Centennial in 1920, have been placed in the custody of the Library. Two items supplement the Woodrow Wilson Papers:41 41. Cf. Ninth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1938-39, page 4. a letter of January 10, 1901, refusing the offer of the presidency of Washington and Lee University, and a brief note written from the president's room, Princeton University, October 20, 1904. A letter by Calvin Coolidge, written in 1900 while he was practicing law in Northampton, Massachusetts, and one by Franklin D. Roosevelt of 1918, while he was assistant secretary of the Navy, have been found in the Low Moor Iron Company Papers.42 42. Described in the following paragraph. The Library has also acquired a collection of miscellaneous letters written by Virginia politicians, mostly in the 1870's and 1880's, along with a few autobiographical sketches of members of Congress from Virginia.43 43. Including John Minor Botts, William E. Cameron, John W. Daniel, W. L. Goggin, Robert W. Hughes, Charles F. Mercer, Francis H. Peirpont, James Pleasants, Jr., W. H. Roane, Littleton Tazewell, E. Lee Trinkle, Nicholas P. Trist, Gilbert C. Walker, John S. Wise, et al. The original "Douglas Register" of St. James-Northam Parish, Goochland County, 1756-97, recorded by the Reverend William Douglas,44 44. The Douglas Register . . . was published by W. Mac Jones, Richmond, 1928. Excerpts had appeared in the William and Mary Quarterly, 1st ser., XV (1906-07), pages 24-36, 113-23, 249-55. is deposited in the Library. Genealogists will be especially interested in the correspondence, charts, and other material from which Colonel Brooke Payne compiled his The Paynes of Virginia (Richmond, 1937). Four items on Italian history may be mentioned: two letters written at Pisa, one by Cosimo de Medici, 1561, the other by Julio de Medici, 1574, and two eighteenth century maps of the Papal States. Most notable of the business records acquired during the year are those of the Low Moor Iron Company near Clifton Forge, Alleghany County, Virginia. This fifty-year accumulation— some twelve tons of 1,065 volumes and unbound material in fileboxes—will reveal the history of the company from its founding in 1873 until it ceased operations ca. 1930. The records of mines, furnaces, stores, the labor accounts, and particularly the bulky correspondence with a great variety of firms and individuals over a wide area will provide valuable evidence on American economic life, business practices, and industrial technique during the period of their greatest expansion. The very magnitude of such a collection enhances its research value, but it also presents a serious problem of filing and making it accessible. A partial answer to this question is the destruction of certain series of papers, like vouchers and invoices, in which the essential data are duplicated in more usable form in the bound volumes. After a check was made of the bookkeeping system, it was decided that the elimination of certain segments of the loose papers was justifiable.45 45. Cf. Hilary Jenkinson, "The Choice of Records for Preservation: Some Practical Hints," Library Association Record, XLI, no. 11 (November, 1939), pages 543-44; "The Preservation of Business Records," Business Historical Society, Bulletin, XI, nos. 3-4 (October, 1937), pages 37-61; Philip C. Brooks, "What Records shall We Preserve?" The National Archives, Staff Information Circulars, no. 9 (June 1940). Facing the risk of condemnation by the social historian, such a decision is more easily postponed than made, despite practical considerations. The iron industry of Virginia on the modest scale characteristic of an earlier day is glimpsed in two Day Books of Liberty Furnace, Shenandoah County, 1832-58 and 1871-72, and a Cord Wood Book, 1872-74. Another approach to this industry is available through the records (3 letter-books and 300 loose papers) of the Dover Company of Henrico and Goochland counties, 186672, with officers in New York City and Cambridge, Massachusetts.46 46. The company was organized by Joseph R. Anderson, William H. Aspinwall, Samuel L. M. Barlow, and Charles P. Stone. It represents one of many attempts to develop manufacturing in the post bellum South. This trend is also evident in a series of manuscript geological and mining reports on properties in southwestern Virginia and West Virginia, 1862-ca. 1870, made by Adelberg &amp; Raymond, mining engineers of New York City, Dr. H. Credner, A. Eilers, and Charles F. Anderson. Iron, coal, and oil lands in the Kanawha and other valleys of West Virginia, zinc and copper deposits in Wythe and Carroll counties, Virginia, were surveyed; the reports and recommendations were couched in the customary vein of optimism.47 47. The Virginias, a magazine edited by Jed Hotchkiss, Staunton, Va., 1880-85, contains an abundance of material on the natural resources and development of this region. It is interesting to note that this prospecting in West Virginia began as soon as the new state was organized, long before the end of the war. William Peile's Diary, January-July, 1888, records brief entries of iron mining operations in Buckingham County, Virginia. The Papers of Andrew Clow &amp; Company of Philadelphia, 17801806, shed light upon commercial relations between a typical eastern banking and commission house and Virginia merchants like William Wilson &amp; Company and Josiah Watson &amp; Company of Alexandria, and others in Richmond, Norfolk, and Petersburg. The Account Book of William C. Jones of "Walnut Valley Plantation," Surry County, Virginia, adjoining historic "Bacon's Castle," reflects the variety of occupations subsidiary to agriculture during the years recorded, 1803-13. In the Winn Papers described above48 48. See ante, page 13. are three letters of John Timberlake to Captain John Winn, 1840-41, concerning the sale of cotton yarn manufactured in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the use of child labor. Partial records of two transportation companies have been received: a volume of toll-gate receipts, 1852-57, of a turnpike company of Franklin County—probably the Rocky Mount Turnpike Company mentioned in connection with the Holland Papers;49 49. See ante, page 11. and an account book on financing the construction of the Martinsburg &amp; Potomac Railroad Company, 1870-73. Some additions to the collection of general merchandise account books and tradesmen's records should be mentioned. From Franklin County come three volumes of the Holland Family's mercantile enterprises for 1822-28 and 1840-46. The flour mill and store account of William or Thomas Noland at Aldie, Loudoun County, 1816-20, includes transactions with James Monroe, 1816-17. Four volumes of mercantile and mill records of William Hendrick of Mecklenburg County, Virginia, and vicinity cover the period 1835-54; the Day Book of Hume &amp; Towles, merchants of Orange County, is for 1859-60. Pittsylvania County is represented by a Day Book of Berger's Store near Toshes P. O., 1867-68, and by 34 ledgers of Hurt's Store near Alta Vista, 1871-1907. The William A. Warren account books supplement and largely precede in date the Bell-Warren Collection acquired previously.50 50. Cf. F. L. Berkeley, Jr., "A Checklist of Bound Business Records in the Manuscript Collections of the Alderman Library, University of Virginia," Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1937-38, page 36. The store also operated at various times under the names Gwaltney &amp; Warren, Warren &amp; Bros., and W. A. Warren &amp; Son. The Day Book of Lauck &amp; Stephen, 1832-34, records mercantile accounts in Martinsburg, Berkeley County, Virginia (now West Virginia). The Papers of A. J. Parr &amp; Brothers51 51. At the suggestion of Dr. Arthur H. Cole of the Harvard Business Historical Society, the donor presented this collection to the University of Virginia rather than to the Baker Library of Harvard University because of the Virginia material in the collection. at Orleans, Fauquier County, Virginia, 1858-62 and 1865, consist of letters received, bills, and vouchers for merchandise purchased by the firm from local farmers, tradesmen, and wholesale houses in Baltimore, Richmond, Alexandria, etc. A manuscript book of 1831-34 records real estate and other accounts, evidently of Washington, D. C., including additional notes on the settlement of the Estate of Robert Leckie and a brief item on Mrs. Ann Royall. From Staunton, Virginia, comes the Day Book of a lawyer of Augusta County for 1821-26 and 1831-33. The incidental acquisition of archival material as a part of collections of private papers re-emphasizes the impossibility of segregating the one from the other and the undesirability of regarding them as mutually exclusive.52 52. See ante, pages 4-5, and Eighth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1937-38, page 10. Official records of the Confederate States of America are widely scattered, the largest collection being in the National Archives.53 53. Although some of this material in the National Archives has been received only recently from governmental departments, much of it is accessible for properly qualified investigators. Cf. L. J. Cappon, "Confederate Ordnance Records in the National Archives," Journal of the American Military Institute, IV, no. 2 (Summer, 1940), pages 94-102. The finding of a few commissary books of the Confederate War Department, among the Holland Papers mentioned above,54 54. See ante, page 12. suggests that many more of these archives will doubtless come to light from time to time. Some Franklin County, Virginia, archives are also among these papers—deputy sheriff records of Asa Holland, 1850-52, and public school records accumulated by Superintendent William E. Duncan, consisting of a series of teachers' reports on printed forms, 1874-81, and a volume showing salaries paid to teachers, by district, 1879-188-(?). A volume of clerk's fees and fines from the Circuit Court of Franklin County, 1850, embraces like data from the neighboring counties of Bedford, Campbell, Patrick, and Roanoke. The Wingfield Collection contains some official records of John R. Wingfield as treasurer of Albemarle County, 18891905—tax books (including poll and delinquent land taxes), school funds, road warrants, licenses, accounts with Charlottesville banks, and a direct tax book of 1866. From Shenandoah County comes a Day Book of Sheriff William Bochin, 1832-35; from Petersburg, tax receipts of the city for 1861, 1862, and 1863. Copies of selected documents in two manuscript volumes, "Quaint, Curious, and Historical Extracts from the Records of Elizabeth City County, Virginia, A. D. 1715-1728," were collected by Jacob Heffelfinger of Hampton, Virginia, in 1877. The county clerks of Virginia have been most cooperative in supplying the University Library with copies of current poll and capitation tax lists, thus continuing a practice of several years.55 55. Cf. Sixth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1935-36, page 6 and n. This Library has aided in diverting certain archival records of Rockbridge County from private hands to the Virginia State Library; the latter has provided the former with important photostats and materials on exchange. This policy of reciprocity has long been of great advantage to both institutions and to the promotion of research in Virginia. Various materials obtained in the form of photographic reproductions have been described above in relation to certain collections of original manuscripts. Other microfilm and photostat copies are listed herewith. The one-volume diary of A. J. Peyton of Orange County, 1859-61, is valuable for its information on the Baptists in the locality and observations on the political crisis of those years. The migration of Virginians to the Middle and Far West is illustrated in "Incidents and reminiscences of the life of C. D. Reynolds [b. 1819] from boyhood to old age beginning at his earliest recollections. Written by himself . . . on Dry Creek, Stanislaus County, California, January 7, 1893" (70 typewritten pages). Born in Orange County, Virginia, Reynolds moved as a boy with his family to Kentucky and Missouri and later to California as a 'forty-niner. He describes life in the mines during the 'fifties, sheep ranching after the Civil War, and makes some comments on national and California politics of the 1880's and early 1890's. Microfilm copies of 55 autograph letters, 1849-61, of Hamilton Fish (1808-1893) while he was governor of New York and United States senator, pertain to numerous persons prominent in American political life.56 56. Including G. T. Beauregard, Henry Clay, J. J. Crittenden, Jefferson Davis, Joseph E. Johnston, Abbott Lawrence, Abraham Lincoln, Winfield Scott, William H. Seward, W. T. Sherman, George H. Thomas, John Tyler, Daniel Webster, et al. From Williamsburg have been received photostats of fragmentary manuscripts found in the Carter-Saunders House containing "secrets" of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, and memoranda concerning the destruction of original records and books in Williamsburg by Federal troops during the Civil War.57 57. The James City County archives in Williamsburg were destroyed by fire on July 29, 1862—cf. The Cavalier, July 30, 1862, published there by northern soldiers. On microfilm is a copy of the Diary of Landon Carter of Sabine Hall, 1766-67 (original in the William L. Clements Library), interleaved in The Virginia Almanack for those years; Carter wrote chiefly of farming and the weather. Photographic copies of a few Virginia church records have been secured: the Proceedings of Hanover Presbytery, 1755-86; Records of the Maysville Presbyterian Church in Buckingham County, 1824-70; and the Parish Register of St. Paul's Episcopal Church at Ivy, Albemarle County, 1848-1936. The John Bowie Strange Camp No. 14, Virginia Division of United Confederate Veterans, at Charlottesville, has permitted the Library to microfilm its Minutes, 1910-30, and retain the originals on loan. A biographical sketch of Mrs. F. L. Murphy, 1854-1933, by J. K. Hall, M. D., supplements the film collection of Bumgardner Papers previously acquired.58 58. Ninth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1938-39, page 18. "The Bible of Hugues de Berzé" was lent for photographing—a nineteenth century manuscript copy of a thirteenth century moralizing poem by Berzé.59 59. Notes in red ink show variations between the London MS. and the one destroyed in the 1904 fire at Turin. The newspaper collection of the Alderman Library60 60. Cf. Fourth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1933-34, pages 3-4; Fifth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1934-35, pages 3-5; et seq. now contains 2,100 bound volumes, which, however, are only a small percentage of the total—about ten per cent. Most of the files of old papers are Virginia publications; a few of various metropolitan dailies of the early twentieth century have been acquired. Among additions of early nineteenth century Virginia papers are files of The Virginia Advocate of Charlottesville, 1840-41, and the Enquirer of Richmond, 1817-20; seven numbers of the scarce Richmond Whig and Commercial Journal, June 4-11, 1832, and issues of 1808 of three papers in the same city—The Spirit of '76, November 25, The Virginia Argus, December 6, and The Enquirer, December 2. Two numbers of rare Charlottesville papers, hitherto unrecorded, are The Era, September 16, 1859,61 61. Vol. 1, no. 46; weekly, John A. Allen, ed. and prop. and The May-Flower, April 5, 1860.62 62. Vol. 1, no. 1; weekly, pub. by J. H. Mahon and C. Marstin, Jr. Scattered issues of several Washington, D. C., organs during the ante bellum period63 63. The Globe, Constitution, Madisonian, Republic, Union, and National Intelligencer. and bound volumes of the National Intelligencer, 1800-03, 1807, 1813-16, have improved the research materials covering the national capital. A notable asset to the Civil War collection is a bound file, with very few omissions, of the rare Lynchburg Republican, 1861-65,* * In the McGregor Library. founded by Robert H. Glass and long controlled by him.64 64. The Whig competitor of the Democratic Lynchburg Republican was the Virginian; cf. L. J. Cappon, Virginia Newspapers, 18211935; a Bibliography (New York, 1936), pages 121-23. The Library's file of the Richmond Daily Dispatch, 1861-64, has been considerably improved and the group of papers published by Federal soldiers in Virginia during the war by photographic copies of The First Minnesota of Berryville, March 11, 1862, and of the weekly it supplanted, the Berryville Conservator, March 12, 1862. Miscellaneous issues of the latter decades of the century include papers from Bedford, Harrisonburg, Lynchburg, Richmond, and Rocky Mount; material on southwestern Virginia will be found in a volume of The Holston Methodist, Knoxville, Tennessee, 187778. The problem of preserving current Virginia newspapers65 65. The University Library also maintains files of several dailies from large eastern and mid-western cities. has led to a cooperative project between the Virginia State Library and the University Library. Since 1905 the State Library has been keeping files of a large number of dailies and a few weeklies; during the past decade the University Library has preserved many weekly papers and several dailies. Since economy of space and of handling prevents both libraries from including all current papers in their collections, each institution assumes responsibility for certain ones under the plan adopted and unnecessary duplications are eliminated. Files of all Virginia dailies are now preserved (the State Library bearing the major burden) and certain weeklies, selected to provide adequate geographic distribution (the University Library being responsible for the larger portion). The existence of back files in either library was a deciding factor in allocating many of the papers; a few files have been interchanged for mutual advantage. Since these two libraries together embrace the largest collection of Virginia newspapers in existence, the far-reaching effects of this agreement in aiding research are obvious. Numerous small collections in local Virginia libraries will continue to have real value either as supplementary to the files described above or as rare papers not duplicated elsewhere. Certain other printed materials acquired by the University Library are deserving of mention. The gift of the Swanson Papers66 66. See ante, page 11. included also a large share of the private library of the late Secretary Swanson, with many volumes on American foreign relations and some World War propaganda items. The Wingfield Collection contains numerous bills of the Virginia Senate during the 1880's (important research material which is seldom preserved in private hands) and some literature of the Readjuster Party. One of these imprints will interest both historians and bibliographers—an issue of The Wedge,67 67. July 1, 1882 (vol. 1, no. 6), monthly; Cash Thomas, ed. and prop. published in Herndon, Fairfax County, Virginia, in 1882 and not recorded in any serial checklist. Two volumes of two rare religious periodicals are the Virginia Religious Magazine, Lexington,68 68. Published 1805-07, bi-monthly; vol. 3, printed by Samuel Walkup. Listed in Sabin, XXVII, page 144, no. 100563. for 1807 (Volume III complete), and the Lynchburg Evangelical Magazine69 69. Not in Union List of Serials. for February (?) and March-October, 1810. Numerous Confederate broadsides and other imprints have been added and a photostat of a Confederate map of Albemarle County in the Virginia Historical Society. Microfilm copies were made of the Milton Grigg Collection of 160 photographs of early Albemarle County homes and buildings exhibited in the University's Bayley Art Museum in 1939. It is unnecessary to discuss the recent accessions of the Tracy W. McGregor Library. Its policies and progress are set forth in the Report of the curator.70 70. The Tracy W. McGregor Library. Curator's Report of the Year's Work, 1939-40, [by John Cook Wyllie] (5 pages, mimeog). Suffice it to say that the Advisory Committee decided to augment this Americana collection with expensive and rare items especially on Virginia and southern history. Thus the University's Manuscript Division and the McGregor Library are complementary and function as a unit in many respects, to the advantage of the student as well as the staff. Some of the collections described earlier in the present report belong to the McGregor Library, but for research purposes it seems appropriate to include them. The University Library has projected a series of volumes to increase the research value of its manuscript collections.71 71. Cf. Ninth Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1938-39, pages 2-3. The text and index of the first volume of Civil War calendars have been prepared for publication. The Jefferson calendar is nearing completion and satisfactory progress has been made on another of eighteenth century collections. All these are compiled by graduate service fellows under supervision of the curator and archivist. Part of the calendar of Berkeley Manuscripts was submitted to the history faculty this year as the appendix to a thesis on the Berkeley family of colonial Virginia.72 72. Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., The Berkeleys of Barn Elms, Planters of Colonial Virginia, and a Calendar of the Berkeley Papers, 16531767 (M. A. Thesis, University of Virginia, 1940; typew.), pages 62-138. The growing momentum of the Virginia Historical Records Survey project under the WPA has resulted in the publication of inventories of Amelia, Isle of Wight, and Southampton counties during the past year. Two volumes in the series of church inventories have also been issued; on the Dover Baptist Association and Negro Baptist churches in Richmond. The work of the American Imprints Inventory has progressed steadily in the University Library; the large collection of nineteenth century sheet music has prolonged this task. It is fortunate that this national project is under the inspiring direction of Dr. Douglas C. McMurtrie who is already applying its findings to larger problems in the library field.73 73. A Suggested Program for Augmenting Materials for Research in American Libraries. Douglas C. McMurtrie, Chairman, Special Committee on Library Holdings, [American Historical Association] ([Chicago?] 1939). In the promotion of historical research through the collection and preservation of manuscript materials, much depends upon the interest or indifference of the average citizen towards the history of his own community and the records which may be in his own family. The local historical society with enthusiasm and a broad vision of its opportunities may contribute much towards a genuine appreciation of the past, its records, and their significance. In Virginia the Clarke County Historical Association, established in the spring of 1939, has the use of the court house at Berryville as a repository for manuscripts and other materials. The following autumn a similar organization was founded in Rockbridge County with meetings at Lexington, the county seat. The Albemarle County Historical Society was organized in April, 1940. It numbers over 175 members, meets quarterly, and its collections are preserved in the Alderman Library of the University. The Society plans to publish periodically a volume of source material and historical articles. Some improvement in the care of local archives is noticeable in Virginia, especially where new county court houses have been erected. Unquestionably the Historical Records Survey deserves credit for the growing interest in such records. What might be done in establishing a county division of archives, to translate the state archives idea into terms of the locality, is suggested in a proposal under consideration by one of the counties of Illinois.74 74. Ernest E. East, "History in County Archives; Peoria County's Plan for a County Archives Department," Illinois Libraries, XXII, no. 2 (February, 1940), pages 27-31. When such departments can be set up successfully with trained personnel, we shall have passed another milestone in archival progress. A general index to the ten annual reports of the present series is included as a separate pamphlet with this issue. The office of Archivist of the University of Virginia Library was abolished at the close of the year 1939-40 and has been replaced by the position of Consultant in History and Archives, held by the writer. The collection and preservation of historical materials will continue with some modifications under the new arrangement. In conclusion, I desire to express my sincere appreciation of the wise counsel and never-failing co-operation of Messrs. John Cook Wyllie, Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., George H. Reese, and Glenn Curtis Smith of the Rare Books and Manuscripts Division, and especially of Harry Clemons, Librarian. Lester J. Cappon Archivist. 1 September 1940.</field>
