      <field name="fulltext">TERMS OF ADMISSION. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. MATRICULATION. To be admitted as a student of the University, the applicant must be at least sixteen years of age; but the Faculty may dispense with this requirement in favor of one who has a brother of the requisite age entering at the same time. If the applicant for admission has been a student at any other incorporated seminary, he must produce a certificate from such seminary, or other satisfactory evidence of general good conduct. In this institution there is no curriculum or prescribed course of study to be pursued by every student, whatever his previous preparation or special objects. In establishing the University of Virginia, Mr. Jefferson, for the first time in America, threw open the doors of a University in the true sense of the name, providing, as amply as the available means would permit, for thorough instruction in independent schools in all the chief branches of learning, assuming that the opportunities for study thus presented were privileges to be voluntarily and eagerly sought, and allowing students to select for themselves the departments to which they are led by their special tastes and proposed pusuits in life to devote themselves. The wisdom of this plan has been amply vindicated by time and experience; and within the last few years many of the institutions of higher culture in the United States have, to a greater or less extent, remodelled their method of study in accordance with the example here set. This elective system commends itself especially to those who desire to make professional attainments in any department of knowledge. At the same time the courses of academic study are so arranged as to provide for the systematic prosecution of a complete plan of general education. While every student may thus select the schools he will attend, in the academic department he is required, as a rule, to attend at least three, unless, upon the written request of his parent or guardian, or for good cause shown, the Faculty shall allow him to attend less than three. Students are permitted to exchange schools, with transfer of fees, within ONE WEEK after admission; thereafter no exchange is allowed, except by leave of the Faculty, and then without transfer of fees. The session commences on the 1st of October, and continues without interruption until the Thursday before the 4th of July. The mode of instruction is by lectures and text-books, accompanied by daily examinations. NO HONORARY DEGREES ARE CONFERRED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. SCHOOL OF LATIN. Prof. Peters. The subjects taught in this school are the Latin Language and Literature, with the History of Rome. The school is divided into two classesâ Junior and Senior.

In Ethics the intuitional theory is maintained against utilitarianism. The chief problems of ethical science are discussed, and its principles applied to personal and social duty. Text-Books.âCalderwood's Hand Book of Moral Philosophy, Stewart's Active and Moral Powers. IV. In Philosophy an outline of the history of speculation is given, from Plato to Hegel. The opinions of the various schools are sketched, the views of different philosophers compared and criticised, and the principles of Ontology examined. Text-Books.âUeberweg's History of Philosophy. The class is examined on the subject as developed by the lectures, supplemented by such portions of the text-books as may be indicated by the Professor. Political Economy. Those studying this subject constitute a separate class. The lectures discuss the relations of Labor and Capital, also various systems of Currency, Banking, Finance, and Taxation, with special reference to what is peculiar in the physical condition, political and social institutions, and industrial pursuits of our own country. Fundamental questions in Sociology are also considered. Text-Books.âMill's Principles of Political Economy. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF HISTORY, GENERAL LITERATURE AND RHETORIC. Prof. Holmes. This School is divided into two distinct classesâone of History and one of Literature and Rhetoric. To each, two lectures in the week are regularly devoted; but exercises in literary compositions are required from the members of the Literary class. Each study may be pursued separately. Class of History. In the Historical Class the successions, revolutions, and various aspects of the principal nations of the world are considered in such a manner as to afford a general and connected view of the progress of political and social organizations. Institutions and laws are noted as the manifestations of different phases of society; an attempt is made to discover and elucidate the conditions of historical advancement, and to refer the changes of nations and governments to the operation of regular principles. Text-Books.âSmith's History of Greece; Merivale's Smaller History of Rome, (Puller's Abridgment); Gibbon, abridged by Smith; Modern History, Text-Book to be indicated hereafter.

It embraces Applications of the Differential and Integral Calculus to selected portions of Mechanics, Physics, and Physical Astronomy. There is one class in Mixed Mathematics. In the class of Mixed Mathematics there are two Lectures each week. The instruction in each class in the School of Mathematics is conveyed partly by lectures and partly by the systematic study of approved textbooks. The student is assisted by full and frequent explanations from the Professor, and constantly subjected to rigid examinations. The progress of the student in each class is also tested by his being required to perform written exercises, in which the principles acquired are applied to the solution of particular problems. Any student entering the school has the privilege of attending all or any of the classes, and if prepared to enter an advanced class, may often find it highly advantageous to review his previous studies by attendance on a lower class also. SCHOOL OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. Prof. Smith. This School includes two departmentsâGeneral Physics and Practical Physics. I. General Physics. Junior Class.âThe Junior Class meets three times in each week throughout the session of nine months. The object of the course of 3 lectures to this class is to furnish the student with a comprehensive view of Modern Physics, and to make him familiar with its methods of investigation. With the design of laying a thoroughly scientific basis for the course, a large space is given at the outset to the discussion of the cardinal doctrines of motion, force and energy, and to their simpler applications in the pressure and motion of visible masses. With this preparation the student proceeds to the subject of Molecular Physics, embracing Sound, Light, Heat and Electricity. Throughout the course the established laws of motion and force are kept steadily in view, and an attempt is made to exhibit the evidence, daily becoming stronger and clearer, for the prevalent belief among scientists, that the entire body of Physics is a coherent and harmonious system of mechanical truth. Text-Books âThe Professor's Syllabus; Everett's Units and Physical Constants. For Reference.âEverett's Privat Deschanel; Jamin; Daguin. Senior Class.âThis class meets thrice each week, and studies Mathematical Physics and Astronomy. Text-Books.âCummings' Electricity; Bartlett's Acoustics and Optics. Norton's Astronomy, with Chauvenet's Astronomy for reference. Candidates for graduation in the school of Natural Philosophy are required to attend only the foregoing classes. II. Practical Physics. To meet the wants of students who may be preparing themselves to become teachers of science, and of those who, for other reasons, desire to push their studies in Physics beyond the limits of the lecture room course, the Visitors have recently instituted a special department with the above title, and have authorized a separate diploma of graduation to be given to such as exhibit proficiency in its exercises. The course of instruction in this class will be partly theoretical and partly experimental, embracing the following topics: A. Theoretical.âReduction of observations. Graphical representation of results. Interpolation. Method of Least Squares. Essays on prescribed Physical topics. B.

SCHOOL OF ANALYTICAL AND AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. Prof. Mallet. Adjunct Prof. Dunnington. In Analytical Chemistry there are three classes: I. The first class meets twice each week during the session, on each occasion spending from two to four hours in practical experiments in the laboratory. A regularly arranged course of practice in chemical manipulation is first pursued; qualitative analysis is then taken up, and the means of detecting the most important chemical substances having been learned, students are required to find out for themselves, by analysis, the constituents of materials presented to them. Special attention is given to substances having useful applications in the arts or connected with agriculture. Towards the close of the session, the elements of quantitative analysis is taught, as far as the limitation of time will permit. II. The laboratory will be open to the second class on six days of each week, during the whole of the working hours of each day. A full course of instruction in practical chemistry, including the qualitative and quantitative analysis of ores, soils, manures, technical products, etc., will be given; and students will be assisted and encouraged to undertake original research. III. The third class is one specially intended for students of medicine, and will meet for lessons of two hours each, twice in the week, for two months of the session. To this class the practical applications of chemistry to medicine will be taught, the detection of poisons, chemical and microscopical examination of animal products, urine, blood, etc. Among the works recommended to laboratory students are: Freseniusâ"Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis;" H.

Special lectures are given during this course on Insects injurious to Vegetation, Fish and Oyster culture, and the breeding, rearing, and diseases of Domestic Animals. The addition of the fine collection of Zoological specimens in the Brooks Museum largely increases the facilities for study in this branch. II. Botany includes a minute history of the structure, physiology and morphology of the plant, in embryo, root, stem, leaf, flower, fruit, and formation of seed. During this course, special lectures are given on Noxious Weeds and Useful Plants, and the Fungoid diseases of Plants. III. Agriculture.âThis course is divided into two partsâExperimental and Practical. 1. Experimental Agriculture has reference to the food of Plants in the Atmosphere and Soil; the formation, variety, classification and adaptation of soils to various crops, illustrated by suitable experiments. 2. Practical Agriculture relates to the Soil Cultivated, its nature, exposure and drainage; the importance of making Domestic Manures and their application; use of Fertilizers, with experiments, in order to show their effects. Tillage is illustrated practically on the farm, in plowing, subsoiling, harrowing, rolling, etc.; in preparing the soil for the reception of seed, as well as in the cultivation of Crops. Special instruction is given in regard to the practical management of teams, and in the various mechanical operations on the farm. The lectures in the three classes are delivered concurrently throughout the session, as far as practicable. The following Text-Books will be used in this school: "Manual of Zoology," Nicholson; "School and Field Book of Botany," Gray; "How Crops Grow," Johnson; "How Crops Feed," Johnson; "Scientific Agriculture," Pendleton. The following may be usefully referred to in connection with different parts of the course: Carpenter's "Zoology;" Harris' "Insects Injurious to Vegetation;" Chapman's "Flora of the Southern States;" "How to Farm Profitably," Mechi; "Muck Manual," Dana; "American Weeds and Useful Plants," Darlington. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF NATURAL HISTORY AND GEOLOGY. Prof. W. M. Fontaine, M. A. This school is divided into three classes, viz: Geology, Mineralogy and Botany. I. Geology.âThe subject of Geology will be taught during the entire session, and three lectures per week will be devoted to it. The aim of the course of instruction is to give as thorough an exposition of the fundamental principles of the science as possible, and to teach the student how to use them in practical work in the field. Special reference is made to the Geology of America. Text-Books.âThe Professor's Lectures, and Le Conte's Elements of Geology. For reference, Dana's Manual, and Lyell's Elements and Principles of Geology. II. Mineralogy.âThe subject of Mineralogy will be studied until the intermediate examination in February.

MALLET, Ph. D., M. D., Professor of Chemistry and Pharmacy. Text-Books.âFownes' Chemistry and Parrish's Pharmacy. WILLIAM B. TOWLES, M. D., Demonstrator of Anatomy. The Medical Department is organized on the same general plan as the other departments of the University, the distinctive features of which are comprehensiveness and thoroughness of instruction, and the graduation of the student upon satisfactory evidence of attainments only, without regard to the length of time he may have been attending the lectures. An experience of more than forty years has fully tested the excellence of the plan. The scholarship of the alumni of the institution, and the value of its degrees, are now freely conceded by cultivated and liberal men throughout the country. The Medical Department of the University aims at thorough work in its special province, to wit: the instruction of the student in the principles of medicine, and his discipline in the modes of acquiring and applying knowledge. Thus, whilst the only solid foundation of professional attainments is laid, the mental faculties are expanded and strengthened for that growth in knowledge, usefulness and distinction to which every one who enlists in an honorable and responsible profession should aspire. The organization and arrangements by which these aims are successfully accomplished may be briefly stated: ARRANGEMENT OF STUDIES. The length of the session (nine months) renders it convenient and eligible to distribute the subjects of instruction among a smaller number of Professors than in the other medical schools of the United States, whose sessions are only four or five months long. Thus, to one Professor is assigned Physiology and Surgery; to another, Human Anatomy and Materia Medica; to a third, Chemistry and Pharmacy; and to a fourth, Medical Jurisprudence, Obstetrics, and the Practice of Medicine. This distribution renders it practicable to bring the different subjects to the attention of the student in their natural and successive order. The arrangement of the lectures is such that he acquires a competent knowledge of Anatomy, Physiology and Chemistry, before he enters upon the study of the principles and practice of Medicine and Surgery, which can only be studied properly in the lights shed upon them by the former. The instructions in Materia Medica and Pharmacy are also given in due relation to the progress of the student in Chemistry. PHARMACY. The introduction of Pharmacy into the course of instruction is another feature of interest, serving, as it does, to initiate the student into an art which he will find of value when he comes to the practice of his profession. LECTURES AND DAILY EXAMINATIONS. Favored as the student is in the comprehensiveness, scientific basis and order of his studies, he is not less favored by arrangements which give ample time for the preparation of every lecture, and address motives to him for such preparation. Each professor gives three regular lectures a week, with occasional extra lectures, making the average weekly aggregate not over fourteen, or a little more than two a day. The student, therefore, is not over-burdened with lecture-room attendance. He has time for study in his private room, to consult books, and compare their teachings with the oral instructions of his Professor, and to digest and systematise his acquisitions from both sources. The daily examinations which precede every lecture supply the stimulus to regular and active study, serve as summary reviews of what he has already heard or read, and as correctives of any misconceptions he may have fallen into in his hearing or reading. The daily examinations constitute a very valuable part of the exercises of the Institution, and are taken into account in determining the fitness of a student for graduation. APPARATUS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. The equipment of the Medical Department in apparatus, specimens and drawings, is extensive and excellent. The collection of paintings for the illustration of the lectures on Anatomy, Physiology and Surgery, several hundred in number, is unequalled by anything of the kind in the United States, or perhaps abroad. PRACTICAL ANATOMY AND DISSECTION. The Department furnishes every facility for the study of practical Anatomy that can be furnished in similar institutions elsewhere. Adequate provision is made for the supply of subjects, and each student has the opportunity, by actual dissection under the guidance of the Demonstrator of Anatomy, of acquiring a practical knowledge of the structure of the human body in all its parts. DEGREES. The degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred upon such students as prove their fitness for the same by rigid and searching examination. It has ever been the policy of the Institution to make its honors testimonials of merit, and not certificates of attendance on a prescribed course of instruction. In accordance with this policy, the degree of Doctor of Medicine may be conferred on a first-course student if found worthy of it. Not only is it within reach of the intelligent, diligent and persevering to graduate in one session of nine months, but in point of fact many do thus graduate. LABORATORY COURSES FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS. In addition to the usual course of Medical Lectures, two special courses of instruction will be given by the Professor of Analytical Chemistry to such Medical Students as may desire to pursue them: 1st, Sixteen lessons in the practical applications of Chemistry to Medicine, (the detection of poisons, chemical and microsopic examination of animal products, urine, blood, etc.) 2nd, Fourteen lessons in practical pharmaceutical manipulations. Each of the above (optional) courses will be at a charge of $20 tuition fee, and $5 for laboratory material consumed. LAW DEPARTMENT. JOHN B. MINOR, LL. D., Professor of Common and Statute Law. STEPHEN O. SOUTHALL, LL. D., Professor of Civil, International, and Constitutional Law and Equity. This Department is organized with a view to acquaint the student FAMILIARLY AND PRACTICALLY with the principles of his profession. The instruction is as thorough as possible, and is given partly through textbooks and partly through lectures, with daily examination upon both. A Moot-Court, in connection with other instruction, tends to perfect the student in the details of practice. Under the immediate supervision of the professors, he is required to pronounce opinions upon supposed cases; to devise and institute remedies by suit or otherwise; to conduct suits at law and in equity from their inception through all their stages; to draw wills, conveyances, and other assurances; and in short, to perform most of the functions of a practising lawyer. The Department comprises two schools, each of which is divided into two classes, and the course of study is as follows: SCHOOL OF COMMON AND STATUTE LAW. Prof. John B. Minor, LL. D. Junior Class.âBlackstone's Commentaries. Minor's Institutes of Common and Statute Law, namely: Vol. I, The Rights which relate to the Person. Vol. II, The Rights which relate to Real Property. Vol. III, The Rights which relate to Personal Property. Senior Class.âStephen on Pleading. Minor's Institutes of Common and Statute Law, namely: Vol. IV, The Practice of the Law in Civil Cases, including Pleading; Minor's Synopsis of Criminal Law; Lectures on the Law of Executors. ? For reference, Virginia Code, (1873); Revised Statutes of United States. SCHOOL OF EQUITY, MERCANTILE AND INTERNATIONAL, CONSTITUTIONAL AND CIVIL LAW, AND GOVERNMENT. Prof. S. O. Southall, LL. D. Junior Class.âVattel's International Law, Lectures on Government, Federalist. Senior Class.âSmith's Mercantile Law; Greenleaf's Evidence; Adams' Equity, with Lectures. For reference, Stephen's Digest of the Law of Evidence. In the Department of Law, the degree of Bachelor of Law is conferred upon those who, upon examination conducted in writing, manifest an intimate acquaintance with the subjects taught in ALL THE CLASSES; and to those who, upon like examination, exhibit a competent knowledge of International and Constitutional Law, and of the Science of Government, a Certificate of Proficiency is awarded. In order to obtain the degree, the whole of the foregoing course must be completed HERE, no preliminary examination being had upon entering. The course is designed for two sessions, and in general it is not prudent to devote less to it, the future professional success of the student depending much upon his full mastery of it. It is a maxim sanctioned by long and wide experience, that "he who is not a good lawyer when he comes to the bar, will seldom be a good one afterwards." And in order to such thorough acquaintance with the elements of the law, thought is requisite as well as reading; and for the purpose of thought, there must be TIME to digest, as well as INDUSTRY to acquire. One cannot expect to gorge himself with law, as a boa constrictor does with masses of food, and then digest it afterwards; the process of assimilation must go on, if it is to proceed healthfully and beneficially, at the same time with the reception of the knowledge. So the athlete judges, who wishes to train the physical man to the most vigorous development, and the intellectual athlete cannot do better than imitate the example. But whilst the student is advised, as a general rule, to avoid the attempt to complete the course in a single session, yet, if he chooses to essay it (as some do successfully), he is admitted to stand the graduating examinations, and if he attains the standard required, he is entitled to his degree. The expenses of a Law student, as appears from page 54 of this Catalogue, amount to about $312 to $339 for a session of nine months, commencing 1st October; or if he messes, to about $280.50 per session. AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. JOHN R. PAGE, M. D., Professor of Zoology, Agricultural Botany and Agriculture. JOHN W. MALLET, Ph. D., M. D., LL. D., Professor of General and Applied Chemistry. FRANCIS P. DUNNINGTON, B. Sc., Adjunct Professor of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry. WILLIAM M. THORNTON, Adjunct Professor of Applied Mathematics and Engineering. The late Samuel Miller, of Lynchburg, having by deed given in trust one hundred thousand dollars for the establishment of a Department of Scientific and Practical Agriculture at the University of Virginia, the Trustees under this deed met the Rector and Visitors of the University on the 17th of September, 1869, and arrangements were made for putting the said department in operation. These arrangements have subsequently, by action taken at various times, been extended and added to, the above named Professors have been nominated by the Trustees of the "Miller Fund," and elected by the Board of Visitors of the University; certain lands belonging to the University have been set aside and brought into cultivation as an Experimental Farm; a machine for the manufacture of drain tiles has been imported from England, and put in operation; and implements, apparatus, models and specimens of various kinds have been collected as material aids to the course of instruction. In this, as in all the other departments of the University, entire freedom of choice is left to the student as to the schools he shall attend, and the order in which he shall attend them, and this choice will be influenced in individual cases by the nature and extent of previous preparation, as well as by difference of ulterior aim; but a student of average ability, who has already had a fair general education, and who comes to the University with the intention of devoting himself to a study of the principles upon which Agriculture is based, will probably do well to select for the first year Natural Philosophy, (Junior Class,) Chemistry (general), Zoology, Agricultural Botany and Agriculture, and Mineralogy and Geology; and for the second year Scientific and Practical Agriculture, Agricultural and Industrial Chemistry (including the first Laboratory class of Analytical Chemistry) and Agricultural Engineering. This arrangement of studies may with advantage be expanded to a course for three years, or may be varied by the selection of other Schools when deemed desirable. For the method of study in the respective Schools, reference should be made to the preceding pages of this Catalogue. Trustees of Miller Fund. J. F. SLAUGHTER, President. W. W. MINOR, S. W.

Any person of unexceptionable character and habits, upon producing to the Faculty satisfactory evidence of suitable capacity and attainments, will be licensed by the Faculty to form classes for private instruction in any school of the University, in aid of and in conformity to the public teachings of the Professor upon any subject taught therein. The employment, selection, and compensation of any such Licentiate is left to the option of the students.

The examinations are of three kinds: 1, the Daily examinations; 2, the Intermediate and Final general examinations; and 3, the examinations for Graduation. DAILY EXAMINATIONS. Each Professor, before commencing the lecture of the day, examines his class orally on the subject of the preceding lecture, as developed in the text-book and expounded in the lecture. GENERAL EXAMINATIONS. Two general examinations of each class are held during the session in the presence of a committee of the Faculty, which every student is required to stand. The first, called the intermediate examination, is held about the middle of the session, and embraces in its scope the subjects of instruction in the first half of the course. The second, called the Final examination, is held in the closing month of the session, and embraces the subjects treated of in the second half of the course. These examinations are conducted in writing. The questions propounded have each numerical values attached to them. If the answers of the student are valued in the aggregate at not less than three-fourths of the aggregate values assigned to the questions, he is ranked in the FIRST division; if less than three-fourths, and more than one-half, in the SECOND division; if less than one-half, and more than one-fourth, in the THIRD division; and if less than one-fourth, in the FOURTH division. Certificates of distinction are awarded to those who attain the first division at one or both of these examinations, and their names are published or announced in the closing exercises of the session. The general examinations are sufficiently comprehensive and difficult to render it impossible for the student, without steady diligence, to secure a place in the first division. The results, whatever they may be, are communicated to parents and guardians respectively in the final circular of the session. The standing of the student at the daily and general examinations is taken into account in ascertaining his qualifications for graduation in any of the schools. EXAMINATIONS FOR GRADUATION. The examinations for graduation are held in the last month of the session. They are conducted in each school by the Professor thereof, in the presence of two other Professors, forming with him the committee of examination for the school. The candidates for graduation are subjected to searching interrogations on the details and niceties as well as the leading principles of the subject, and they are expected to be accurately versed in all the topics treated of in the lectures and correlative text. These examinations are chiefly carried on in writing; but in some of the schools they are partly oral. As a proper acquaintance with the English language is indispensable to the attainment of any of the honors of the Institution, all candidates for graduation are required to exhibit in their examination due qualifications in this respect. DEGREES. The degrees conferred by the University are Academic and Professional. The Academic Degrees are: 1. That of Proficientâconferred for satisfactory attainments in certain subjects of study, to-wit: In Anglo-Saxon, the Junior and Intermediate Course of Mathematics, Geology, Mineralogy, Botany, Physics, Physiology, Medical Jurisprudence, Human Anatomy, Political Economy, History, Literature, International Law and Government, Pharmacy, and Agricultural Chemistry. 2. That of Graduate in a Schoolâconferred for satisfactory attainments in the leading subjects of instruction in the same, to-wit: In the Latin Language and Literature, in the Greek Language and Literature, in the French, German, Spanish, or Italian Language and Literature, Mixed Mathematics, Pure Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Practical Physics, Moral Philosophy, History and Literature, Applied Mathematics, Analytical Chemistry, General Chemistry, Industrial Chemistry, Zoology, Agricultural Botany and Agriculture, and Natural History and Geology. 3. That of Bachelor of Lettersâconferred upon such students as have graduated in the Schools of Ancient and Modern Languages, Moral Philosophy, and History, Literature and Rhetoric. 4. That of Bachelor of Scienceâconferred on such students as have graduated in the Schools of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, General Chemistry, and Natural History and Geology, attained distinction in the Junior Class of Applied Mathematics, and made satisfactory attainments in the first Laboratory class of Analytical Chemistry. 5. That of Bachelor of Artsâconferred on such students as have made satisfactory attainments in the Senior Classes of Greek and Latin; in the Intermediate Class in Pure Mathematics and in Moral Philosophy; obtained certificates in Physics and in History, or Literature and Rhetoric; and graduated in Chemistry and in French or German. 6. That of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia, conferred upon students who have graduated in the Latin, Greek, French and German Languages, Pure Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, General Chemistry, Moral Philosophy, and History, Literature and Rhetoric, and who have been subjected in the last year of their candidacy to a special examination, in any two schools of their own selection, in which they may have graduated in a previous year. The candidate for the degree of Bachelor or Master of Arts is also required to submit for the approval of the Faculty an essay, composed by himself, on some subject of Literature or Science, which essay must be read by the author on the Public Day, if so ordered. The Professional Degrees are: 1. That of Bachelor of Lawâconferred for satisfactory attainments in all the subjects of instruction in the Schools of Law. 2. That of Doctor of Medicineâconferred for satisfactory attainments in all the subjects of instruction in the several schools constituting the Medical Department. Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine who have been previously declared graduates in General Chemistry, or proficients in Anatomy, Physiology, or Medical Jurisprudence, are not required to stand the examinations in these subjects anew; and the same rule applies to candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Law who are proficients in International Law and Government. 3. That of Civil Engineerâconferred on such students as have graduated in the schools of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry or Industrial Chemistry, obtained Certificates of Proficiency in Mathematics and in Geology and Mineralogy, and graduated in the School of Applied Mathematics, course of Civil Engineering, with satisfactory attainments in a prescribed course of the Infinitesimal Calculus. 4. That of Mining Engineerâconferred on such students as have graduated in the Schools of Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry, obtained Certificates of Proficiency in Physics, in Geology and Mineralogy, and in Mathematics, and graduated in the School of Applied Mathematics, course of Mining Engineering, with satisfactory attainments in a prescribed course on the Infinitesimal Calculus. JEFFERSON MEDAL. The Board of Visitors of the University, in honor of its illustrious founder, have established a gold medal, to be entitled the "Jefferson Medal," and to be awarded to the most distinguished student of those who in each session shall take the degree of Master of Arts, under the following conditions: 1. When a number of students take the degree of M. A., it shall be the duty of the Faculty, in full session, after a thorough discussion of the merits of all the competitors, to decide which (if any) is entitled to the medal. But if there be but one student taking the degree of M. A., it shall still be competent for the Faculty to award this medal if deserved. 2. No one shall receive this medal except for high attainments, systematic habits of study, combined with the essential qualifications of good deportment and elevated character. PUBLIC DAY. On the closing day of the session, which occurs on the Thursday before the 4th day of July, the Visitors, Faculty, Officers and Students of the University assemble in the Public Hall, whither also the friends of the students and the public generally are invited. On this occasion the results of the examination are announced, certificates and diplomas awarded, and addresses delivered by the Bachelors and Masters of Arts. EXPENSES. 1. The charges common to all classes of students, if two occupy the same room, are as follows: Matriculation and Library Fee, $30 00 Diplomas, 7 50 Room-Rent, 15 00 Infirmary Fee, 7 50 $60 00 Contingent Deposit, $10 00 Fuel and Lights, about 13 50 Washing, about 13 50 $97 00 The contingent deposit is designed to cover any assessments that may be made against the student during the session for violation of the rules of the library, damage to books, room, etc. The residue is refunded to the student on the settlement of his account at the close of the session. 2. Tuition. The tuition fee in each of the Academic Schools is $25; in Applied Mathematics, $50; in Law, $80; in Medicine, $110; in Practical Physics, $50, with a charge of $10 for outfit. The fees for students of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry are as follows: First Laboratory Class, $50, with $10 for materials. Second Laboratory Class, 100, with 25 for materials. Third Laboratory Class, 20, with 5 for materials. Practical Pharmacy, 20, with 5 for materials. Each laboratory student (except students of Pharmacy) is required to furnish himself with the more common and generally necessary articles of apparatus. The cost of a suitable set need not exceed $15. Laboratory students may attend, without additional charge, the course of lectures on Agricultural Chemistryâthe fee to others is $15. The tuition fees of Academic students attending three schools (the usual number attended in one session) amount to $75; of Law students to $80; of students of Civil Engineering, attending three schools, to $100; and of Medical students, to $110. 3. Board. There are two large boarding houses within the precincts of the University, at which the cost of board, including diet, furniture of room, and attendance, is $18 per month. Besides these, there are several licensed boarding houses in the immediate vicinity, at which the charges are from $15 to $18 per month. There are also two messes within the precincts of the University instituted by the Faculty, and under the control of the Chairman. The affairs of the mess are administered by a superintendent appointed by the Chairman. The accounts of the superintendent are audited monthly by a committee, consisting of the President and two other members of the mess, before being presented to the Proctor for payment. The expense of board to each member of the mess is a deposit of $5 with the Proctor for outfit of mess-halls, and a monthly charge of $10 for diet and servant's attendance, with fuel and lights for mess-halls. Furniture for lodging-room, with fuel and lights, cost $1.50 a month. Board, at $11.50 a month in the Mess, including fire, furniture and attendance, for nine months, $103 50 Matriculation, etc, 97 00 $200 50 Board, at $15 a month, in licensed boarding-house, including fire, furniture and attendance, for nine months, $135 00 Matriculation, etc., 97 00 $232 00 Board, at $18 a month, in boarding-house within the precincts, including fire, furniture and attendance, for nine months, $162 00 Matriculation, etc., 97 00 $259 00 4 Total Expenses, exclusive of Books, Clothing, and Pocket-Money, for Nine Months. Mess. Boarding-houses. At $11.50 a month. At $15. At $18. For Academic Students, 3 schools, $275 50 $307 00 $334 00 For Law Students, 2 schools, 280 50 312 00 339 00 For Engineering Students, 3 schools, 300 50 332 00 359 00 For Medical Students, 4 schools, 310 50 342 00 369 00 5. Mode of Payment. All the foregoing items are payable in advance, except board and washing. One-third of the board is required on admission, and the balance in equal instalments, at three and six months thereafter. Washing is paid for monthly. To secure rooms in the University buildings, application may be made by letter to the Proctor; but if the rent is not deposited with him before the 15th of September, the room is considered to be unengaged. MESSING. Apply to the Chairman of the Faculty for further information upon the subject of messing, which has been in successful operation during several sessions. Over eighty students have been messing in two distinct messes in different locations within the precincts. Boarding Houses near the University. Dr. Chancellor's; Mrs. Emerson's; Mrs. McKennie's; Miss Pace's; Mrs. Garth's; Mrs. Smith's; Mrs. Smithson's. REGULATIONS LATE ENTRANCE AND WITHDRAWAL. No abatement is made in the matriculation, tuition fees and room rent, on account of late entrance, unless the student enter after the first of January, and no portion of the same is refunded on account of withdrawal from the University before the close of the session, unless the withdrawal be rendered necessary by ill health, and occur before the first of March. The charges for board, fuel, lights, and washing, are estimated from the time of entrance. Many disadvantages to the student result from late entrance; therefore prompt attendance at the beginning of the session is earnestly enjoined upon all who wish to derive the full benefits of the course of instruction. PROHIBITION OF CREDIT. An act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting students. The license to contract debts, which the chairman is authorized to grant, is confined (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing,) to cases of urgent necessity; and these, it is hoped, parents and guardians will as far as possible prevent from arising by the timely supply of the requisite funds. PRIVILEGED STUDENTS. Ministers of the Gospel may attend any of the schools of the University without the payment of tuition fees. The same privilege will be extended to any young man preparing for the ministry, on condition that he shall submit testimonials that he is a bona fide candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet the expenses of education at the University without aid. LIBRARY. Wm. Wertenbaker, Librarian. F. W. Page, Assistant Librarian. The Library of the University, originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, and since enlarged by purchases and donations, now contains about 36,000 volumes. Valuable additions are made from the donation of $1,000 per annum for five years by W. W. Corcoran, Esq., of Washington, D. C. Students are allowed the use of the books under the usual restrictions, and the librarian is present in the library for four hours daily, to attend to their wants. Persons at a distance, who may desire to consult this library by correspondence, can do so on payment of a small charge, proportioned to the time and labor expended on the research required, copying of titles or passages from authors, &amp;c. A letter on this subject, prepaid, and addressed to Frederick W. Page, Esq., Assistant Librarian, will receive attention. BROOKS MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY. This Museum consists of well-selected cabinets of Zoology, Mineralogy and Geology, arranged in a handsome building, erected for the purpose, according to the plans of a competent architect. They furnish ample means of illustration in their several departments. The building and its various cabinets are the gift of the late Mr. Lewis Brooks, of New York. A Botanical collectionâwhich formed a part of the original plan of Mr. Brooks, but had not been provided for before his deathâhas been presented by his brothers, the Rev. Lemuel Brooks and Mr. Garey Brooks, of New York, and is now in its proper place in the Botanical Hall. INFIRMARY. There is a well-appointed infirmary connected with the University for the care and comfort of sick students. Every student on admission deposits the infirmary fee, ($7.50,) which entitles him, in case of sickness during the session, to the advice and attention of the infirmary physicians, (Professors in the Medical Department,) and if necessary, to nursing by professional nurses, without additional charge. LITERARY SOCIETIES. There are two Literary Societies (the "Washington Society" and the "Jefferson Society") of long standing connected with the University. They meet weekly in their respective halls for the purpose of cultivating debate and composition, and occasionally hold public exhibitions. DISCIPLINE. Morality and Religion are recognized as the foundation and indispensable concomitants of education. The discipline of the University is seduously administered with a view to confirm integrity and to maintain a sacred regard for truth. Great efforts are made to surround the students with religious influences; but experience has proved that the best way to effect this result is to forbear the employment of coercion; the attendance on religious exercises is therefore entirely voluntary. Prayers are held every morning in the chapel, and divine service is performed twice on Sunday by a chaplain, selected in turn from the principal religious denominations. YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. This society seeks to bring new students under good influences, and furnishes opportunities for Christian work in the University and its neighborhood. It has been in active operation many years, and has recently established the STUDENTS' UNIVERSITY READING ROOM. This is convenient of access, comfortably arranged and furnished, and supplied with a large selection of the best periodical literature. It is open to all members of the University upon the payment of a small fee to meet its current expenses. FRIENDS OF TEMPERANCE. The Friends of Temperance are represented by University Council, No. 46, an association which has done good service in guarding young men against dangerous excesses, and in promoting literary and moral culture. MONTHLY CIRCULAR. At the end of every month a circular letter is addressed by the Chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from lectures and examinations, and any other irregularities of which he may have been guilty, together with such further information as to the student's progress and conduct as it may be deemed proper to communicate, or as the parent or guardian may specially request. The object of such reports being, on the one hand, to incite the student to steady diligence, by eliciting the commendation and encouragement of his friends; and, on the other, to restrain him from idleness and disorder, or to urge him to amendment by their admonition and advice; their usefulness greatly depends upon the prompt and judicious attention they receive from those to whom they are addressed. Parents and guardians, therefore, cannot be too earnest in communicating such advice or encouragement as the monthly reports may suggest. UNIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIPS. Eleven Scholarships, entitling the successful candidates at a competitive examination to prosecute their studies for one session at the University of Virginia without the payment of matriculation fees or tuition fees, will be open to new-comers from all the States at the beginning of the next academic year (October 1st). Of these eleven Scholarships five are in the Academic Department, and two each in the departments of Law; of Medicine; and of Industrial Chemistry, Civil and Mining Engineering and Agriculture. The examination is uniform, and embraces Latin, Greek, Mathematics, and English. In order to secure positive attainments the right is reserved to reject any papers that do not reach the standard required for distinction at the Final Examination in Junior Latin, Junior Greek, and Junior Mathematics, and do not show a competent acquaintance with the grammatical and rhetorical structure of the English language. VIRGINIA STUDENTS. Under a late act of the Legislature, students from Virginia over eighteen years of age are, on examination, admitted into the Academic Schools without being required to pay tuition fees therein. The expenses of such students, exclusive of text-books, clothing, and pocket-money, will beâ For those who board, from $232 to $259. For those who mess, $200.50. By authority of the General Assembly, the following regulations have been adopted by the Board of Visitors as to the General and Special Examinations for admission of Virginia students into the University: General Examination. Applicants are required to pass, once for all, to entitle them to matriculation, on their first coming to the University, an examination in the English language and in Arithmetic. In English, they will be required to show both a practical knowledge of the language, as proved by orthography and by correctness in composition, and a theoretical knowledge of the inflections and Syntax. In Arithmetic, they will be required to know the elementary processes, Vulgar and Decimal Fractions, Proportion, and the metric system of Denominate Numbers. Special Examinations. After passing the General Examination, the Virginia students who desire to study Latin, Greek, Mathematics, or History and Literature, will be required to pass the following Special Examinations for each school: I. For admission to the School of Latinâthe full knowledge of the Inflections of the language will be rigorously demanded; besides this, acquaintance with the elementary principles of Syntax, and ability to translate any passage from Books I and II of CÃ¦sar's Commentaries, or from Cicero's four orations against Catiline. II. For admission to the School of Greekâa full and exact knowledge of the Attic Inflections, especially of the verb, will be rigorously demanded; besides this, acquaintance with the elementary principles of Syntax, and ability to translate any passage from the first two books of Xenophon's Anabasis. III. For admission to the School of Mathematicsâthe knowledge of Algebra, embracing the fundamental operations, simple and quadratic equations, proportion, and the first three books of Plane Geometry. IV. For admission to the School of History and Literature: For the Class of HistoryâModern Geography, and an Elementary History of Greece, Rome, the United States, or England; for the Class of Literatureâan Elementary History of England. For admission to the other Academic Schools, not specified above, only the General Examination will be required. The preparation required for the advanced classes, Intermediate or Senior, in the several schools, is shown by the courses laid down in the Catalogue. The examinations of Academic Students from Virginia, over eighteen years of age, for admission under the late act of the Legislature, will be held on the 27th, 28th, 29th, and 30th of September. All students that intend to apply for examination under the law are urged to report themselves promptly to the Chairman of the Faculty before the beginning of the session, (1st of October). Those that come later, after the work of the session has begun, will of necessity be subjected to inconvenience and delay. The time of the special examinations will be fixed by the several professors, each for his own school. The Faculty of the University, prompted by their experience of the preliminary examinations of the present session, wish most earnestly to call the attention of the public, and especially of their brother teachers in Virginia, to the importance of accuracy and thoroughness in the elements of education, especially in English orthography and composition, in elementary geography and history, in arithmetic, and in the inflections of the classical languages. Students that are well grounded in these elementary studies can do well from the first, and can advance themselves steadily from class to class; but looseness and inaccuracy of knowledge in these lead only to prolonged and disheartening failure. The stress of the preliminary examinations will, therefore, be laid upon accuracy in elementary knowledge. Note.âIn the Schools of Greek and Mathematics, young men are advised to prepare themselves at least for the intermediate classes. DONATIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. Under an act of the Legislature, entitled "A bill to encourage donations to the University of Virginia, and to constitute the State of Virginia the trustee thereof," "any person may deposit in the treasury of this State, or bequeath money, stock, or public bonds of any kind, to be so deposited, or grant, devise, or bequeath property, real or personal, to be sold, and the proceeds to be so deposited, in sums not less than one hundred dollars, which shall be invested in certificates of debt of the State of Virginia, or of the United States, or any other State thereof, for the benefit of the University of Virginia; and in such case the interest or dividend accruing on such stock, certificates of debt or bonds, shall be paid to the Rector and Visitors of the University, to be by them appropriated to the general purposes thereof, unless some particular appropriation shall have been designated by the donor or testator as hereinafter provided.______________The State of Virginia is hereby constituted the trustee for the safekeeping and due application of all funds which may be deposited in the treasury in pursuance of this act." The legal title of the University isâ "The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia." ENDOWMENT OF PROFESSORSHIPS AND SCHOLARSHIPS THROUGH THE SOCIETY OF ALUMNI. Under an act of the Legislature, entitled "A bill to incorporate the Society of Alumni of the University of Virginia," this Society is authorized, by its Executive Committee, or in such other way as it may direct, "to raise the sum of five hundred thousand dollars, to be held in the name of the `Society of Alumni of the University of Virginia,' to be safely invested, and the net annual income therefrom to be applied to the benefit of the University of Virginia." It is also empowered "to employ agents to obtain endowments for scholarships and professorships, to solicit donations, to dispose of anything of any value belonging to the Society or entrusted to its management for the purpose of endowing professorships or scholarships, or for accomplishing any of the other objects of the Society authorized by its charter."
