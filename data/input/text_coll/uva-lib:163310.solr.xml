      <field name="fulltext">COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. In establishing the University of Virginia, Mr. Jefferson, for the first time in America, threw open the doors of a University, providing for thorough instruction in Independent Schools in all the chief branches of learning. The system assumes that the opportunities it presents are privileges to be voluntarily and eagerly sought, and it therefore allows students to elect for themselves the departments to which they are led by their individual tastes and proposed pursuits in life. This freedom of election commends itself particularly to those who desire to make special attainments in some one department of knowledge. At the same time the courses of academical study are so arranged as to provide for the systematic prosecution of a complete plan of general education. The wisdom of the founder has been amply vindicated by time and experience; and of late many institutions of higher education in the United States have, to a greater or less extent, remodeled their methods in accordance with this example. The Courses of Instruction are Academical and Professional. The former are comprised in two Departments, the Literary and the Scientific; the latter, in the four Departments of Medicine, Law, Engineering, and Agriculture. In the several Departments there are altogether nineteen distinct Schools, each affording an independent course under a Professor, who gives the instruction, generally by lectures, and conducts the examinations, and who alone is responsible for its system and methods. Among these Schools, without regard to the Departments, the student is at liberty to elect those he may wish to attend, limited only in respect of lectures occurring at the same hours, and by a regulation concerning the number of Schools to be attended by academical students.</field>

Text-Books.âThe Professor's Psychology, Hamilton's Metaphysics, Calderwood's Moral Philosophy, Ueberweg's History of Philosophy. GRADUATE COURSES. School of Latin.âA class is formed of students who have graduated in the School, and who desire a wider acquaintance with Latin than is implied in graduation. Authors not embraced in the regular course are read and closely studied. Special attention is given to translation; and a prominent feature of the lecture-room exercises is the discussion by members of the class of the text translated. The vocabulary acquired by extensive translation is frequently applied in rendering into Latin passages of English selected for the purpose. School of Greek.âThis course is designed primarily for students who are making a professional study of Greek philology. With such students the Professor will read and discuss the more difficult Greek authors. Extensive courses of reading in the Greek authors, and in selected text-books (English, German, or French) are assigned as subjects for examination. Incessant practice in Greek composition is given. Two theses, one in English and one in Latin, on subjects belonging to Greek philology, are required as evidence of power to do original work. Competent students who do not seek distinction at the examination of this course, but simply desire to enlarge their knowledge of Greek Literature, will be guided in their reading, and regularly instructed by the Professor. LITERARY DEPARTMENT. School of Modern Languages.âGraduates and others who may wish to continue the study of any one of the modern languages or of Anglo-Saxon beyond the customary limits, or who may aim at attaining the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, will in this School read additional authors in the language selected, study the science of language, and be trained to write essays, giving proof of original research. To do this successfully a certain amount of knowledge in the ancient, and at least of two modern languages, will be required. Candidates for honors will be given the choice between pursuing the study of linguistique with the help of such works as Hovelacque's, Diez', Sayce's and others, or of thoroughly studying one or more idioms from their origin to the period of highest perfection. They will thus be led to compare the languages belonging to certain families, like the Romance, Germanic or Slavic, either with each other, or with other families, according to their lexical or psychological peculiarities. School of English.âIn this School two separate graduate courses will be arranged to suit the needs of those students who desire to pursue further either philological or literary studies. The former will comprise the further study of Anglo-Saxon and Early English works, especially Anglo-Saxon poetry, or the study of Gothic and the comparative grammar of the Teutonic languages. The latter will comprise the study of some distinctive period in English literature, or of some particular writer, or writers, including the political, social, and literary characteristics of the age under consideration. In each course a thesis will be required, giving evidence of independent private study of some subject cognate with the course pursued, in addition to such examinations on the course as may be advisable. School of Historical Science.âThe graduate course in this School for the Degree of doctor of Philosophy will be varied from year to year, but will always be designed to train the student in original research and systematic exposition of the results. Some historical period, with the accompanying social, political and intellectual development of the people, will be made the subject of study. Such instructions and directions as may be required to render these pursuits efficacious will be given throughout the session. School of Moral Philosophy.âThe history of philosophy, ancient and modern, with a special study of Aristotle and Kant. SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. CHARLES S. VENABLE, LL. D., Professor of Mathematics. FRANCIS H. SMITH, M. A., LL. D., Professor of Natural Philosophy. JOHN W. MALLET, Ph. D., M. D., LL. D., F. R. S., Professor of Chemistry. F. P. DUNNINGTON, B. Sci., Adj.

This course is designed for those students who may desire to prosecute their studies beyond the limits of the Pure Mathematics. It embraces applications of the Differential and Integral Calculus to selected portions of Mechanics, Physics, and Physical Astronomy. There is one class in Mixed Mathematics. Text-Book:âPrice's Infinitesimal Calculus, Vols. III and IV. The instruction in each class in the School of Mathematics is conveyed partly by lectures and partly by the systematic study of approved text-books. The progress of the student in each class is tested by his being required to perform written exercises, in which the principles acquired are applied to the solution of selected problems. Any student entering the School has the privilege of attending all or any of the classes, and if prepared to enter an advanced class, may often find it highly advantageous to review his previous studies by attendance on a lower class also. SCHOOL OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. Prof. Smith. This School includes two courses: I. General Physics. Junior Class.âThe Junior Class meets three times in each week. The object of the course of lectures to this class is to furnish the student with a comprehensive view of modern Physics, and to make him familiar with its methods of investigation. With the design of laying a thoroughly scientific basis for the course, a large space is given at the outset to the discussion of the cardinal doctrines of motion, force, energy, and potential, and to their simpler applications in the pressure and motion of visible masses. SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. With this preparation the student proceeds to the subject of Molecular Physics, embracing Sound, Light, Heat, and Electricity. Throughout the course the established laws of motion and force are kept steadily in view, and an attempt is made to exhibit the evidence, daily becoming stronger and clearer, for the belief prevalent among scientists that the entire body of Physics is a coherent and harmonious system of mechanical truth. Text-Books:âThe Professor's Syllabus; Everett's Units and Physical Constants. For reference:âTreatises by Clerk Maxwell; Jamin; Daguin. Senior Class.âThis class meets thrice each week, and studies Mathematical Physics and Theoretical Astronomy. The parts of Physics studied are usually Sound and Light one session, and Heat and Electricity the next. Text-Books:âCummings' Electricity; Everett's Wave Motion; Bartlett's Optics; Norton's Astronomy. Candidates for graduation in the School of Natural Philosophy are required to attend only the foregoing classes. II. Practical Physics. To meet the wants of students who may be preparing themselves to become teachers of science, and of those who, for other reasons, desire to push their studies in Physics beyond the limits of the lecture room course, the Visitors have instituted a special course with the above title, and have authorized a separate diploma of graduation to be given to such as exhibit proficiency in its exercises. The course of instruction in this class will be partly theoretical and partly experimental, embracing the following topics: 1st. Theoretical.âReduction of observations. Graphical representation of results. Interpolation. Method of Least Squares. Essays on prescribed Physical topics. 2nd. Experimental.âIn this, the main portion of the course, the student will learn physical manipulation, and the use of instruments by actual practice.

The course in General Chemistry consists of three lectures a week throughout the session. The fundamental ideas of chemical science, the relations of Chemistry to Physics, the laws regulating chemical combination by weight and by volume, the atomic theory as at present viewed in connection with Chemistry, the chemical nomenclature and symbols now in use, and a general survey of the descriptive chemistry of the elements and their compounds, inorganic and organic, are brought forward in order, with incidental allusion to the applications in medicine, the arts and manufactures, of the facts mentioned. Text-Books:âFownes' Chemistry, (last edition.) For reference:- Miller's Elements of Chemistry; A. Naquetâ"Principes de Chimie fondÃ©e sur les thÃ©ories modernes." II. The course in Industrial Chemistry, in which also three lectures a week are delivered, investigates in detail the chemical principles and processes specially concerned in the more important arts and manufactures, upon which, in large measure, depends the development of the natural resources of the country, the opportunity being thus presented of preparation for such positions as those of the miner and metallurgist, the chemical manufacturer, the dyer, bleacher, tanner, sugar refiner, etc. Text-Books:âWagner's Chemical Technology. For reference:âRichardson and Watt's Chemical Technology; Muspratt's Chemistry as Applied to Arts and Manufactures; Ure's Dictionary of Arts and Manufactures; Girardinâ"LeÃ§ons de Chimie ElÃ©mentaire appliquÃ©e aux Arts Industriels;" Percy's Metallurgy, etc. The lectures in both these courses are illustrated by suitable experiments, and by such specimens, models, drawings, etc., as the various subjects require. The collections of the University in illustration of the processes and products of Industrial Chemistry have been procured with SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. much expense and pains in this country, England, France and Germany, and are unusually extensive and goodâamongst the best on this side of the Atlantic. (See page 56.) SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT.3 SCHOOL OF ANALYTICAL AND AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. Prof. Dunnington. Instruction in this School is given in the two following courses: I. In Analytical Chemistry, while the chief portion of the teaching is necessarily individual, there are three classes: The first class meets twice a week during the session, on each occasion spending from three to four hours in practical experiments in the laboratory. A course of practice in chemical manipulation is first pursued. This is followed by a systematic course of qualitative analysis, including blowpipe analysis, and the elements of fire assaying. Toward the close of the session, the elements of quantitative analysis are taught as far as the limitation of time will permit The second class, in addition to the work of the first class given above, pursues an extended course of quantitative analysis, determining the composition of ores, minerals, clays, soils, building-stones, manures, technical products, and like substances, and involving a full course of instruction in practical chemistry. Members of this class have access to the laboratory daily during working hours, and are assisted and encouraged to undertake original research. The third class is specially intended for students of medicine (see page 40). Among the works recommended to laboratory students are: Freseniusâ"Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis;" Greville Williamsâ"Handbook of Chemical Manipulation;" Woehlerâ"Examples for Practice in Chemical Analysis;" Von Kobellâ "Tafeln zur Bestimmung der Mineralien" (also in English translation); Odlingâ "Practical Chemistry for Medical Students;" A. Classenâ"Elementary Quantitative Analysis." Besides the above, there is also a class in Practical Pharmacy, specially intended for medical students (see page 40). II. In Agricultural Chemistry there is one class, to which lectures are SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. delivered once a week throughout the session; or, when found more convenient to students of Agriculture, a larger number of lectures a week will be given during a part of the year only. In this course the chemical and physical properties of soils, of the atmosphere, and of plants, chemistry of the processes of vegetable life and growth, the composition and chemical preparation of manures, etc., will be discussed. Text-Books:âJ. F. W. Johnston and C. A. Cameron "Elements of Agricultural Chemistry and Geology" (12th edition). For reference: S. W. Johnsonâ"How Crops Grow," and "How Crops Feed;" N. T. Lupton -"Elementary Principles of Scientific Agriculture." Farmers who are not regular students of the University, but may desire to attend this special course, are freely invited to do so. Very liberal provision for this School has been made in the way of material arrangements. The laboratory building is of ample size, specially designed for the purpose of working students, contains all necessary rooms, and is amply supplied with gas, water and all proper laboratory fixtures; and all needful apparatus, chemicals, minerals, materials for analysis, etc., are imported from Europe in abundance. (See page 56.) CORCORAN SCHOOL OF NATURAL HISTORY AND GEOLOGY. Prof. Fontaine. In this School are three classes: Geology, Mineralogy, and Botany. I. Geology.âThe subject of Geology will be taught during the entire session, and three lectures per week will be devoted to it. The aim of the course of instruction is to give as thorough an exposition of the fundamental principles of the science as possible, and to teach the student how to use them in practical work in the field. Text-Books:âThe Professor's Lectures, and Le Conte's Elements of Geology. For reference:âDana's Manual, and Lyell's Elements and Principles of Geology. II. Mineralogy.âThe subject of Mineralogy will be studied until the intermediate examination in February. Two lectures per week will be devoted to it. Special attention will be paid to crystallography, as well as to the chemical and physical properties of minerals. In Descriptive SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. Mineralogy, the mode of occurrence, the geological importance and relations of the species will be made prominent. Text-Books:âThe Professor's Lectures, and Dana's Manual of Mineralogy and Lithology. For reference:âDana's Text-Book of Mineralogy. III. Botany.âFor the present Botany is transferred to the School of Agriculture, Zoology and Botany. (See page 47.) The excellent collections of Geological, Mineralogical, and Botanical specimens in the Lewis Brooks Museum of Natural History (see page 55), afford facilities for the study and illustration of the principles taught. The lectures on Geology and Mineralogy end the last of April, when field explorations begin, and continue two months. Persons engaged in the study of Geology and Mineralogy, though not members of the University class, can, with the leave of the Professor, and on paying $25 to the Proctor, join the exploring party. SCHOOL OF PRACTICAL ASTRONOMY. Prof. Stone. Besides the general fundamental principles of Spherical and Practical Astronomy and Celestial Mechanics, instruction in this School embraces the theory of meridian and equatorial instruments, and the instruments subsidiary thereto, the methods of determining time, latitude and longitude, the methods of determining right ascensions and declinations, the formation of star catalogues, the use and construction of ephemerides, the computation of elliptic and parabolic orbits and of special perturbations, together with the auxiliary subjects of interpolation, mechanical quadrature, and the method of least squares. Throughout the course systematic training is given in numerical computation, and in the use of astronomical instruments, and students are expected to engage in such original work as their time and attainments will permit. Only in exceptional cases will students be able to complete the course in less than two years. Text-Books:âChauvenet's Spherical and Practical Astronomy; Oppolzer's Lehrbuch zur Bahnbestimmung; Gauss' Theoria Metus. SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. N.

School of General and Industrial Chemistry.âThe principal part of the graduate course will consist of practical laboratory work on subjects of original investigation; advanced reading may also be prescribed, especially in the shape of the bibliography of particular topics, to be looked up from various sources and condensed by the student. School of Natural History and Geology.âIn this School no fixed course of study will be laid down for graduates. Subjects will be selected from one or more of the branches included in the School, and assigned to the students. As far as possible, original research will be required in the treatment of the subjects chosen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. JAMES L. CABELL, M. D., M. A., LL. D., Professor of Physiology and Surgery. JOHN STAIGE DAVIS, M. D., M. A., Professor of Anatomy and Materia Medica. JAMES F. HARRISON, M. D., Professor of Medicine, Obstetrics, etc. J. W. MALLET, M. D., Ph. D., F. R. S., Professor of Chemistry and Pharmacy. WILLIAM B. TOWLES, M. D., Demonstrator of Anatomy. The Medical Department of the University aims at thorough work in its special province, to wit: the instruction of the student in the principles of medicine, and his discipline in the modes of acquiring and applying knowledge. Thus, whilst the only solid foundation of professional attainments is laid, the mental faculties are expanded and strengthened for that growth in knowledge, usefulness and distinction to which every one who enlists in an honorable and responsible profession should aspire. The organization and arrangements by which these aims are successfully accomplished may be briefly stated as follows: ARRANGEMENT OF STUDIES. The length of the session (nine months) renders it practicable and convenient to distribute the subjects of instruction among a smaller number of Professors than in other medical schools of the United States, whose sessions are only four or five months long. This distribution brings the different subjects to the attention of the student in their natural and successive order. The arrangement of the lectures is such that he acquires a competent knowledge of Anatomy, Physiology and Chemistry before he enters upon the study of the principles and practice of Medicine and Surgery, which can only be studied properly in the light of the former. The instructions in Materia Medica and Pharmacy are also given in due relation to the progress of the student in chemistry. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. SCHOOL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND SURGERY. Prof. Cabell. Text-Books:âDalton's Physiology; Wilson's Manual of Hygiene and Sanitary Science, Fourth Edition, 1880; Green's Pathology; Ashurst's Surgery; Saterthwaite's Histology. SCHOOL OF ANATOMY AND MATERIA MEDICA. Prof. Davis. Text-Books:âWilson's or Gray's Anatomy; Farquharson's Materia Medica. N. B.âThis School furnishes every facility for the study of Practical Anatomy that can be found in similar institutions elsewhere. Adequate provision is made for the supply of subjects, and each student has the opportunity, by actual dissection under the guidance of Doctor Towles, Demonstrator of Anatomy, of acquiring a practical knowledge of the structure of the human body in all its parts. SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, OBSTETRICS, AND MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE. Prof. Harrison. Text-Books:âTaylor's Medical Jurisprudence (last edition); Playfair's with Roberts' Midwifery (last edition); Roberts' Practice of Medicine (last edition); Hartshorne's Essentials. SCHOOL OF CHEMISTRY AND PHARMACY. Prof. Mallet. For the course in General Chemistry, see page 33. Throughout the course the attention of medical students is particularly drawn to the physiological, medical and sanitary relations of the subject. A special course of lectures on Pharmacy is given, beginning soon after the intermediate examinations. Text-Books:âFowne's Chemistry; Parrish's Pharmacy. N. B.âIn addition to the above, two special courses of instruction will be given by the Professor of Analytical Chemistry, as follows: MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. 1st, Sixteen lessons in the practical applications of Chemistry to Medicine; as, the detection of poisons, chemical and microscopic examination of animal products, urine, blood, etc. 2nd, Fourteen lessons in practical pharmaceutical manipulations. APPARATUS AND ILLUSTRATION. The equipment of the Medical Department in apparatus, specimens and drawings, is extensive and excellent. The collection of paintings for the illustration of the lectures on Anatomy, Physiology and Surgery, several hundred in number, is unequalled by anything of the kind in the United States, or perhaps abroad. LECTURES AND EXAMINATIONS. Favored as the student is in the comprehensiveness, scientific basis and order of his studies, he is not less favored by arrangements which give ample time for the preparation of every lecture, and address motives to him for such preparation. Each Professor gives three regular lectures a week, with occasional extra lectures, making the average weekly aggregate not over fourteen, or a little more than two a day. The student, therefore, is not over-burdened with lecture-room attendance. He has time for study in his private room, to consult books, and compare their teachings with the oral instructions of his Professor, and to digest and systematize his acquisitions from both sources. The daily examinations which precede every lecture supply the stimulus to regular and active study, serve as summary reviews of what he has already heard or read, and as correctives of any misconceptions he may have fallen into in his hearing or reading. The daily examinations constitute a very valuable part of the exercises of the Institution, and are taken into account in determining the fitness of a student for graduation. DEGREE. The degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred upon such students as prove their fitness for the same by rigid and searching examination. It has ever been the policy of the Institution to make its honors testimonials of merit, and not merely certificates of attendance on a prescribed course of instruction. (See p. 52.) EXPENSES. The expenses of a medical student are from $333 to $369. (See page 53.) LAW DEPARTMENT. JOHN B. MINOR, LL. D., Professor of Common and Statute Law. STEPHEN O. SOUTHALL, LL. D., Professor of International and Constitutional Law, Equity, etc. This Department is organized with a view to acquaint the student familiarly and practically with the principles of his profession. The instruction is as thorough as possible, and is given partly through textbooks and partly through lectures, with daily examination upon both. A Moot-court, in connection with other instruction, tends to perfect the student in the details of practice. Under the immediate supervision of the Professors, he is required to pronounce opinions upon supposed cases; to devise and institute remedies by suit or otherwise; to conduct suits at law and in equity from their inception, through all their stages; to draw wills, conveyances, and other assurances; and in short, to perform most of the functions of a practising lawyer. The Department comprises two Schools, each of which is divided into two classes, and the course of study is as follows: SCHOOL OF COMMON AND STATUTE LAW. Prof. Minor. Junior Class:âMinor's Institutes of Common and Statute Law, namely: Vol. I, The Rights which Relate to the Person. Vol. II, The Rights which Relate to Real Property. Minor's Synopsis of Criminal Law. Blackstone's Commentaries. Senior Class:âMinor's Institutes of Common and Statute Law, namely: Vol. IV, The Practice of the Law in Civil Cases, including Pleading. Vol. III, The Rights which Relate to Personal Property. Stephen on Pleading. For reference:âVirginia Code (1873); Revised Statutes of United States. LAW DEPARTMENT. SCHOOL OF INTERNATIONAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, MERCANTILE LAW, EVIDENCE, AND EQUITY. Prof. Southall. Junior Class:âVattel's International Law, with Lectures; Lectures on Government, Federalist. Senior Class:âSmith's Mercantile Law; Greenleaf's Evidence; Adams Equity, with Lectures. For reference:âStephen's Digest of the Law of Evidence. In the Department of Law, the degree of Bachelor of Law is conferred upon those who, upon examination conducted in writing, manifest an intimate acquaintance with the subjects taught in all the classes; and to those who, upon like examination, exhibit a competent knowledge of International and Constitutional Law, including the Science of Government, a Certificate of Proficiency is awarded. In order to obtain the degree, the whole of the course must be completed here, no preliminary examination being had upon entering. The course is designed for two sessions, and in general it is not prudent to devote less to it; the future professional success of the student depending much upon his full mastery of it. It is a maxim sanctioned by long and wide experience, that "he who is not a good lawyer when he comes to the bar, will seldom be a good one afterwards." And in order to such thorough acquaintance with the elements of the law, thought is requisite as well as reading; and for the purpose of thought, there must be time to digest, as well as industry to acquire. One cannot expect to gorge himself with law, as a boa constrictor does with masses of food, and then digest it afterwards; the process of assimilation must go on, if it is to proceed healthfully and beneficially, at the same time with the reception of the knowledge. So the athlete judges, who wishes to train the physical man to the most vigorous development, and the intellectual athlete should imitate the example. But whilst the student is advised, as a general rule, not to attempt to complete the course in a single session, yet, if he chooses to essay it (as some do successfully,) he is admitted to the graduating examinations, and if he attains the standard required, he is entitled to the degree. The expenses of a Law student are from $303 to $339 for the session; books will cost about $80 additional. (See page 53.) DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. W. M. THORNTON, Adj. Professor of Mathematics Applied to Engineering. CHARLES S. VENABLE, LL. D., Professor of Mathematics. FRANCIS H. SMITH, M. A., LL. D., Professor of Natural Philosophy. JOHN W. MALLET, Ph. D., M. D., LL. D., F. R. S., Professor of Chemistry. F. P. DUNNINGTON, B. Sc., Adj. Professor of Analytical Chemistry. WM. M. FONTAINE, M, A., Professor of Natural History and Geology. This Department is designed to furnish intending engineers thorough and practical instruction in the principles of Engineering and the sciences connected therewith. For this purpose, in addition to the Schools of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and Natural History and Geology, already existing in the University, there have been organized (since 1867) the Schools of Analytical Chemistry, and of Mathematics Applied to Engineering. For the first five Schools the courses of instruction are given in detail in the Scientific Department. SCHOOL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS. Prof. Thornton. The courses of this School are arranged as follows: I. Civil Engineering. Junior Class:âProjective Geometry, Engineering Geodesy, Engineering Construction, Lines of Communication. Senior Class:âElementary Mechanics, Resistance of Materials, Stability of Structures, Hydraulic Engineering. II. Mining Engineering. Junior Class:âProjective Geometry, Engineering Geodesy, Engineering Construction, Exploitation of Mines. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. Senior Class:âElementary Mechanics, Resistance of Materials, Mechanics of Machines, Theory of Prime Movers. Instruction in the foregoing subjects is conveyed by a course of systematic lectures, combined with assiduous practice in the field and at the drawing-board, continued throughout the course. In the lecture course, after careful elucidation of fundamental principles, the rules of construction are deduced, and applied to the criticism of existing structures and the design of proposed works. In the field course the adjustments and use of the instruments are carefully taught, and the student, after a thorough drill in the methods of measuring and estimating lengths, altitudes, and angles, is required to execute for himself surveys of lands, buildings, and topography; to locate lines for railways, highways, and canals; and to set out curves, earthworks and masonry. In the course of design the easy and accurate use of pen and brush is first acquired by exercises in projective and topographic drawing. The student is then required, from assigned data, to compute the dimensions of proposed structures, and on the basis of his computations to prepare bills of material, and general and detailed drawings of the works; to draw up specifications and furnish estimates of cost in accordance with prices current. To facilitate the instruction in this department, the University has provided a commodious and well-lighted lecture room and drawing hall, a liberal supply of field instruments of the best construction, and models and drawings of a large variety of structures, illustrating the best practice of modern engineers, American and foreign. Note.âApplicants for Degrees in Engineering (see p. 52) should possess an accurate knowledge of the elements of Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry. With such preparation the following arrangement of studies, leading to the Degrees of C. E. and M. E. respectively, is recommended: Degree of C. E.âFirst Year:âJunior Applied Mathematics, Chemistry, Mathematics. Second Year:âSenior Applied Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Mineralogy and Geology. AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. Degree of M. E.âFirst Year:âJunior Applied Mathematics, General Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics. Second Year:âSenior Applied Mathematics, Industrial Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry, Mineralogy and Geology. The annual expenses of students of Civil Engineering are from $325 to $360; those of students of Mining Engineering from $390 to $425; according to the price paid for board. Virginia students in this department, over eighteen years old, who have passed the requisite entrance examinations pay no tuition (see p. 62), except in Applied Mathematics and Analytical Chemistry. AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. JOHN R. PAGE, M. D., Professor of Agriculture, Zoology and Botany. FRANCIS H. SMITH, M. A., LL. D., Professor of Natural Philosophy. JOHN W. MALLET, Ph. D., M. D., LL. D., F. R. S., Professor of Chemistry. F. P. DUNNINGTON, Adj. Professor of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry. WM. M. FONTAINE, M. A., Professor of Natural History and Geology. W. M. THORNTON, Adj. Professor of Mathematics Applied to Engineering. The late Samuel Miller, of Lynchburg, having by deed given in trust one hundred thousand dollars for the establishment of a Department of Scientific and Practical Agriculture in the University of Virginia, the Trustees, under this deed, met the Rector and Visitors of the University on the 17th of September, 1869, and arrangements were made for putting the said department in operation. These arrangements have subsequently, by action taken at various times, been extended and added to; the above-named Professors have been nominated by the trustees of the Miller Fund, and elected by the Board of Visitors of the University; certain lands belonging to the University have been set aside, and AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. brought into cultivation as an Experimental Farm; a machine for the manufacture of drain tiles has been imported from England; and implements, apparatus, models and specimens of various kinds have been collected as material aids to the course of instruction. In this, as in all the other Departments of the University, entire freedom of choice is left to the student as to the Schools he shall attend, and the order in which he shall attend them; and this choice will be influenced in individual cases by the nature and extent of previous preparation, as well as by difference of ulterior aim; but a student of average ability, who has already had a fair general education, and who comes to the University with the intention of devoting himself to a study of the principles upon which Agriculture is based, will probably do well to select for the first year Natural Philosophy (Junior Class), Chemistry (general), Zoology, Agricultural Botany and Agriculture, and Mineralogy and Geology; and for the second year Scientific and Practical Agriculture, Agricultural and Industrial Chemistry (including the first Laboratory Class of Analytical Chemistry) and Agricultural Engineering. This arrangement of studies may, with advantage, be expanded to a course for three years, or may be varied by the selection of other Schools when deemed desirable. For the plan of study in the respective Schools, reference may be made to the preceding pages. The degree of Bachelor of Scientific Agriculture is conferred in this department (see page 53.) Trustees of the Miller Fund. J. F. SLAUGHTER, President. W. W. MINOR, S. V. SOUTHALL, S. W. FICKLIN, H. W. JONES, GEO. W. PALMER, B. JOHNSON BARBOUR. R. T. W. DUKE, Secretary. AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. MILLER SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE, ZOOLOGY, AND BOTANY. Prof. Page. In this School are three classes: I. Agriculture; divided into two courses, Scientific and Practical. 1. The Scientific course comprises a review of what is known of the chemical composition, the structure and the functions of the organs of plants; and of the atmosphere and soil, as related to vegetable production. 2. The course on Practical Agriculture comprises the study of the nature and formation of soils; their exposure and drainage; the best methods of tillage; and the use of manures and fertilizers, with experiments to show their effects. Special instruction is given in the mechanical operations of the farm, and in the practical management of teams. This class is continued throughout the whole session. II. Zoology.âThis class studies the leading principles of the science, with special reference to the anatomy, physiology and morphology of typical species throughout the animal kingdom. Special lectures are given during this course on insects injurious to vegetation, on fish and oyster culture, and on the breeding, rearing, and diseases of domestic animals. The fine collection of Zoological specimens in the Brooks Museum affords excellent facilities for study of the science. The class is continued until the examination, about the middle of March. III Botany.âThis class commences about the middle of March, and continues until the end of the session. The time is mainly devoted to the study of flowering plants, their analysis and determination. Cryptogamic Botany, especially fungi and fungoid diseases of plants, receive as much attention as possible. Text-Books.â"How Crops Grow," and "How Crops Feed," by Johnson; "Scientific Agriculture," by Pendleton: "Manual of Zoology," by Nicholson; "School and Field Book of Botany," by Gray. For reference:âCarpenter's Zoology; Harris' Insects Injurious to Vegetation; Mivart's Comparative Anatomy; "Flora of the Southern States," by Chapman; Armsby on "Cattle Feeding," and Law's Veterinary Adviser.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">4 EXAMINATIONS. The examinations are of three kinds, viz:â1, The Daily examinations; 2, the General examinations; 3, the examinations for Graduation. DAILY EXAMINATIONS. Each Professor, before commencing his lecture, examines his class on the subject of the preceding lecture, as developed in the text-book and expounded in the lecture. GENERAL EXAMINATIONS. Two general examinations of each class are held during the session in the presence of a committee of the Faculty, which every student is required to stand. The first, called the Intermediate Examination, is held about the middle of the session, and embraces in its scope the subjects of instruction in the first half of the course. The second, called the Final Examination, is held in the closing month of the session, and embraces the subjects treated of in the second half of the course. These examinations are conducted in writing. The questions propounded have each numerical values attached to them. If the answers of the student are valued in the aggregate at not less than three fourths of the aggregate values assigned to the questions, he is ranked in the FIRST division; if less than three-fourths, and more than one-half, in the SECOND division; if less than one-half and more than one fourth, in the THIRD division; and if less than one-fourth, in the FOURTH division. Certificates of distinction are awarded to those who attain the first division at one or both of these examinations, and their names are published or announced at the closing exercises of the session. The general examinations are sufficiently comprehensive and difficult to render it impossible for the student, without steady diligence, to secure a place in the first division. The results, whatever they may be, are communicated to parents and guardians respectively in the final circular of the session. EXAMINATIONS. EXAMINATIONS FOR GRADUATION. The examinations for graduation are held in the last month of the session. They are conducted in each School by the Professor, in the presence of two other Professors, forming with him the committee of examination for the School. The candidates for graduation are subjected to searching interrogations on the details and niceties as well as on the leading principles of the subject, and they are expected to be accurately versed in all the topics treated of in the lectures and correlative text. These examinations are chiefly carried on in writing; but in some of the Schools they are partly oral. The standing of the student at the daily and general examinations is taken into account in estimating his qualifications for graduation in any of the schools. As a proper acquaintance with the English language is indispensable to the attainment of any of the honors of the institution, all candidates for graduation are required to exhibit in their examination due qualifications in this respect.

One-third of the board is payable at the beginning of the session, and the remainder in two equal instalments, at three and six months thereafter. Washing is paid for monthly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EQUIPMENTS. LIBRARY. The Library of the University, originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, and since much enlarged by purchases and donations, now contains about 40,000 volumes. LEWIS BROOKS MUSEUM. The Lewis Brooks Museum contains collections illustrating the subjects of Geology, Mineralogy, Zoology and Botany. Each of the collections is selected so as to exemplify the principles of these sciences, and, at the same time, to exhibit a large variety of objects for the study. Its primary object is to serve as an aid in teaching Natural History. In Geology the collections are large and well selected. The specimens of rocks show all the different kinds classified according to mineral character, and the formations in which they occur. The collection of fossils, plaster casts, maps, etc., etc., is exceptionally fine, and fully illustrates Historical Geology. In Mineralogy the principles of the science are made plain by well-chosen suits of specimens, models of crystals, etc., etc. The general collection of minerals contains all the important minerals, and many of the rarer ones, in good specimens. The science of Zoology is well illustrated by a fine and large collection of objects, such as mounted skeletons, stuffed animals, dried specimens, plaster casts, etc., etc. In Botany the collections contain charts, papier-machÃ© models of flowers, fruits, sections of wood, etc., etc. The bulk of the collection is in the form of an herbarium selected from the most important and interesting botanical regions of the world. In addition to the above, a beginning has been made of a collection to illustrate the geology and mineralogy of the State, and this will be increased as rapidly as possible. LEANDER McCORMICK OBSERVATORY. The Astronomical Observatory, now building on the University grounds, the Institution owes to the munificence of Leander J. McCormick, Esq., of Chicago. It will contain the great refracting telescope EQUIPMENTS. of 26Â½ inches aperture, constructed for Mr. McCormick by Alvan Clark &amp; Sons, and given by him to the University. When completed, the Observatory will be fitted with the working apparatus of the best modern observatories. The directorship has been endowed with the sum of $50,000 by friends of the University; and an additional sum of $25,000, given to the Institution by Wm. H. Vanderbilt, Esq., of New York, has been invested, that the income may form a working fund for the Observatory. (See p. 36.) CHEMICAL LABORATORY. A building planned and erected for the purpose is exclusively used as a chemical lecture-room and laboratory. It is completely fitted with the most approved appliances, and stocked with apparatus, models, materials and specimens. The commodious lecture-room, with work and store rooms attached, is provided with every convenience for exhibiting a complete series of experiments illustrating the lectures on General Chemistry. The large room assigned to Analytical Chemistry will accommodate fifty working students, and is furnished with work tables, gas, water and all proper laboratory fixtures; and all requisite apparatus, chemicals, minerals, materials for analysis, etc, are kept constantly supplied by home purchase and importation. MUSEUM OF INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY. This Museum contains a very large number of specimens, collected at much expense and pains in this country, England, France and Germany, illustrating the products and processes of Chemistry applied to the Arts and Manufactures, and so arranged as to be a most valuable aid to the student of Industrial Chemistry. (See p. 33.) PHYSICAL LABORATORY. A suitable room has been assigned to this objeet by the Board of Visitors. The needful fittings have been partly provided, and its thorough equipment will be pushed forward as rapidly as funds for the purpose can be obtained. (See p. 32.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCHOLARSHIPS. UNIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIPS. Eleven scholarships, entitling the successful candidates at a competitive examination to prosecute the studies of one session at the University of Virginia without the payment of matriculation or tuition fees, are open to new-comers from all the States at the beginning of the academic year (October, 1st). Of these eleven scholarships five are in the Academic Department, and two severally in the Departments of Law, of Medicine, and of Civil and Mining Engineering. The examination is uniform, and embraces Latin, Greek, Mathematics, and English. In order to secure positive attainments the right is reserved to reject any papers that do not reach the standard required for distinction at the Final Examination in Junior Latin, Junior Greek, and Junior Mathematics, and do not show a competent acquaintance with the grammatical and rhetorical structure of the English language. The subjects of examination in Latin, Greek and Mathematics for these scholarships will be found under the head "Junior Class" of those Schools. For more precise information, apply to the Professors. In addition to the foregoing, the Visitors, in September, 1882, founded three free scholarships, to be called the Corcoran Scholarship, the McCormick Scholarship, and the Vanderbilt Scholarship. MILLER SCHOLARSHIPS. There are three scholarships in the Agricultural Department, named for its founder.. These scholarships are bestowed on competitive examination, and the emolument from each is $333.33. For information as to subjects of examination, apply to the Professors. TEMPERANCE SCHOLARSHIP. The Temperance Union bestows a scholarship annually on some student-member of the Union. ALUMNI SCHOLARSHIPS. The appointments to these rest with the persons who founded them, or with the Executive Committee of the Society of Alumni.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SOCIETIES. LITERARY SOCIETIES. There are two Literary Societies of long standing, the Washington Society and the Jefferson Society, connected with the University. They meet weekly in their respective halls for the purpose of cultivating debate and composition, and hold public exhibitions at intervals during the session, and at its close. Each Society bestows medals on its best debaters, and the two Societies in conjunction give a medal to the best writer in the University Magazine, which is maintained by them. YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. This society seeks to guard new students from evil influences, and furnishes opportunities for Christian work in the University and its neighborhood. It has been in active operation many years. It has established and maintains the STUDENTS' READING ROOM. This is convenient of access, comfortably arranged and furnished, and supplied with a large selection of the best periodical literature. It is open to all members of the University upon the payment of an annual fee of $4.00 to meet its current expenses. TEMPERANCE UNION. The Temperance Union of the University of Virginia is an association which does good service in guarding young men against dangerous excesses, and in promoting literary and moral culture. SQUIBB GYMNASIUM ASSOCIATION. Founded upon a liberal gift from R. E. Squibb, M. D., of Brooklyn, N. Y., for the promotion of physical culture. RIVES BOAT CLUB. Founded upon a liberal gift from F. R.

      <field name="fulltext">REGULATIONS. ADMISSION. To be admitted as a student of the University, the applicant must be at least sixteen years of age; but the Faculty may dispense with this requirement in favor of one who has a brother of the requisite age entering at the same time. If the applicant for admission has been a student at any other incorporated seminary, he must produce a certificate from such seminary, or other satisfactory evidence of general good conduct. NUMBER OF SCHOOLS. An academical student must attend at least three Schools, unless upon the written request of his parent or guardian, or for good cause shown, the Faculty shall allow him to attend a less number. EXCHANGE OF SCHOOLS. Students are permitted to exchange Schools, with transfer of fees, within one week after admission. Thereafter no exchange is allowed except by leave of the Faculty, and then without transfer of fees. ENTRANCE AND WITHDRAWAL. No abatement is made in the matriculation or tuition fees or room rent, on account of late entrance, unless the student enter after the first of January, and no portion of the same is refunded on account of withdrawal from the University before the close of the session, unless the withdrawal be rendered necessary by ill health. The charges for board, fuel, lights, and washing, are estimated from the time of entrance. Many disadvantages to the student result from late entrance; therefore prompt attendance at the beginning of the session is earnestly enjoined upon all who wish to derive from the course of instruction the full benefit. RENT OF ROOMS. To secure rooms in the University Buildings, application may be made by letter to the Proctor; but if the rent is not deposited with him before the 15th of September, the room is considered to be unengaged. PRIVILEGED STUDENTS. Ministers of the Gospel may attend any of the Schools of the University without the payment of tuition fees. The same privilege will be extended to any young man preparing for the ministry, on condition that he submit testimonials that he is a bona fide candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet the expenses of education at the University without aid. MONTHLY CIRCULAR. At the end of every month a circular letter is addressed by the Chairman of the REGULATIONS. Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from lectures and examinations, and any other irregularities of which he may have been guilty, together with such further information as to the student's progress and conduct as it may be deemed proper to communicate, or as the parent or guardian may specially request. The object of such reports being, on the one hand, to incite the student to steady diligence, by eliciting the commendation and encouragement of his friends, and, on the other, to restrain him from idleness and disorder, or to urge him to amendment by their admonition and advice, their usefulness greatly depends upon the prompt and judicious attention they receive from those to whom they are addressed. Parents and guardians, therefore, cannot be too earnest in communicating such advice or encouragement as the monthly reports may suggest. LICENTIATES. Any person of unexceptionable character and habits, upon producing to the Faculty satisfactory evidence of suitable capacity and attainments, will be licensed by the Faculty to form classes for private instruction in any School of the University, in aid of and in conformity to the public teachings of the Professor upon any subject taught therein. The employment, selection, and compensation of such Licentiate is left to the determination of the students. PROHIBITION OF CREDIT. An act of the legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting students. The license to contract debts, which the Chairman is authorized to grant, is confined (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing), to cases of urgent necessity; and these, it is hoped, parents and guardians will, as far as possible, prevent from arising by the timely supply of the requisite funds. DISCIPLINE AND RELIGIOUS WORSHIP. Morality and Religion are recognized as the foundation and indispensable concomitants of education. The discipline of the University is sedulously administered with a view to confirm integrity, and to maintain a sacred regard for truth. Great efforts are made to surround the students with religious influences; but experience has proved that the best way to effect this result is to forbear the employment of coercion; the attendance on religious exercises is therefore entirely voluntary. Prayers are held every morning in the chapel, and divine service is conducted twice on Sunday by a Chaplain, selected in turn from the principal religious denominations. USE OF LIBRARY. Students are allowed the use of the books under the usual restrictions, and the librarian is present in the library for four hours daily, to attend to their wants. Persons at a distance, who may desire to consult the library by correspondence, can do so on payment of a small charge, proportioned to the time and labor expended on the research required, copying of titles, or passages from authors, etc. A letter on this subject, addressed to Wm. A. Winston, Librarian, will receive attention. INFIRMARY. There is a well-appointed Infirmary connected with the University for the care and comfort of sick students. Every student on matriculation deposits the infirmary fee REGULATIONS. ($7.50), which entitles him, in case of sickness during the session, to the advice and attendance of the infirmary physicians (the Professors in the Medical Department), and, if necessary, to nursing by professional nurses, without additional charge. VIRGINIA ACADEMICAL STUDENTS. By act of the General Assembly of the State of Virginia, approved February 26, 1876, the University "shall educate all students of the state of Virginia, over the age of eighteen, who shall be matriculated under rules and regulations prescribed by the board of visitors, without charge for tuition in the academic department, consisting of the following schools, to-wit: the schools of Greek, Latin, history and literature, moral philosophy, modern languages, natural philosophy, natural history and agriculture, general and industrial chemistry, and pure mathematics: provided, that no person shall be admitted as a student, free of charge for tuition fees under the provisions of this act, unless the faculty shall be satisfied by actual examination of the applicant, or by a certificate of some college or preparatory school, that he has made such proficiency in the branches of study which he proposes to pursue as will enable him to avail himself of the advantages afforded by this university." Virginia students wishing to avail themselves of the advantages provided by this enactment will apply to the Chairman of the Faculty for more detailed information. DONATIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY. Under an act of the Legislature, entitled "A bill to encourage donations to the University of Virginia, and to constitute the State of Virginia the trustee thereof, "any person may deposit in the treasury of this State, or bequeath money, stock, or public bonds of any kind, to be so deposited, or grant, devise, or bequeath property real or personal, to be sold, and the proceeds to be so deposited, in sums not less than one hundred dollars, which shall be invested in certificates of debt of the State of Virginia, or of the United States, or any other State thereof, for the benefit of the University of Virginia; and in such case the interest or dividend accruing on such stock, certificates of debt or bonds, shall be paid to the Rector and Visitors of the University, to be by them appropriated to the general purposes thereof, unless some particular appropriation shall have been designated by the donor or testator as hereinafter provided.âThe State of Virginia is hereby constituted the trustee for the safekeeping and due application of all funds which may be deposited in the treasury in pursuance of this act." The legal title of the University isâ "The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia." ENDOWMENTS BY THE SOCIETY OF ALUMNI. Under an act of the Legislature, entitled "A bill to incorporate the Society of Alumni of the University of Virginia," this Society is authorized, by the executive Committee, or in such other way as it may direct, "to raise the sum of five hundred thousand dollars, to be held in the name of the `Society of Alumni of the University of Virginia,' to be safely invested, and the net annual income therefrom to be applied to the benefit of the University of Virginia." It is also empowered "to employ agents to obtain endowments for scholarships and professorships, to solicit donations, to dispose of anything of value belonging to the Society, or entrusted to its management for the purpose of endowing professorships or scholarships, or for accomplishing any of the other objects of the Society authorized by its charter."</field>
