      <field name="fulltext">THE A. L. A. IN SIBERIA LETTERS WRITTEN BY HARRY CLEMONS, REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION WAR SERVICE, WITH THE A. E. F. IN SIBERIA</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Full Permission to Reprint is Given to the Press Press of Judd &amp; Detweiler, Inc. Washington, D. C.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FOREWORD IT was a happy circumstance for the Library War Service with the A. E. F. in Siberia that a man like Harry Clemons was available in such convenient proximity. Mr. Clemons had had considerable experience at Wesleyan University and at Princeton University (at Princeton he had been successively instructor in English, Jacobus Fellow, and Reference Librarian, from 1904 to 1912). Since the spring of 1913 he had been in the Far East as professor of English and Librarian in the University of Nanking. His friends at Nanking give such report of him as "It is difficult to speak in moderation of the work which Clemons has accomplished for the University"; "Mr. Clemons has done an appalling amount of work . . . inspiring students with his own high ideals and his own correctness in the use of English." Genius for English and library work, and "appalling" industry are characteristics familiar enough to his friends and former colleagues at Wesleyan and at Princeton and among the most obvious to the reader of this collection of reports. The collection consists of the letters and cablegrams sent to headquarters of the Library War Service from December 6, 1918, to May 18, 1919, together with an extract from a letter to Mrs. Clemons, kindly copied and forwarded by her to the Library War Service as an illustration of some of the difficulties of the work in Siberia where, Mr. Clemons remarks, "long" means time even "more than distance." The work of editing has been of the simplest sort—the material has been treated as making up a historical document of the Library War Service in Siberia. Consequently the text is fairly complete; achievements, difficulties, pleasant association and co-operation, and the lack of co-operation, have all been left to appear at their best and at their worst. The brief omissions are: (1) military and quasi-military information; (2) personal matters, such as salary arrangements— only enough of this has been left to show the slow and complicated processes by which money, particularly salary, as well as most other things, "got through"; (3) a certain amount of repetition and occasional fullness of exposition not necessary in particular passages when the series of reports is to be read as a whole; and necessarily excluded from a pamphlet of limited dimensions. As the editing was more or less a formal matter in dealing with the content, so it was almost to the merest comma. To Mr. Clemons' "correct use of English" may be added all such matters as punctuation and capitals, and all this in spite of the fact that these routine matters of administration were recorded in full detail, and in handwriting at that—the last letter speaks of the promised Corona typewriter as not yet arrived. The finished character of the work as a document is accompanied by a literary finish and characteristic bits of humor not usually to be expected in reports. "With money in yen and sen and roubles and kopecks, your representative in Siberia hath feelings of an addled brain," ends up an intricate financial exposition before the reader's interest begins to lag. "Thus do we introduce the short story into the long Siberian night" would relieve even the Siberian night of the dryest statistical report. The suggested sign for the periodicals pile, "All is not literature that litters," would cheer the most despondent camp librarian in a deluge of periodicals, and "War unfits a man for the sterner pursuits of life" could almost console an enlisted stay-at-home. And so on. The report to the Commanding General shows the activity as well as the activities of the A. L. A. Library War Service in Siberia; how, in five months, one man was able to handle some ten thousand volumes (plus 10 boxes, 194 parcels, 75 mail sacks, not counting discarded magazines), unpacking, censoring, sorting, cataloguing, and repacking; to distribute and organize these into a system of over fifty branches scattered all the way from the Yangtse Valley to no one knows how far towards the German frontier (not to mention gift distribution); and at the same time to act as reference department and superintendent of no inconsiderable circulation; and, on top of all this, to produce, in slow, longhand manuscript, and in spite of obstacles like frozen ink, etc., a series of reports of real historical value and among the chief literary "by-products" of the Library War Service. H. B. VAN HOESEN, Assistant Librarian, Princeton University Library. June 5, 1919.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THE A. L. A. IN SIBERIA LETTERS OF HARRY CLEMONS 6 December, 1918. . . . Perhaps I had better begin epistolary communication by certain commentaries on the cablegrams. I regret that the matter of salary has been mentioned so often. I was willing to take without demur whatever you might have decided upon as a proper salary. I must admit that I did not have much fear of the results, for since I came to China I have been receiving a missionary salary. Up to the present I have not received the two thousand dollars which you reported as cabled. . . . I was able to carry on, however, because the University advanced five hundred dollars Mexican and the Red Cross in Shanghai advanced the cost of an outfit such as they supply their doctors, the cost of passage on the steamer from Shanghai to Vladivostok, and some money for expenses en route. As I could not arrange for the proper A. L. A. insignia in Shanghai, I was forced to request by cable from Nagasaki that you send it from Washington. The Japanese couldn't find A. L. A. in Webster's Dictionary, so I had to write American Library Association in full. I was pleased that the words are long. . . . Your message of "27 November, 1918" states "Am cabling London send twenty-five hundred A. L. A. books Archangel." I find here that communications with Archangel are just at present well nigh impossible; at least, it would mean several weeks, probably several months en route, and large expenses. . . . Several cases of books were received by this expedition from you months ago. Apparently others have come from Miss Polk in Manila since then. The cases received here have been distributed widely through the interest and energy of Captain Moore, the Morale Officer of the Expedition. My first work is apparently to locate these books, find out the methods of use, arrange for exchanges, and generally study the possibilities for camp libraries in this expedition. I must fit myself with as little friction as possible into an already existing organization. I have been here some three days, and there are still two or three things that I do not know! But I am inclined to believe that tact, time and patience, and a bit of travelling must be at the top of my programme for a while. The places where books can be used are very much scattered. I have located ten different collections in use in the neighborhood of Vladivostok so far, and expect to start for three other places a little further out tomorrow. You see the records of the distribution have come to me rather casually, by word of mouth. The methods of putting the books into use vary also. In some cases no records have been kept, in others the records are elaborate. One regiment has made the A. L. A. books a part of the regimental library, and the Colonel has himself worked out an excellent plan for exchange among his scattered detachments. This plan has not yet been put into effect, because the regimental library has just been started and there is not yet a sufficient number of volumes. But in a fortnight the library, as it now exists at the location of the largest detachment, has had a large use. The regimental library idea will probably prevent exchange with outside organizations, which are fairly numerous, but it will mean location of the books in the barracks and under regimental supervision. In view of the scattered and uncertain conditions here, the erection of any library buildings seems to me not desirable. Among the non-regimental organizations—headquarters, hospitals, engineers—a system of exchanges can readily be instituted, as soon as I have some new cases for distribution. At Headquarters I yesterday learned that thirteen cases had been sent recently from Manila. When these arrive I ought to be able to get things moving finely; and also to reach several detachments that have not yet had any books. Captain Moore recently received from the chaplain of a regiment along the line the following comment: "The books you sent are without exception the best collection for soldiers I have ever seen. But every book, except atlases and encyclopedias, which we do not let out, was gone in twenty-four hours after the library was opened and men calling for more. We do not want more than our share, but we really need more." To this excerpt may be added three notes from my brief chance of observation. First, you are to be congratulated very heartily indeed on the selection of books in the cases. The comments on this point have been expressed in various ways—one or two officers have even assured me that they could not have done better themselves—but the conclusion has been quite unanimous. Second, the books have been used very much. I have heard of a whole barracks full of men off duty stretched out quietly and contentedly reading the evening after a case of books had been opened. Yesterday I found that a case had reached a squad of American engineers. The lieutenant in charge of the books had recorded the use of each in a big folio blank book. From October 24th to November 6th, from about eighty volumes there had been three hundred and thirty loans. At one or two places I was assured that "the men have read them all." Third, the effect on the morale is hard to judge accurately, of course, but it certainly exists. I have enjoyed receiving assurances from some of the privates on this point. And one lieutenant informed me that the opening of the camp library in his company immediately cut down, more than half, the requests for evening leave. The war is over, the winter is here, men and officers are comfortably housed; the camp libraries have an unusual opportunity for service. I have been located at the officers' quarters at the Base, and have been receiving most courteous and helpful treatment. 10 December, 1918. Yesterday and today I have found four new places where books have been distributed. The largest collection was of 300 volumes, shelved in a Y. M. C. A. hut and canteen. There were just sixteen books on the shelves, the others being in circulation! The cards had been used in this case, and I found that the cards recorded an average use of fully ten loans per volume. The men were reading everything in sight. I have now located fourteen collections in use in the neighbourhood of Vladivostok. One of these collections is divided into six parts and another into four parts, the parts being located at different points. This makes twenty-two locations. There is perhaps one more in this vicinity, and there are two or three detachments that have no books. I have heard of four locations out along the railway—the letter from a regimental chaplain quoted before being from one of these— and books have gone with intelligence officers some way inland. . . . The work here has already started; and perhaps a policy of adaptation to an existing organization and of pushing rather than pulling will succeed better than a policy of aggressive reorganization. I should like to have extra cards in quantity, some ink, and, if possible, letter paper and envelopes. 15 December, 1918. At the beginning of this week I seemed at a loss how to proceed. However, I learned at the office of the Chief of Staff that a letter had recently been received there from Miss Mary Polk of Manila stating that a dozen or so boxes of books and periodicals had been sent by transport from the Philippines. So I started after these, ran into a mesh of red tape, and after some patient unwinding—during which I received most courteous treatment—I reached the following results—which make up my report for the week:— Location and Stock on Hand:—I have a medium-sized room for storage in a warehouse at the Base. The room is opposite the Base Post Office. Out of another warehouse I dug twenty-four boxes and three parcels, containing a few books and a welter of periodicals. These were moved to my store-room and opened—except in the case of a box marked for a detachment along the line. The result is the first stage of a mobilization of most of the periodicals in the East. It is chaos. I have considered topping it with a banner, "All is not literature that litters." Many of the contents have nor rhyme nor reason. Ancient financial and commercial journals, a run of "The Bowler's Magazine," periodicals for children, "The Ladies' Home Journal," "Butterick's Patterns," "The Delineator," "The Mother's Magazine," "Good Housekeeping," "The Woman's Homely Companion"—what is one to do with these? There are comparatively few books, but many of them are coverless, worm-eaten, decrepit. Yet in this chaff there is some fine grain. And I am greatly gladdened at the chance I now have for a wide distribution of this stock. . . . Methods of Distribution:—This week I got from head-quarters a full distribution and strength chart of this expedition, with an excellent blue-print map. This I have deposited in the safe at the Base Post Office. It will enable me to reach, in course of time, all the scattered detachments. My location at the Post Office enables me to make use of the mail orderlies going out to the detachments. In the last two days I have sent out two sets of books and four collections of periodicals. . . . Assistants:—For the moving I had a squad of Austrian prisoners (well-fed, cheerful fellows); and a colonel who got interested yesterday loaned me a soldier to open boxes. So far I have done all the sorting that has been done. Later I may have to get an assistant or two, particularly when I start out for an inspection of more distant detachments. (Last week, by the way, I sent letters to the commanding officers of various detachments explaining the wish of the A. L. A. to keep the camp libraries circulating. And the very mess in the store-room is proving something of an advertisement. Those who come to stare remain to browse.) 22 December, 1918. I have finished unpacking the boxes of periodicals which I reported last week. The periodicals have been sorted and I have now begun the more interesting work of making up sets to send out. Already twenty-eight sets have been made up for seventeen places. Some have been distributed, but thirteen mail sacks are ready for tomorrow. I hope to be able to send sets to all the detachments, large and small, of this expedition during the coming week—Christmas week. Thus do we introduce the short-story into the long Siberian night. I am very glad to have found this work to do while I am waiting for books to arrive; and it is teaching me locations and methods of transportation which ought certainly to be useful later. Because I have been much cramped for room in which to do the unpacking, sorting, selecting, and repacking of the periodicals, I have done practically all of this work alone, though I have had offers of help. This is making the job a rather long one. . . . In my position of "middleman" I am sure I can send to you and to the others who are making this war work possible the grateful Christmas greetings of the Expeditionary Force in Siberia. 29 December, 1918. On December 24th, I cabled to you: "For sending money Vladivostok branch Hongkong Shanghai Bank available." This Vladivostok branch did not appear on the list . . . and those who answered my inquiries were ignorant of it and seemed pessimistic about all the banks here. . . . During the past week I have put the finishing touches to the arrangement of my prize collection of periodicals, and have sent out twenty mail sacks and fifty other parcels of this machine gun literature. More than half of the contents of these boxes are now in the hands of the soldiers. The expressions of appreciation are not few. . . . It has been a very grimy job, and I have looked upon so many magazine-cover ladies that completely clothed women of intelligent mien are at a premium with me. But I repeat that I am heartily glad that I found this work. The work and the daily association with officers and men have given me more understanding of situation and personnel. Colonel S—— of the umpty-first infantry has been an almost daily visitor, and a result of his interest and initiative has been a regimental library with plans for development that promise practical success. The central library is used very largely. But the regiment is broken into detachments which are scattered over the country adjoining as thickly as the golf links of Scotland. So the branch system with exchanges has been worked out, and this past week three sets of from fifty to seventy-five volumes have been sent from the main collection to branches. All this is managed and controlled by the regiment, and the Colonel's desire is to have the books we supply him permanently a part of the regimental library. I have no instructions from you concerning this; but it seems to me that the plans have many advantages. I have been sending letters to the commanding officers of all the larger detachments of this expedition which are located at some distance from Vladivostok inquiring about the desire for books and about my chance of making each place a visit. The answers which I have received have been uniformly affirmative on both points. It was my plan at first to make a round of the various locations immediately, as I did here in the vicinity of the Base. But because the books received had already been distributed and local methods of control had been put into operation; because travelling is uncertain and difficult; and because the twenty-four boxes of old periodicals were hopelessly acquiring dust in a warehouse; I decided to wait until I actually had, not promises, but new books before taking to the novel experiences of the Siberian railway. . . . I realize . . . that you may even be reaching the Chestertonian conclusion expressed by one of the officers of this expedition that "warfare unfits one for the sterner pursuits of life." At any rate I shall be delighted when the hundred cases are here and explanations like those above will not be necessary. Meantime the Morale Officer has been sent off on distant service, and it is an advantage for our work to have someone here who can speak and act, when possible, for the American Library Association. 5 January, 1919. There was a violent storm here on New Year's Day, and . . . consequently what is officially known as "transportation" has been interfered with. However, I have distributed twenty parcels of my diminishing stock of periodicals locally and have sent eight mail sacks of it out by the railway, and there are sixteen other parcels ready to go out. During the week I have unpacked the last of the twenty-four boxes which have been my stock in trade. These contained books; cruelly large cases they were. . . . At times this week, if it had not been for a Chinese tailor's attempt at a marine green uniform, I should have believed myself a librarian of the village life period in America. And the marine green has had its difficulties too; for these tomes have been more than musty. Cleanliness has been next to— impossible. However, I have got the contents of the two cases all out on box tops and beams and the floor, and I have, from a part of the collection, repacked six small boxes and made up four parcels, which have all found users. Three of the boxes are still awaiting "transportation" but may go tomorrow. One is to accompany a small detachment which is starting a long trip inland. In the curious difficulties, political and otherwise, which the American engineers are having in their endeavours toward railway improvement, "long" means time more than distance. A newspaper correspondent who had just come in made the journey from Omsk in five weeks! So the Manila Club may be blessed of these travellers. . . . Having won back space in which to turn around in my humble storeroom, I have arranged to have shelves put up this coming week. . . . This rough library and distributing room, which is located about ten feet across a hallway from the American Base Post Office, is becoming known, and shelves will be very useful. As an illustration that the place and work are becoming known, I can tell of requests that are coming in for special books as well as for periodicals. This past week these requests have included books on mathematics, English grammar, Spanish, economics, commerce, Russian history, and the Eastern question. Having such definite knowledge of needs I have not hesitated to send to a bookseller I knew in Shanghai a hurry order for about fifty books. Communications with Shanghai have been difficult recently, but this order is going by a Russian ship for that port, and I hope that the books can catch the return trip. This week the expressions of appreciation of work done and the offers of co-operation in my plans have continued to come in. . . . You will be interested in the response to a parcel of magazines and a letter that I sent to the Commanding Officer of the Legation Guard at Harbin:— "Dear Sir: Herewith acknowledge receipt of parcel of magazines received from you today. In thanking you for this shipment I would like to express my personal appreciation for the very good work done by the American Library Association in all the posts that I have seen in Siberia. "E. R. PERCY, "Captain, Infantry." 12 January, 1919. There has just come by post from Miss Mary Polk, of Manila, a very welcome collection of supplies and information. I have been particularly eager to get printed or other matter about the working of the Camp Libraries in the States and overseas. . . . Miss Polk sent a supply of book cards and book pockets, which will be very useful—for gifts reaching me here and for purchases made through a Shanghai bookseller. She sent no book plates; at least I have as yet found none in the parcels. Speaking of book plates, may I add my humble words of congratulation to the person or persons who designed the fine A. L. A. plate? . . . I am hoping that, when word begins to come through directly from you, you will direct me what to do in the case of regimental libraries, or permanent libraries of other permanent units. . . . Of my prize collection of periodicals there are now only two "Japan Magazines" and twenty-five copies of the periodical that publishes over two million copies weekly. (An enlisted man remarked the other day that the Saturday Evening Post was too high-brow for him.) These periodicals have been sent to forty different detachments in forty-one mail sacks and 128 parcels. As I have a record of what has gone out, I am in a good position to go on with the distribution of periodicals. Of the old books from Manila I have sent out nine parcels and ten boxes, and I have about an equal number left. These books have been sent out "without strings" and I, personally, am in hopes that there will be no return. But this past week I have effected a volume for volume exchange of A. L. A. books which had been in the possession of five different detachments. There were 390 volumes exchanged. In passing I may say that I have made some effort to keep undesirable specimens out of the parcels of old books and periodicals that have been distributed. . . . With periodicals out and shelves going in, I am certainly in a position to get some new cases of books—you can imagine how my fingers itch to get hold of new books. And on Friday my eager search among the material deposited by the last transport was rewarded by the sight of eight or ten sure-enough Camp Library boxes. But a book in the hand is more of an achievement than I had known; for the boxes were addressed rather casually on tags to "R. W. Bayles, Y. M. C. A." or to "Helen Burr." And of course I could not get possession of the cases until something was established about the names. The names were, on investigation, not known to the American post office, the Y. M. C. A., or the Red Cross. That being clear, the Y. M. C. A. gave me a lever. For a special trip into Vladivostok resulted in the enclosed letter from Mr. Inglehart. The letter has released the cases, and I am to have them tomorrow. The investigation had other results. For in one of the Y. M. C. A. offices which I visited, I found five or six other new A. L. A. cases. These had been turned over to the Y. M. C. A. by people on the transport. . . . 20 January, 1919. Yesterday I received by registered post from "The One Hundredth Bank, Ltd.," Tokyo, Japan, the following letter, under date of January eighth: . . . "We beg to enclose herewith a cheque payable at the Matsuda Bank for yen 3,720.93, being the equivalent of $2,000 at $53¾. Kindly acknowledge the receipt. Yours faithfully, For the One Hundredth Bank, (Signature successfully illegible) Per Pro Manager." About half of the first two thousand is still unused. I have drawn from it only my expenses. . . . The books specially wanted here and ordered from Shanghai have not yet come; hence that bill is outstanding. But the assistance rendered by the Red Cross in Shanghai not only made possible my coming when I did, but also materially reduced the cost. My assignment to the officers' quarters at the American Base in Siberia eliminated room rent and reduced board to cost ($1.25 a day during December). As prices are sky high in Vladivostok this is another material advantage. Most of the matter of transportation of books and periodicals has been taken care of by the Quartermaster's Department and the American Post Office. And the "Clearing House Library"—which is on the same floor in one of the base warehouses as the Quartermaster's Department and the Post Office—has, thanks to the Quartermaster, cost three roubles, or thirty-eight cents, which was paid at a Russian shop for a padlock. The shelves in the "Clearing House Library" were finished on Monday last, and an hour later the first of the real A. L. A. books—ten cases—arrived. I had several hours of sheer physical and mental enjoyment in getting the books arranged. The Y. M. C. A. had taken ten cases from the transport. . . . They had, previous to my call a week earlier, sent out three cases to distant detachments. But I should have sent cases to the same places, and the Y. M. C. A. are turning over to me full lists of the books sent. The seven cases which they still had are to be delivered to me tomorrow. My work with periodicals, my correspondence with distant detachments, and my constant association with officers at the officers' quarters and at the Base offices have given me considerable clue as to needs. And I find that the strength and location chart entrusted to me at Headquarters has put me in possession of better information on those points than even the Y. M. C. A. possesses. I plan to keep a constant stock of books at the "Clearing House Library" for regular library and reference purposes and to repack from there the cases to be sent out (hence the "Clearing House Library"). . . . This past week I have repacked five such cases and the contents of one case more or less have gone out from the "Clearing House Library" on loan. Incidentally an interested colonel has promised to furnish a library attendant for the "Clearing House Library" when the opportune time comes for me to go on a visitation to other locations. . . . The cases I have repacked contain a somewhat smaller proportion of reference books, because I have wanted to keep a stock of these on hand at the "Clearing House Library." Because of the location of this small place with the large name, it is likely to have borrowers in which the proportion of officers is comparatively large—and of course it will be the only "central" library. Perhaps the best proof of the quality of the users would be a list of what has been borrowed from the "Clearing House Library." To save space I will give the first twenty of the new books taken out: Adkins. Historical backgrounds. (Captain) Austin. Unchanged Russia. (Captain) Bairnsfather. Fragments from France. (Lieutenant) Boyer and Speranski. Russian reader. (Sergeant) Breasted. Ancient times. (Lieutenant) Churchill. Traveller in war time. (Lieutenant) Doyle. Study in scarlet. (Lieutenant) Duruy. General history of the world, v. 1. (Sergeant) Fairbanks. Laugh and live. (Private) Fish. Development of American nationality. (Lieutenant) Futrelle. My lady's garter. (Captain) Graham. The way of Martha and the way of Mary. (Lieutenant) Hazen. Alsace-Lorraine. (Lieutenant) Hazen. Europe since 1815. (Lieutenant) Milyoukov. Russian realities and problems. (Captain) Pagé. How to run an automobile. (Private) Poole. The dark people. (Lieutenant) Robinson. Mediæval and modern times. (Lieutenant) Wells. Tono-Bungay. (Captain) Wiener. Interpretation of the Russian people. (Captain) I ought to add that in the past day or two the proportion of enlisted men has been higher. But the list will make clear my meaning that the location is good for a reference library. I am eager to get the other cases that are on the way. These Siberian cities are not lacking in temptations; moreover the thrill of the war is over; moreover most of the men want to go home. Books, periodicals, and games have an influence for good on morale than can well nigh be demonstrated mathematically. Every case that comes now will have its part in that influence. The selection of books in the A. L. A. cases is admirable indeed. The single criticism I have heard is the lack of standard poetry. I have myself admired the evidences of open-mindedness and careful selection combined. . . . A little incident of last week is unique in my library experiences. . . . A door-filling specimen of an enlisted man, who had borrowed Douglas Fairbanks' "Laugh and Live," brought it back, mildly disgusted. "This ain't what I want. I thought it was a funny book." "And you didn't find it funny?" I inquired. "Naw. Say, have you got anything like Elinor Glyn's `Three Weeks?' Elinor Glyn's so— so— well, scientific, you know." The adjective gave me a sudden coughing fit. But it also gave me an answer. "Perhaps you are interested in eugenics." However this wasn't any more helpful than I had expected it to be. So the man started out to help himself. He made a laborious tour of the shelves. Finally with a grunt that seemed to mingle satisfaction with doubt he pulled out a volume and handed it to me for record. "I guess that'll do. I'll try it anyway." It was "Marriage a la mode." Thus is virtue its own (Mrs. Humph)ry Ward! Among the papers sent me by Miss Polk, I have found and read eagerly a typewritten copy of your "The A. L. A. Follows the Flag Overseas." It is a thrilling account and most illuminating to me. Having such material as this and having shelves and books, I have at last the happy sensation of being "on my job." . . . 26 January, 1919. This past week has been a fairly busy one. Now that I am able to get really to work with real cases of real A. L. A. books, perhaps you will not have to wade through such lengthy screeds from me. . . . Last week I reported to you the details of the quest of seven cases of books, which had gone to the Y. M. C. A. All the difficulties which had not previously arisen in that quest emerged this week. However, I got the cases on Thursday. . . . One of the seven cases was short about twenty or twenty-five books. I judge that the case had been opened en route. I have written to the Director of the Y. M. C. A. in Vladivostok for any possible clue about the missing volumes. This past week one case of books turned up in the Quartermaster's warehouse. It had been at the bottom of a few tons of miscellaneous boxes. The Quartermaster's department is now looking sharply for A. L. A. cases, and is cooperating with me very pleasantly. . . . All the cases have been unpacked at the Clearing House and Reference Library, and eleven have been repacked for distribution. The repacking has been done according to my information about local needs. The use of the reference library continues to grow. I had an illustration of the change in the appearance of that thirty-eight cent Clearing House and Reference Library recently. The enlisted man who was loaned to me several weeks ago to help open and unpack the twenty-four boxes of old periodicals and books nearly broke his back and did break his hatchet over the job. When I dismissed him the mess was beyond my powers of description. I judge that the soldier thought the situation was hopeless. For he didn't come back until one afternoon this past week. Meantime the periodicals had been distributed, the boxes and the room cleaned out, shelves put in, and books arranged on the shelves. As I glanced up from my work I saw him standing in the door, with mouth wide open. At my nod he fairly exploded: "My God, you've got it cleaned up!" On that previous day he had, while rubbing his back, confided in me that he wanted to read a book by Marie Corelli. This time it was waiting for him. The books I ventured to order from Shanghai have not yet come. But new requests have come in, and I am going this week to venture again, for certain books on mineralogy, chemistry, medicine, history, and English. These requests seem to me legitimate, as they are for special reference use, chiefly for classes which have been started among the soldiers. During the week I have had an exchange of letters with the Y. M. C. A. Director in Vladivostok concerning details of cooperation. I have also had a long conference with the Secretary in charge of Y. M. C. A. transportation over the same matter. In view of my advantageous connection with the army, both in the location of my work room and of my quarters, it has seemed to me wise to maintain my independence to the extent that I can everywhere deal directly with the commanding officers of detachments. 2 February, 1919. . . . The use of the little Clearing House and Reference Library has increased beyond my expectations. And the cases which I have been able to distribute from the twenty-one received (three of which were sent out by the Y. M. C. A.) have only whetted the appetite for more. I shall be grievously disappointed if the next transport—due in about a week—does not bring a number of cases. Little has happened during the week except this growing use and this demand for more books. The Y. M. C. A. has, however, appointed a new man to take charge of their library business, and he came at once to see me. I think we can work together with pleasure and profit. The Red Cross is not dealing much with books, but I have during the week had another satisfactory conference with the head of their work among soldiers. During the week I learned that one of the officers of the Expedition (a professor of history in an eastern college) might be relieved of other duties in order to give courses of lectures at various points. I got from him a list of reference books bearing on his subjects, and sent to Shanghai for copies of these, in order that the camp libraries might "carry on" his work. . . . The Commanding General has paid a brief visit to the Clearing House and Reference Library; one day this week the Chief of Staff sent a messenger out from Vladivostok to the Base for a reference work which fortunately was there. But it is the enlisted men who are responsible for the increased use of this C. H. and R. L. at the Base. 9 February, 1919. On February 4th, I received the following cable message: . . . "Shall we subscribe magazines continue book shipments how many." Because of three reasons I have so far delayed my answer. The first is that on the sixth two mails from the States were due—it seemed better to wait for information which letters might contain. . . . The second reason was that a transport was to arrive on the sixth, and my answer to the cablegram would depend on the number of cases of books which I might receive. The Quartermaster's manifest bore the glad news that there were sixty-six cases on board, consigned to the Commanding General. The Quartermaster's Corps are interested in the A. L. A., and show a pronounced desire to be helpful in every way. But on account of the ice in the harbor, transport's freight had to be unloaded down the bay and carried out to the Base; and late last evening these cases had not been located in the warehouse where they could be counted, and turned over to me. . . . So that this second reason for delay still exists. The third reason is that the answer to the cablegram depends also on information from Headquarters here about the probable duration of this expedition. And before I ask for such information I want to have the facts about the number of cases of books now in hand. . . . These sixty-six cases may, of course, contain soap or toothpicks or rubber shoes. I am trying to steel myself to further delays. But the very prospect that I may now be able to do something worth while has proved the finest tonic. My morale, whatever that may mean, has bounded upward at the news. My plan is to place fifty cases as rapidly as I can, put an assistant in charge of the little Clearing House and Reference Library, and then go out to visit the various detachments. . . . Yielding to the hope that the reported cases did not contain soap or toothpicks or rubber, yesterday I robbed the little library at the Base to send a box of books to an army hospital, the Commanding Officer of which, a colonel, had sent an urgent request for such reading matter. Another indication of the need for books here came this week in a letter from the chaplain of a regiment at Habarovsk. . . . "The box of books sent by you on the 27th inst. (January) was received yesterday and acknowledgment of your favor is hereby made. The box will be preserved as suggested by you. I have never seen a finer collection of books for soldiers distributed among the men than has been sent me by the A. L. A. And I do not know just how we could have gotten on without them in this far-away place. The men's entertainment is very limited." . . . Of the old books from Manila I have recently sent one parcel to an army hospital and another to a little "troupe" of soldiers who have been giving a minstrel show at the different army locations. Having been reference librarian at Princeton for five years, I am not without experience in the range of reference questions. But yesterday I got one from an embarrassed corporal which even the justly praised selection in the A. L. A. cases failed to answer. After waiting until no one besides himself and your representative was in the little library, he sidled up and asked, "How can one get married in Vladivostok?" The "one" was, of course, the speaker; and the girl, a Russian. The answer was a matter for commanding officers and consuls to express. But the query led to two long conversations in the library, and gave me an opportunity to try to make sure that the boy did not altogether blink the future in the glamour of the present. I suppose that here is a bit of our new internationalism. And the United States has two millions overseas! 17 February, 1919. . . . Now I have both letters and books. In quantity too. . . . Your words, "Your plan of action seems the only wise one," gave me immense relief. I have felt the aim of the American Library Association War Service. That explains my coming to Siberia. But I was anxious lest my lack of any experience in camp library methods should make my efforts appear futile to you from the very start. Thank you for the letter of appointment and the letter of introduction to General Graves. . . . Your cable message of 19 December, 1918, "Money cabled supplies sent above address first payment deposited Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Shanghai," has never reached me. I shall write at once to China about this. But is it possible that this is the sum received by me from the First Hundredth Bank, Ltd., of Tokyo, in January? . . . There are three possibilities arising out of the length of stay of the Expedition. Of course if the Expedition itself should withdraw before the end of April, there would be no problem. If the Expedition should remain only a month or two longer than that, I realize that my withdrawal would mean a heavy expense for the A. L. A. For I believe that there should be a representative here, if possible, when things are cleared up. And I think it quite possible that a short extension of my leave might be arranged. But if the Expedition is to remain for a longer period, there would be much more difficulty. . . . You will probably be able to ascertain the plans for the Expedition in Washington more promptly than I in Siberia. An attempt of mine to do that here a few days ago was utterly fruitless. . . . With the Chief of Staff I took up another matter. When I arrived in Siberia, the Morale Officer, Captain Moore, said that he had received and distributed about fifty cases of A. L. A. books. I inquired for a record of the places to which the cases had been sent. The Morale Officer told me that he had made such a list, but that it had got mislaid. However, he gave me the locations so far as he recalled them, and I wrote these down. My later investigations convinced me that Captain Moore had made a wise distribution and had put the A. L. A. under considerable obligations of gratitude. Those investigations also revealed that my word-of-mouth list accounted for only about half of the fifty cases; and that the distribution had been quite free-and-easy. . . . Meantime Captain Moore had been sent off on special service inland. Very recently he has been recalled from that special service and has been ordered home. While he was in Vladivostok on his way, I made another attempt to get a full list. But though he agreed to make another search, there was no result. So I asked the Chief of Staff if he would consent to ask the detachment commanders for some statement of the A. L. A. books in their commands. This he has agreed to do, and the order has just gone out. I explained the lack of records and said that such an order would not only help to remedy that lack but would also aid in the pro rata distribution of new books and in the planning for the disposal of the books when the Expedition should leave. But I sorely fear that when the A. L. A. roll is called in this Expedition, the proportion of lost or not accounted for will be strikingly large. . . . Certainly I am now more anxious to distribute the new books than I am to find the old ones. The presence of a few cases of technical books has been a great boon. . . . They came among the sixty-six cases just received. And the books for special classes which were ordered from Shanghai have just arrived—at least the bill of lading has come. The list that came with the bill of lading indicates that we shall get a surprisingly large proportion of the works ordered. . . . After I received the cases last week I managed to unpack twenty and to prepare eight for transportation to five locations. I don't know that this record is not a cause for blushing rather than for pride, for the results somehow look meagre. . . . 23 February, 1919. I have taken the opportunity to go over your letter of January ninth and the two sets of circular instructions more carefully. . . . As yet I have not discovered an answer to my question concerning the ultimate disposal of books. . . . Next as regards the shipment of books from Manila and from San Francisco. . . . When I arrived in December, of the fifty-five cases, twenty-four were in the Quartermaster's warehouse, having arrived but a short time before. The others had apparently been disposed of among the forces by the Quartermaster's Department. One of the twenty-four cases was addressed to a regiment with headquarters at Habarovsk, and I sent this on without opening. Of the others all but five or six contained periodicals. These I distributed as I have previously reported. Two boxes of good books I turned over to the Colonel in command at the American Base, for his regimental library—a very successful institution. There were two huge boxes of books, many of them old and worn and worm-eaten and all having two or three club labels pasted on the covers. I repacked ten smaller boxes from these and sent them to various places—a hospital, isolated stations, and so on. Several hundred of these remain. I have permitted them to be taken as gifts and have continued to distribute them myself as opportunity offered—when a new ward was opened in a nearby hospital, when a "troupe" of soldiers went off to perform at various detachments, when a Red Cross guard went to Omsk, when I learned of a handful of signal corps men at a point on the railway. About a hundred and fifty newer books I kept until I received some cards and pockets from Miss Polk—for I found none of the books in the cases equipped with cards and pockets—and with this hundred and fifty I was able to effect the beginnings of an exchange of A. L. A. books which had previously been distributed. This exchange affected five different detachments. On the January transport from San Francisco, which reached here early this month, there were sixty-six cases. In January twenty-two cases arrived. . . . I have asked the Y. M. C. A. for a statement as to the total number of A. L. A. cases they have handled. . . . The request for receipts, from the various commanding officers of detachments, of A. L. A. cases in their charge has so far brought no information that I had not previously received by word of mouth from Captain Moore. So the matter of the A. L. A. books in Siberia seems to be of a piece with the whole Russian question. A new Y. M. C. A. man has recently been put in charge of their books, and I sent him as full a list as I had of the distribution of the earlier A. L. A. cases and a full list of the distribution and of the plans for distribution of the cases that have come to me. I asked him to favor me with a similar record of the distribution of Y. M. C. A. books so that we could cover the field and avoid congestion. . . . I have endeavoured to keep the A. L. A. independent as a war service agency. There has been no particular problem involved in this, except that I have insisted on sending books to commanding officers instead of directly to Y. M. C. A. secretaries and I have urged against the requirement of deposits or fees or fines. . . . The use of the library by enlisted men has much increased, and conclusions drawn from the experience of the first day would no longer hold. . . . One day this past week . . . of the sixty-two books drawn out fifteen were non-fiction (seven of these being on subjects connected with Russia). The borrowers had been: majors, 3; lieutenants, 2; sergeants, 5; corporal, 1; privates, 43; field clerks, 4; postal agents, 3; Y. M. C. A. secretary, 1. A box of books on special subjects connected with classes instituted hereabouts, which I ordered from Shanghai some weeks ago, has arrived and the books are in use. It took me the greater part of one morning and all of one afternoon (two trips into Vladivostok) to get the little box through the customs. A more facile pen than mine could make a yarn for the Saturday Evening Post out of the experience. In the process I saw twelve different Russian officials and collected a waste paper basket full of documents. . . .* * A fuller description of this experience is given in an extract from a letter to Mrs. Clemons published at the end of this collection. On the mail with your letters came a supply of periodicals which the Post Office turned over to me. These have been largely distributed, a specialty being hospitals. I have also unpacked eight cases and repacked five since I wrote last. The Commanding Officer at the Base has promised me a Camp Librarian for the Clearing House Library so that I shall be more free for the work of distribution. I have no information about the plans of the Expedition, but small shifts in location are not infrequent—which possibly indicate that complete withdrawal is not to be immediate and certainly indicate that the A. L. A. representative should try to keep up with the changes. (To get ready for one little shift has occupied me through Washington's birthday and today.) . . . 2 March, 1919. Notice has reached me by letter from San Francisco that on the March transport, the "Thomas," which is due to arrive this coming week, there are thirty-four cases of books for me and four for the transport. . . . I shall then have received one hundred and twenty-two altogether. If twenty more are sent in response to my recent cablegram, there will be an adequate supply for this expedition at its present strength. Of the eighty-eight cases which have been received at this writing, sixty-three have so far been unpacked at the Clearing House Library and thirty-four repacked and distributed among eighteen detachments or hospitals. A letter has just been received from the Commanding Officer at Spasskoe. At that station the books are in charge of the Y. M. C. A. Secretary, and the Commanding Officer enclosed a report from the Secretary as to the use of the books: "Portions of the library have been established at the Hospital and elsewhere for the convenience of the men. The central library, housed in the Y. M. C. A. building, shows unusual activity for a small library. For example: the daily distribution of books for the week of February tenth illustrates this point:— February 10 54 February 11 65 February 12 58 February 13 42 February 14 63 February 15 66 February 16 72 Total 420 books. Considering the fact that the total number of books in the library is less than 450 volumes you can see that few libraries can show an activity in circulation equal to ours. The War Service Library has met and is meeting a real need." This past week the Vladivostok Y. M. C. A. Secretary in charge of their distribution of books answered my last letter about cooperation by a call at the Clearing House Library. . . . He said that, in view of the A. L. A. supply of books and the Y. M. C. A. lack of them, the latter organization now wished to limit its book business to the International Hut in Vladivostok and two sets for the personal use of Secretaries, and to leave all distribution among the detachments of the A. E. F. Siberia to the A. L. A. This means that the local Y. Secretaries will continue to supervise the use of books, when that work is turned over to them by the commanding officers, and that requests for books and other suggestions will come to me. . . . On the heels of the Y. M. C. A. man came the Red Cross man in charge of their work among the soldiers of the Expedition. He handles a few books and periodicals, but distributes these almost solely among the hospitals. I had been trying for several weeks to have him come to the Clearing House Library to look over my work and plans, and to make suggestions. As a result of the visit he readily agreed to give me the benefit of his observations gained on his frequent trips, to spy out the land as it were. I am glad to have this good feeling and this prospect of valuable cooperation. For one thing, it will somewhat make up for my present inability to visit the distant detachments. That inability is a handicap. But there have been compensations, not only through the Red Cross and the Y. M. C. A., but more particularly through my residence among the shifting body of officers at the Base, the almost daily visits and encouragement of the Commanding Officer at the Base, and through the connection with the Post Office. The enlisted man in charge of the mail car has brought in information about small and isolated detachments that would otherwise have probably remained unknown. I realize that the work of unpacking and repacking the cases delays things. But I believe that the results justify this. . . . The repacking enables me to keep one copy of each important book for the Clearing House and Reference Library, to remedy the occasional instances of duplication in the cases, and to select the books in each case for the particular detachment for whom it is destined. This last point of course adds much pleasure to my work. An amusing instance of the result occurred this week. To a "garage detachment" in the country nearby I sent a case flavored with works on gasoline engines, with automobile guides, and with Williamson stories. The lieutenant in charge came in early the next morning and said that he and his men had been almost fighting for the technical books on their subject. He said that if I had books like that, he wanted something on refrigeration! He got it. One cannot forsee all that a man may want. But if one gives him something of what he wants, he is more likely to have confidence in one's ability to supply the rest. I have been asking for an assistant at the Clearing House Library. This week I was assigned a German prisoner! You remarked in your recent letter that the situation here seemed unique. Is a German prisoner Camp Librarian unique? But he uses English well, has a very fair education and an astonishing knowledge of books, and appears to be accurate and a hard worker. I feared lest the soldiers would resent getting information about the simple library regulations from him. But there has been no evidence of this so far. . . . I have certainly been able to work faster with his help. . . . 9 March, 1919. The transport "Thomas" has arrived with A. L. A. cases, but as these are unloaded by the Quartermaster's Corps, turned over to the Commanding General, turned back to the Q. M. C., and turned over to me, it will probably be several days before my "turn" comes. Of the eighty-eight cases previously received I have now unpacked seventy-eight and repacked for distribution forty-five. The little Clearing House Library is the gainer by this process, and its use continues at a satisfactory rate. The German prisoner Camp Librarian, Petzsch (conveniently pronounced "Page"), has been of much assistance to me. . . . My hope to have a chance to visit the various posts of the Expedition is still delayed in fulfilment. It has seemed to me that the distribution of the books should be continued up to a certain point before I leave the Base; and certain shifts that are now going on within the Expedition can best be cared for, so far as books are concerned, by my remaining at this center. I could wish, however, that I had a double or triple personality. . . . In mentioning the transport "Thomas" I omitted one matter. . . . Four cases containing 200 books on board for use during the voyage . . . had been received by a Y. M. C. A. man, Mr. Tanner, I believe, and had been turned over by him to the enlisted men going to Manila. The books seem to have been well used. Mr. Tanner will carry out the plan of having the four cases make the round trip. 16 March, 1919. The thirty-four cases for the A. E. F. Siberia have been turned over to me. As yet I have not discovered the case of supplies, but this may possibly be at the bottom of the pile. The American Chief of Staff was yesterday not yet able to suggest the proper answer to your question about ordering periodicals. Certain movements towards a redistribution of the Expedition would seem to indicate that there will be no complete withdrawal before April Thirtieth. Hence, I opened the question in my cablegram of having my leave of absence extended. . . . Miss Polk wrote me that she was willing to devote a part of her leave to carry on the work here. It was a fine offer, I thought. But the location of the Clearing House Library at the Base and the general nature of the work as it has developed would seem to make it difficult for a woman to undertake to carry it on. I have now unpacked all the cases received before the last lot of thirty-four, and two of these new ones. The total unpacked is therefore ninety. Of these, fifty-six have been repacked and distributed, the other books being on the shelves in the Clearing House Library. The contents of about six cases are out in circulation from that central library, however. I have been able to supply troops going recently to new stations as they have started. This past week the Red Cross man in charge of their work among the soldiers, Mr. Short, visited me on his return from a trip and reported that the recent distribution of books was meeting the need very satisfactorily. . . . To three recent Red Cross trains for the interior I have supplied reading matter, putting the books in charge of the detachment of the A. E. F. Siberia, which acts as guard. The guard makes the round trip and the officer in charge takes the responsibility for the books. Both guard and Red Cross people seem to appreciate this, as railway travelling in Siberia is still of a character to bring white hairs to the head of Father Time. I have completed arrangements with the Y. M. C. A. about stocking the International Hut in Vladivostok with books. This Hut is used not only by Americans but also by Russians, Czecko-Slovaks, and Japanese, and one problem was concerning the loan of books. The Y. M. C. A. plan had been to charge a money deposit. As a result no books have been taken on loan, all the reading taking place in the library room. It seemed better to make the general rule that all use of books be limited to the library, thus rendering the matter of fees unnecessary. Of course the American soldiers can borrow from their own detachments or from the Clearing House Library out at the Base. I shall have, in this case, to depart from my rule of turning books over to A. E. F. commanding officers in each detachment, as the Y. M. C. A. Secretary in charge of the Hut is there the C. O. But I have agreed to this, and am glad not only to make this extension of our work but also to have a practical monopoly of the book business. This ought effectively to prevent duplication of effort. . . . This past week I withdrew from the Red Cross the balance of the first two thousand dollars, amounting to seven hundred ninety-nine dollars, and deposited it in the newly opened agency of the National City Bank of New York. The deposit had to be in Russian money. But roubles happened to be particularly cheap. . . . The deposit is therefore 9,747 roubles, 80 kopecks—which seems like a lot of money! However, Russian money is wretched stuff at present, and counterfeits are everywhere. I had a forty rouble note turned back when I sent the cablegram yesterday—the cablegram costing 497 roubles and 42 kopecks incidentally. The second two thousand was exchanged at the One Hundredth Bank, Ltd., of Tokyo, for yen 3,720.93 (at the rate of 53¾) and deposited in the Vladivostok Branch of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. . . . With money in yen and sen and roubles and kopecks, your representative in Siberia hath feelings of an addled brain. One other matter. As the "Brooklyn" is now at Vladivostok I have called on the Captain and ascertained that no A. L. A. books had been received by that vessel. Three cases have therefore been repacked and delivered to the Brooklyn. 23 March, 1919. This week the Chief of Staff went over with me the situation concerning the withdrawal of the Expedition. . . . The conference was specifically about the answer, [&amp;c.] The Chief of Staff finally suggested that periodicals might be ordered for the permanent units. . . . In case of any withdrawals the periodicals would, of course, follow these units to their new location. . . . I shall also, in my next cablegram, send some inquiry about the point raised in the following letter, received this week from the Captain of the "Brooklyn," the flagship of the United States Asiatic Fleet:— March 21, 1919. . . . The three boxes of books containing respectively, 69 71 and 71 volumes, were promptly received and have been placed in the crew's library of this vessel. I need hardly assure you that the acquisition of a new collection of books at this time and place was especially gratifying. I have to further advise you that the U. S. S. Ajax leaves Vladivostok in the very near future for the Yangtse River. It has occurred to me that you might desire to take advantage of this opportunity to forward such books as may be available via the Ajax for further distribution to the seven United States gun boats stationed on the Yangtse River. . . . Action on this involves the extension of my power as your representative to cover the United States Asiatic Fleet. . . . A more immediate difficulty is the matter of the stock of books for the Expedition. . . . However, I know something about the lonely life on those little gunboats plying up and down the Yangtse, and I am strongly inclined to send three or four cases to Captain Kearney for the Ajax itself and for the gunboats it may find at Shanghai. The Asiatic Fleet may be useful at the end of this expedition as the "ultimate consumer" of some of the A. L. A. books now in Siberia. Among the 34 cases received on the March transport I have discovered the case marked "Supplies." . . . The pocket and book card scheme has been most successful here. . . . Of the cases distributed I have simply retained lists, for record and to enable me to avoid undue duplication in sending several cases to one center. . . . I received a small supply of books from Shanghai. . . . I feel that this unauthorized expenditure of mine has been, at least to some degree, justified by the delight of those who needed the particular books. Three medical works of recent edition brought an unusual expression of grateful feeling from a major of the Medical Corps. The use of a little set —six—of textbooks in English for foreigners is out of the ordinary; some of the enlisted men in a company out on the line wanted them in order to conduct classes in English among poor Russians. . . . Shortly after my last letter I sent two copies of a Saint Patrick's Day paper issued by the 31st Infantry. This contained a very gratifying account of A. L. A. activities, written, I understand, by the Editor. Incidentally it is going to help here in advertising our work. The write-up was unexpected by me, but I am hoping you will credit me with it in place of one of those news-literary effusions urgently requested by a recent A. L. A. circular. The German prisoner Camp Librarian, Petzsch, is doing very well. He seems intelligent, industrious, and accurate. The soldiers appear to like him, and I have found him a very friendly sort. The way he clicks his heels at me when I speak is doubtless most satisfactory too, Through him I have distributed some of the old Manila books among the prisoners. Petzsch is himself doing a good bit of reading in the evenings, sometimes in authors whom I suggest, and this is increasing his usefulness as a librarian of books in English. (However the extraordinary number of books on the war makes one subject rather amusingly delicate.) A morning or two ago Petzsch told me a pathetic story. It seems that he had for the evening previous borrowed Bret Harte's little parodies on then-current novels. He said that he laughed over them till the tears ran down his cheeks. Then he called some prisoner friends around and read aloud to them. "Finally," he concluded, "it was too much. We lay down on the floor back to back and wept together." 30 March, 1919. Last week I gave you the reasons for making the subscriptions for periodicals. . . . The colonels . . . have expressed pleasure at the idea of receiving these periodicals. I enclose a copy of the signed letter from Colonel Styer. To report that the four cases of periodicals on the transport have been "received" is a bit premature, for they have not yet reached me. But I am very glad to have a stock of periodicals again. After the distribution of books this past two months, a change to magazines will make a fine touch of variety; and I believe the Expedition will appreciate the new munitions. With Colonel Styer's letter I am also sending a note from an enlisted man who has been teaching a class or two in one of the companies, and for whom I ordered a book or two from Shanghai. Captain Lawrence Packard, Ph. D. (Professor at the University of Rochester), has been delivering a series of excellent and stimulating lectures on history and allied subjects, and I am glad to be able to report that the presence of books sent in the regular cases or specially ordered from Shanghai has enabled him to supplement his lectures with reading courses and examinations. Captain Packard has done efficient service in keeping up morale in detachments of the Expedition by this means. A copy of Mr. Koch's "War Libraries and Allied Subjects" has reached me this week. I have given myself the privilege of being the first borrower, and have found the essays most interesting and suggestive and stimulating. (Enclosure.) Headquarters. Habarovsk, Siberia,March 27, 1919. Mr. Harry Clemons, American Library Association, Vladivostok. My dear Mr. Clemons: In reply to yours of March 23rd, I beg to say that we will appreciate very much receiving the periodicals you mention. If they are addressed to the Headquarters of the Regiment, the Chaplain will attend to their distribution in case our companies are scattered in a number of places. . . . I would like to place on record with you at this time the thanks and deep appreciation of myself and the whole regiment for the work of the Association. Only those who have served under present conditions, during a long Siberian winter, very far from home, can tell what benefit your work has been to our men. . . . (Signed) HENRY D. STYER, Colonel. 6 April, 1919. This past week I have received your letter of February twenty-first and two cable messages. . . . As soon as the first of the two cable messages had arrived, I took it to the Commanding Officer at the American Base, where the central library is located, and to the Chief of Staff at Headquarters in Vladivostok. . . . The former officer, Colonel Sargent, who is almost a daily visitor at the library and whose interest and helpfulness have been extraordinary, at once suggested the sending of a representative to take my place. The Chief of Staff, however, has not been able to keep so cognizant of the A. L. A. work, though he has occasionally used our books and has always been most courteous and free of access; and he asked for a day or two to look into the book question. Yesterday, as no word had come from him, I went into Headquarters again, and had the best conference on the A. L. A. work we have so far had. He was frankly anxious about the type of representative who might be sent in an expedition consisting so largely of civilian recruits so far from home in a country so different from the United States in its ideas of drink, drainage, and divorce. . . . He did go over exactly the question raised in your letter of the twenty-first of February, namely, whether some officer or enlisted man could not handle the A. L. A. work after my departure. But after a considerable discussion of various possibilities of this sort, it seemed fairly clear to us both that an acceptable A. L. A. representative offered the best solution. . . . Should a newly appointed representative come by the May transport—the earliest that now seems possible—he could not arrive here before the fourth of June. If he should take a liner to Japan, however, and change there for a steamer to Vladivostok, he could reach here soon after the middle of May. It would be greatly to his advantage if he could take a trip to Haborovsk while I go on with the work here; and then I could go to China overland and investigate possibilities for books at Harbin, Peking, and Tientsin. . . . Your letter has been very good reading and its information has helped me greatly. Since it came I have been able to meet certain questions much more like a real "representative." The foremost of these questions has been that of the "Permanent Disposition of Books." I have informed Colonel Sargent—who first raised the question because of its bearing on the regimental library—and Colonel Robinson of your statement, and both seem to appreciate the attitude of the A. L. A. The stationery which this letter is returning in such quantity came in one of the four boxes of periodicals which were received by me from the Logan. Any stationery is much at a premium in the A. E. F. Siberia, and this will help me considerably in advertising the A. L. A. besides. The A. L. A. signs were very gratefully received also. Did my cablegram from Nagasaki for A. L. A. insignia go astray? My marine green uniform has had to remain thus far quite innocent of distinguishing marks. However, in view of the epaulets and badges which some of our allies here wear, perhaps to have none is to render one peculiarly distinguished. On April first I sent a statement of my expenses to that date. . . . To return to more pleasant subjects, the past has been a week of periodicals. In addition to the 1,300 received in the four boxes from San Francisco, about three hundred came on boats from Manila and from Shanghai. Due largely to the German prisoner Petzsch's intelligent and vigorous work, we had this collection sorted, tied in bundles, and the distribution begun in two days. One day Petzsch, going from the prisoners' barracks to the library, noticed a railway car used by a "troupe" of enlisted men from Habarovsk who are making a tour of the Expedition, giving a minstrel show and other "stunts." He at once suggested that periodicals be placed on that car, since it has become the home of that "troupe" for a month or so. . . . I am taking measures towards a consolidation of two collections of books at Headquarters and of drawing in certain collections in detachments at the Base, which can easily use the places where books are located. Indeed that number varies constantly. Just at present there are thirty-five places where at least a case of books is located, extending from wherever the flagship "Brooklyn" happens now to be to wherever in Clearing House Library . . . slightly reducing the number of European Russia the recent Red Cross trains have penetrated —each train has an A. E. F. guard and each guard an A. L. A. case of books. There are fourteen of the thirty-five which have larger collections, and these extend from Vladivostok to a place near Lake Baikal with a name that probably would be most successfully pronounced in hay fever season. 13 April, 1919. This week a box of periodicals sent by the United States Soldiers' Christian Aid Association, George Breck, Esq., Secretary, 5 Beekman Street, New York City, was turned over to me for distribution. The periodicals have been distributed and the gift acknowledged. This morning the United States transport "Sheridan" arrived with five cases of war manuals, vocational books, etc. These are still in the hands of the Quartermaster's Corps, but will reach me soon. They are very welcome. I visited the "Sheridan" and found that some books and periodicals had been supplied to the enlisted men on board; but on the officers' deck the book cupboard was bare. I have arranged to have one case of books put on deck, and will notify Mr. Richards in San Francisco. I did the same for the "Logan"—the transport before this one. . . . A letter dated March 13th has come from Mr. C. G. Dickson announcing the approach of a Corona typewriter and other supplies. The news is welcome indeed. My methods in this work have had to be laughably primitive in many ways. . . . Mr. Dickson writes that he is sending some boxes of ink tablets. That is very wise. My efforts to get ink from Shanghai resulted in a broken bottle and a frozen, black cylinder within. Fortunately this had been well packed, and I was able to get the thing out of the box of books in which it came with little damage to anything except me and the floor. The accounts with Messrs. Edward Evans and Sons, Ltd., of Shanghai, covering the books purchased by post, have at last arrived. At first the amounts were in Chinese currency. There were liberal discounts allowed, but it struck me that even so the prices ranged high. The rate of exchange demanded when one buys articles in China is much higher than the rate received when one sells gold. So I asked to have the transaction put in terms of gold. . . . They did put sixty-three books for which they had charged $142.91 in Chinese currency into gold prices and the total was $93.86 gold. The first amount of $142.91 ought to exchange at $119.09 gold— about $25.23 gold was saved by asking for gold prices. I wonder if I have yet confessed one Shanghai purchase. In January, I found the A. E. F. Siberia very short on 1919 calendars. So I got eight inexpensive but decorative wall calendars and distributed them among the heads of the Expedition with the compliments of the A. L. A. . . . In regard to the [International] Hut matter: . . . with some care I selected about 400 volumes filling five cases, and had them ready on March 20th, the date on which they were to be called for. Nothing happened. About a week later I discovered that the Secretary was planning to leave, and I made two trips into Vladivostok to assure myself that there would be no hitch. . . . But nothing happened. After his departure I made two visits (four in all on this business) on the Secretary in charge of the Hut. . . . He expressed his willingness to receive the A. L. A. books, but did not seem aware of the plan to remove the Y books. . . . The Y. M. C. A. heads here expressed ignorance of the plan for the Hut formulated by the late Secretary on books; and directed him to keep the Y. books in the Hut. As this at once removed the reason for putting A. L. A. books there, I suggested that two collections would be unnecessary and might prove embarassing to him, and proposed that the Hut plan be dropped. He accepted the proposal and—that's the end of the story. . . . No, not quite the end. For, meantime I had been trying to consolidate two separate collections of books started by Captain Moore at Headquarters in Vladivostok. And I could now ask for the return of those two collections . . . and could put this specially selected collection of five cases into a new union library at Headquarters. . . . When the five new cases arrived on the "Sheridan" today, my reserve stock had been reduced to seven unopened cases. But this past week I have started quite a business in exchanging books. . . . Early in the week the Chief of Staff made a visit of inspection to my little library at the Base. This was a result of the conference reported in my letter of last week. One incidental matter and I shall have finished this unduly long letter. Two or three times recently, as I have noticed one donor's name appearing in several good books, I have ventured to send the donor a note of appreciation. . . . But I have not had time or opportunity to do this many times. 20 April, 1919. . . . Up to the present I have repacked, listed, and distributed eighty-two cases. . . . [To continue] my attempts to cover the whole Expedition and to make the distribution of books so far as possible proportional to the strength of the detachments . . . now means a redistribution of books, and a redistribution from centers outside of Vladivostok and the Base—from centers, that is, which are going to be reduced in strength. Hence, I have been waiting for a fortnight or so, and shall continue to do so until it becomes clear how the troops are to be located. . . . Because of censorship restrictions I have not written fully about these larger and more important matters of Library War Service in the Expedition. But about little incidents, especially those centering about the little Clearing House Library at the Base, I have been verbose indeed. Therefore, to revert to type, I am going to drop here to the little incident level. In my struggles with the myriad of periodicals that occupied my time last December, I noticed that I had a call or two for something with pictures suitable for decorating barracks rooms. I finally conceived the plan of laying aside certain magazines that made a specialty of pictures that might be cut out. And it is surprising how much use has been made of this little pile. . . . Just at present I am having a hard cold, a temporary attack of lameness, some visitors, and a touch of ptomaine poisoning; so perhaps it is just as well that the distribution has been held up for a bit. But I have been able to be at the library at least a part of every day this past week. 27 April, 1919. . . . By repacking each case of books sent out from the Clearing House Library (eighty-seven cases have thus far been so repacked) and retaining a list of the contents, I have been able to build up collections of books that were largely free from duplication and that contained a proportion and type of non-fiction books adapted to the local use—at least such has been my purpose. It is altogether probable that in the redistribution of troops the larger collections have been broken up into smaller collections and repacked for this purpose in such a way that I have no longer any use for my lists. The plans for the redistribution of troops have been carried out rapidly and my appeals to the various centers for information about the books have thus far brought not a single response. Of course, where companies have gone out from the Base at Vladivostok I have been able to handle the matter as before. But the troops from centers like Habarovsk have gone from those centers, they are now on the way, and, though the sectors to be guarded are known, the actual locations of the entrained troops will depend on the discovery of suitable barracks by the Commanding Officers; hence, these ultimate locations are not known even at Head-quarters in Vladivostok. However, I presume that all of these troops have books from the former collections, so that the chief difficulty is that I do not know just what books each detachment has. And just as this difficulty has arisen a possible way out has also appeared. . . . A newly-arrived first lieutenant, Mr. Herbert A. Horgan, has very recently been appointed Morale Officer for the Expedition. . . . Together we worked out a method by which the new information I need can be gathered by the sub Morale Officers he proposes to have appointed at each location. If this method is successful, I shall be able to have the work reorganized by the time my successor appears. . . . The distances will be north to Habarovsk, some 450 miles, and west to Baikal City, nearly 2,000 miles. . . . Captain Moore placed a case of books with the American Russian Railway Service Corps (the R. R. S.) while the corps was marooned in Vladivostok during the wait for railway developments. This winter I have exchanged that case for a fresh one and added another—the use of the books has been more than ordinary. Now the railway men are scattered all over the line in very small detachments. The Y. M. C. A. has undertaken to fit out a special car to maintain touch with these men. Working through the R. R. S., who will continue to assume responsibility for the books, I have put two cases on this car, and the "Y" man in charge has undertaken to feed these out to the R. R. S. men—a travelling library. I shall keep one case at R. R. S. Headquarters in Vladivostok, and exchanges can be effected as necessary. . . . The little Clearing House Library at the Base . . . loaned 1,571 books during March, of which 402 were non-fiction. That library needs an Encyclopædia and some books on law. The new Morale Officer is a Harvard Law School man and is one of those who has asked for law books. . . . Throughout the Expedition, books on Russia or on Russian are in demand. At least three little books on Russian have appeared on sale in one of the Vladivostok shops, and I have bought a set for the library at the Base. If cards printed as notices for overdue books are available, they will save labor here. . . . The five cases which came on the last boat fitted us up finely for poetry and war manuals. And the sets of Zane Grey and the other new books in recent cases have gone like the proverbial hot cakes. The interest of Headquarters in the library at the Base seems to be increasing. Both the Chief Surgeon and the Inspector General visited the library for the first time this past week. Both took books and both have repeated the visit. 4 May, 1919. . . . I have written two short letters containing lists of books desired by Captain Ward of the Intelligence Department and by Lieutenant Horgan, the Morale Officer. On Monday, I was informed by the Chief of Staff that the War Department in Washington, had by cable raised the question whether an army officer might not be detailed as my successor. . . . I am in a typical army condition of uncertainty about my "relief." . . . The Chief of Staff has asked me to prepare a report of Library War Service in this Expedition. I have completed a first draft and hope to have the whole finished so that I can enclose a copy to you next week. By the "Sherman" came three cases of "books and supplies," and also, from the freight clerk, two or three bags of periodicals. None of these has yet penetrated "army channels" far enough to reach me, however. As the freight clerk and the Quartermaster agent on the "Sherman" both assured me that they had an ample supply of books on board I did not put any on this transport. However, the library shelves seemed noticeably bare; and I gave to an enlisted man, who is making the trip from here, some magazines for distribution, and to an officer a few books, to be added later to the ship's library. . . . The money situation is serious here. The Russian money has dropped greatly in value during a few weeks. When I came here the exchange was about eight roubles for one dollar. Now it is twenty-five or more for a dollar. I deposited $799 in the new branch of the National City Bank of New York in March, which at 12.20 amounted to 9,747.80 roubles—the bank would accept only rouble accounts. . . . There seems to be nothing to do but hold the account in the hope that the Russian money may recover value. There are 2,559.17 yen in the Vladivostok Branch of the Hongkong Banking Corporation; this ought to equal $1,500 gold, but there is some loss here, too, in exchange. . . . 11 May, 1919. No cable . . . no message about my relief has been received. The cable business here is extraordinarily slow and uncertain. Your message of March fourteenth did not reach me until the end of the month. . . . The administration of this Expedition amid huge distances and such means of communication and transportation is one of the feats of the war. . . . The last manifest from Mr. Richards, stating shipments from San Francisco during the week ending April fifth, mentioned three boxes holding 100 volumes and supplies. . . . Two cases came by the U. S. T. "Sherman." The two contained 133 volumes and supplies. . . . The supplies included all the articles mentioned in Mr. C. G. Dickson's letter to me of March thirteenth, except the Corona typewriter, and also included the envelope of A. L. A. insignia. (This letter is written on sheets from that paper, with ink prepared by prescription—somewhat homeopathic—from the tablets, and by a representative wearing insignia). . . . It has been a busy week, and one that would have convinced me, if I had not been already convinced, that effective control of this work requires that some one be steadily at hand at the Base library, keeping ears open, policies fixed, and plans fluid, and being on the mark for a sprint of hard work at any moment. With apparently every source for information working, I find that I recently missed a Red Cross train for the interior with its A. E. F. Siberia guard making the round trip. Yesterday a strange Red Cross man wildly trying to get some canned goods at the Base Library gave me a clue which two hours later resulted in the Lieutenant, in command of the guard for that train, and his man receiving in pleased surprise a specially packed case of books for the six or eight weeks' trip. . . . At the beginning of a military movement neither officers nor men seem to have a chance to think of anything so secondary as reading matter munitions. . . . 18 May, 1919. Chaplain Loughran [appointed my successor] is one of the four chaplains who arrived a fortnight ago on the transport "Sherman." He has been assigned to the Base, lives at the officers' mess where I have been staying, and a simple chapel room is being made for him in warehouse number three, one wall of the chapel serving also as a wall of the Base Library. So his work will be centralized—the feast of reason on one side and the flow of soul on the other. He is Catholic. Already he has made a good impression for energy and for ability to get on with the men. . . . On Wednesday, the fourteenth, I closed the Base Library and with Petzsch and two other German prisoners helping, had a thorough housecleaning. The low walls of the Library were also carried up to the ceiling by a burlap-covered framework so that the books will be much more free from warehouse dust. . . . Chaplain Loughran has obtained another German prisoner assistant, a man named Leuteritz, to assist Petzsch. Yesterday afternoon I gave Petzsch, who has been unusually efficient, a present of ten dollars. Did I write you that he recently read at my suggestion Professor Phelps's "Advance of the English novel," and that he has since been going steadily through a list of fifty or more novels so that he will know something about the subject and be able to advise the men who ask about books? He gets on very well with the American soldiers—the point about which I had some fear. . . . Chaplain Loughran will "take over" the work tomorrow, the nineteenth of May, and, orders will go out to that effect from Headquarters. . . . My plan is to visit the detachments in Harbin, Peking, and Tientsin, so you are still far away from seeing the end of my correspondence. WITH SIBERIAN DELIBERATION (Extract from a letter written to Mrs. Clemons in China.) Vladivostak, February, 1919. . . . Strengthened by your letter, I got that Shanghai box of books out of Customs, yesterday afternoon. Thank you for the letter. I don't believe I can recall all the ramificacations. Tuesday morning, I took the blue bill of lading and sallied into Vladivostok. I went to the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and loaded up with dollars and roubles first, and then hunted for the office of the Russian Volunteer Fleet. After a little search I located that. I got into an office full of people and waited. Finally I caught an official's eye and waved the blue document at him. He took it, perused it with deliberation, and then carried it to another official. The second perused it with deliberation, and then wrote out a supplement to the document. The second official handed it to the first and the first handed it to me and said, "Pay three roubles, four kopecks at cash." I received the papers and started in the direction of his gesture for "cash." I went into a hallway and wandered about a bit and then sighted a window like a ticket seller's arrangement. The window was closed, but I knocked on it. A third official woke up inside, gathered in my money and papers, stamped the supplement, and handed back the papers. For want of further directions I returned to the office. Official number one deliberately perused the stamp and handed the papers to official number two. The latter perused the stamp with deliberation and returned the papers to number one. Number one handed them back to me and said, "Go Customs House." I went back to the maddening world and hunted for the Customs House, Once I got lost in a maze of unclean back yards, but finally I located the building on a certain block. Then I made a systematic search. The first building was a bank. Into the second building a man with a portfolio under his arm was going. So I put my blue document and supplement under my arm and followed. It was a good scent. I got into a crowded office and found an official, number four. He knew some English and was obviously proud of the knowledge. Only his method was to think each sentence through before uttering it, which gave an air of deliberation to the conversation. After a friendly interchange of remarks, he seemed to reach the facts in my case, and then delivered himself thus: "You will please go upstairs and see the Superintendent." I went obediently upstairs. A page took my papers and disappeared down a long corridor. Later he came back without the papers and indicated that I was to follow him. I was ushered into the presence of the Superintendent, this fifth official being clothed like the Lord Mayor of London. We spoke briefly in different languages, and then an interpreter was summoned. I was asked what this was about. I said it was about a box of books. For whom was this box of books? For the American soldiers. Who was this Clemons, American Library Association? I indicated myself. But if the box of books was for the American soldiers, there must be some official document from the American army to indicate that. Then they could consider whether the books should be admitted free of duty. But nothing could be done without that document. And I might come again tomorrow. I indicated a shade of impatience, I fear, but this only brought a repetition of the same statement. So I pocketed my blue documents and supplements and departed from the Lord Mayor official and his interpreter. At headquarters, the Adjutant told me that he would be glad to give me a letter identifying me, but that the other letter ought to come from the Quartermaster at the Base. So I came back, back from Vladivostok. That afternoon I approached the Quartermaster with my tale, and he cheered me with a show of hearty sympathy and promised the letter. The letter came yesterday. (So did yours.) At half past one I started for the Custom House. The same page took the same blue document plus the official letter to the same Lord Mayor Superintendent. Then in the same way he waved me down the long corridor. This time instead of the interpreter there was a sixth official summoned. He read the letter from the Quartermaster, and the Superintendent pondered. Then he apparently washed his hands of the whole blue matter and departed. The sixth official inquired if the books were for the American troops. I affirmed that they were. Then he asked if I wrote Russian. I uttered a regretful negative. Thereupon the sixth official condescended to write out a statement about the destination of the books on the back of the blue document and asked me to sign it. I inquired if I should write the statement in English also. This seemed to grieve him, and so I assumed that the signature would be safe. Then I was asked to wait a few minutes. I did. Twenty. At the end official number six said I would please follow him. He was correct. We went downstairs into the office full of people. Number six pushed over into a corner where an important-looking number seven sat, and an earnest conversation ensued. I remained discreetly in the background. Meantime official number four, he of the deliberate speech, observed me and came for a friendly greeting. He said he hoped I was making progress. I told him I shared his hope. "Do you not find," he continued, "that the process in the Russian customs is different from that in the American?" Again I agreed with him. But by this time official number six had persuaded official number seven to add a supplement to the document, and so I left official number four of the agreeably deliberate enunciation and returned with the unusually efficient number six to the room down the long corridor of the second story. When we arrived there, he informed me that now I should go to the Customs House. I confess that I was a bit startled, and had to ask for a repetition of the information. But I had heard correctly. This time I took the precaution of asking the name of the building. He carefully informed me that it was "Korabelnaia Kontora." I practiced this under his instructions; and telling official number six, in true Chinese style, that I feared I had caused him much trouble, I departed. The fresh air was invigorating, and after getting my lungs full, I fell into step to the tune of "Korabelnaia Kontora." It was almost as difficult for this purpose as the Wedding March. Whenever I met a person of intelligent mien I stopped him and remarked, "Korabelnaia Kontora." For the first three attempts there was no result. But as I got near the wharves, I found two Russians who responded by violent pointing to the right. On I went, and was again urged forward, and again a third time. Then I discovered a building with a sign over the door. Once I won half a small prize for an examination in Greek. But yesterday I felt as if I had got the equivalent of the other half also, when my Greek letters enabled me to spell out "Korabelnaia Kontora" itself. I entered proudly and immediately got lost. But a youth with a dog found me and steered me and my blue documents and supplements into a crowded office. After a time an eighth official took the documents and perused them with deliberation and then led me to another office. It seemed that the necessary official here was missing, and I was given a chair with a considerable show of politeness. Official number eight had an imposing array of stars on his shoulders but rather feeble trousers. He seemed to be a general above, and a camp follower below. But he was polite. So I sat down. For twenty-five minutes. Then the missing official number nine entered briskly, bowed, and examined my documents with deliberation. Whereupon he uttered an exclamation and led me and my documents back into the former office. It appears that the proper official for my case had really been there. But meantime he had departed. So I waited. Thirty minutes. At the expiration of the half hour, official number ten wandered in, and everybody looked up and said, "Here he is," in Russian. Number ten perused my blue document and its supplements with unusual deliberation and then arose and beckoned me to follow. We went forth into the fresh air down along the docks for a walk of some little distance, tried a warehouse or two unsuccessfully and then in a third apparently discovered something. There was much conversation in Russky, and suddenly a little box bearing my name appeared. My heart leaped up when I beheld that little box. But workmen had to be summoned and the box opened and one of the books gravely felt and peeped into. Then the box was closed. But number ten official had forgotten to bring his order book, and so I was led reluctantly out away from my box and along that walk of some little distance to "Korabelnaia Kontora." The order was there filled out with elaborate care, and was then given to me in exchange for my blue companion and its supplements. So I went forth for the third journey over that walk of some little distance back to the warehouse and my box of books. But I grew more cheerful as I found myself again in reach of the little box, and after a moderately short wait was able to hand over the order so elaborately prepared. But the warehouse boss, when he arrived, looked at the box and then at the order and then at me, and then struck his forehead with his open palm in dismay. Something was wrong. A little crowd collected. The warehouse boss found a document of an appearance new to me and asked if I did not have one like that. At least so I interpreted his inquiry. I responded in English that I had never seen anything like that document, but that I was perfectly willing that he should use that for me. Again he struck his head. Then he called a minion, who was wearing Joseph's coat of many colors, and sent him hurrying off for something. After a moderately long wait the coat of many colors returned and the inmate uttered a negative. Then there was another little crowd, and a sub-boss appeared. He was Chinese and spoke English. Are there bolsheviki miracles? The Chinese took me away from my little box of books for another walk—briefer this time—and we interviewed official number eleven. Official number eleven said that I should have to pay forty-five kopecks. I paid them. Then he handed me a document of this new style, like the one exhibited; and the Chinese Good Samaritan and I gaily wended our way back to the little box of books. At last it was surrendered to me, and the Good Samaritan helped me to find a Chinese coolie with one of the picturesque chair-shaped carriers on his back and we loaded the little box of books on to the contrivance. But just at this moment of escape, the Chinese turned to me suddenly and asked, "Have you got a pass to go out of the gate?" Well, no, I hadn't any pass. So we lowered the box of books and left it there in the warehouse, and went forth to find official number one dozenth. It wasn't really a very long operation, and I don't remember much about it. I was moving on and on as in a dream anyway. Yes, we got the pass, and went back to the little box of books, and loaded the box on the coolie's back, and I said an almost tearful goodbye to the Chinese Good Samaritan, and the coolie and the box and I hurried through the gate—and night was falling. How I paid the coolie and got a droshky and lumbered in that broken-down vehicle back towards the Base and how the driver struck three times for higher fare and how I finally paid him ten roubles and how we reached the warehouse and how two enlisted friends of mine carried the box up to the library without letting me help are other stories. The Quartermaster called on me today to inquire about results—and he seemed to think that I was lucky! I was. I have got the box. Nothing was broken in it except a pint bottle of ink.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">6 December, 1918. . . . Perhaps I had better begin epistolary communication by certain commentaries on the cablegrams. I regret that the matter of salary has been mentioned so often. I was willing to take without demur whatever you might have decided upon as a proper salary. I must admit that I did not have much fear of the results, for since I came to China I have been receiving a missionary salary. Up to the present I have not received the two thousand dollars which you reported as cabled. . . . I was able to carry on, however, because the University advanced five hundred dollars Mexican and the Red Cross in Shanghai advanced the cost of an outfit such as they supply their doctors, the cost of passage on the steamer from Shanghai to Vladivostok, and some money for expenses en route. As I could not arrange for the proper A. L. A. insignia in Shanghai, I was forced to request by cable from Nagasaki that you send it from Washington. The Japanese couldn't find A. L. A. in Webster's Dictionary, so I had to write American Library Association in full. I was pleased that the words are long. . . . Your message of "27 November, 1918" states "Am cabling London send twenty-five hundred A. L. A. books Archangel." I find here that communications with Archangel are just at present well nigh impossible; at least, it would mean several weeks, probably several months en route, and large expenses. . . . Several cases of books were received by this expedition from you months ago. Apparently others have come from Miss Polk in Manila since then. The cases received here have been distributed widely through the interest and energy of Captain Moore, the Morale Officer of the Expedition. My first work is apparently to locate these books, find out the methods of use, arrange for exchanges, and generally study the possibilities for camp libraries in this expedition. I must fit myself with as little friction as possible into an already existing organization. I have been here some three days, and there are still two or three things that I do not know! But I am inclined to believe that tact, time and patience, and a bit of travelling must be at the top of my programme for a while. The places where books can be used are very much scattered. I have located ten different collections in use in the neighborhood of Vladivostok so far, and expect to start for three other places a little further out tomorrow. You see the records of the distribution have come to me rather casually, by word of mouth. The methods of putting the books into use vary also. In some cases no records have been kept, in others the records are elaborate. One regiment has made the A. L. A. books a part of the regimental library, and the Colonel has himself worked out an excellent plan for exchange among his scattered detachments. This plan has not yet been put into effect, because the regimental library has just been started and there is not yet a sufficient number of volumes. But in a fortnight the library, as it now exists at the location of the largest detachment, has had a large use. The regimental library idea will probably prevent exchange with outside organizations, which are fairly numerous, but it will mean location of the books in the barracks and under regimental supervision. In view of the scattered and uncertain conditions here, the erection of any library buildings seems to me not desirable. Among the non-regimental organizations—headquarters, hospitals, engineers—a system of exchanges can readily be instituted, as soon as I have some new cases for distribution. At Headquarters I yesterday learned that thirteen cases had been sent recently from Manila. When these arrive I ought to be able to get things moving finely; and also to reach several detachments that have not yet had any books. Captain Moore recently received from the chaplain of a regiment along the line the following comment: "The books you sent are without exception the best collection for soldiers I have ever seen. But every book, except atlases and encyclopedias, which we do not let out, was gone in twenty-four hours after the library was opened and men calling for more. We do not want more than our share, but we really need more." To this excerpt may be added three notes from my brief chance of observation. First, you are to be congratulated very heartily indeed on the selection of books in the cases. The comments on this point have been expressed in various ways—one or two officers have even assured me that they could not have done better themselves—but the conclusion has been quite unanimous. Second, the books have been used very much. I have heard of a whole barracks full of men off duty stretched out quietly and contentedly reading the evening after a case of books had been opened. Yesterday I found that a case had reached a squad of American engineers. The lieutenant in charge of the books had recorded the use of each in a big folio blank book. From October 24th to November 6th, from about eighty volumes there had been three hundred and thirty loans. At one or two places I was assured that "the men have read them all." Third, the effect on the morale is hard to judge accurately, of course, but it certainly exists. I have enjoyed receiving assurances from some of the privates on this point. And one lieutenant informed me that the opening of the camp library in his company immediately cut down, more than half, the requests for evening leave. The war is over, the winter is here, men and officers are comfortably housed; the camp libraries have an unusual opportunity for service. I have been located at the officers' quarters at the Base, and have been receiving most courteous and helpful treatment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">10 December, 1918. Yesterday and today I have found four new places where books have been distributed. The largest collection was of 300 volumes, shelved in a Y. M. C. A. hut and canteen. There were just sixteen books on the shelves, the others being in circulation! The cards had been used in this case, and I found that the cards recorded an average use of fully ten loans per volume. The men were reading everything in sight. I have now located fourteen collections in use in the neighbourhood of Vladivostok. One of these collections is divided into six parts and another into four parts, the parts being located at different points. This makes twenty-two locations. There is perhaps one more in this vicinity, and there are two or three detachments that have no books. I have heard of four locations out along the railway—the letter from a regimental chaplain quoted before being from one of these— and books have gone with intelligence officers some way inland. . . . The work here has already started; and perhaps a policy of adaptation to an existing organization and of pushing rather than pulling will succeed better than a policy of aggressive reorganization. I should like to have extra cards in quantity, some ink, and, if possible, letter paper and envelopes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">15 December, 1918. At the beginning of this week I seemed at a loss how to proceed. However, I learned at the office of the Chief of Staff that a letter had recently been received there from Miss Mary Polk of Manila stating that a dozen or so boxes of books and periodicals had been sent by transport from the Philippines. So I started after these, ran into a mesh of red tape, and after some patient unwinding—during which I received most courteous treatment—I reached the following results—which make up my report for the week:— Location and Stock on Hand:—I have a medium-sized room for storage in a warehouse at the Base. The room is opposite the Base Post Office. Out of another warehouse I dug twenty-four boxes and three parcels, containing a few books and a welter of periodicals. These were moved to my store-room and opened—except in the case of a box marked for a detachment along the line. The result is the first stage of a mobilization of most of the periodicals in the East. It is chaos. I have considered topping it with a banner, "All is not literature that litters." Many of the contents have nor rhyme nor reason. Ancient financial and commercial journals, a run of "The Bowler's Magazine," periodicals for children, "The Ladies' Home Journal," "Butterick's Patterns," "The Delineator," "The Mother's Magazine," "Good Housekeeping," "The Woman's Homely Companion"—what is one to do with these? There are comparatively few books, but many of them are coverless, worm-eaten, decrepit. Yet in this chaff there is some fine grain. And I am greatly gladdened at the chance I now have for a wide distribution of this stock. . . . Methods of Distribution:—This week I got from head-quarters a full distribution and strength chart of this expedition, with an excellent blue-print map. This I have deposited in the safe at the Base Post Office. It will enable me to reach, in course of time, all the scattered detachments. My location at the Post Office enables me to make use of the mail orderlies going out to the detachments. In the last two days I have sent out two sets of books and four collections of periodicals. . . . Assistants:—For the moving I had a squad of Austrian prisoners (well-fed, cheerful fellows); and a colonel who got interested yesterday loaned me a soldier to open boxes. So far I have done all the sorting that has been done. Later I may have to get an assistant or two, particularly when I start out for an inspection of more distant detachments. (Last week, by the way, I sent letters to the commanding officers of various detachments explaining the wish of the A. L. A. to keep the camp libraries circulating. And the very mess in the store-room is proving something of an advertisement. Those who come to stare remain to browse.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">22 December, 1918. I have finished unpacking the boxes of periodicals which I reported last week. The periodicals have been sorted and I have now begun the more interesting work of making up sets to send out. Already twenty-eight sets have been made up for seventeen places. Some have been distributed, but thirteen mail sacks are ready for tomorrow. I hope to be able to send sets to all the detachments, large and small, of this expedition during the coming week—Christmas week. Thus do we introduce the short-story into the long Siberian night. I am very glad to have found this work to do while I am waiting for books to arrive; and it is teaching me locations and methods of transportation which ought certainly to be useful later. Because I have been much cramped for room in which to do the unpacking, sorting, selecting, and repacking of the periodicals, I have done practically all of this work alone, though I have had offers of help. This is making the job a rather long one. . . . In my position of "middleman" I am sure I can send to you and to the others who are making this war work possible the grateful Christmas greetings of the Expeditionary Force in Siberia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">29 December, 1918. On December 24th, I cabled to you: "For sending money Vladivostok branch Hongkong Shanghai Bank available." This Vladivostok branch did not appear on the list . . . and those who answered my inquiries were ignorant of it and seemed pessimistic about all the banks here. . . . During the past week I have put the finishing touches to the arrangement of my prize collection of periodicals, and have sent out twenty mail sacks and fifty other parcels of this machine gun literature. More than half of the contents of these boxes are now in the hands of the soldiers. The expressions of appreciation are not few. . . . It has been a very grimy job, and I have looked upon so many magazine-cover ladies that completely clothed women of intelligent mien are at a premium with me. But I repeat that I am heartily glad that I found this work. The work and the daily association with officers and men have given me more understanding of situation and personnel. Colonel S—— of the umpty-first infantry has been an almost daily visitor, and a result of his interest and initiative has been a regimental library with plans for development that promise practical success. The central library is used very largely. But the regiment is broken into detachments which are scattered over the country adjoining as thickly as the golf links of Scotland. So the branch system with exchanges has been worked out, and this past week three sets of from fifty to seventy-five volumes have been sent from the main collection to branches. All this is managed and controlled by the regiment, and the Colonel's desire is to have the books we supply him permanently a part of the regimental library. I have no instructions from you concerning this; but it seems to me that the plans have many advantages. I have been sending letters to the commanding officers of all the larger detachments of this expedition which are located at some distance from Vladivostok inquiring about the desire for books and about my chance of making each place a visit. The answers which I have received have been uniformly affirmative on both points. It was my plan at first to make a round of the various locations immediately, as I did here in the vicinity of the Base. But because the books received had already been distributed and local methods of control had been put into operation; because travelling is uncertain and difficult; and because the twenty-four boxes of old periodicals were hopelessly acquiring dust in a warehouse; I decided to wait until I actually had, not promises, but new books before taking to the novel experiences of the Siberian railway. . . . I realize . . . that you may even be reaching the Chestertonian conclusion expressed by one of the officers of this expedition that "warfare unfits one for the sterner pursuits of life." At any rate I shall be delighted when the hundred cases are here and explanations like those above will not be necessary. Meantime the Morale Officer has been sent off on distant service, and it is an advantage for our work to have someone here who can speak and act, when possible, for the American Library Association.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">5 January, 1919. There was a violent storm here on New Year's Day, and . . . consequently what is officially known as "transportation" has been interfered with. However, I have distributed twenty parcels of my diminishing stock of periodicals locally and have sent eight mail sacks of it out by the railway, and there are sixteen other parcels ready to go out. During the week I have unpacked the last of the twenty-four boxes which have been my stock in trade. These contained books; cruelly large cases they were. . . . At times this week, if it had not been for a Chinese tailor's attempt at a marine green uniform, I should have believed myself a librarian of the village life period in America. And the marine green has had its difficulties too; for these tomes have been more than musty. Cleanliness has been next to— impossible. However, I have got the contents of the two cases all out on box tops and beams and the floor, and I have, from a part of the collection, repacked six small boxes and made up four parcels, which have all found users. Three of the boxes are still awaiting "transportation" but may go tomorrow. One is to accompany a small detachment which is starting a long trip inland. In the curious difficulties, political and otherwise, which the American engineers are having in their endeavours toward railway improvement, "long" means time more than distance. A newspaper correspondent who had just come in made the journey from Omsk in five weeks! So the Manila Club may be blessed of these travellers. . . . Having won back space in which to turn around in my humble storeroom, I have arranged to have shelves put up this coming week. . . . This rough library and distributing room, which is located about ten feet across a hallway from the American Base Post Office, is becoming known, and shelves will be very useful. As an illustration that the place and work are becoming known, I can tell of requests that are coming in for special books as well as for periodicals. This past week these requests have included books on mathematics, English grammar, Spanish, economics, commerce, Russian history, and the Eastern question. Having such definite knowledge of needs I have not hesitated to send to a bookseller I knew in Shanghai a hurry order for about fifty books. Communications with Shanghai have been difficult recently, but this order is going by a Russian ship for that port, and I hope that the books can catch the return trip. This week the expressions of appreciation of work done and the offers of co-operation in my plans have continued to come in. . . . You will be interested in the response to a parcel of magazines and a letter that I sent to the Commanding Officer of the Legation Guard at Harbin:— "Dear Sir: Herewith acknowledge receipt of parcel of magazines received from you today. In thanking you for this shipment I would like to express my personal appreciation for the very good work done by the American Library Association in all the posts that I have seen in Siberia. "E. R. PERCY, "Captain, Infantry."</field>

      <field name="fulltext">12 January, 1919. There has just come by post from Miss Mary Polk, of Manila, a very welcome collection of supplies and information. I have been particularly eager to get printed or other matter about the working of the Camp Libraries in the States and overseas. . . . Miss Polk sent a supply of book cards and book pockets, which will be very useful—for gifts reaching me here and for purchases made through a Shanghai bookseller. She sent no book plates; at least I have as yet found none in the parcels. Speaking of book plates, may I add my humble words of congratulation to the person or persons who designed the fine A. L. A. plate? . . . I am hoping that, when word begins to come through directly from you, you will direct me what to do in the case of regimental libraries, or permanent libraries of other permanent units. . . . Of my prize collection of periodicals there are now only two "Japan Magazines" and twenty-five copies of the periodical that publishes over two million copies weekly. (An enlisted man remarked the other day that the Saturday Evening Post was too high-brow for him.) These periodicals have been sent to forty different detachments in forty-one mail sacks and 128 parcels. As I have a record of what has gone out, I am in a good position to go on with the distribution of periodicals. Of the old books from Manila I have sent out nine parcels and ten boxes, and I have about an equal number left. These books have been sent out "without strings" and I, personally, am in hopes that there will be no return. But this past week I have effected a volume for volume exchange of A. L. A. books which had been in the possession of five different detachments. There were 390 volumes exchanged. In passing I may say that I have made some effort to keep undesirable specimens out of the parcels of old books and periodicals that have been distributed. . . . With periodicals out and shelves going in, I am certainly in a position to get some new cases of books—you can imagine how my fingers itch to get hold of new books. And on Friday my eager search among the material deposited by the last transport was rewarded by the sight of eight or ten sure-enough Camp Library boxes. But a book in the hand is more of an achievement than I had known; for the boxes were addressed rather casually on tags to "R. W. Bayles, Y. M. C. A." or to "Helen Burr." And of course I could not get possession of the cases until something was established about the names. The names were, on investigation, not known to the American post office, the Y. M. C. A., or the Red Cross. That being clear, the Y. M. C. A. gave me a lever. For a special trip into Vladivostok resulted in the enclosed letter from Mr. Inglehart. The letter has released the cases, and I am to have them tomorrow. The investigation had other results. For in one of the Y. M. C. A. offices which I visited, I found five or six other new A. L. A. cases. These had been turned over to the Y. M. C. A. by people on the transport. . . .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">20 January, 1919. Yesterday I received by registered post from "The One Hundredth Bank, Ltd.," Tokyo, Japan, the following letter, under date of January eighth: . . . "We beg to enclose herewith a cheque payable at the Matsuda Bank for yen 3,720.93, being the equivalent of $2,000 at $53¾. Kindly acknowledge the receipt. Yours faithfully, For the One Hundredth Bank, (Signature successfully illegible) Per Pro Manager." About half of the first two thousand is still unused. I have drawn from it only my expenses. . . . The books specially wanted here and ordered from Shanghai have not yet come; hence that bill is outstanding. But the assistance rendered by the Red Cross in Shanghai not only made possible my coming when I did, but also materially reduced the cost. My assignment to the officers' quarters at the American Base in Siberia eliminated room rent and reduced board to cost ($1.25 a day during December). As prices are sky high in Vladivostok this is another material advantage. Most of the matter of transportation of books and periodicals has been taken care of by the Quartermaster's Department and the American Post Office. And the "Clearing House Library"—which is on the same floor in one of the base warehouses as the Quartermaster's Department and the Post Office—has, thanks to the Quartermaster, cost three roubles, or thirty-eight cents, which was paid at a Russian shop for a padlock. The shelves in the "Clearing House Library" were finished on Monday last, and an hour later the first of the real A. L. A. books—ten cases—arrived. I had several hours of sheer physical and mental enjoyment in getting the books arranged. The Y. M. C. A. had taken ten cases from the transport. . . . They had, previous to my call a week earlier, sent out three cases to distant detachments. But I should have sent cases to the same places, and the Y. M. C. A. are turning over to me full lists of the books sent. The seven cases which they still had are to be delivered to me tomorrow. My work with periodicals, my correspondence with distant detachments, and my constant association with officers at the officers' quarters and at the Base offices have given me considerable clue as to needs. And I find that the strength and location chart entrusted to me at Headquarters has put me in possession of better information on those points than even the Y. M. C. A. possesses. I plan to keep a constant stock of books at the "Clearing House Library" for regular library and reference purposes and to repack from there the cases to be sent out (hence the "Clearing House Library"). . . . This past week I have repacked five such cases and the contents of one case more or less have gone out from the "Clearing House Library" on loan. Incidentally an interested colonel has promised to furnish a library attendant for the "Clearing House Library" when the opportune time comes for me to go on a visitation to other locations. . . . The cases I have repacked contain a somewhat smaller proportion of reference books, because I have wanted to keep a stock of these on hand at the "Clearing House Library." Because of the location of this small place with the large name, it is likely to have borrowers in which the proportion of officers is comparatively large—and of course it will be the only "central" library. Perhaps the best proof of the quality of the users would be a list of what has been borrowed from the "Clearing House Library." To save space I will give the first twenty of the new books taken out: Adkins. Historical backgrounds. (Captain) Austin. Unchanged Russia. (Captain) Bairnsfather. Fragments from France. (Lieutenant) Boyer and Speranski. Russian reader. (Sergeant) Breasted. Ancient times. (Lieutenant) Churchill. Traveller in war time. (Lieutenant) Doyle. Study in scarlet. (Lieutenant) Duruy. General history of the world, v. 1. (Sergeant) Fairbanks. Laugh and live. (Private) Fish. Development of American nationality. (Lieutenant) Futrelle. My lady's garter. (Captain) Graham. The way of Martha and the way of Mary. (Lieutenant) Hazen. Alsace-Lorraine. (Lieutenant) Hazen. Europe since 1815. (Lieutenant) Milyoukov. Russian realities and problems. (Captain) Pagé. How to run an automobile. (Private) Poole. The dark people. (Lieutenant) Robinson. Mediæval and modern times. (Lieutenant) Wells. Tono-Bungay. (Captain) Wiener. Interpretation of the Russian people. (Captain) I ought to add that in the past day or two the proportion of enlisted men has been higher. But the list will make clear my meaning that the location is good for a reference library. I am eager to get the other cases that are on the way. These Siberian cities are not lacking in temptations; moreover the thrill of the war is over; moreover most of the men want to go home. Books, periodicals, and games have an influence for good on morale than can well nigh be demonstrated mathematically. Every case that comes now will have its part in that influence. The selection of books in the A. L. A. cases is admirable indeed. The single criticism I have heard is the lack of standard poetry. I have myself admired the evidences of open-mindedness and careful selection combined. . . . A little incident of last week is unique in my library experiences. . . . A door-filling specimen of an enlisted man, who had borrowed Douglas Fairbanks' "Laugh and Live," brought it back, mildly disgusted. "This ain't what I want. I thought it was a funny book." "And you didn't find it funny?" I inquired. "Naw. Say, have you got anything like Elinor Glyn's `Three Weeks?' Elinor Glyn's so— so— well, scientific, you know." The adjective gave me a sudden coughing fit. But it also gave me an answer. "Perhaps you are interested in eugenics." However this wasn't any more helpful than I had expected it to be. So the man started out to help himself. He made a laborious tour of the shelves. Finally with a grunt that seemed to mingle satisfaction with doubt he pulled out a volume and handed it to me for record. "I guess that'll do. I'll try it anyway." It was "Marriage a la mode." Thus is virtue its own (Mrs. Humph)ry Ward! Among the papers sent me by Miss Polk, I have found and read eagerly a typewritten copy of your "The A. L. A. Follows the Flag Overseas." It is a thrilling account and most illuminating to me. Having such material as this and having shelves and books, I have at last the happy sensation of being "on my job." . . .</field>

      <field name="fulltext">26 January, 1919. This past week has been a fairly busy one. Now that I am able to get really to work with real cases of real A. L. A. books, perhaps you will not have to wade through such lengthy screeds from me. . . . Last week I reported to you the details of the quest of seven cases of books, which had gone to the Y. M. C. A. All the difficulties which had not previously arisen in that quest emerged this week. However, I got the cases on Thursday. . . . One of the seven cases was short about twenty or twenty-five books. I judge that the case had been opened en route. I have written to the Director of the Y. M. C. A. in Vladivostok for any possible clue about the missing volumes. This past week one case of books turned up in the Quartermaster's warehouse. It had been at the bottom of a few tons of miscellaneous boxes. The Quartermaster's department is now looking sharply for A. L. A. cases, and is cooperating with me very pleasantly. . . . All the cases have been unpacked at the Clearing House and Reference Library, and eleven have been repacked for distribution. The repacking has been done according to my information about local needs. The use of the reference library continues to grow. I had an illustration of the change in the appearance of that thirty-eight cent Clearing House and Reference Library recently. The enlisted man who was loaned to me several weeks ago to help open and unpack the twenty-four boxes of old periodicals and books nearly broke his back and did break his hatchet over the job. When I dismissed him the mess was beyond my powers of description. I judge that the soldier thought the situation was hopeless. For he didn't come back until one afternoon this past week. Meantime the periodicals had been distributed, the boxes and the room cleaned out, shelves put in, and books arranged on the shelves. As I glanced up from my work I saw him standing in the door, with mouth wide open. At my nod he fairly exploded: "My God, you've got it cleaned up!" On that previous day he had, while rubbing his back, confided in me that he wanted to read a book by Marie Corelli. This time it was waiting for him. The books I ventured to order from Shanghai have not yet come. But new requests have come in, and I am going this week to venture again, for certain books on mineralogy, chemistry, medicine, history, and English. These requests seem to me legitimate, as they are for special reference use, chiefly for classes which have been started among the soldiers. During the week I have had an exchange of letters with the Y. M. C. A. Director in Vladivostok concerning details of cooperation. I have also had a long conference with the Secretary in charge of Y. M. C. A. transportation over the same matter. In view of my advantageous connection with the army, both in the location of my work room and of my quarters, it has seemed to me wise to maintain my independence to the extent that I can everywhere deal directly with the commanding officers of detachments.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2 February, 1919. . . . The use of the little Clearing House and Reference Library has increased beyond my expectations. And the cases which I have been able to distribute from the twenty-one received (three of which were sent out by the Y. M. C. A.) have only whetted the appetite for more. I shall be grievously disappointed if the next transport—due in about a week—does not bring a number of cases. Little has happened during the week except this growing use and this demand for more books. The Y. M. C. A. has, however, appointed a new man to take charge of their library business, and he came at once to see me. I think we can work together with pleasure and profit. The Red Cross is not dealing much with books, but I have during the week had another satisfactory conference with the head of their work among soldiers. During the week I learned that one of the officers of the Expedition (a professor of history in an eastern college) might be relieved of other duties in order to give courses of lectures at various points. I got from him a list of reference books bearing on his subjects, and sent to Shanghai for copies of these, in order that the camp libraries might "carry on" his work. . . . The Commanding General has paid a brief visit to the Clearing House and Reference Library; one day this week the Chief of Staff sent a messenger out from Vladivostok to the Base for a reference work which fortunately was there. But it is the enlisted men who are responsible for the increased use of this C. H. and R. L. at the Base.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">9 February, 1919. On February 4th, I received the following cable message: . . . "Shall we subscribe magazines continue book shipments how many." Because of three reasons I have so far delayed my answer. The first is that on the sixth two mails from the States were due—it seemed better to wait for information which letters might contain. . . . The second reason was that a transport was to arrive on the sixth, and my answer to the cablegram would depend on the number of cases of books which I might receive. The Quartermaster's manifest bore the glad news that there were sixty-six cases on board, consigned to the Commanding General. The Quartermaster's Corps are interested in the A. L. A., and show a pronounced desire to be helpful in every way. But on account of the ice in the harbor, transport's freight had to be unloaded down the bay and carried out to the Base; and late last evening these cases had not been located in the warehouse where they could be counted, and turned over to me. . . . So that this second reason for delay still exists. The third reason is that the answer to the cablegram depends also on information from Headquarters here about the probable duration of this expedition. And before I ask for such information I want to have the facts about the number of cases of books now in hand. . . . These sixty-six cases may, of course, contain soap or toothpicks or rubber shoes. I am trying to steel myself to further delays. But the very prospect that I may now be able to do something worth while has proved the finest tonic. My morale, whatever that may mean, has bounded upward at the news. My plan is to place fifty cases as rapidly as I can, put an assistant in charge of the little Clearing House and Reference Library, and then go out to visit the various detachments. . . . Yielding to the hope that the reported cases did not contain soap or toothpicks or rubber, yesterday I robbed the little library at the Base to send a box of books to an army hospital, the Commanding Officer of which, a colonel, had sent an urgent request for such reading matter. Another indication of the need for books here came this week in a letter from the chaplain of a regiment at Habarovsk. . . . "The box of books sent by you on the 27th inst. (January) was received yesterday and acknowledgment of your favor is hereby made. The box will be preserved as suggested by you. I have never seen a finer collection of books for soldiers distributed among the men than has been sent me by the A. L. A. And I do not know just how we could have gotten on without them in this far-away place. The men's entertainment is very limited." . . . Of the old books from Manila I have recently sent one parcel to an army hospital and another to a little "troupe" of soldiers who have been giving a minstrel show at the different army locations. Having been reference librarian at Princeton for five years, I am not without experience in the range of reference questions. But yesterday I got one from an embarrassed corporal which even the justly praised selection in the A. L. A. cases failed to answer. After waiting until no one besides himself and your representative was in the little library, he sidled up and asked, "How can one get married in Vladivostok?" The "one" was, of course, the speaker; and the girl, a Russian. The answer was a matter for commanding officers and consuls to express. But the query led to two long conversations in the library, and gave me an opportunity to try to make sure that the boy did not altogether blink the future in the glamour of the present. I suppose that here is a bit of our new internationalism. And the United States has two millions overseas!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">17 February, 1919. . . . Now I have both letters and books. In quantity too. . . . Your words, "Your plan of action seems the only wise one," gave me immense relief. I have felt the aim of the American Library Association War Service. That explains my coming to Siberia. But I was anxious lest my lack of any experience in camp library methods should make my efforts appear futile to you from the very start. Thank you for the letter of appointment and the letter of introduction to General Graves. . . . Your cable message of 19 December, 1918, "Money cabled supplies sent above address first payment deposited Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Shanghai," has never reached me. I shall write at once to China about this. But is it possible that this is the sum received by me from the First Hundredth Bank, Ltd., of Tokyo, in January? . . . There are three possibilities arising out of the length of stay of the Expedition. Of course if the Expedition itself should withdraw before the end of April, there would be no problem. If the Expedition should remain only a month or two longer than that, I realize that my withdrawal would mean a heavy expense for the A. L. A. For I believe that there should be a representative here, if possible, when things are cleared up. And I think it quite possible that a short extension of my leave might be arranged. But if the Expedition is to remain for a longer period, there would be much more difficulty. . . . You will probably be able to ascertain the plans for the Expedition in Washington more promptly than I in Siberia. An attempt of mine to do that here a few days ago was utterly fruitless. . . . With the Chief of Staff I took up another matter. When I arrived in Siberia, the Morale Officer, Captain Moore, said that he had received and distributed about fifty cases of A. L. A. books. I inquired for a record of the places to which the cases had been sent. The Morale Officer told me that he had made such a list, but that it had got mislaid. However, he gave me the locations so far as he recalled them, and I wrote these down. My later investigations convinced me that Captain Moore had made a wise distribution and had put the A. L. A. under considerable obligations of gratitude. Those investigations also revealed that my word-of-mouth list accounted for only about half of the fifty cases; and that the distribution had been quite free-and-easy. . . . Meantime Captain Moore had been sent off on special service inland. Very recently he has been recalled from that special service and has been ordered home. While he was in Vladivostok on his way, I made another attempt to get a full list. But though he agreed to make another search, there was no result. So I asked the Chief of Staff if he would consent to ask the detachment commanders for some statement of the A. L. A. books in their commands. This he has agreed to do, and the order has just gone out. I explained the lack of records and said that such an order would not only help to remedy that lack but would also aid in the pro rata distribution of new books and in the planning for the disposal of the books when the Expedition should leave. But I sorely fear that when the A. L. A. roll is called in this Expedition, the proportion of lost or not accounted for will be strikingly large. . . . Certainly I am now more anxious to distribute the new books than I am to find the old ones. The presence of a few cases of technical books has been a great boon. . . . They came among the sixty-six cases just received. And the books for special classes which were ordered from Shanghai have just arrived—at least the bill of lading has come. The list that came with the bill of lading indicates that we shall get a surprisingly large proportion of the works ordered. . . . After I received the cases last week I managed to unpack twenty and to prepare eight for transportation to five locations. I don't know that this record is not a cause for blushing rather than for pride, for the results somehow look meagre. . . .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">23 February, 1919. I have taken the opportunity to go over your letter of January ninth and the two sets of circular instructions more carefully. . . . As yet I have not discovered an answer to my question concerning the ultimate disposal of books. . . . Next as regards the shipment of books from Manila and from San Francisco. . . . When I arrived in December, of the fifty-five cases, twenty-four were in the Quartermaster's warehouse, having arrived but a short time before. The others had apparently been disposed of among the forces by the Quartermaster's Department. One of the twenty-four cases was addressed to a regiment with headquarters at Habarovsk, and I sent this on without opening. Of the others all but five or six contained periodicals. These I distributed as I have previously reported. Two boxes of good books I turned over to the Colonel in command at the American Base, for his regimental library—a very successful institution. There were two huge boxes of books, many of them old and worn and worm-eaten and all having two or three club labels pasted on the covers. I repacked ten smaller boxes from these and sent them to various places—a hospital, isolated stations, and so on. Several hundred of these remain. I have permitted them to be taken as gifts and have continued to distribute them myself as opportunity offered—when a new ward was opened in a nearby hospital, when a "troupe" of soldiers went off to perform at various detachments, when a Red Cross guard went to Omsk, when I learned of a handful of signal corps men at a point on the railway. About a hundred and fifty newer books I kept until I received some cards and pockets from Miss Polk—for I found none of the books in the cases equipped with cards and pockets—and with this hundred and fifty I was able to effect the beginnings of an exchange of A. L. A. books which had previously been distributed. This exchange affected five different detachments. On the January transport from San Francisco, which reached here early this month, there were sixty-six cases. In January twenty-two cases arrived. . . . I have asked the Y. M. C. A. for a statement as to the total number of A. L. A. cases they have handled. . . . The request for receipts, from the various commanding officers of detachments, of A. L. A. cases in their charge has so far brought no information that I had not previously received by word of mouth from Captain Moore. So the matter of the A. L. A. books in Siberia seems to be of a piece with the whole Russian question. A new Y. M. C. A. man has recently been put in charge of their books, and I sent him as full a list as I had of the distribution of the earlier A. L. A. cases and a full list of the distribution and of the plans for distribution of the cases that have come to me. I asked him to favor me with a similar record of the distribution of Y. M. C. A. books so that we could cover the field and avoid congestion. . . . I have endeavoured to keep the A. L. A. independent as a war service agency. There has been no particular problem involved in this, except that I have insisted on sending books to commanding officers instead of directly to Y. M. C. A. secretaries and I have urged against the requirement of deposits or fees or fines. . . . The use of the library by enlisted men has much increased, and conclusions drawn from the experience of the first day would no longer hold. . . . One day this past week . . . of the sixty-two books drawn out fifteen were non-fiction (seven of these being on subjects connected with Russia). The borrowers had been: majors, 3; lieutenants, 2; sergeants, 5; corporal, 1; privates, 43; field clerks, 4; postal agents, 3; Y. M. C. A. secretary, 1. A box of books on special subjects connected with classes instituted hereabouts, which I ordered from Shanghai some weeks ago, has arrived and the books are in use. It took me the greater part of one morning and all of one afternoon (two trips into Vladivostok) to get the little box through the customs. A more facile pen than mine could make a yarn for the Saturday Evening Post out of the experience. In the process I saw twelve different Russian officials and collected a waste paper basket full of documents. . . .* * A fuller description of this experience is given in an extract from a letter to Mrs. Clemons published at the end of this collection. On the mail with your letters came a supply of periodicals which the Post Office turned over to me. These have been largely distributed, a specialty being hospitals. I have also unpacked eight cases and repacked five since I wrote last. The Commanding Officer at the Base has promised me a Camp Librarian for the Clearing House Library so that I shall be more free for the work of distribution. I have no information about the plans of the Expedition, but small shifts in location are not infrequent—which possibly indicate that complete withdrawal is not to be immediate and certainly indicate that the A. L. A. representative should try to keep up with the changes. (To get ready for one little shift has occupied me through Washington's birthday and today.) . . .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2 March, 1919. Notice has reached me by letter from San Francisco that on the March transport, the "Thomas," which is due to arrive this coming week, there are thirty-four cases of books for me and four for the transport. . . . I shall then have received one hundred and twenty-two altogether. If twenty more are sent in response to my recent cablegram, there will be an adequate supply for this expedition at its present strength. Of the eighty-eight cases which have been received at this writing, sixty-three have so far been unpacked at the Clearing House Library and thirty-four repacked and distributed among eighteen detachments or hospitals. A letter has just been received from the Commanding Officer at Spasskoe. At that station the books are in charge of the Y. M. C. A. Secretary, and the Commanding Officer enclosed a report from the Secretary as to the use of the books: "Portions of the library have been established at the Hospital and elsewhere for the convenience of the men. The central library, housed in the Y. M. C. A. building, shows unusual activity for a small library. For example: the daily distribution of books for the week of February tenth illustrates this point:— February 10 54 February 11 65 February 12 58 February 13 42 February 14 63 February 15 66 February 16 72 Total 420 books. Considering the fact that the total number of books in the library is less than 450 volumes you can see that few libraries can show an activity in circulation equal to ours. The War Service Library has met and is meeting a real need." This past week the Vladivostok Y. M. C. A. Secretary in charge of their distribution of books answered my last letter about cooperation by a call at the Clearing House Library. . . . He said that, in view of the A. L. A. supply of books and the Y. M. C. A. lack of them, the latter organization now wished to limit its book business to the International Hut in Vladivostok and two sets for the personal use of Secretaries, and to leave all distribution among the detachments of the A. E. F. Siberia to the A. L. A. This means that the local Y. Secretaries will continue to supervise the use of books, when that work is turned over to them by the commanding officers, and that requests for books and other suggestions will come to me. . . . On the heels of the Y. M. C. A. man came the Red Cross man in charge of their work among the soldiers of the Expedition. He handles a few books and periodicals, but distributes these almost solely among the hospitals. I had been trying for several weeks to have him come to the Clearing House Library to look over my work and plans, and to make suggestions. As a result of the visit he readily agreed to give me the benefit of his observations gained on his frequent trips, to spy out the land as it were. I am glad to have this good feeling and this prospect of valuable cooperation. For one thing, it will somewhat make up for my present inability to visit the distant detachments. That inability is a handicap. But there have been compensations, not only through the Red Cross and the Y. M. C. A., but more particularly through my residence among the shifting body of officers at the Base, the almost daily visits and encouragement of the Commanding Officer at the Base, and through the connection with the Post Office. The enlisted man in charge of the mail car has brought in information about small and isolated detachments that would otherwise have probably remained unknown. I realize that the work of unpacking and repacking the cases delays things. But I believe that the results justify this. . . . The repacking enables me to keep one copy of each important book for the Clearing House and Reference Library, to remedy the occasional instances of duplication in the cases, and to select the books in each case for the particular detachment for whom it is destined. This last point of course adds much pleasure to my work. An amusing instance of the result occurred this week. To a "garage detachment" in the country nearby I sent a case flavored with works on gasoline engines, with automobile guides, and with Williamson stories. The lieutenant in charge came in early the next morning and said that he and his men had been almost fighting for the technical books on their subject. He said that if I had books like that, he wanted something on refrigeration! He got it. One cannot forsee all that a man may want. But if one gives him something of what he wants, he is more likely to have confidence in one's ability to supply the rest. I have been asking for an assistant at the Clearing House Library. This week I was assigned a German prisoner! You remarked in your recent letter that the situation here seemed unique. Is a German prisoner Camp Librarian unique? But he uses English well, has a very fair education and an astonishing knowledge of books, and appears to be accurate and a hard worker. I feared lest the soldiers would resent getting information about the simple library regulations from him. But there has been no evidence of this so far. . . . I have certainly been able to work faster with his help. . . .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">9 March, 1919. The transport "Thomas" has arrived with A. L. A. cases, but as these are unloaded by the Quartermaster's Corps, turned over to the Commanding General, turned back to the Q. M. C., and turned over to me, it will probably be several days before my "turn" comes. Of the eighty-eight cases previously received I have now unpacked seventy-eight and repacked for distribution forty-five. The little Clearing House Library is the gainer by this process, and its use continues at a satisfactory rate. The German prisoner Camp Librarian, Petzsch (conveniently pronounced "Page"), has been of much assistance to me. . . . My hope to have a chance to visit the various posts of the Expedition is still delayed in fulfilment. It has seemed to me that the distribution of the books should be continued up to a certain point before I leave the Base; and certain shifts that are now going on within the Expedition can best be cared for, so far as books are concerned, by my remaining at this center. I could wish, however, that I had a double or triple personality. . . . In mentioning the transport "Thomas" I omitted one matter. . . . Four cases containing 200 books on board for use during the voyage . . . had been received by a Y. M. C. A. man, Mr. Tanner, I believe, and had been turned over by him to the enlisted men going to Manila. The books seem to have been well used. Mr. Tanner will carry out the plan of having the four cases make the round trip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">16 March, 1919. The thirty-four cases for the A. E. F. Siberia have been turned over to me. As yet I have not discovered the case of supplies, but this may possibly be at the bottom of the pile. The American Chief of Staff was yesterday not yet able to suggest the proper answer to your question about ordering periodicals. Certain movements towards a redistribution of the Expedition would seem to indicate that there will be no complete withdrawal before April Thirtieth. Hence, I opened the question in my cablegram of having my leave of absence extended. . . . Miss Polk wrote me that she was willing to devote a part of her leave to carry on the work here. It was a fine offer, I thought. But the location of the Clearing House Library at the Base and the general nature of the work as it has developed would seem to make it difficult for a woman to undertake to carry it on. I have now unpacked all the cases received before the last lot of thirty-four, and two of these new ones. The total unpacked is therefore ninety. Of these, fifty-six have been repacked and distributed, the other books being on the shelves in the Clearing House Library. The contents of about six cases are out in circulation from that central library, however. I have been able to supply troops going recently to new stations as they have started. This past week the Red Cross man in charge of their work among the soldiers, Mr. Short, visited me on his return from a trip and reported that the recent distribution of books was meeting the need very satisfactorily. . . . To three recent Red Cross trains for the interior I have supplied reading matter, putting the books in charge of the detachment of the A. E. F. Siberia, which acts as guard. The guard makes the round trip and the officer in charge takes the responsibility for the books. Both guard and Red Cross people seem to appreciate this, as railway travelling in Siberia is still of a character to bring white hairs to the head of Father Time. I have completed arrangements with the Y. M. C. A. about stocking the International Hut in Vladivostok with books. This Hut is used not only by Americans but also by Russians, Czecko-Slovaks, and Japanese, and one problem was concerning the loan of books. The Y. M. C. A. plan had been to charge a money deposit. As a result no books have been taken on loan, all the reading taking place in the library room. It seemed better to make the general rule that all use of books be limited to the library, thus rendering the matter of fees unnecessary. Of course the American soldiers can borrow from their own detachments or from the Clearing House Library out at the Base. I shall have, in this case, to depart from my rule of turning books over to A. E. F. commanding officers in each detachment, as the Y. M. C. A. Secretary in charge of the Hut is there the C. O. But I have agreed to this, and am glad not only to make this extension of our work but also to have a practical monopoly of the book business. This ought effectively to prevent duplication of effort. . . . This past week I withdrew from the Red Cross the balance of the first two thousand dollars, amounting to seven hundred ninety-nine dollars, and deposited it in the newly opened agency of the National City Bank of New York. The deposit had to be in Russian money. But roubles happened to be particularly cheap. . . . The deposit is therefore 9,747 roubles, 80 kopecks—which seems like a lot of money! However, Russian money is wretched stuff at present, and counterfeits are everywhere. I had a forty rouble note turned back when I sent the cablegram yesterday—the cablegram costing 497 roubles and 42 kopecks incidentally. The second two thousand was exchanged at the One Hundredth Bank, Ltd., of Tokyo, for yen 3,720.93 (at the rate of 53¾) and deposited in the Vladivostok Branch of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. . . . With money in yen and sen and roubles and kopecks, your representative in Siberia hath feelings of an addled brain. One other matter. As the "Brooklyn" is now at Vladivostok I have called on the Captain and ascertained that no A. L. A. books had been received by that vessel. Three cases have therefore been repacked and delivered to the Brooklyn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">23 March, 1919. This week the Chief of Staff went over with me the situation concerning the withdrawal of the Expedition. . . . The conference was specifically about the answer, [&amp;c.] The Chief of Staff finally suggested that periodicals might be ordered for the permanent units. . . . In case of any withdrawals the periodicals would, of course, follow these units to their new location. . . . I shall also, in my next cablegram, send some inquiry about the point raised in the following letter, received this week from the Captain of the "Brooklyn," the flagship of the United States Asiatic Fleet:— March 21, 1919. . . . The three boxes of books containing respectively, 69 71 and 71 volumes, were promptly received and have been placed in the crew's library of this vessel. I need hardly assure you that the acquisition of a new collection of books at this time and place was especially gratifying. I have to further advise you that the U. S. S. Ajax leaves Vladivostok in the very near future for the Yangtse River. It has occurred to me that you might desire to take advantage of this opportunity to forward such books as may be available via the Ajax for further distribution to the seven United States gun boats stationed on the Yangtse River. . . . Action on this involves the extension of my power as your representative to cover the United States Asiatic Fleet. . . . A more immediate difficulty is the matter of the stock of books for the Expedition. . . . However, I know something about the lonely life on those little gunboats plying up and down the Yangtse, and I am strongly inclined to send three or four cases to Captain Kearney for the Ajax itself and for the gunboats it may find at Shanghai. The Asiatic Fleet may be useful at the end of this expedition as the "ultimate consumer" of some of the A. L. A. books now in Siberia. Among the 34 cases received on the March transport I have discovered the case marked "Supplies." . . . The pocket and book card scheme has been most successful here. . . . Of the cases distributed I have simply retained lists, for record and to enable me to avoid undue duplication in sending several cases to one center. . . . I received a small supply of books from Shanghai. . . . I feel that this unauthorized expenditure of mine has been, at least to some degree, justified by the delight of those who needed the particular books. Three medical works of recent edition brought an unusual expression of grateful feeling from a major of the Medical Corps. The use of a little set —six—of textbooks in English for foreigners is out of the ordinary; some of the enlisted men in a company out on the line wanted them in order to conduct classes in English among poor Russians. . . . Shortly after my last letter I sent two copies of a Saint Patrick's Day paper issued by the 31st Infantry. This contained a very gratifying account of A. L. A. activities, written, I understand, by the Editor. Incidentally it is going to help here in advertising our work. The write-up was unexpected by me, but I am hoping you will credit me with it in place of one of those news-literary effusions urgently requested by a recent A. L. A. circular. The German prisoner Camp Librarian, Petzsch, is doing very well. He seems intelligent, industrious, and accurate. The soldiers appear to like him, and I have found him a very friendly sort. The way he clicks his heels at me when I speak is doubtless most satisfactory too, Through him I have distributed some of the old Manila books among the prisoners. Petzsch is himself doing a good bit of reading in the evenings, sometimes in authors whom I suggest, and this is increasing his usefulness as a librarian of books in English. (However the extraordinary number of books on the war makes one subject rather amusingly delicate.) A morning or two ago Petzsch told me a pathetic story. It seems that he had for the evening previous borrowed Bret Harte's little parodies on then-current novels. He said that he laughed over them till the tears ran down his cheeks. Then he called some prisoner friends around and read aloud to them. "Finally," he concluded, "it was too much. We lay down on the floor back to back and wept together."</field>

      <field name="fulltext">30 March, 1919. Last week I gave you the reasons for making the subscriptions for periodicals. . . . The colonels . . . have expressed pleasure at the idea of receiving these periodicals. I enclose a copy of the signed letter from Colonel Styer. To report that the four cases of periodicals on the transport have been "received" is a bit premature, for they have not yet reached me. But I am very glad to have a stock of periodicals again. After the distribution of books this past two months, a change to magazines will make a fine touch of variety; and I believe the Expedition will appreciate the new munitions. With Colonel Styer's letter I am also sending a note from an enlisted man who has been teaching a class or two in one of the companies, and for whom I ordered a book or two from Shanghai. Captain Lawrence Packard, Ph. D. (Professor at the University of Rochester), has been delivering a series of excellent and stimulating lectures on history and allied subjects, and I am glad to be able to report that the presence of books sent in the regular cases or specially ordered from Shanghai has enabled him to supplement his lectures with reading courses and examinations. Captain Packard has done efficient service in keeping up morale in detachments of the Expedition by this means. A copy of Mr. Koch's "War Libraries and Allied Subjects" has reached me this week. I have given myself the privilege of being the first borrower, and have found the essays most interesting and suggestive and stimulating. (Enclosure.) Headquarters. Habarovsk, Siberia,March 27, 1919.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Harry Clemons, American Library Association, Vladivostok. My dear Mr. Clemons: In reply to yours of March 23rd, I beg to say that we will appreciate very much receiving the periodicals you mention. If they are addressed to the Headquarters of the Regiment, the Chaplain will attend to their distribution in case our companies are scattered in a number of places. . . . I would like to place on record with you at this time the thanks and deep appreciation of myself and the whole regiment for the work of the Association. Only those who have served under present conditions, during a long Siberian winter, very far from home, can tell what benefit your work has been to our men. . . . (Signed) HENRY D. STYER, Colonel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">6 April, 1919. This past week I have received your letter of February twenty-first and two cable messages. . . . As soon as the first of the two cable messages had arrived, I took it to the Commanding Officer at the American Base, where the central library is located, and to the Chief of Staff at Headquarters in Vladivostok. . . . The former officer, Colonel Sargent, who is almost a daily visitor at the library and whose interest and helpfulness have been extraordinary, at once suggested the sending of a representative to take my place. The Chief of Staff, however, has not been able to keep so cognizant of the A. L. A. work, though he has occasionally used our books and has always been most courteous and free of access; and he asked for a day or two to look into the book question. Yesterday, as no word had come from him, I went into Headquarters again, and had the best conference on the A. L. A. work we have so far had. He was frankly anxious about the type of representative who might be sent in an expedition consisting so largely of civilian recruits so far from home in a country so different from the United States in its ideas of drink, drainage, and divorce. . . . He did go over exactly the question raised in your letter of the twenty-first of February, namely, whether some officer or enlisted man could not handle the A. L. A. work after my departure. But after a considerable discussion of various possibilities of this sort, it seemed fairly clear to us both that an acceptable A. L. A. representative offered the best solution. . . . Should a newly appointed representative come by the May transport—the earliest that now seems possible—he could not arrive here before the fourth of June. If he should take a liner to Japan, however, and change there for a steamer to Vladivostok, he could reach here soon after the middle of May. It would be greatly to his advantage if he could take a trip to Haborovsk while I go on with the work here; and then I could go to China overland and investigate possibilities for books at Harbin, Peking, and Tientsin. . . . Your letter has been very good reading and its information has helped me greatly. Since it came I have been able to meet certain questions much more like a real "representative." The foremost of these questions has been that of the "Permanent Disposition of Books." I have informed Colonel Sargent—who first raised the question because of its bearing on the regimental library—and Colonel Robinson of your statement, and both seem to appreciate the attitude of the A. L. A. The stationery which this letter is returning in such quantity came in one of the four boxes of periodicals which were received by me from the Logan. Any stationery is much at a premium in the A. E. F. Siberia, and this will help me considerably in advertising the A. L. A. besides. The A. L. A. signs were very gratefully received also. Did my cablegram from Nagasaki for A. L. A. insignia go astray? My marine green uniform has had to remain thus far quite innocent of distinguishing marks. However, in view of the epaulets and badges which some of our allies here wear, perhaps to have none is to render one peculiarly distinguished. On April first I sent a statement of my expenses to that date. . . . To return to more pleasant subjects, the past has been a week of periodicals. In addition to the 1,300 received in the four boxes from San Francisco, about three hundred came on boats from Manila and from Shanghai. Due largely to the German prisoner Petzsch's intelligent and vigorous work, we had this collection sorted, tied in bundles, and the distribution begun in two days. One day Petzsch, going from the prisoners' barracks to the library, noticed a railway car used by a "troupe" of enlisted men from Habarovsk who are making a tour of the Expedition, giving a minstrel show and other "stunts." He at once suggested that periodicals be placed on that car, since it has become the home of that "troupe" for a month or so. . . . I am taking measures towards a consolidation of two collections of books at Headquarters and of drawing in certain collections in detachments at the Base, which can easily use the places where books are located. Indeed that number varies constantly. Just at present there are thirty-five places where at least a case of books is located, extending from wherever the flagship "Brooklyn" happens now to be to wherever in Clearing House Library . . . slightly reducing the number of European Russia the recent Red Cross trains have penetrated —each train has an A. E. F. guard and each guard an A. L. A. case of books. There are fourteen of the thirty-five which have larger collections, and these extend from Vladivostok to a place near Lake Baikal with a name that probably would be most successfully pronounced in hay fever season.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">13 April, 1919. This week a box of periodicals sent by the United States Soldiers' Christian Aid Association, George Breck, Esq., Secretary, 5 Beekman Street, New York City, was turned over to me for distribution. The periodicals have been distributed and the gift acknowledged. This morning the United States transport "Sheridan" arrived with five cases of war manuals, vocational books, etc. These are still in the hands of the Quartermaster's Corps, but will reach me soon. They are very welcome. I visited the "Sheridan" and found that some books and periodicals had been supplied to the enlisted men on board; but on the officers' deck the book cupboard was bare. I have arranged to have one case of books put on deck, and will notify Mr. Richards in San Francisco. I did the same for the "Logan"—the transport before this one. . . . A letter dated March 13th has come from Mr. C. G. Dickson announcing the approach of a Corona typewriter and other supplies. The news is welcome indeed. My methods in this work have had to be laughably primitive in many ways. . . . Mr. Dickson writes that he is sending some boxes of ink tablets. That is very wise. My efforts to get ink from Shanghai resulted in a broken bottle and a frozen, black cylinder within. Fortunately this had been well packed, and I was able to get the thing out of the box of books in which it came with little damage to anything except me and the floor. The accounts with Messrs. Edward Evans and Sons, Ltd., of Shanghai, covering the books purchased by post, have at last arrived. At first the amounts were in Chinese currency. There were liberal discounts allowed, but it struck me that even so the prices ranged high. The rate of exchange demanded when one buys articles in China is much higher than the rate received when one sells gold. So I asked to have the transaction put in terms of gold. . . . They did put sixty-three books for which they had charged $142.91 in Chinese currency into gold prices and the total was $93.86 gold. The first amount of $142.91 ought to exchange at $119.09 gold— about $25.23 gold was saved by asking for gold prices. I wonder if I have yet confessed one Shanghai purchase. In January, I found the A. E. F. Siberia very short on 1919 calendars. So I got eight inexpensive but decorative wall calendars and distributed them among the heads of the Expedition with the compliments of the A. L. A. . . . In regard to the [International] Hut matter: . . . with some care I selected about 400 volumes filling five cases, and had them ready on March 20th, the date on which they were to be called for. Nothing happened. About a week later I discovered that the Secretary was planning to leave, and I made two trips into Vladivostok to assure myself that there would be no hitch. . . . But nothing happened. After his departure I made two visits (four in all on this business) on the Secretary in charge of the Hut. . . . He expressed his willingness to receive the A. L. A. books, but did not seem aware of the plan to remove the Y books. . . . The Y. M. C. A. heads here expressed ignorance of the plan for the Hut formulated by the late Secretary on books; and directed him to keep the Y. books in the Hut. As this at once removed the reason for putting A. L. A. books there, I suggested that two collections would be unnecessary and might prove embarassing to him, and proposed that the Hut plan be dropped. He accepted the proposal and—that's the end of the story. . . . No, not quite the end. For, meantime I had been trying to consolidate two separate collections of books started by Captain Moore at Headquarters in Vladivostok. And I could now ask for the return of those two collections . . . and could put this specially selected collection of five cases into a new union library at Headquarters. . . . When the five new cases arrived on the "Sheridan" today, my reserve stock had been reduced to seven unopened cases. But this past week I have started quite a business in exchanging books. . . . Early in the week the Chief of Staff made a visit of inspection to my little library at the Base. This was a result of the conference reported in my letter of last week. One incidental matter and I shall have finished this unduly long letter. Two or three times recently, as I have noticed one donor's name appearing in several good books, I have ventured to send the donor a note of appreciation. . . . But I have not had time or opportunity to do this many times.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">20 April, 1919. . . . Up to the present I have repacked, listed, and distributed eighty-two cases. . . . [To continue] my attempts to cover the whole Expedition and to make the distribution of books so far as possible proportional to the strength of the detachments . . . now means a redistribution of books, and a redistribution from centers outside of Vladivostok and the Base—from centers, that is, which are going to be reduced in strength. Hence, I have been waiting for a fortnight or so, and shall continue to do so until it becomes clear how the troops are to be located. . . . Because of censorship restrictions I have not written fully about these larger and more important matters of Library War Service in the Expedition. But about little incidents, especially those centering about the little Clearing House Library at the Base, I have been verbose indeed. Therefore, to revert to type, I am going to drop here to the little incident level. In my struggles with the myriad of periodicals that occupied my time last December, I noticed that I had a call or two for something with pictures suitable for decorating barracks rooms. I finally conceived the plan of laying aside certain magazines that made a specialty of pictures that might be cut out. And it is surprising how much use has been made of this little pile. . . . Just at present I am having a hard cold, a temporary attack of lameness, some visitors, and a touch of ptomaine poisoning; so perhaps it is just as well that the distribution has been held up for a bit. But I have been able to be at the library at least a part of every day this past week.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">27 April, 1919. . . . By repacking each case of books sent out from the Clearing House Library (eighty-seven cases have thus far been so repacked) and retaining a list of the contents, I have been able to build up collections of books that were largely free from duplication and that contained a proportion and type of non-fiction books adapted to the local use—at least such has been my purpose. It is altogether probable that in the redistribution of troops the larger collections have been broken up into smaller collections and repacked for this purpose in such a way that I have no longer any use for my lists. The plans for the redistribution of troops have been carried out rapidly and my appeals to the various centers for information about the books have thus far brought not a single response. Of course, where companies have gone out from the Base at Vladivostok I have been able to handle the matter as before. But the troops from centers like Habarovsk have gone from those centers, they are now on the way, and, though the sectors to be guarded are known, the actual locations of the entrained troops will depend on the discovery of suitable barracks by the Commanding Officers; hence, these ultimate locations are not known even at Head-quarters in Vladivostok. However, I presume that all of these troops have books from the former collections, so that the chief difficulty is that I do not know just what books each detachment has. And just as this difficulty has arisen a possible way out has also appeared. . . . A newly-arrived first lieutenant, Mr. Herbert A. Horgan, has very recently been appointed Morale Officer for the Expedition. . . . Together we worked out a method by which the new information I need can be gathered by the sub Morale Officers he proposes to have appointed at each location. If this method is successful, I shall be able to have the work reorganized by the time my successor appears. . . . The distances will be north to Habarovsk, some 450 miles, and west to Baikal City, nearly 2,000 miles. . . . Captain Moore placed a case of books with the American Russian Railway Service Corps (the R. R. S.) while the corps was marooned in Vladivostok during the wait for railway developments. This winter I have exchanged that case for a fresh one and added another—the use of the books has been more than ordinary. Now the railway men are scattered all over the line in very small detachments. The Y. M. C. A. has undertaken to fit out a special car to maintain touch with these men. Working through the R. R. S., who will continue to assume responsibility for the books, I have put two cases on this car, and the "Y" man in charge has undertaken to feed these out to the R. R. S. men—a travelling library. I shall keep one case at R. R. S. Headquarters in Vladivostok, and exchanges can be effected as necessary. . . . The little Clearing House Library at the Base . . . loaned 1,571 books during March, of which 402 were non-fiction. That library needs an Encyclopædia and some books on law. The new Morale Officer is a Harvard Law School man and is one of those who has asked for law books. . . . Throughout the Expedition, books on Russia or on Russian are in demand. At least three little books on Russian have appeared on sale in one of the Vladivostok shops, and I have bought a set for the library at the Base. If cards printed as notices for overdue books are available, they will save labor here. . . . The five cases which came on the last boat fitted us up finely for poetry and war manuals. And the sets of Zane Grey and the other new books in recent cases have gone like the proverbial hot cakes. The interest of Headquarters in the library at the Base seems to be increasing. Both the Chief Surgeon and the Inspector General visited the library for the first time this past week. Both took books and both have repeated the visit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4 May, 1919. . . . I have written two short letters containing lists of books desired by Captain Ward of the Intelligence Department and by Lieutenant Horgan, the Morale Officer. On Monday, I was informed by the Chief of Staff that the War Department in Washington, had by cable raised the question whether an army officer might not be detailed as my successor. . . . I am in a typical army condition of uncertainty about my "relief." . . . The Chief of Staff has asked me to prepare a report of Library War Service in this Expedition. I have completed a first draft and hope to have the whole finished so that I can enclose a copy to you next week. By the "Sherman" came three cases of "books and supplies," and also, from the freight clerk, two or three bags of periodicals. None of these has yet penetrated "army channels" far enough to reach me, however. As the freight clerk and the Quartermaster agent on the "Sherman" both assured me that they had an ample supply of books on board I did not put any on this transport. However, the library shelves seemed noticeably bare; and I gave to an enlisted man, who is making the trip from here, some magazines for distribution, and to an officer a few books, to be added later to the ship's library. . . . The money situation is serious here. The Russian money has dropped greatly in value during a few weeks. When I came here the exchange was about eight roubles for one dollar. Now it is twenty-five or more for a dollar. I deposited $799 in the new branch of the National City Bank of New York in March, which at 12.20 amounted to 9,747.80 roubles—the bank would accept only rouble accounts. . . . There seems to be nothing to do but hold the account in the hope that the Russian money may recover value. There are 2,559.17 yen in the Vladivostok Branch of the Hongkong Banking Corporation; this ought to equal $1,500 gold, but there is some loss here, too, in exchange. . . .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">11 May, 1919. No cable . . . no message about my relief has been received. The cable business here is extraordinarily slow and uncertain. Your message of March fourteenth did not reach me until the end of the month. . . . The administration of this Expedition amid huge distances and such means of communication and transportation is one of the feats of the war. . . . The last manifest from Mr. Richards, stating shipments from San Francisco during the week ending April fifth, mentioned three boxes holding 100 volumes and supplies. . . . Two cases came by the U. S. T. "Sherman." The two contained 133 volumes and supplies. . . . The supplies included all the articles mentioned in Mr. C. G. Dickson's letter to me of March thirteenth, except the Corona typewriter, and also included the envelope of A. L. A. insignia. (This letter is written on sheets from that paper, with ink prepared by prescription—somewhat homeopathic—from the tablets, and by a representative wearing insignia). . . . It has been a busy week, and one that would have convinced me, if I had not been already convinced, that effective control of this work requires that some one be steadily at hand at the Base library, keeping ears open, policies fixed, and plans fluid, and being on the mark for a sprint of hard work at any moment. With apparently every source for information working, I find that I recently missed a Red Cross train for the interior with its A. E. F. Siberia guard making the round trip. Yesterday a strange Red Cross man wildly trying to get some canned goods at the Base Library gave me a clue which two hours later resulted in the Lieutenant, in command of the guard for that train, and his man receiving in pleased surprise a specially packed case of books for the six or eight weeks' trip. . . . At the beginning of a military movement neither officers nor men seem to have a chance to think of anything so secondary as reading matter munitions. . . .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">18 May, 1919. Chaplain Loughran [appointed my successor] is one of the four chaplains who arrived a fortnight ago on the transport "Sherman." He has been assigned to the Base, lives at the officers' mess where I have been staying, and a simple chapel room is being made for him in warehouse number three, one wall of the chapel serving also as a wall of the Base Library. So his work will be centralized—the feast of reason on one side and the flow of soul on the other. He is Catholic. Already he has made a good impression for energy and for ability to get on with the men. . . . On Wednesday, the fourteenth, I closed the Base Library and with Petzsch and two other German prisoners helping, had a thorough housecleaning. The low walls of the Library were also carried up to the ceiling by a burlap-covered framework so that the books will be much more free from warehouse dust. . . . Chaplain Loughran has obtained another German prisoner assistant, a man named Leuteritz, to assist Petzsch. Yesterday afternoon I gave Petzsch, who has been unusually efficient, a present of ten dollars. Did I write you that he recently read at my suggestion Professor Phelps's "Advance of the English novel," and that he has since been going steadily through a list of fifty or more novels so that he will know something about the subject and be able to advise the men who ask about books? He gets on very well with the American soldiers—the point about which I had some fear. . . . Chaplain Loughran will "take over" the work tomorrow, the nineteenth of May, and, orders will go out to that effect from Headquarters. . . . My plan is to visit the detachments in Harbin, Peking, and Tientsin, so you are still far away from seeing the end of my correspondence.</field>
