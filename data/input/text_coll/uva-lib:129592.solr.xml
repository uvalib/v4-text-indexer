HISTORICAL STATEMENT While the original organization of the Academic Schools of the University by Jefferson contemplated instruction of graduate grade in each School, the first "post-graduate department" in the modern sense was instituted in 1859-60 by Basil L. Gildersleeve, then Professor of Greek in the institution. The degree of Master of Arts continued to be conferred upon graduates in all six Schools of the University. Professor Gildersleeve conducted graduate courses in the School of Greek; shortly after the Civil War a "post-graduate department" was announced for the School of Latin. Graduate courses were offered in individual Schools, but there was no general department organization for graduate study until 1904. In that year the Department of Graduate Studies was established as a regular co-ordinate division of the University, with definitely prescribed regulations corresponding to the requirements of the Association of American Universities, in which the University of Virginia was the first Southern university to hold membership. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy had, however, been offered by the University as far back as 1880. The present requirements for graduate degrees, with minor modifications, have been in force since 1904. THE GRADUATE HOUSE The Graduate House, administrative headquarters of the Department of Graduate Studies, is on West Lawn. Besides the Dean's office, this building contains one large lecture-room for graduate classes and three seminar rooms on the second floor specially equipped for small groups of students and professors engaged in advanced graduate work. Each seminar room has a small library for the use of advanced graduate students in the courses conducted in that room. The building is therefore the administrative office of the Department and the workshop of its humanistic section. At present the class-rooms are used by certain C and D classes in the Schools of English, History, Philosophy, Economics, Biblical Literature, and Political Science. The central location of this house and its proximity to the General Library make it particularly adapted to departmental use. LIBRARY FACILITIES The University Libraries contain 158,557 volumes. Departmental libraries, notably those of the Scientific Schools, the Classical, the English, the Social Sciences, and the Heck Memorial Library of the Department of Education, have about 40,000 volumes. Graduate students may, through the office of the General Library, get certain books needed in research from other libraries on the interlibrary loan system. Library facilities for graduate study, both in arts and sciences, are excellent. GRADUATE CLUBS Several general meetings of the students and officials of the Graduate Department are held during the session for professional and social purposes. Addresses are delivered by members of the Faculty or by visiting scholars. Besides these general conferences there are regular weekly or bi-weekly meetings of graduate students and professors for discussion of topics connected with graduate study. Papers are presented on the progress of certain investigations by the writers, some of which are published as monographs, or contributed to technical journals. These clubs are stimulating centers of research activity. The scientific society of Sigma Xi is an important organization for the advancement of technical knowledge. The University Committee on Research, while not specifically an organization of the Department of Graduate Studies, is a valuable auxiliary of the Department. This committee administers an annual appropriation for promoting research in the various Departments of the University, especially in the matter of the publication of the results of original investigation, and so aids the general cause of advanced scholarship. An annual volume, "Publications and Research," containing summaries of contributions by professors and students of the Graduate Department, is issued by the University. SCIENTIFIC LABORATORIES Each Scientific School occupies a separate building with an extensive laboratory and a select departmental library. Statements in regard to laboratories and general scientific equipment in the Schools of Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Geology, and Physics may be found under the announcements of those Schools. More detailed information is contained in the General Catalogue. ORGANIZATION The immediate direction of the Department of Graduate Studies is vested in the Dean and an Administrative Committee of seven professors, appointed by the President, two of whom serve only during the Summer Quarter. The Faculty of the Graduate Department consists of those professors in the Academic Schools who offer graduate courses. Courses marked C are for graduates and advanced undergraduates; those marked D are for graduates only. The prerequisites for each course are indicated, varying from six to twelve session-hours of college work. The various Schools, or departments, fall into three general divisions, or groups, as follows: Group IâLanguages, Literature, Fine Arts, and Music. English, French, German, Greek, Latin, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Biblical Literature, Architecture, Music. Group IIâSocial and Philosophical Sciences. Commerce, Economics, Education, History, Philosophy, Psychology, Political Science, Sociology. Group IIIâMathematical and Natural Sciences. Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Geology, Mathematics, Physics. REGISTRATION Every graduate student, new or old, is required to register at the office of the Dean of the Department, Graduate House, West Lawn, where he will be advised in regard to a program of studies. The first three days of the session are devoted to registration. Every applicant for admission to the Graduate Department as candidate for a degree must file with the Dean an official transcript of his college record. Admission to the Department does not necessarily imply acceptance for candidacy for a degree. All applications will be passed upon by the Committee on Rules and Courses of the Department of Graduate Studies early in the first term, and each applicant will be formally notified by the Dean of the tentative approval of his candidacy. The final approval of his candidacy will depend upon his record during the first term, or quarter, of his residence. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Admission to the Department.âFor admission to the Department of Graduate Studies a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank is required, for men and women alike. In order to become a candidate for a degree, the student must be advanced to candidacy by the Committee on Rules and Courses upon formal application, as set forth below. Advancement to Candidacy for a Degree.âAny graduate student who wishes to become a candidate for a degree must file with the Dean of the Department his application on a blank form to be secured from the Dean's Secretary. This application must include a proposed program of work arranged in accordance with the requirements for the several degrees as stated below, and must be accompanied, in case the applicant does not hold an academic degree from this University, by an official transcript of the applicant's academic record made out by the Registrar of the institution from which the baccalaureate degree was received, and by a catalogue of that institution, marked to show the courses of study pursued. The application will be submitted by the Dean to the Committee on Rules and Courses, who will consider it in conference with the professors concerned. The Committee will have the right to require that the applicant add to his program any courses, undergraduate or graduate, considered necessary to supply his deficiencies, or to enable him to pursue with profit the courses he has selected. When the program has been finally approved, the Dean will report to the applicant his advancement to candidacy for a degree. It should be distinctly understood that graduate degrees are not conferred merely upon the basis of the number of courses passed, or of the length of time spent in resident or non-resident work, but upon the basis of the quality and scope of the candidate's knowledge, and his power of investigation in his chosen field of study. Candidates whose training and attainments are inferior cannot expect to secure a degree in the normal length of time estimated below for the respective degrees. As a prerequisite to full candidacy for a Master's degree, at least six collegiate session-hours of foreign language credit are required. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES Master of Arts.âThe degree of Master of Arts will be conferred upon the holder of a degree of Bachelor of Arts who has fulfilled the following requirements: (1) The successful completion, in not less than one full year of resident graduate work, of the program of studies approved for the candidate by the Committee on Rules and Courses, as embodied in his formal application for advancement to candidacy. This application must be submitted not later than one week after registration, in the year in which it is expected that the degree will be conferred. The program must form a consistent plan of work, to be pursued with some definite aim, and grouped around some one subject to be known as the candidate's Major Subject, the name of which will be incorporated in the body of each diploma conferring the degree. The program should be arranged in consultation with the professors concerned, and must be approved in writing by a professor of the candidate's Major Subject, who shall be designated by the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies, after consultation with the candidate. (2) The preparation and submission of a thesis, to be accepted as satisfactory by the professor of the candidate's Major Subject. Two copies of the thesis, typewritten on paper of prescribed quality and size, and substantially bound, must be deposited in the office of the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies not later than May 15 of the year in which it is expected that the degree will be conferred.

Master of Science.âThe degree of Master of Science will be conferred upon the holder of a degree of Bachelor of Science who fulfills requirements corresponding to those stated above for the degree of Master of Arts. The degree of Master of Science, like that of Master of Arts, is regarded as a cultural rather than a professional degree and the prerequisites for candidacy, including a reading knowledge of foreign languages, are estimated accordingly. No extension or correspondence courses will be credited toward a Master's degree. Doctor of Philosophy.âThe degree of Doctor of Philosophy will be conferred upon the holder of a baccalaureate degree who has fulfilled the following requirements: (1) The successful completion, in not less than three full years of graduate work, of the program of studies approved for the candidate by the Committee on Rules and Courses, as embodied in the student's formal application for advancement to candidacy. This application must be submitted not later than October 1 of the session preceding the final year of candidacy for the degree. The program of studies must include a Major Subject, pursued for at least three years, and one Minor Subject, pursued for at least one year. The Minor Subject must be closely related to the Major Subject, and the program as a whole must contribute to the mastery of some definite field of of knowledge as an object of study and research. The name of the Major Subject will be incorporated in the body of the diploma conferring the degree. At least two years of graduate study must be spent in residence. By special permission of the Committee on Rules and Courses the student may be allowed to complete his dissertation in absentia. Upon advancement to candidacy the Dean will appoint a special committee of not less than three Professors, under the Chairmanship of the Professor of the candidate's Major Subject, and including a representative of the Committee on Rules and Courses. This committee will conduct the candidate's final examinations, and pass upon his dissertation. (2) A reading knowledge of French and German sufficient to enable the student to use these languages for purposes of research. This knowledge shall be attested by passing examinations in French and German, set by the professors of these languages, in consultation with the Professor of the Major Subject, not later than October 1 of the session preceding the final academic year of candidacy for the degree. Upon recommendation of the professor of the Major Subject, and at the discretion of the Committee on Rules and Courses, some other language may be substituted for either French or German. (3) A final examination, written, oral, or both, in addition to all examinations in course, upon such phases of the Major Subject and of allied subjects, as the special committee shall prescribe. No candidate can be admitted to the final examination until his dissertation has been accepted. Preliminary examinations may in addition be required by individual schools, as stated under the announcements of these Schools. (4) A Dissertation exhibiting independent research in some branch of the candidate's Major Subject, submitted to the Special Committee not later than April 15 of the last year of candidacy. The copy submitted shall be typewritten upon paper of prescribed quality and size, and shall be substantially bound. The cover shall bear the title of the dissertation and the name of the writer, and the title page shall bear the words: A Dissertation presented to the Academic Faculty of the University of Virginia in candidacy for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Upon approval of the dissertation the candidate must arrange for the publication, at the earliest practicable date, of the whole or such portions of the dissertation as the special committee shall direct. If publication prior to the conferring of the degree be impracticable, the candidate must deposit with the Bursar a sum of money sufficient to cover the cost of 50 copies, which shall be the property of the University Library. Two copies, in addition, must be placed in the office of the Dean of the Graduate Department. Grade.âA graduate student's standing in a course is indicated not by a numerical grade, but by one of the following terms: Distinguished, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory. Only those courses marked C and D may be counted toward a graduate degree. Summer Session.âThe Master's degree may be won by properly qualified persons in three full Summer Quarters. In no case will this degree be conferred without resident graduate study during three quarters, the equivalent in time of the regular session. Not more than two graduate courses each term of the Summer Quarter will be credited toward the degree except by special permission of the Dean and the Committee concerned. At least twelve session-hours of graduate work are required for the Master's degree. A candidate for the Master's degree in the Summer Quarter must register with the Dean of the Graduate Department and submit a program of studies in accordance with the regulations prescribed for admission to candidacy for that degree in the regular session. In addition to the preparation of a thesis, a final examination, written or oral, upon the program of study and acceptable to the Professor of the candidate's Major Subject in the regular session of the University, will be required. Graduate Students in the Summer Quarter are required to make their Masters' degrees within five summers after admission to full candidacy. Graduate students are strongly advised to continue their residence during one or more terms of the regular session. APPROXIMATE SUMMARY OF NECESSARY EXPENSES The figures in the following tables may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of nine months. As necessary expenses are reckoned here university and tuition fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. For each department three estimates are givenâa low, an average, and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundryâin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. If a student shares a room with another student, and practices the strictest economy, he may possibly reduce his expenses below the low estimate. VIRGINIANS NON-VIRGINIANS Low Average Liberal Low Average Liberal University Fee $ 50 $ 50 $ 50 $ 60 $ 60 $ 60 Tuition Fee 40 40 40 215 215 215 Laboratory Fees (average) 10 10 10 10 10 10 Room, Heat, Light, Furniture and Service 50 115 180 50 115 180 Board 200 250 300 200 250 300 Books 25 30 35 25 30 35 Laundry 25 35 50 25 35 50 Total for Session of Nine Months $400 $530 $665 $585 $715 $850 For detailed information as to fees, rooms, and board, see the General Catalogue.
