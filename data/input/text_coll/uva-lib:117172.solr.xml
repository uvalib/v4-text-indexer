For information as to lodging, board, expenses, etc., and for catalogues and other printed matter, address the Registrar. A General Catalogue containing more detailed information with respect to the University as a whole, may be had on application to the Registrar. For other information, address the Dean of the Department of Law. Historical.âAmong the original Schools contemplated in Mr. Jefferson's plan for the organization of the University of Virginia was "Law: Municipal and Foreign; Embracing the General Principles, Theory and Practice of Jurisprudence, together with the Theory and Principles of Constitutional Government." Accordingly the School of Law was established in 1826, and has been in continuous operation since. From the establishment of the Law School until 1894, the course comprised the work of a single year. With the session of 1894-1895, a two years' course was inaugurated, which continued up to the session of 1909-1910, when the course was extended to three years. The aim of the Department of Law has always been to maintain a high standard as a requirement for graduationâthe degree being conferred only upon such students as are thorough masters of the prescribed course of study. This policy has been rigorously enforced, and its wisdom has been vindicated by the high position which the graduates of the Law School are accustomed to attain at the bar and in public life. The course of instruction has been extended from time to time to conform to changing conditions and to meet the increasing needs of the profession. Minor Hall.âThe Law School is accommodated in its own building, designated as Minor Hall, in honor of the late John B. Minor, whose distinguished service of fifty years as a professor in the Law School, the University thus commemorates. The building is located between Dawson's Row and the southern end of West Range. The architecture is on classic lines, in keeping with the general design of the other university buildings. It contains on the first floor four large lecture halls, with convenient offices, lavatories, etc., and on the second floor a stack room with ample space for books, two commodious reading rooms, and a number of offices for the use of the librarian and the teaching staff. Law Library.âThe Library contains sixteen thousand volumes. Its financial resources, from appropriations by the Visitors, and from income from special endowments, make possible substantial additions annually. The Library contains the English Reports, practically complete, from and including the Year Books to date; the United States Supreme Court Reports; reports of all the American States; the National Reporter System, complete; selected and annotated reports, together with modern search-books in the form of general Digests, and the leading Encyclopedias, besides a large collection of textbooks, bound volumes of law magazines, etc. Law students have the privileges of the general University Library, containing more than ninety thousand volumes. The Library is the beneficiary of three special endowments; one of $10,000, the gift of William W. Fuller, Esq. ('78); another of $10,000, the gift of Farrell Dabney Minor, Esq. ('83) and Mrs. Minor, in memory of their son, the late Lieutenant Farrell Dabney Minor, Jr. ('11), who died in France (1918), from wounds received in battle; and one of $5,100, the gift of the Coolidge Family of Boston as a memorial to their distinguished ancestor, Thomas Jefferson. In 1922 the late Judge George Moffett Harrison (LL.B. 1870) judge of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia from 1895 to 1917, and president of the Court from 1916 to 1917, presented his entire well selected law library of several hundred volumes to the Law School; and the Honorable John Bassett Moore (1880), Permanent Court of International Justice at the Hague, donated an especially fine collection of books on International Law, designated as the John Bassett Moore Library of International Law, which is regularly receiving additions through the generosity of the donor. In memory of Raleigh Colston Minor the alumni and active members of Minor Inn of Phi Delta Phi have made a gift to the University for the establishment and maintenance of a section of the Law Library, on Legal Ethics and Legal History. The Virginia Law Review.âUnder the title of The Virginia Law Review, the undergraduate students of the Law School conduct a law journal devoted to the discussion of general questions of American jurisprudence. Eight numbers are issued annually, from October to May inclusive. The Review is now in its tenth volume. From its inception it has maintained a high standard of excellence, and a worthy rank among the leading law journals of the country. Association of American Law Schools.âThe Law School is a member of the Association of American Law Schools. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. Suggestions as to Preliminary Education.âStudents, and their parents or guardians, are admonished that the law is peculiarly an intellectual profession, and for its successful prosecution, whether in a law school or in the broader fields of professional life, demands a well-trained mind. If it be true that untrained recruits, in rare instances, under diligent and persistent effort, develop into successful practitioners after entrance upon the practice, such exceptional cases but serve to illustrate the rule that out of a given number of candidates entering upon the study of law, those with sound preliminary training will have incomparably the advantage, while those without such training are likely never to rise above mediocrity in their profession. The experience of the Law Facultyâindeed, of all law teachersâis, that the standing and progress of law students may, in general, be measured by their academic preparation. Students are therefore advised not to begin their legal studies until they have completed an academic course approximating that required for a baccalaureate degree. So high a standard, however, is not exacted as a condition of entrance into the Law School. These conditions are shown in the following sections. 1. Regular Students.âCandidates for the degree of Bachelor of Laws must have attained the age of nineteen years (counting to the nearest birthday) before entering the department, must produce a certificate of good character from the school or college last attended, or from other satisfactory source, and must conform to the general requirements following: For Admission to the Department of Law, in addition to the completion of an approved high school course of four years, or its equivalent, the candidate must present evidence that he has pursued at least two years of standard college work, of which he must have successfully completed at least twenty-four session-hours, distributed among three or more courses, and exclusive of courses in Art, Music, Commercial Law, Education (Course B3, as described in the bulletin of the Department of Education of this University, or its equivalent completed elsewhere, will be accepted), Physical or Military Training, and Public Speaking. A session-hour is one hour a week of recitation, or two hours a week of laboratory work, throughout the college year. Credit will be given for completed courses only. A completed course is one for which the student is entitled to final credit toward a baccalaureate degree. It is deemed advisable that in preparation for entering the Law School the student select his courses from among the following subjects: English, Latin, French or Spanish, History, a Natural Science, Mathematics, Government, Accounting, and for students of more than average maturity Economics, Logic and Ethics. Prospective law students should take notice that the minimum college hours here indicated will be increased to 27 session hours of standard college work beginning with the session of 1926-27. Admission of Women.âWith the beginning of the session 1920-21, women were admitted to the Law School for the first time. The conditions of their admission are the same as in the case of male applicants. Forensic Debating.âAs indicated in a preceding regulation, Forensic Debating is excluded from the category of courses accepted in fulfillment of entrance requirements. This course, however, as one of the required subjects in the regular curriculum of the Law School, may be substituted by the completion of an equivalent course in the College of this university, or other institution of collegiate rank, evidenced by proper certificate. But the student is advised to defer the pursuit of this course until entrance into the Law School. The High School Subjects for Admission to the College, and their values in units are indicated in the General Catalogue of the University, in connection with that department. Evidence of the Required High School and College Work must be in the form of a certificate, properly authenticated by the Registrar or other authorized official of the institution at which the work was done. 2. Special Students.âAn applicant who is at least 23 years old, and who presents proper evidence of good character, and of needful maturity and training, though unable to fulfill the foregoing entrance requirements, may, by special action of the Law Faculty, in exceptional cases, be admitted as a special student, and not as a candidate for the degree. Every applicant for admission as a special student is required to make written application to the Dean of the Law School, on a blank furnished for the purpose, with detailed information as to his age, general habits, his educational and business experience, and his general fitness to undertake the study of law. Such application, together with such testimonials as may be required, should be filed with the Dean of the Law School not later than September 1 of the year in which the applicant desires to enter the Law School. Every such applicant for admission as a special student must (if required) pass a satisfactory examination, to be held at the University during the registration days of the session. The examination, which will be conducted by a committee of the Law Faculty, may include the subjects of English, American and English History, and Civil Government. This regulation is subject to the general university regulation as to delayed entrance examinations. Special students who fail to complete 60 per cent. of the work taken during any session may be declared ineligible for readmission the following session. Admission with Credits.âNo advanced standing, or other credit, is given, in any case, for attendance at another law school, nor for time spent in private reading.1. 1. Credit may be received, however, for Forensic Debating. See above. The candidate for graduation must spend three years in residence, and pursue all required courses in the curriculum, and pass the regular examinations therein. GENERAL INFORMATION. The Session begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September, and continues for thirty-nine weeks, ending about June 15. The first three days of the session are given to registration, and all students, both old and new, are required during that time to place their names upon the books of the University and the rolls of their respective classes. Lecture courses begin on the Monday following, and absences will be recorded against any student not present from the opening lecture of each course. Students entering after the first three days, without satisfactory excuse, will be charged a fee for registration. The session is divided into Three Terms. The first term ends December 23; the second, March 21; and the third, with the close of the session. Late Entrance.âStudents are advised that late entrance upon the work of any term is a serious hindrance to progress. The student who enters late must begin his work at the point to which the several courses have advanced at the time of his entrance; and credit for three years' attendance cannot be secured unless the student is in actual residence at least thirty weeks per session. No registration in absentia is permissible. When Students May Enter.âIt is highly desirable that students of any year, and particularly those entering the work of the first year, should enter at the beginning of the year's work which they propose to pursue. Where this is impossible students may register at the beginning of the second term, but not later, save in exceptional cases. In case of such late entrance the student's chief handicap (often a serious one) will be lack of familiarity with preceding courses, on some of which his own work may be based. Entrance at the beginning of the later term, therefore, is not advised, but only permitted. Where the student has thus entered in a later term, he may not make up the work of the earlier term except by returning for such portion of a fourth year as is covered by the term omitted. Expenses.âThe necessary expenses of a student in the Department of Law may be estimated at $500 per session of nine months. This minimum estimate includes all university and tuition fees, board, lodging, laundry and books. An average estimate would be $600 per session, reckoning living expenses at a somewhat higher figure. The university fee applicable to all law students (including those from Virginia) is $60; and the tuition fee is $160 for the regular work of each session. Three Years' Course.âThe course of study embraces three years of thirty-seven weeks each, exclusive of holidays. Residence for three years, with attendance of at least thirty weeks a year, exclusive of holidays, is essential to graduation. Plan of Instruction.âThe instruction is sought to be made as thorough as possible, and is given mainly through textbooks and lectures, supplemented in some of the courses by the study of cases. While convinced of the value of the combined textbook and lecture system, which has prevailed for more than half a century in the Law School, the Law Faculty have long appreciated the value that the study of cases possesses, in illustrating the practical application of legal principles. The present organization of the Law School gives opportunity for more emphasis on this form of instruction, and the case-book is now used more extensively than here-toforeânot as supplanting, but as supplementing, textbooks and lectures. The daily oral quiz has long been a marked and, as experience has proved, a most valuable feature of the system of instruction. This oral quiz is supplemented by frequent written tests, the results of which are carefully recorded, and, in the professor's discretion, are considered in estimating the final grade of the student. Practical Work.âIn the procedural courses, in Forensic Debating, and in Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, special stress is laid upon practical work. In the course on Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, an intimate acquaintance with law books and skill in their use are secured by oral and written quizzes, and finally by practical tests; and briefs on assigned topics are required to be prepared according to rigorous standards. Much practical work is done in the headnoting of cases, on scientific principles. Required for Graduation.âThe degree of Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) is conferred upon such students as have satisfied the entrance requirements; have attended three full sessions of the Law School; and have successfully passed the required examinations, with satisfactory performance of assigned practical work. More specifically, the candidate for graduation must have completed all of the obligatory courses (see Outline of Courses, below), and at least two elective courses, one of which must be Virginia Pleading or Code Pleading. SCHOLARSHIPS. The Louis Bennett Scholarship in the Department of Law, with a yearly income of two hundred and fifty dollars. Founded in 1920 by Mrs. Sallie Maxwell Bennett in memory of her husband, Hon. Louis Bennett, '71, of Weston, W. Va. The holder must be a deserving young man, preference being given to students from West Virginia. In case there are no applicants from West Virginia the award is to be made to a student from Virginia. Appointment will be made upon the recommendation of the Dean of the Department of Law. The Virginia Law Review Scholarship in the Department of Law, with an income of two hundred dollars. Founded in 1914. Annually awarded to the Editor-in-Chief of the Virginia Law Review. The William E. Homes Scholarship in the Department of Law, with a yearly income of sixty dollars.

The Daniel Harmon Scholarship in the Department of Law; emolument, the remission of the tuition and university fees. Founded in 1912 "in consideration of the distinguished service rendered by Daniel Harmon, '82, as a member of the Board of Visitors." The holder must be "a young Virginian of ability, character, and need." The Charles Minor Blackford Prize in the Department of Law was established through the liberality of Mrs. Susan Colston Blackford, of Lynchburg, Va., in memory of her husband, the late Charles Minor Blackford, a distinguished alumnus of the Law School. The prize consists of fifty dollars in cash, and is awarded each year to a student in the Department of Law for the best essay on some legal or sociological subject. General Scholarships.âThere are other scholarships applicable to all departments. These are described in the General University Catalogue. Special inquiries with reference to these scholarships should be addressed to the Dean of the University. THE WILLIAM H. WHITE FOUNDATION. This Foundation was established in 1922 by a gift of $10,000 by Mrs. Emma Gray White, widow, Mrs. Emma Gray Trigg, daughter, and W. H. Landon White and William H. White, Jr., sons, of the late William H. White, a distinguished Alumnus and for many years a Visitor of the University. The conditions require that the income be used in securing each session the delivery before the University Law School of a series of lectures, preferably not less than three in number, by a jurist or publicist, who is specially distinguished in some branch of jurisprudence, domestic, international, or foreign; that the lecturer present some fresh or unfamiliar aspect of his subject. Each series of lectures shall possess such unity that they may be published in book form; and that the copyright thereof shall vest in the Foundation. The first lectures under the William H. White Foundation were delivered during the session of 1923-24 by Dean Roscoe Pound of the Harvard Law School, upon the subject of "Codification." OUTLINE OF COURSES. The schedule, as outlined below, contemplates an average of ten lecture periods (or fifteen hours) per week.

Hours of Examinations: Morning: 9 A. M. to 2 P. M. Afternoon: 3 P. M. to 6:30 P. M. GENERAL REGULATIONS. 1. Registration of New Students.âBefore registration in the Law School, students who have not before been registered in any department of the University must produce to the Dean of the Law School (office in Minor Hall) a proper certificate indicating that entrance requirements have been fulfilled. 2. Registration Generally.âStudents must register in advance at the office of the Dean of the Law School and with the Registrar for every course taken, and no credit will be given for work done in any course without proper registration therefor. 3. Delayed Registration.âStudents are not permitted to delay their registration through carelessness or for inadequate reasons. Any student, new or old, who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session, and between the hours of nine a. m. and two p. m. on the first week-day after the Christmas Recess, will be charged a special registration fee of five dollars. 4. Exchange or Omission of Courses.âAfter registration no course may be exchanged or omitted except on the written approval of the professor in charge and of the Dean. 5. Carrying Over Uncompleted Work.âStudents who are deficient in the work of one year will be permitted to take but a limited amount of the work of the succeeding year. 6. Minimum for Which Student Must Register.âNo student, without special permission, and for good cause, may register for less than nine periods per week. 7. Advanced Work.âStudents of one year are not permitted to anticipate the courses of a subsequent year, without urgent reasons satisfactory to the Dean. 8. Late Entrance into Classes.âNo credit is given for the completion of any course upon which the student has entered after fifty per centum of the lectures thereon have been delivered. See requirements for Graduation, ante, p. 8. 9. Optional Attendance.âA student who has attended the required lectures on any subject but has failed on the examination, may, on written application, with the endorsed approval of the professor in charge, and of the Dean, secure optional attendance on such subjects the following session, but subject to Regulation 5. Re-examinations are granted only in this form, or in that designated in Regulation 17, infra. 10. General Requirements.âEvery student of the Law School is required to attend all regular exercises of the classes of which he is a member, and to perform all the work assigned, including quizzes and examinations, unless excused for good cause. 11. Invalids.âStudents whose condition of health is too precarious to permit regular attendance upon lectures, but not serious enough to admit them as patients of the hospital, will be required to withdraw from the University until able to resume their regular work. 12. Conditions of Readmission.âAny student who, without satisfactory cause, has not attained for the session, on his examinations, credit for courses comprising in the aggregate at least 150 lecture periods, will be excluded from the Law School the following session. In this connection, attention is called to Regulation 5 foregoing. 13. First-Year Students.âFailure on the part of any first-year student, without just cause, to attain, for the first term, an average grade of 75 per cent. on the daily written quizzes, will place such student on probation for the remainder of the session, and the student and his parent or guardian will be so notified. Unless, in the opinion of the Law Faculty, a decided improvement in the character of his work is indicated at the end of the second term, his resignation will be required. 14. Absence from the University is permitted on the written leave of the dean of the Law School. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or musical clubs on excursions will not be granted, except to the officers and members of the organization. Nor, except for good cause, may leaves be granted in anticipation or extension of holidays. 15. Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors for sickness or other providential cause. Such excuses must be rendered promptly. Unexcused absences from lectures render the student liable to be disciplined. 16. Special Examinations.âNo special examinations are granted, save in cases of sickness on the day of examination (attested by physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause approved by the Law Faculty. In no case will such examination be granted unless prompt application be made therefor. 17. Third-Year StudentsâIncomplete Work.âCandidates for the degree, who have failed on one or more subjects in any year, may return the following session, and stand the regular examinations on such subjects, without further attendance upon lectures. But this privilege may be exercised but onceâthat is to say, after a second failure the candidate must take the lectures over again, on the subject or subjects on which he has for a second time proved deficient. See Regulation 9. 18. Examination Fees.âThe fee for standing such examinations as are mentioned in the preceding regulation is $5 for each examination taken. Students, who, under such circumstances, return for further lectures, and who have paid full matriculation and tuition fees for three years, pay a matriculation fee in proportion to the amount of work taken plus $5 for each course. There is no charge for special examinations granted for imperative cause. 19. Application for Degree.âCandidates for graduation are required to file a written application with the Dean, not later than November 15th of their third year, indicating the courses completed, together with a schedule of the courses to be pursued during their final year. Blanks for this purpose will be supplied at the Dean's office. 20. Required Withdrawal.âThe right is reserved to require the withdrawal of any student who, in the opinion of the faculty, is not profiting nor likely to profit by the instruction offered; or whose neglect or irregular performance of required duties, after admonition, indicates indifference or contumacy; or whose character or habits are a menace to the good order of the Law School. 21. Honor System.âAll examinations are conducted under the Honor System. REGISTER OF STUDENTS. First-Year Class. Anderson, Buist Murfee Marion, Ala. Anderson, Thomas Minor Rockville, Md.
