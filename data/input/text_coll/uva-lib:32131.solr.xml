      <field name="fulltext">NOTES ON THE NAMES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Foreword By The President of the University of Virginia It is an honor and keen pleasure for me to be able to offer a few words of introduction to the valuable and delightful biographies of former professors of the University of Virginia which Harry Clemons, Librarian Emeritus of the University, has written. In the succeeding pages, Mr. Clemons has vividly and concisely delineated the life and character of the twenty-two eminent teachers and scholars, diverse in personality but consistent in distinction, for whom the modern dormitories of the University are named. Mr. Jefferson, of course, built the first rooms for students at the University, still known, as he designated them, as the Lawn and the Ranges. They were occupied upon the opening of the University in 1825. During the succeeding century, some additional accommodations were provided. Finally, in 1929 the University completed the construction of a group of a dozen residence "Halls." In planning for these Halls, President Edwin A. Alderman, on 28 April 1928, appointed Professors Robert Montgomery Bird, Robert Bennett Bean, George Oscar Ferguson, Jr., William Mentzel Forrest, and William Alexander Lambeth as the members of a "Dormitory Committee." There is no proof that this committee (which was active in determining the location of the buildings and in drawing up rules for their occupancy) named the twelve Halls, but it seems likely that they did. The minutes of the Board of Visitors show that the following resolution was adopted on 2 November 1928: "The suggestion of the President that the entries to the new dormitories be designated by names taken from the list of professors who had served the University from its beginning, was approved." The only additional documentary information is an undated typewritten list in President Alderman's 1928 correspondence of the names actually used, with the pencilled notation "names verified by Dr. [William Mynn] Thornton." Thus twelve of Mr. Clemons' twenty-two men were chosen. The remaining ten were commemorated by the undergraduate "Houses," which were opened in 1950. While these dormitories were under construction. President Colgate W. Darden, Jr., asked the University Senate to recommend names for them, and a committee of the Senate, consisting of Professors James Southall Wilson, Earnest Jackson Oglesby, and Ivey Foreman Lewis determined upon the names for the ten Houses from a list of forty former professors nominated by members of the Faculty. As the minutes of the committee show, "The names were selected on the basis of stature in the world of scholarship, influence in the University of their day, and in the case of the last two [Page and Hancock] their hold on the affection of the alumni growing out of their personal influence on students." On 10 February 1950, the Board of Visitors approved the recommendations of the committee. Mr. Clemons' list of twenty-two was then complete. All who cherish the University of Virginia are indebted to the Librarian Emeritus for these biographical sketches and for the care and grace with which he has recreated our heritage. I am grateful that successive generations of students will be able to turn to this work and bring to life the men whose names they daily encounter in the residence Halls and Houses. I trust that these biographies will also alert each contemporary generation of students to the fact that, if they want to know great men in the flesh before the enshrinement of posthumous honor, they need only look about them on the Grounds. It is a happy circumstance that the name of one of the great men of the University now living should be linked with these illustrious names of her past through the authorship of this book. His tribute to their influence bespeaks the enduring spirit of the University. Edgar F. Shannon, Jr.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARLES BONNYCASTLE Bonnycastle is an apt name for an habitation, but its appropriateness for one of the University's Residence Houses stems from the surname of one of the original Professors, Charles Bonnycastle. He was born in England in 1792, the son of a distinguished Professor of Mathematics at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. Two of John Bonnycastle's sons achieved notable careers in the New World. The elder of the two, Sir Richard Bonnycastle, was a military engineer in Canada. The younger, Charles, received his training at Woolwich, and he was holding a government appointment when Francis Walker Gilmer, Jefferson's agent in England to secure a Faculty for the University of Virginia, persuaded him to cast his lot with the newly fledged institution. The voyage to the United States, which Bonnycastle made with Robley Dunglison, who was to be Professor of Medicine, and Thomas Hewitt Key, to be Professor of Mathematics, was a hazardous initiation. The ship "Competitor" in which they sailed was "an old log", and the voyage was stormy, requiring three and a half months. In fact, because of the delay, the first session of the University of Virginia could not begin until 7 March 1825. Bonnycastle was at first, from 1825 to 1827, Professor of Natural Philosophy. But when Key returned to England in 1827, he was transferred to the professorship of Mathematics, and he held that chair until his death in 1840. By his effective teaching, by his familiarity with current English progress in his subject, and by his authorship of mathematical textbooks (he was the compiler of treatises on Algebra, on Inductive Geometry, and on Mensuration) he proved to be a manifest example of the success of Jefferson's design of choosing members of the original Faculty from abroad. It is said that Bonnycastle possessed the most original mind of any teacher of Mathematics in the United States in his time. He had been a bachelor on arrival, but he married a Virginia maiden, Ann Mason Tutt of Loudoun County, "of great charm and beauty." They lived on the Lawn in Pavilion VIII (now the President's office) and had three children. He relieved the rather bleak appearance of the original pavilions by planting in his garden an arbor covered with roses and honeysuckle vines for his children. He was notable for his powers of concentration. Perhaps it was for this characteristic, added to an extreme degree of shyness, that he was described as being taciturn. An article which appeared after his death in the Southern Literary Messenger pictured him as "sitting in the midst of his playful children perfectly unconscious of their bewitching gambols. But their easy confidence and familiarity proved that there was no austerity in his nature." Death came to him on 31 October 1840 while he was only in his forty-eighth year. He lies buried in the University Cemetery. The article (unsigned) in the Southern Literary Messenger appeared in the number for January 1842. There are ample references to Professor Bonnycastle in the histories of the University of Virginia by Bruce, by Barringer-Garnett-Page, by Culbreth, and by Patton, and also in Herbert B. Adams's Thomas Jefferson and the University of Virginia. There is a pleasant sketch by Clara Bell Davis, the daughter of Professor Noah K. Davis, in the University of Virginia Alumni Bulletin for February 1900.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RICHARD HEATH DABNEY The Dabney Residence House was named in honor of Richard Heath Dabney, Professor of History and first Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies—a distinguished member of a distinguished family. He was of English-French ancestry, and was born in Memphis, Tennessee, 29 March 1860. His father, Virginius Dabney, was a captain in the Confederate Army, a schoolteacher, and the author of two novels of social life in old Virginia characterized by a Tristram Shandyish whimsicality: The Story of Don Miff (a child's lisping pronunciation of John Smith) and Gold That Did Not Glitter. His father's father, Thomas Smith Gregory Dabney, was the gallant figure portrayed in A Southern Planter, a biography by his daughter, Mrs. Susan D. Smedes. Richard Heath Dabney's mother's maiden name was Ellen Maria Heath, and his maternal ancestry was likewise notable. Her father, James Ewell Heath, was the author of Edge Hill, a novel with a Southern background, he was the generous contributor of "Editorial Remarks" to the first volume of The Southern Literary Messenger, and for many years he was the Auditor of the Accounts of the State of Virginia; and his father, John Heath, was the first President of Phi Beta Kappa. The family eminence has continued. Richard Heath Dabney married, in 1888, Mary Amanda Bentley of Richmond, who died the following year; and, in 1899, Lily Heth Davis of Albemarle County. Of the second marriage were born a son, Virginius Dabney, Pulitzer Prize winner as Editor of The Richmond Times-Dispatch and the author of several penetrating book-length studies of political and social import, and two daughters, Lucy Davis Dabney, who died in childhood, and Alice Saunders Dabney, wife of John Crump Parker of Franklin, a leading Virginia lawyer. Though born in Memphis, Richard Heath Dabney spent most of his life in Virginia. He studied at home or in a private school until he entered the University of Virginia in 1876. Three years later he gained the M.A. degree; and he then spent several years of graduate study in Germany, receiving his Ph.D., with distinction, from Heidelberg in 1885. From 1886 to 1889 he was Professor of History at Indiana University. It was in 1889 that he joined the Faculty at the University of Virginia, being successively Adjunct Professor of History, Associate Professor of History, Professor of Historical and Economical Science, and from 1906 to 1938 Professor of History. From 1905 to 1923 he was the first Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies. He retired from his professorship in 1938, but he continued to live in Charlottesville, an esteemed Nestor, until his death 16 May 1947. Thus from 1889 to 1938 Dabney was an active participant in the notable expansion of the University of Virginia's functions as a university. The earlier part of his teaching and graduate school administration had to be performed with a minimum of assistance, and the constant pressure of routine duties curtailed both the opportunity and the facility to write. It is to be noted that his Causes of the French Revolution (the printed form of lectures delivered at Washington and Lee University) was published in 1888, and his John Randolph, A Character Sketch in 1898. But even the pedagogic groove could not confine his wisdom as a counsellor or his flair for inspiring comradeship. His argument for a greater unity and cohesion in college classes (quoted at length in Bruce's History) as a potent asset for alumni loyalty failed to persuade when it was advanced in 1893, but its validity has not been without recognition in the years that have followed. Through his simplicity and directness, his consideration for others, and his example of honest effort and high ideals, his personal influence was widespread. The record, preserved in letters now in the Alderman Library, of his enduring intimacy with Woodrow Wilson, an intimacy which began in 1881 when both were students at the University of Virginia, is a testament to a stimulating and magnanimous friendship. There are numerous references to Richard Heath Dabney in Bruce's History, the quotation mentioned above appearing in volume four, pages 203 to 206. The Barringer-Garnett-Page History has an early sketch of Professor Dabney in the second volume, pages 16, 17. Volume two, 1943–1950, of Who Was Who in America contains a summary record. Lewis Catlett Williams, a graduate of 1898, who was from 1922 to 1946 a member of the University's Board of Visitors, gives in his pamphlet The "Gay Nineties" at the University of Virginia, published in 1942, details of Professor Dabney's courses in History. An encomium by another who was a student of his, Professor Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker of Princeton, appeared at the time of Professor Dabney's death in the University of Virginia Alumni News for June 1947; and the Alumni News for November 1956 printed a notable tribute by a graduate student from England, David Albin Booth, who during his residence in Charlottesville lived in the home of Mrs. Richard Heath Dabney.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NOAH KNOWLES DAVIS Davis Hall is named in memory of Noah Knowles Davis, known familiarly as "Professor Noah K." He was the last of the University's trio of Professors of Moral Philosophy, his tenure of that chair extending from 1873 to 1906, following George Tucker, 1825–1845, and William Holmes McGuffey, 1845–1873. In 1906 the title "Moral Philosophy" was dropped and the Department was reorganized as the Corcoran School of Philosophy. Davis was in his forty-third year when he came to the University of Virginia, having been born in Philadelphia 13 May 1830. His father, Noah D. Davis, was the founder of the American Baptist Publishing Society. The son was but two months old when the father died. Subsequently his mother remarried and moved to Georgia, where the step-father, John L. Dagg, became President of Mercer University. There the youth, only nineteen, graduated with the B.A. degree. Later he received from Mercer honorary degrees of M.A. and Ph.D., and from both Baylor and Furman Universities the honorary degree of LL.D. But after graduating from Mercer University he spent a busy three years in Philadelphia, studying Chemistry while supporting himself by teaching and by work in an architect's office. In this period he compiled two popular texts, The Carpenter's New Guide and The Model Architect. He found some leisure for the study of music as well, and of all these acquired skills he made use in his varied career. But teaching was his life work. Returning to the South, he was successively Professor of Natural Science at Howard College in Alabama, Principal of the Judson Female Institute, also in Alabama, and President of Bethel College in Kentucky. It was from the presidency of Bethel College that he came to Charlottesville to succeed Professor McGuffey. He looked the part of a Professor of Moral Philosophy. He was of massive build, with a domelike head, and a flowing beard—a figure suggestive of the Greek philosophers. His mien was serious, his speech precise, and his lectures and books were based on unremitting study and preparation. He supplemented his class work by an "Elements" series of books on Inductive and Deductive Logic, on Psychology, and on Ethics. For a number of years he gave Sunday lectures on Biblical subjects, which also found printed form. He was a prime mover in the development of a Young Men's Christian Association at the University of Virginia, and he was instrumental in engineering in 1892 the purchase of the acres for a playing field for the students. on the southern portion of which Madison Hall was later to be erected. He was in demand also as a lecturer outside of the University. For several years he served on the popular Chautauqua platform; and during two summers he acted as head of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Chicago. In 1857, while he was at Howard College, he married Ella Cordelia Hunt of Columbus, Georgia. There were four children: two sons, Noah Wilson and Archibald Hunt, both of whom became alumni of the University of Virginia, and two daughters, Marella and Clara Bell. At the University the family lived in the pavilion which is now the Colonnade Club. Of a retiring disposition himself, his wife was one of the gracious hostesses of "the Lawn." He became Emeritus Professor in 1906, and died 3 May 1910. He is buried in the University Cemetery. Of Noah K. Davis's years at the University of Virginia there are accounts in Bruce's History, in the Barringer-Garrett-Page History, in Culbreth's Memoirs, and in Lewis Catlett Williams' pamphlet, "The Gay Nineties" at the University of Virginia; and The Alumni Bulletin, series III, volume 3, contains three articles printed at the time of his death: one on his career, one containing the Resolutions of the Faculty, and the third on "What the Young Men's Christian Association Owes to Mr. Davis." In volume three of the Library of Southern Literature there are a general tribute by Bishop Collins Denny and six extracts from Professor Davis's writings. The volume for 1897– 1942 of Who Was Who in America contains a concise sketch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WILLIAM HOLDING ECHOLS, JR. Echols Residence House receives its name from William Holding Echols, Jr., who, in his forty-seven years at the University of Virginia as student and member of the Faculty, made that name, familiarly shortened to "Reddy" Echols, symbolize a strenuously individual but eminently constructive influence in university life. This influence has most recently been memorialized at the University in the name of the Echols Scholarship program. Born in San Antonio, Texas, 2 December 1859, Echols was the son of William Holding and Mary Beirne Patton Echols. He studied in private schools until he matriculated at the University of Virginia in 1878, at the age of nineteen. In four years he attained to both B.S. and C.E. degrees. After vigorous field experience as construction engineer for four different railways in the deep South, his teaching career began in 1887 in Missouri when he became Professor of Applied Mathematics and, the following year, Director of the Missouri School of Mines. From there he returned in 1891 to the University of Virginia as Adjunct Professor of Mathematics. He was also saddled with the duties of Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, and it was in the alert performance of this added responsibility that he became the outstanding hero at the burning of the Rotunda in October 1895. The Rotunda fire was a sharp dividing point in the history of the University of Virginia. There followed energetic developments in building activity and in administrative procedure. In those developments Professor Echols took a leading part. He was both a creating and a conserving force, and his influence penetrated to all parts of the University. He supported the insistence on erecting new buildings in harmony with the original Jeffersonian architectural plan. He was scornful of what he deemed to be frills, such as the wearing of academic costume. He was a strong advocate of pure amateurism in college sports. It was he who for many years illuminated for entering students the ideals of the Honor System— insisting that "Eternal vigilance is absolutely necessary for its preservation." In the first World War he, with President Alderman, headed the University Council on Military Service. All this was in addition to his chosen career as a teacher. In the year after the Fire he had been promoted to a full professorship and to the headship of the School of Mathematics, and his forceful teaching was supplemented by various published papers and by the several editions of his textbook on Differential and Applied Calculus. Through all these years of residence in the university community, his tall, athletic figure, striding to and from his home in Pavilion VIII (now the President's office), was a familiar and respected sight. That was a lively home. He had married twice: to Mary Elizabeth Blakey, on 9 September 1885, who died in 1894, and to Elizabeth Mitchell Harrison, on 15 June 1897. There were five children of each marriage, three daughters and seven sons. Of the sons, four became students at the University of Virginia. At the time of his death, three of the children were deceased, but the others were carrying on the name with distinction in various fields. Death came to him suddenly, on 29 September 1934, from a heart attack. He had already begun his schedule of teaching for another new session. At his funeral the pall bearers were students. members of the Chi Phi Fraternity and of the Eli Banana Society. He lies buried in the University Cemetery, just beyond the Echols Residence House. There are frequent references to Professor Echols in volumes four and five of Bruce's History; there is a memoir in the Alumni News for December 1934, following his death; and there is a concise sketch in the first volume of Who Was Who in America. His exploits at the burning of the Rotunda are recorded in Morgan P. Robinson's vivid story of that disaster, and in Lewis C. Williams pamphlet, The "Gay Nineties" at the University of Virginia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN PATTEN EMMET Emmet Residence House and Emmet Street (the portion of Route 29 which passes by the university grounds) are named in honor of John Patten Emmet, Professor of Natural History in the original Faculty. He was born in Dublin 8 April 1796, in a family of Irish patriots. His uncle, Robert Emmet, was a martyr to the cause; and his father, Thomas Addis Emmet, after five years of imprisonment, emigrated to New York. The young Emmet, eight years old on arrival in America, attended a classical school on Long Island, and was appointed a cadet to West Point. Ill health, which hampered him throughout his life, necessitated withdrawal before graduation. But while still a cadet student he had been appointed an assistant instructor in Mathematics. A year was spent in the milder climate of southern Italy, during which the range of his interests extended to music, painting, and sculpture; and a frolicsome Celtic trait was revealed in his participation in a Naples Carnival, cleverly disguised as the Devil—so realistically, that he was well-nigh mobbed. On his return to New York, he studied medicine at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, and for homework he fitted up a private chemistry laboratory. He received an M.D. degree in 1822, and started the practice of medicine in Charleston, South Carolina. It was a course of popular lectures in Chemistry, given in Charleston, that brought young Emmet to the attention of Thomas Jefferson and ultimately led to his appointment in the initial Faculty at the University of Virginia. His professorship of Natural History was in the third session altered to that of Chemistry and Materia Medica. He was enthusiastic over the University and over his teaching; and he was a man of marked ingenuity, in his experiments for useful devices, for the utilization of soils and minerals, and for the introduction or improvement of fruits and vegetables. In Pavilion I, where Emmet lived at first, he kept as pets snakes, a white owl, and a friendly bear. But this menagerie was cheerfully discontinued upon his marriage in 1829 to Mary Byrd Tucker, a niece of George Tucker, Professor of Moral Philosophy. Later the couple were permitted to move from the Lawn to a considerable tract of land west of the University on which the house still known as "Morea" was erected. The word is derived from the Latin morus meaning mulberry tree, which Emmet introduced for his silkworm culture. "Morea" has recently been taken over by the University for use as a guest house. There Professor Emmet could freely pursue his horticultural experimentation— thus producing something like the botanical garden which had figured in Jefferson's original planning. But in 1842 persistent ill health made advisable his withdrawal to Florida. There a mitigation of the illness resulted in a hopeful return to New York. Six weeks later, however, on 15 August 1842, he died, in his forty-seventh year. He was buried in New York. There were three children, two sons, of whom the younger died in his eighth year, and one daughter. The elder son, bearing his grandfather's name, Thomas Addis Emmet, became a distinguished physician in New York, and was the author of an impressive folio volume on the Emmet Family. Besides the biography of John Patten Emmet in the family record by his son (that biography was also issued separately, and also in the University of Virginia Alumni Bulletin for February 1895), there is a printed memoir written by George Tucker; and in addition to acounts by Herbert B. Adams in his Thomas Jefferson and the University of Virginia and in the histories of the University by Bruce and Patton, there is an appreciative sketch by University Dean B.F.D. Runk in volume XIII, 1953, of the Magazine of Albemarle County History.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BASIL LANNEAU GILDERSLEEVE Gildersleeve Hall and Gildersleeve Wood (south of Oakhurst Circle) bear the distinguished name of Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve, who was Professor of Greek from 1856 to 1876 and also Professor of Latin during the war years 1861 to 1866. He was born 23 October 1831 in Charleston, South Carolina, with descent on both sides from Revolutionary patriots. First taught at home, he had completed a year at the College of Charleston, as a freshman of fourteen, when his father moved to Richmond. His education continued to be a record of precocity. After a year at Jefferson College in Washington, Pennsylvania (now Washington and Jefferson College), he went on to Princeton and graduated in his seventeenth year with the class of 1849. There followed a year of teaching in Richmond, five years of study in Germany, with a Ph.D. from Göttingen, and a further period in Richmond of writing and of tutoring in a private family. His appointment in 1856 to the chair of Greek at the University of Virginia therefore came before his twenty-fifth birthday. During the score of years in Charlottesville, this young Professor made a deep impression upon the students who attended his classes and also upon his associates in the Faculty. Strict as a grammarian and philologist, he was through all and above all an inspiring exponent of the beauty and aspiration of the Hellenic spirit. His courses afforded a notably comprehensive introduction to the Greek language and literature, and they were taught with a vigor that effectively separated the earnest students from the apathetic. As a teacher his appreciative encouragement could on occasion be matched by biting censure. During the war years Gildersleeve proved his patriotism twofold. He carried the Latin classes as well as the Greek, and in summer vacations he served with the armed forces. In 1864 as an aide to General Gordon he suffered a knee wound which resulted in a lasting trace of lameness. After the war he joined in a faculty project for preparing textbooks for Southern schools, and his Latin Grammar and his edition of Persius were of such quality that they contributed to the selection of Gildersleeve in 1876 to the initial professorship of Greek in the newly established Johns Hopkins University. At the University of Virginia he lived in Pavilion I. In 1866 he married Eliza Fisher Colston, and there was a son, Raleigh Colston Gildersleeve, and a daughter, Emma Louise Gildersleeve, who became Mrs. Gardner M. Lane, Jr. The twenty years at the University of Virginia formed a record of instruction of college students by a teacher in his young manhood. The wellnigh forty years (18761915) at Johns Hopkins formed a record as Mentor of graduate students by a scholar of ripened intellectual powers and experience. By his continued writings and as the founder and first editor of the American Journal of Philology he gained national and international repute, as may be attested by the honorary doctor's degrees conferred upon him by the College of William and Mary, by the University of the South, by Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Pennsylvania, and Chicago, and abroad by Cambridge and Oxford. Active teaching ended in 1915. Thereafter declining health reduced his activities, but his mental powers continued unabated until his death on 9 January 1924. In accordance with his wish, he was buried in the University of Virginia Cemetery. His fealty to Virginia and the South was abiding. His Creed of the Old South was published in 1915, and he was the second of the University of Virginia's Page-Barbour lecturers, so that his Hellas and Hesperia (1908) adorns the distinguished list of publications of that lectureship. Professor Thornton, who was Chairman of the Faculty when the Rotunda was burned in 1895, records that the first letter of sympathy and concern received following that disaster was from Gildersleeve, and that it enclosed a generous contribution. But flashes of Gildersleeve's characteristic humor also persisted, along with his affection and compassion. Professor Thornton illustrates this by the aged Gildersleeve's reply to a query whether he really wished to be buried at the University of Virginia. The response, with an elfish gleam of merriment, was, "Yes, you see I was buried there before!" Esteem for his distinguished services endures at the University of Virginia, and even the inscription on his tombstone has recently given occasion for a lively controversy among scholars as to the correctness of the Greek lettering of a phrase from Aeschylus thereon, the apt translation of which is "Life's bivouac is o'er." Professor Thornton, who had been a student under Gildersleeve, paid two detailed tributes to him as a teacher, tributes which were printed in the Johns Hopkins Alumni Magazine for January 1925 and in the University of Virginia Alumni Bulletin for April 1924. Another detailed recital of the impression made by Gildersleeve as a teacher of college students appears in David M. R. Culbreth's The University of Virginia: Memories of her Student-life and Professors. Still another tribute by a former student, Dr. Walter A. Montgomery, himself Professor of Latin at Virginia, is preserved in the Alderman Library. A full list of biographical references is given by Francis G. Allinson with the Gildersleeve article in the Dictionary of American Biography. The comments on the stonecutter's rendering of the inscription on the tombstone were made by two Professors of the University of Virginia, Chalmers Gemmill and Arthur Stocker, and by Professor Bernard Peebles of the Catholic University of America.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARLES HANCOCK Hancock Residence House bears the name of Charles Hancock, who in eighteen years as a member of the Engineering Faculty to a notable degree won the esteem and affection of both students and teachers. He was a native of Albemarle County, born at "Edgeworth" on 2 September 1869. His father was a physician, Dr. Charles Hancock. The son attended the Miller Manual Training School, located about six miles south of Crozet, and after his graduation remained at that School for a time as Instructor. He then entered the University of Virginia, from which he received the B.S. degree in 1904, with Phi Beta Kappa standing and membership in the Raven Society. The next four years afforded him his only experience outside of Albemarle, as a Professor of Mechanical Engineering in the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College. In 1908 he came home to the University of Virginia, for three years as Adjunct Professor, for four years as Associate Professor, and for eleven years as Professor of Mechanical Engineering. He was an engineer's engineer, practical rather than theoretical, a beautifully skillful worker with his hands, rarely with his pen. He had been largely responsible for the excellent quality of the laboratory apparatus at the Miller School, and he designed the University's power plant and central heating system. When during the first World War the University introduced special training for military recruits, Professor Hancock had a considerable share in both planning and instruction. He was a useful member of several national associations in his field. He served on the Governor's Board for a Mechanical Survey for Virginia. At the University he was chosen for several responsible committee posts, notably on the Faculty Committee for Student Self-Help; and his encouragement and counsel to students gained for him the title of "Daddy" Hancock. He had a tranquil mind, an even temper, and was deliberate in speech, perhaps even to an excess. He was direct, simple, and without guile. His colleagues feelingly termed him "the salt of the earth" and "a saint among men." At his death, President Alderman fittingly stated that "to know Professor Hancock was to love him and to honor him." In 1902 he married Alice Jones of North Carolina. There were three charming daughters in the home, a fact which in no way detracted from the popularity of the Hancocks. In 1926, after a severe illness of several months, which Professor Hancock bore with fortitude and constant thoughtfulness for others, he died on May eleventh. He was buried in the University Cemetery. Volume five of Bruce's History outlines the special services rendered by Professor Hancock in the training of military recruits during the first World War. In his entertaining autobiographical work, The Abbots of Old Bellevue, Dr. James P. C. Southall, Professor of Physics in Columbia University, pays tribute to Charles Hancock as he knew him when they were colleagues at the Miller School. That he was "the salt of the earth" is a quotation from Professor Southall. That Hancock was "a saint among men" is quoted from an engineering colleague at the University of Virginia, Professor Charles Henderson, who later was for a period Dean of the Department of Engineering. Obituary notices appeared in the Charlottesville Daily Progress for 12 May 1926 and in the University of Virginia Alumni News for May 1926.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GESSNER HARRISON Harrison Hall is named in honor of Gessner Harrison, a student in the first session of the University of Virginia and a member of its Faculty from his graduation in 1828 to 1859. His career afforded a demonstration of the achievement of one at least of the purposes for which the University was founded. Himself a product of the college training offered by the new institution, in his thirty-one years as Professor he had a recognized part in so preparing leaders in secondary education that their pupils matriculated for college at a definitely mounting stage of attainment. It was a prime example of the potent effect of higher education on the whole educational system. Professor Harrison's contribution was characterized by patient industry, an open mind, robust common sense, and sound judgment. He was not brilliant, but he was conspicuously useful. He was born in Harrisonburg, Virginia, 26 June 1807. His father was a physician of wide practice, and the son was inclined to make medicine his career. But when, in 1828, he became one of the first three graduates in the School of Medicine, Gessner Harrison was also one of the first three graduates of the School of Ancient Languages; and Professor Long, who was at that point returning to England, recommended that the position of Professor of Ancient Languages be filled by the twenty-one year old Harrison. The surprised Board of Visitors offered a probationary appointment of one year. The equally surprised Harrison accepted it. The regular appointment followed in due course. The years that ensued were strenuous. There were difficult problems of discipline for a professor of approximately the same age as his students, and there was the incessant pressure of preparing for class instruction. But intelligence and initiative guided labor. Harrison was probably the first in America to adopt the new German science of comparative grammar, and the University gained a solid reputation for its courses in the Classics. In 1856, in order to relieve the congestion in those courses, the Board of Visitors divided the School of Ancient Languages into Schools of Latin and of Greek and Hebrew. Gessner Harrison was given his choice and selected Latin, Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve being appointed to the other School. In administration also Professor Harrison won general confidence. Five times he was chosen Chairman of the Faculty, serving altogether twelve years in that exacting office. His busy life afforded little opportunity for writing, but he did produce treatises on Latin Grammar, on Greek Prepositions, and on Ancient Geography, and he contributed the article on the University of Virginia to Duyckinck's Cyclopedia of American Literature. There was also an active family life. In 1830 he married a daughter of Professor George Tucker, and there were six sons and three daughters. One daughter became the wife of Professor Francis Henry Smith and another of a prominent Baptist clergyman, the Rev. John Albert Broadus. It was in part to seek financial support for the education of his children that Professor Harrison resigned from the Faculty in 1859 in order to establish a boarding school for boys. But the promising opportunities of the prosperous 1850's in Virginia turned to ashes with the coming of armed conflict; and on 7 April 1862 Gessner Harrison himself became a victim of the war, for in nursing a son who had contracted camp fever, he was fatally infected by the same disease. There is a revealing incident of a meeting between Rector Jefferson and students Gessner Harrison and his elder brother, Edward, who had matriculated with him. During the first session, groups of students were in rotation invited to a Sunday meal at Monticello—a Sunday meal in order that college routines might not be interrupted. When the invitation came to the Harrison brothers, a frank letter of regrets was sent, explaining that the promise had been made to the father not to indulge in social events on the Sabbath Day. This act of filial piety moved Jefferson to warm appreciation, and he cordially responded with a special arrangement for a weekday occasion. It proved a felicitious and memorable experience for this youth, who was so admirably to carry forward the aims of the Founder by his own resolutely individual and self-sacrificing efforts. In 1873 Dr. John A. Broadus made an extended memorial address on his father-in-law before the Society of the Alumni, an address which was included in the Broadus volume of Sermons and Addresses, published in 1886. Culbreth was present on that occasion and described it at length on pages 250–256 of his University of Virginia: Memories of Her Student-Life and Professors. A successor of Harrison in the chair of Latin, Dr. Walter A. Montgomery, contributed the appreciative article in the Dictionary of American Biography. There are frequent references in Bruce's History, a concise sketch in the Barringer-Garnett-Page compilation, and three articles in the University of Virginia Alumni Bulletin, in the issue for October 1894 by Francis H. Smith, in the issue for January 1915 by Crawford Howell, and in the issue for April 1915 by Edward S. Joynes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GEORGE FREDERICK HOLMES Holmes Hall perpetuates the name of George Frederick Holmes, a scholar of an extraordinary range of knowledge who never acquired a bachelor's degree. He was born 2 August 1820 in British Guiana, where his father was Judge-Advocate. Taken to England when two years old, the child was left in Northumberland with his maternal grandfather. Sent to school in Sunderland, he gained a prize scholarship at Durham University, and appeared to be on the way to academic distinction, when for some obscure reason the family (his father was no longer living) cast him adrift to Canada at the age of seventeen. There followed a period of wandering through Pennsylvania, Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia, during which he tried teaching and writing, made notable friends, and gained respect and admiration wherever he went. He tried the study of law, and was admitted to the bar in South Carolina, but he never practiced. In 1845, while only twenty-five, he was appointed Professor of Ancient Languages at the University of Richmond. Two years later he was Professor of History and Political Economy at the College of William and Mary; and a single year after that, in 1848, he was chosen to be the first President of the University of Mississippi. An accident which cost him the use of one eye forced him to resign from that post, and for the next nine years he tried farming in southwestern Virginia. His most productive harvest, however, was of printed articles and reviews on a wide variety of subjects, which brought him in friendly touch with many of the leading literary figures of his day. He had meantime married the daughter of John Floyd, at one time Governor of Virginia, and had shouldered the responsibilities of a family. The decade of the 1850's was one of comparative prosperity for the University of Virginia, and there was a moderate increase in students and teachers and courses. A School of History and General Literature was added, and in 1857 Holmes was invited to be its first Professor. For forty years thereafter, until his death 4 November 1897, he continued to be an active member of the Faculty. However the alterations in his title indicate the recognized range of his capabilities. When in 1882 a separate School of English Literature was introduced, Holmes became Professor of Historical Science, including Political Economy; and in 1887 another division in the curriculum found him Professor of Political Economy and of the Science of Society. During these years he published numerous textbooks, readers, grammars, and a school history of the United States. There was also a privately printed form of his lectures on the Science of Society, an early venture into the field of Sociology. In March 1861, on the eve of hostilities, he proposed, in a document characteristically ponderous in language and learned in allusions, that the University undertake a special collection to be termed "The Memorials of the American Disruption" and to comprise "everything that should have a bearing on the great political dissilience of the formerly United States of America." The project died of inanition, and it was not until 1930 that the University seriously concentrated on systematic efforts to conserve and make available materials in the broad fields of human relationship. At the University of Virginia Professor Holmes occupied what became the Romance Pavilion on East Lawn. "Daddy" Holmes, as he was familiarly known, was a striking figure, tall and gaunt, untidy in dress, with his hair long, but with a keenly alert mind. His courses were comprehensive. He was a discursive lecturer, drawing on a wide range of experience and of reading. He treated social and political issues with objective detachment, not emphasizing personal beliefs. That he did have unswerving loyalties was revealed by a happy event near the close of his life. In 1891 the University of Durham, cognizant of the distinction gained by its former student of only one year, conferred on him the honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Law. This he felt was a compensating reward for a lifetime effort begun in adversity; and when he died, six years later, it is said that the last word he uttered was "England." At his request he was laid to rest beside the grave of his wife in Sweet Springs, West Virginia. Following the Rotunda fire, his private library was purchased, mainly by his former students, and presented to the University. The Bruce and Barringer-Garnett-Page Histories and Culbreth's Memories record details of his life and character. Volume six of The Library of Southern Literature contains an extended tribute by Henry E. Shepherd, and among the excerpts from Holmes's writings is his comprehensive argument that Shakespeare and not someone else wrote the works of Shakespeare. In the issues of The University of Virginia Alumni Bulletin for August and November 1898 are two articles on Professor Holmes, the first being an extended exposition of Holmes's private letter book by William Mynn Thornton. There is a concise biography of Holmes by Samuel Chiles Mitchell in the Dictionary of American Biography. In the Virginia Magazine of History and Biography for January 1961 Professor William R. Manierre discusses Holmes's attitude toward Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MILTON WYLIE HUMPHREYS The Humphreys Residence House commemorates the name of Milton Wylie Humphreys, Professor of Greek from 1887 to 1912, who might indeed have been credited with the Carlylean title of Professor of Things-in-General. He was born 15 September 1844 in Greenbrier County while it was still a part of Virginia—in 1863 it was included in the separated State of West Virginia. His father was a practising physician, largely self-trained, whose ancestors came from Ireland just prior to the Revolutionary War. His mother was of Scotch origin, and her grandfather had died from a wound received in that War of Independence. The boy's youth was spent in the rugged hill country, where he developed a powerful body which was matched with an indomitable urge for education. He was able to attend Mercer Academy in Charleston, and to enter Washington College in Lexington, Virginia, in 1860. After one year as a student, he enlisted in Bryan's Battery of the Virginia Artillery, and he served as a gunner until the surrender at Appomattox, giving in his war diary and in his autobiography extraordinarily full records of the campaigns in which he was engaged. After the war, faced with conditions of extreme poverty, he was seeking for a means of livelihood when he learned that General Lee had become President of Washington College, and young Humphreys resolved to make a desperate effort to resume his college course. Even that effort had reached the point of despair when General Lee personally made it possible for him to remain. Moreover, while still a student, Humphreys was appointed an Assistant Professor of Greek to fill a vacancy. He later stated that had the vacancy been in Mathematics, for which subject he felt better fitted, the whole course of his subsequent career would probably have been in Science. He was graduated, the first in his class, in 1869 with the degree of M.A., and he was continued as Adjunct Professor of Ancient Languages from 1870 to 1875, the institution having become Washington and Lee University after the death of General Lee in 1870. During that period, however, he was granted leave of absence for two years of study in Germany, where he obtained a Ph.D. in Greek at Leipzig. There followed two 'firsts." He was the first Professor of Greek at Vanderbilt University (18751883), and he was the first Professor of Latin and Greek at the University of Texas (1883–1887). It was in 1887 that he began his term of twenty-five years in the chair of Greek at the University of Virginia. Fitting himself into a reorganization of the courses in Ancient Languages, he gave vigorous instruction in Greek. Greek was his subject; and while as need arose he helped out in other subjects, he was sensitive to the possible implication of being superficial in his attainments. He had earlier, however, declined invitations from other institutions for professorships in English, Modern Languages, and Physics, and twice he refused college presidencies. At the University of Virginia he was President of the Philosophical Society, and he was one of the original members of the Beta Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. Wielding an industrious pen, he contributed articles on philological subjects (he was in turn Vice President and President of the American Philological Association); he was the American Editor of the Revue des Revues, appended to the Parisian Revue de Philologie; he produced editions of the "Clouds" of Aristophanes (1881), of the "Antigone" of Sophocles (1891), and of Demosthenes' "On the Crown" (1913). Through all his absorption in scholarship, his mind eagerly reverted to the thrilling years of his war service, and he was an occasional contributor to the United States Journal of Artillery, in articles significant for his discoveries in indirect firing and terrestrial shifts. He was the recipient of the honorary degree of LL.D. from Washington and Lee and Vanderbilt Universities. But the title he most cherished was that of "The First Gunner of Bryan's Battery." In 1877 Professor Humphreys married the daughter of Dr. Landon Garland, Chancellor of Vanderbilt University, and his honeymoon was spent in a second trip to Europe, Greece being the country of his special investigation. His wife died in 1901. He retired from teaching in 1912, but he lived in his home on Wertland Street until 1928, continuing into his alert old age a notable intellectual capacity along with the simplicity of a youthful mountaineer. Four talented daughters, Louise Garland Humphreys, Mrs. Edward R. Dyer, Mrs. Dean W. Hendrickson, and Mrs. John S. Derr, survived him. His was a mind enriched with profound learning and stocked with infinite detail. He was to the last a blending of an irrepressible boyhood and of a sage. When his stalwart heart failed on 20 November 1928, President Alderman said of him that "the University of Virginia will cherish him among its great men." On his tombstone in the University Cemetery, along with the dates of birth and death, is the pithy depiction, "Bryan's Battery, C.S.A. Chair of Greek, Univ. Va. 1887–1912." Professor Humphreys told his own story in his own words in his autobiography written for his daughters (the typed copy runs to 848 folio pages), in his war diary, and in a series of letters written to Mrs. Winifred B. Russell of Gordonsville, Virginia. These are preserved in the Manuscript Division of the Alderman Library. The Dictionary of American Biography has a discriminating article by Robert H. Webb, Professor of Greek at the University of Virginia from 1912 to 1950. There are references in the Bruce and the Barringer-Garnett-Page Histories; and obituary notices appeared in the Charlottesville Daily Progress for 20 and 21 November 1928, in College Topics for 21 November 1928, and in the University of Virginia Alumni News for November 1928.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARLES WILLIAM KENT Kent Residence House commemorates the name of Charles William Kent, the Linden Kent Memorial Professor of English Literature from 1893 to 1917. He was descended from early settlers in Virginia, of English ancestry on his father's side and of Scottish ancestry on his mother's. He was born at Louisa Court House 27 September 1860. After private schooling and a period at the Locust Dale Academy, he entered the University of Virginia in 1878, and received the M.A. degree in 1882. He spent the next two years in Charleston, South Carolina, as joint founder and headmaster of a preparatory school. Then he went to Germany for advanced study, at the Universities of Göttingen, Berlin, and Leipzig, receiving from Leipzig the Ph.D. degree in 1887. The following year he was again at the University of Virginia as a Licentiate in German and French, the duties of a Licentiate resembling those of the present positions of Assistant and Instructor. From 1888 to 1893 he filled the comprehensive chair of Professor of English and Modern Languages at the University of Tennessee. But he then was called to become the first Linden Kent Professor at the University of Virginia. It was an appropriate appointment, since the new School of English Literature had been established by Mrs. Linden Kent as a memorial to his lawyer brother. The University's initial School of English had also been of recent date, 1882; and that was now designated as the School of English Language. Professor Kent's inaugural address in the new School had the significant title of "Literature and Life." To a remarkable degree he was both a painstaking scholar and a man of action. He edited texts of Cynewulf, Burns, Tennyson, and Poe, and was the first Literary Editor of the sixteen-volume Library of Southern Literature. He was also the first Editor of the University of Virginia Alumni Bulletin. He injected vitality into the University Literary Magazine, and as early as 1903 he offered a course in Journalism. He lectured widely on literary subjects, in recognition whereof came honorary degrees: LL.D. from the University of Alabama and Litt.D. from Colgate. He served as Chairman of the State Executive Committee of the Young Men's Christian Association. Known affectionately as "Chucky," his Sunday Bible Class for college students was for years a dynamic influence in the University. Of the wealth of a disciplined mind he was an eager and generous donor. In 1895 he married a daughter (Eleanor) of Professor Francis Henry Smith, and they occupied Pavilion IV on East Lawn until that became the office of the first President, Edwin Anderson Alderman. The Kents then moved into joint occupancy, with Professor Smith, of Pavilion V on West Lawn. It was there that Professor Kent died of a cerebral hemorrhage on 5 October 1917, at the beginning of his fifty-eighth year. He is buried in the University Cemetery. His was a comparatively brief but a notably abundant life. There are obituary tributes to Professor Kent in the University of Virginia Alumni News for October 1917 and in the University of Virginia Alumni Bulletin for January 1918. The Alumni Bulletin for October 1921 prints addresses by Judge Fishburne and Dean Metcalf on the occasion of the presentation to the University of a bust of Professor Kent by Charles Keck. Biographical sketches are contained in Bruce, Barringer-Garnett-Page, the Library of Southern Literature (volume XVI), and in volume one of Who Was Who in America.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ALBERT LEFEVRE The Lefevre Residence House bears the name of Albert Lefevre, who in his twenty-three years (1905 to 1928) as Corcoran Professor of Philosophy won distinction as an eloquent lecturer and a charming personality. He was born in Baltimore on the fourth of October 1873, the son of the Rev. Jacob A. Lefevre, one of the leaders of the Presbyterian Church. He had three elder brothers who made their mark in the educational field: George Lefevre, Professor of Zoology at the University of Missouri, Arthur Lefevre, who was Editor of the Texas School Journal, and Walter Lefevre, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Texas. Albert Lefevre matriculated at the University of Texas, and there received his B.A. and M.A. degrees. He then spent a year at Johns Hopkins, but transferred to Cornell, where he gained his Ph.D. After two years of study at the University of Berlin, he returned to Cornell, first as Instructor and then as Assistant Professor of Philosophy. In 1903 he was elected Professor of Philosophy at Tulane University, where Edwin Anderson Alderman was President. Between President and Professor there was formed a bond of admiration and friendship, and when in 1904 Alderman became President of the University of Virginia, Lefevre followed him to Charlottesville the next year. At the University of Virginia Professor Lefevre became an institution in himself. As a teacher, he infused the problems of philosophy with a clarifying insight that charmed his student listeners. As an author, he produced such books as "The Ethical System of Bishop Butler" and "The Relation Between Ethical System and Epistemology"; he translated Paulsen's "Immanuel Kant"; and he was Associate Editor of The Philosophical Review and of The Virginia Quarterly Review. He was a member of the Executive Committee of the General Athletic Association, and he was co-organizer, with Professor Lambeth, of the Southern Conference. He possessed a genius for friendship, sympathy, and good will, which won for him a notable degree of admiration and affection. An unhappy event that occurred in 1925 deepened the regard in which he was held. There was an accident to the car in which he was driving to Richmond with two associates from the University, and in the investigation of the accident, a flask was found which he was as a favor returning from a friend to a friend, by whom it had inadvertently been left behind. He was quite unaware that it was partly filled. Professor Lefevre was therefore fined under the Volstead Act for this unintentional transportation of liquor. Feeling deeply the odium caused to the University, he assumed all responsibility, frankly admitting that he was himself an occasional drinker, and tendered his resignation to the Board of Visitors. That Board refused to accept the resignation, but attached a mild period of probation, which Professor Lefevre faithfully observed. Thereafter "The Little Doc," as he was familiarly called, continued his quiet participation in teaching and university affairs. His bachelor quarters in the Mallet House (torn down in 1929 when Monroe Hall was erected) was a haven for his many friends, until he suddenly passed away from a cardiac hemorrhage on 18 December 1928. The funeral services were impressive. He was buried in the University Cemetery. Obituary notices and editorials appeared in the Charlottesville Daily Progress for 19 and 20 December 1928, in the Richmond Times-Dispatch for the same dates, and in the University of Virginia Alumni News for December 1928. There are pertinent records in the Minutes of the University's Board of Visitors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GEORGE LONG Long Hall is named for George Long, one of the original faculty members selected in England by Francis Walker Gilmer, the agent of the University of Virginia commissioned by Thomas Jefferson. Long was then a Don of Cambridge University. He was but twenty-five years of age; but he had already gained distinction, having been elected to a Fellowship for which Thomas Babington Macaulay had been an unsuccessful candidate. At Virginia, Long was the first Professor of Ancient Languages; and though he held that position for only three years, in a notable way he gave to that School its reputation for sound scholarship and vigorous instruction, for he was succeeded by a student and admirer of his, Gessner Harrison, who in his thirty-one years as Professor ably maintained and extended the solid distinction of the University's courses in the Classics. In 1828 Long was called back to be Professor of Greek at the newly founded University of London. In his short stay in Charlottesville he adjusted himself remarkably to life in Virginia. Jefferson was surprised at first by Gilmer's selection of one who was seemingly a boy Professor. But he soon concluded that Long was "a most sociable man, of fine understanding and well qualified for his Department, and acquiring esteem as fast as he became known." He was popular with the students (they dubbed him "Colonel"—perhaps because of his short stature), and when he contributed the first romance on the Lawn by wooing and wedding Harriet Selden, a sister of the wife of Proctor Brockenbrough, there was perpetrated this student couplet: "Harriet wants but little here below, But wants that little Long." He drew by lot Pavilion V; and in addition to his energetic teaching and his spirited social life, he contributed the Greek section to John Lewis's Tables of Comparative Etymology and Analogous Formations, and he collaborated with Robley Dunglison in the preparation of an Introduction to the Study of Grecian and Roman Geography, both of which works were published in 1828. His three years in the United States made a deep impression on him, as is evidenced by his letters to his American friends. In the Civil War he ardently espoused the Southern side, and thereafter he termed himself "an unreconstructed rebel." In the second edition (1869) of his translation of The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius he included in a note a warm tribute to General Robert E. Lee. His later career in England fulfilled the promise of his youth. After several years (1828–1831) as Professor of Greek at the University of London, he became Editor of the Quarterly Journal of Education and he edited twenty-nine volumes of the Penny Cyclopaedia, a publication sponsored by the Society for the Propagation of Useful Knowledge. There was another period of teaching (1842–1846), this time as Professor of Latin at University College in London. In 1849 he became Classical Lecturer at Brighton College, then newly opened, and for the next twenty or more years he contributed largely to its considerable measure of success. Meantime he was one of the founders of the Royal Geographical Society, and his works on Classical Geography were standard for many years. He likewise became a recognized authority on Roman Law. His published translations included, as has been mentioned, The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius; and in view of the openness, elevation, and integrity of his character, it was said of George Long that no one better exemplified "the good life" prescribed in The Meditations. He was born 4 November 1800 in Poulton, Lancashire, and died 10 August 1879 at Portfield, Chichester. The American Letters of George Long, edited by Thomas FitzHugh, appeared in the University of Virginia Alumni Bulletin for October 1916 and January and April 1917, and they were printed separately in 1917. A small supplementary collection of his American letters, edited by Selden Piercy, appeared in the Alumni Bulletin for October 1924. Professor Long has been a favorite subject for articles in the Alumni Bulletin, the issue for May 1894 containing one by Burwell Stark, the issue for October 1914 containing one by Francis H. Smith, and the issue for July 1924 containing one by Philip Alexander Bruce. There are references to Professor Long in Herbert B. Adams's Thomas Jefferson and the University of Virginia, and in the Histories of the University of Virginia by Barringer-Garnett-Page (volume I, page 123), by Bruce, and by Patton: and there is, of course, a sketch in the British Dictionary of National Biography. Extended notices of his death appeared in the Academy, volume two, 1879, in the Athanaeum for 23 August 1879, and in the November 1879 (by H. J. Mathews) and in the March 1880 issues of the Brighton College Magazine. No picture of Long taken while he was at the University of Virginia appears to have been preserved. The one reproduced represents him toward the end of his life, and was received from G. P. Burstow, Esq., of the Junior School of Brighton College in kind response to a request from Miss Louise Savage, Associate Librarian of the Alderman Library. Mr. Burstow records the request in an article on George Long in The Brightonion for May 1961.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WILLIAM HOLMES McGUFFEY McGuffey Hall takes its name from William Holmes McGuffey, Professor of Moral Philosophy for twenty-eight years, from 1845 to 1873. He was born in Washington County, Pennsylvania, 23 September 1800, the son of Alexander and Anna Holmes McGuffey, a pioneer couple of Scotch-Irish stock. The boy was trained at home, at the Old Stone Academy under the tutelage of the Rev. Thomas Hughes, and at Washington College, afterwards Washington and Jefferson College. He early developed a prodigious memory. In 1826 he graduated with honors. At once he became Professor of Ancient Languages in Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. After six years he was transferred to the chair of Mental Philosophy. Meantime he had been licensed as a minister of the Presbyterian Church. In 1836 he became the first President of Cincinnati College, but the financial panic of 1837 adversely affected the new institution, and after three years McGuffey accepted an offer to became President of Ohio University in Oxford, Ohio. The four years he held this post were prosperous for the growth of the institution, but here too he was hampered by a local failure to accord support, and in 1843 he resigned from his second presidency to accept a position at Woodward College, a school founded in emulation of the great public schools of England. It was from Woodward College that he was called in 1845 to succeed Professor George Tucker as Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Virginia. Here he remained during the prosperous years of the 1850's, through the desolation wrought by the war, and into the years of adjustment and reconstruction that followed. That was a time characterized by an earnest and responsive attitude on the part of the students, particularly of those during the war and postwar years, and Professor McGuffey was eminently fitted to meet their needs. He was a purposeful teacher, his teachings were infused with moral force, and he came to Virginia in the maturity of his intellectual life. He exerted himself to make his students think and reason for themselves, and though his courses were formidable, the ratio of those failing to pass was the lowest in the University. As a minister he never held a stated charge, but on Sundays he preached frequently. He taught and preached directly, using notes merely. Toward the end of his life he estimated that he had preached on some 3,000 occasions, but that none of his sermons had been written out. While at Miami University he had married Harriet Spining, the daughter of Judge Isaac Spining of Ohio, and they had two daughters and three sons. She died in 1853 in Charlottesville. In 1857 he had married again, this time to Laura Howard, the daughter of Professor Henry Howard of the Medical School at the University of Virginia. They had one daughter, who died in infancy. At the University the family lived in Pavilion IX, West Lawn, behind which still stands the imposing McGuffey ash. Professor McGuffey continued active teaching until within a few weeks of his death, on 4 May 1873. He is buried in the University Cemetery. For many years the Columbus McGuffey Society has arranged that a wreath be placed on his grave on the anniversaries of his death. The truth was that his fame extended far beyond the bounds of the University of Virginia. Coming of a pioneer family, he had been a pioneer of education, an educator with a preacher's zeal, and a preacher of morality and good taste, who, strange as it may seem, produced a best seller. His best seller was the McGuffey Eclectic Readers. Begun in 1838 when he was President of Cincinnati College, the series extended to six readers, with a high school reader and a speller added. They were compiled with an uncanny knowledge of youthful aptitudes and capacity, the contents were chosen for their cultural and moral instruction, they were amply illustrated, and they were steadily revised by the substitution of fresh material-those revisions were continued into the years at the University of Virginia. There is an appealing story of one of his methods in this process. It is said that he would invite to parties at his pavilion on West Lawn children of the neighborhood of the appropriate ages, and, after games and refreshments, would gather the children about him and read to them selections chosen for the age limits. Whenever their attention was keen, the selection was accepted as a candidate for inclusion in a Reader; but whenever the children became inattentive and restless, that selection was discarded. The Readers went through edition after edition, they were adopted in thirty-seven of the then existing States, and their sale reached the estimated figure of 122,000,000 copies. Their influence in shaping the American mind of the midnineteenth century is specifically recognized by historians of the period. Indeed the mid-twentieth century is witnessing a revival of interest in Readers modeled upon the McGuffey pattern, and this has had its inception at the University of Virginia. The purpose is to combat the tendency towards juvenile delinquency by instilling right principles in the formative years, with the difference that the "thou shalt" and "thou shalt not" precepts of the original series are modified by enabling the pupils to discover the moral principles by themselves. The Golden Rule Series, in eight graded texts, compiled with devoted care by the late Professor Ullin Whitney Leavell, Director of the McGuffey Reading Clinic at the University of Virginia from 1946 to 1959, and published by the American Book Company, bids fair to rival the success of its predecessor, the McGuffey Readers. The new series has already been adopted by forty-one States and the District of Columbia. This is an effective memorial to Professor McGuffey. It has previously been mentioned that one of his outstanding characteristics was an extraordinary memory. He himself is being extraordinarily remembered. Among the several books about Professor McGuffey are Harvey C. Minnich's William Holmes McGuffey and his Readers and Henry H. Vail's A History of the McGuffey Readers. Doctor Minnich, who was Dean of Miami University and also Curator of its McGuffey Museum, was also the author of the sketch of McGuffey in the Dictionary of American Biography. Mark Sullivan in the second volume of Our Times portrays McGuffey's influence. There are references in Bruce's History of the University of Virginia and in the History of the University of Virginia by Barringer-Garnett-Page, and Culbreth in his Memories gives a moving picture of McGuffey's death and funeral. Special articles, mostly on his teaching, are printed in the University of Virginia Alumni Bulletin for May 1895, October 1911, April 1914, January 1915, and July 1917.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN WILLIAM MALLET Mallet Hall bears the name of John William Mallet, who was Professor of Chemistry (particularly in its industrial and agricultural applications) from 1868 to 1883 and from 1885 to 1908, when he was given the title of Emeritus Professor. He was born near Dublin, Ireland, 10 October 1832, the son of Robert Mallet, a civil engineer and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. He was a student at Trinity College of the University of Dublin, but he interrupted his undergraduate course by a period of study in Germany, and actually won the degree of Ph.D. at Göttingen the year before he received his B.A. from Trinity College. That was in 1853, and he went straightway to the United States (he was then twenty-one years old) to collect information for his father about the Erickson caloric engine, with no expectation of remaining in this country. But he was persuaded to take the post of Professor of Analytical Chemistry at Amherst College. He remained there, however, for only one year, being tempted by an offer to become Chemist of the Geological Survey of Alabama. This brought him into the Southern States, and he was soon holding also the chair of Chemistry at the University of Alabama. He was there when the Civil War broke out, and though he never relinquished his status as a British citizen, he was accepted as a private in the Confederate forces. He was soon promoted to a first lieutenancy and to a staff position and eventually he was, as a lieutenant-colonel, put in charge of the ordnance laboratories of the Confederacy. He had married in 1857 the daughter of Judge John Ormond of Alabama, and at the termination of the war he had a family of two sons and a daughter to support in the precarious conditions portrayed by Margaret Mitchell in "Gone with the Wind." But he found temporary employment by some northern capitalists, who wished a survey made of traces of petroleum in Louisiana and Texas. Then he became Professor of Chemistry in the Medical Department of the University of Louisiana. That position he held until 1868, when he began his long service at the University of Virginia. This service was interrupted for two years, 1883–1885, the first of which was spent as Professor of Chemistry at the University of Texas, partly to seek a favorable climate for his elder son, smitten fatally by tuberculosis; and the second as Professor of Chemistry at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, this being in part to seek a change of scene for his ailing wife, who died in 1886. His position at the University of Virginia had meantime been kept open for him, and he returned to it and to the house which had been erected for him in 1871. He was married again, in 1888, to Mrs. Josephine Burthe of Louisiana, who survived him. As a Professor he was an impressive personage, formal and dignified, with a carefully trimmed beard, and wearing customarily a cutaway coat and a silk hat. He had a high sense of duty in his relations with his colleagues in the Faculty and with the students. His lectures were systematic, concise, and clear, and his experiments were so carefully prepared beforehand that they are said to have never failed. He was the first President of the University of Virginia Philosophical Society; and when that was reorganized after its suspension consequent to the burning of the Rotunda, he was again its first President. His services were in demand throughout the region as an expert witness in medico-legal cases. His first scientific article had been prepared while he was a student in Trinity College, and the roll of his learned contributions numbered well over a hundred. He was a member of many scientific societies in the United States, Europe, and South America. He received an honorary degree of M.D. from the University of Louisiana, and the degree of LL.D. honoris causa was conferred upon him by William and Mary, the University of Mississippi, Princeton, Johns Hopkins, and the University of Pennsylvania. Vigorous both mentally and physically, he continued his full life as a Professor until he was seventy-six, when in 1908 the Board of Visitors did him the honor of making him Emeritus Professor. He died four years later, on 7 November 1912, and is buried in the University Cemetery. His home, the Mallet House, was torn down in 1929 to make way for the erection of Monroe Hall. But his name is now fittingly preserved in Mallet Hall. The Alumni Bulletin of the University of Virginia for January 1913 contains a full record of Professor Mallet's activities, together with a memoir by Professor Echols. The Alumni Bulletin had previously contained articles about him in the issues for July 1908, October 1908, and January 1909. There are numerous references in the histories by Bruce and by Barringer-Garnett-Page, and there is a warm appreciation in Culbreth's Memories. His ordnance services during the Civil War are described by Joseph B. Milgram, Jr., in an article in Foote Prints, volume 32, number 2, 1961, a technical journal published by the Foote Mineral Company of Philadelphia. The Dictionary of American Biography prints a sketch of his life by Francis Preston Venable; and there is a concise entry in volume one of Who Was Who in America.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN CALVIN METCALF The Metcalf Residence House commemorates the name of John Calvin Metcalf, Linden Kent Professor of English Literature from 1917 to 1940 and Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies from 1923 to 1937—a scholar-administrator who quietly deepened the prestige of an expanding University. He was born in Christian County, Kentucky, 7 August 1865. His father, a native of Maine, was a prominent physician in southern Kentucky, and his mother was related to several distinguished Virginia families. The son matriculated at Georgetown College in Kentucky, winning his M.A. in 1888. He pursued graduate study at the University of Chicago and at Harvard University, gaining his second M.A. from the latter in 1905. Meantime he had begun his teaching career, as Professor of Latin at Soule College in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, as Professor of Modern Languages at Mercer University in Georgia, and as Professor of English at his alma mater, Georgetown College, the last post being held from 1895 to 1904. He came to Virginia in 1904, where, at the University of Richmond, he was Professor of English from 1904 to 1917 and Dean from 1914 to 1917. Thereafter he was at the University of Virginia, gaining well deserved renown as a teacher, as an administrator, as a lecturer, and as an editor and an author. He was a man of gentle manners and a distinguished bearing, and he won a host of friends among his students and his associates. As a teacher and public lecturer he blended clarity and wit with convincing scholarship. Though he retired from teaching in 1940, he was in the session of 19421943 summoned back to give courses during the absence of many Professors in war service. Under his administration the Graduate School came of age in gaining recognition among the Universities of this country. As Chairman of the Faculty Library Committee for twenty-one years (during which he presided over every one of its meetings) he saw the Library expand into a collection and service of distinction. Meantime his facile pen produced numerous textbooks. He was an Associate Editor of the Virginia Quarterly Review and (following Professor Kent) the Literary Editor of the Library of Southern Literature, a Joint Editor of The Enchanted Years: a Book of Contemporary Verse and of The Centennial Volume of the University of Virginia, and the author of such books as The Stream of English Biography (1930), De Quincey, a Portrait (1940), and Know Your Shakespeare (1949). At the University of Virginia he received the Raven Award in 1938 and the Sullivan Award in 1940. Upon his retirement a volume of Humanistic Studies was prepared in his honor. He was a charter member of the Conference of Deans of Southern Graduate Schools, an early President of the Association of Virginia Colleges and of the Virginia Library Association, one of the founders of the Virginia Folklore Society, and he was a member of the Author's Club of London. Honorary degrees of Litt.D. were conferred upon him by Georgetown College, by Baylor University, and by the University of Kentucky, and the honorary degree of LL.D. by the University of Richmond. His portrait, painted in his academic robes by Frederick Wight, adorns the Colonnade Club at the University of Virginia. Professor Metcalf was married in 1891 to Ruth Cooper Sharp, and they had one son, Victor Sharp Metcalf, a youth of rare promise, who died while in training as a soldier in the First World War. He had been an avid reader, and his father devised for him a touching memorial, a special alcove in the University of Richmond Library in which were placed his favorite volumes, which were annually augmented by such new books as would have appealed to him. The mother died in 1925; and in 1929 Dean Metcalf was married again, to Edmonia Carrington Lancaster, who with devoted companionship enriched the later years of his life, until his death on 9 September 1949. His grave is in the University Cemetery, not far from the Metcalf Residence House, and there is a handsome Library endowment in his memory. There is a concise sketch of Professor Metcalf's life in volume one of Who Was Who in America. Volume five of Bruce's History of the University of Virginia contains a tribute to Victor Sharp Metcalf, Professor Metcalf's son. There are obituary notices in the Charlottesville Daily Progress for 10 September 1949 and in the University of Virginia Alumni News for November 1949.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JAMES MORRIS PAGE Page Residence House bears the name of James Morris Page, known to many generations of students as "The Dean." Holding a position in the School of Mathematics from 1896 to 1934, he was Dean for thirty years, from 1904 to 1934. He was born in Louisa County, Virginia, on 4 March 1864, the son of Thomas Walker and Nancy Watson Morris Page, his parents being related to a galaxy of notable Virginia families. The son received his early training from his father, a graduate of the University of Virginia, and from a day school in Louisa County. As a college student at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Virginia, he carried off all the prizes offered by the academic department, and during his last two years he was appointed an assistant in Mathematics. He received his M.A. in 1885, and then went for advanced study to Germany. There he achieved in Leipzig a Ph.D. magna cum laude, and had to his credit several published articles on the theory of transformation groups. On his return, he and his brother, Thomas Walker Page, Jr. (who became a Professor of Economics at the University of Virginia and later was Chairman of the United States Tariff Commission), established the Keswick School in Albemarle County, which they conducted for eight years. In 1895–1896 James Morris Page was a Fellow in Mathematics at Johns Hopkins University, and in 1896 there was published by the Macmillan Company in London his Ordinary Differential Equations. It was in this year that he received appointment as Adjunct Professor of Mathematics at the University of Virginia. He became a full Professor four years later. Professor Page was an essential cog in the changes in administration that took place when Edwin Anderson Alderman became the first President of the University of Virginia in 1904. He was the last Chairman of the Faculty under the organization that had persisted since Jefferson's day, and he was the first Dean under the organization framed by the new President. He was strategically fitted to preserve the essential values amid the radical changes in the administration, and his salutary influence on the character of the University was profound. In his thirty years as Dean he served as Acting President during the absences of President Alderman; he was a member of many faculty committees; he served a term as Secretary of the Alumni Association; he was the first President of the Beta Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa; and he was for many years a valued member of the State Board of Education. Notwithstanding the pressure of his responsibilities as Dean (he was both the University Dean and the Dean of the College), he continued to give a course in Mathematics, and he was the pioneer in this country in the interpretation of the mathematical theories of Sophus Lie, one of his teachers at Leipzig. As the officer for discipline, it was his fate to know best the discredited students, but he was a man of heart as well as of mind, and his sympathetic understanding saved many from confusion and discouragement. Perhaps his greatest achievement was as a spiritual therapist. At the University he lived in the last of the three houses on McCormick Road, occupied later by the Engineers' Club. He married Elinore Mildred McGlore in 1900, and they had seven children: James Morris Page, Jr., of Chicago; Mrs. Robert Parrish of Richmond, Anne Page, Mrs. Nelson Daniel of Newport News; William Fontaine Page and Mann Page, both deceased; and John Cary Page of Richmond. His retirement in 1934 was caused by ill health, and he was then named Dean Emeritus by the Board of Visitors. He died on 18 March 1936, and impressive funeral services were held at Grace Episcopal Church in Cismont, Albemarle County, in the graveyard of which he lies buried. There is a concise sketch of Dean Page's career in volume one of Who Was Who in America. Bruce's History of the University of Virginia and the History by Barringer-Garnett-Page contain extensive references to him; and there are articles about him in the University of Virginia Alumni Bulletin for August 1897 and April 1915. Obituary notices appeared in the Charlottesville Daily Progress for 18 and 19 March 1936 and in the University of Virginia Alumni News for April 1936, the last being written by John J. Luck, Director of Alumni Activities.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WILLIAM ELISHA PETERS Peters Hall is named in honor of William Elisha Peters, Professor of Latin from 1866 to 1902 and Emeritus Professor until his death 22 March 1906. He was born 28 August 1829 in Bedford County, Virginia, the son of Elisha and Cynthia (Turner) Peters. He attended New London Academy in Bedford County and graduated from Emory and Henry College. After two postgraduate years (1850–1852) at the University of Virginia, he was invited back to Emory and Henry College as Professor of Greek and Latin. He continued there until 1861, except for two years of study in Germany. But immediately upon Virginia's secession in April 1861, Professor Peters enlisted as a private in the Southern forces. In active service he was promoted through the ranks to Colonel, and was three times wounded, twice seriously. In 1864 he was in the campaign into Pennsylvania. Being ordered to burn Chambersburg, he refused, firmly stating that he had not enlisted to fight women and children. Other officers outranking him did execute that command, but General Lee upheld Colonel Peters' refusal, and he was not court-martialed. In 1866 when the School of Ancient Languages at the University of Virginia, which had been taught by Professor Gildersleeve unassisted through the war, was divided, Colonel Peters became Professor of Latin. In his teaching he maintained the qualities of earnestness, strict accuracy, and courage, and he also had a deep personal interest in those he taught; "Old Pete" was greatly respected by generations of students. To his faculty associates he was a valued friend and a firm and wise counsellor. In the religious life of the University he manifested an effective concern. In 1858 he married Margaret Sheffey of Marion, Virginia. Some years after her death he married (in 1873) her sister, Mary Sheffey. At the University he lived on West Lawn, first in Pavilion III and later in Pavilion IX. After thirty-six years of occupation of his chair of Latin, he voluntarily resigned in 1902; four years later he succumbed to an attack of pneumonia. He was buried in the Sheffey family cemetery in Marion. Much of his private collection of books on classical subjects was presented to the University Library by his sons, James White Sheffey Peters, a lawyer in Washington, and Don Preston Peters, a physician in Lynchburg. In the University of Virginia Alumni Bulletin for January 1907 there are printed tributes to Professor Peters by Charles W. Kent, Francis H. Smith, George H. Denny, and John S. Mosby. The issue of the Alumni Bulletin for April 1915 contains a tribute to his teaching by Edward S. Joynes. There are full references to him in the histories of the University of Virginia by Barringer-Garnett-Page, by Bruce, and by Culbreth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WILLIAM BARTON ROGERS Rogers Hall was named in honor of William Barton Rogers, who was Professor of Natural Philosophy from 1835 to 1853, and later was instrumental in the founding of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, of which he was the first President. He was born in Philadelphia 7 December 1804, the second of four brothers, all of whom became distinguished scientists. His father, Patrick Kerr Rogers, was one of the men of ability forced out of Ireland by political entanglements. The father received the degree of Doctor of Medicine from the University of Pennsylvania in 1806, practiced medicine there and in Baltimore, and in 1819 was appointed Professor of Natural Philosophy and Chemistry at the College of William and Mary. The son, William Barton, received training under his father's instruction, in a school in Baltimore, and in the college at Williamsburg. As a graduate of William and Mary he joined with one of his brothers in conducting a school near Baltimore, and he lectured before the Maryland Institute. On the death of his father in 1828, William Barton Rogers, then twenty-four years of age, was named to succeed him in the professorship at William and Mary. This post he held until 1835, when he was called to the position in Charlottesville. That same year, largely as the result of his advocacy of the value of a more thorough knowledge of the mineral resources of the State, the Virginia Legislature undertook a Geological Survey with Rogers as its Chief. Thus when he came to the University of Virginia, Professor Rogers had already demonstrated unusual powers in research, in exposition, and in progressive thinking. The eighteen years (1835 to 1853) spent in intimate contact with Jeffersonian educational concepts were powerful incentives in the maturing of his creative capacity. Being at the same time a Professor with a full schedule of classes and the State Geologist with field surveys in progress, there was an onerous pressure of work. But his annual reports and other papers on the Geology of the Virginias, published after his death, became standard authorities; and by the uniform testimony of those who received instruction from him, there were in his lectures unusual qualities of clarity and eloquence. There is a tradition that students not enrolled in his courses were in their free hours wont so to crowd into his classes that at times he and his assistant demonstrator were compelled to climb in at a window to reach the platform! The period in Charlottesville was also one of frustration. The Virginia Legislature lost its enthusiasm for the Geological Survey and terminated it. In the University the solidly entrenched lecture system was not ready for the introduction of adequate laboratory equipment. Morever those were years of inordinate unruliness by a part of the student body; and Professor Rogers, he was Chairman of the Faculty for 1844–1845, was deeply involved in the baffling problems of discipline. In order to concentrate on what he deemed should be his life work, he sought release by resignation as early as 1848, but was persuaded to remain in Charlottesville five years more. However, in 1853 he definitely turned to a new field of opportunity. On a geological expedition into New England he had met Miss Emma Savage, a daughter of James Savage of Lunenburg, Massachusetts, the compiler of The Genealogical Dictionary of New England. She had become his wife in 1849. At the University they lived in Pavilion VI. Through the Savage family he came into touch with a congenial group in Massachusetts, and he was encouraged there to advocate his then novel conception of an institute devoted to technical training. There too frustration impeded the effort, and it was not until 1861 that legislative approval was secured—and 1861 was a year of intense concentration on war. However, a site for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was acquired, a building programme started, and the beginnings of a faculty and a student body assembled. Any genealogy of ideas must needs be inexact. Yet it may be suggestive that in the first faculty the Professor of Chemistry was Charles W. Eliot, whose educational statesmanship was soon to be proved as the President of Harvard. Rogers himself was made President of the Institute of Technology, and this position he held, except for an interval of ill health, until 1880. On 30 May 1882, then Professor Emeritus, he died in action while handing diplomas to the graduates of that year. In the Life and Letters of William Barton Rogers, compiled by his widow with the assistance of William T. Sedgewick, Professor of Biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, there is a bibliography listing ninety of his publications, of which thirty-five are dated during his connection with the University of Virginia. The two volumes of the Life and Letters are based so fully on the correspondence of the four brothers that they might be termed a foursome autobiography. That fraternal combination achieved international fame in science—in Germany they were known as the "Gebrüder Rogers." The eldest, James Blythe Rogers (1802– 1852), was a lecturer at the Maryland Institute and held professorships in Cincinnati College, the Philadelphia Medical Institute, the Franklin Institute, and the University of Pennsylvania. The two who were younger than William Barton were Henry Darwin Rogers (1808–1866), who held professorships at Dickinson College and at the University of Pennsylvania, was Director of the Geological Survey of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and completed his career as Regius Professor of Natural History at the University of Glasgow in Scotland; and Robert Empie Rogers (1813–1884), who was Professor of Chemistry at the University of Virginia (1842–1852), Professor and Dean at the University of Pennsylvania, and Professor at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. In a memoir in the Publications of the National Academy of Science it is affirmed that this was "a family group scarcely to be excelled for native powers and acquirements, in the history of science, in this or any age or country." There is a plethora of biographical material aside from the two-volume Life and Letters, which was published by the Houghton Mifflin Company in 1896. There are sketches of each of the four brothers in the Dictionary of American Biography, and in the memoirs of various scientific societies. Professor Rogers' eloquence is stressed in the printed address by William Cabell Rives, given before the Society of the Alumni of the University of Virginia in 1883. Joseph Kent Roberts, Professor of Geology at the University of Virginia 1926 to 1959, contributed extended biographical sketches to the June 1886 Proceedings of the Geological Society of America and to the Annotated Bibliography of Virginia Geology, a 1942 publication of the University of Virginia Library. There are articles in the University of Virginia Alumni Bulletin for November 1897, for May 1898, and March 1900; and there are, of course, references in the Barringer-Garnett-Page compilation and in Bruce's History and in Culbreth's Memories.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FRANCIS HENRY SMITH Smith Hall appropriately extends in visible form the prolonged and distinguished connection of Francis Henry Smith with the University of Virginia. He was a student at the University from 1849 to 1851, and received the then somewhat rare degree of M.A. in course. He was an assistant to the Professor of Mathematics from 1851 to 1853, Professor of Natural Philosophy from 1853 to 1907 (over half a century), and Emeritus Professor in residence from 1907 until his death in 1928—an uninterrupted connection of nearly four score years. He was born in Leesburg, Virginia, 14 October 1829, his parents on both sides being descended from colonial settlers. He was a student in Leesburg Academy and at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, where he was a member of the class of 1850. Though his stay at Wesleyan was for only two years, he was, on the completion of his college course at Charlottesville, elected to the Middletown chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. His services as a Professor were in depth as well as in length, and they contributed solidly to the University's reputation for thoroughness and scholarship. He was serious in purpose and of gentle manners, a scholar of broad learning, and a lucid and eloquent lecturer. His appreciation of the abilities of his associates in the Faculty was a contribution to morale, a vital force for faculties as well as for football teams. His writings were not prolific, but included an Outline of Physics and three treatises on the harmony of Science and the Bible. He was a strong supporter of the Young Men's Christian Association and of the University Chapel, and for twenty years he was a member of the governing board of the Miller Manual Labor School in Albemarle County. During the War of 1861–1865 he and Commodore Matthew Fontaine Maury were elected by the Confederate Congress to be Commissioners of Weights and Measures. Honorary degrees were conferred upon him by Hampden-Sydney, Emory and Henry, and Randolph-Macon in Ashland (LL.D.) and by Sewanee (D.C.L.). In 1853, the year he became Professor of Natural Philosophy, he married Mary Stuart Harrison, a daughter of Professor Gessner Harrison. Their daughter, Eleanor, extended the family relationships of "the Lawn" by becoming the wife of Professor Charles William Kent. Another daughter, Rosalie, regained the surname Harrison by marriage to Dr. Isaac Carrington Harrison. One son, Captain George Tucker Smith (familiarly known as "the Admiral"), was a surgeon in the United States Navy, and another son, James Duncan Smith, gained distinction as an artist. It was in Pavilion V, under the care of Mrs. Kent, that the end came for Professor Smith on 5 July 1928, one year, three months, and nine days short of one hundred years. It was Dean Metcalf's remark, from the office of the Department of Graduate Studies in the neighboring Pavilion III, that Francis Smith, that radiant spirit, had appeared "to be coming down in person to posterity." There are an early account of Professor Smith's personality as a teacher in David M. R. Culbreth's The University of Virginia: Memories of her Student-Life and Professors, pages 384–389, and a later account contributed by William Mynn Thornton, after Professor Smith's death, to the University of Virginia Alumni News for September 1928. The Culbreth account is quoted at length in Bruce's History of the University of Virginia. Additional references are in Tyler's Men of Mark in Virginia, volume one, in the historical compilation by Barringer-Garnett-Page, volume two, in Who Was Who in America, 1897–1942, and in the 6 July 1928 issues of the Charlottesville Daily Progress and the Richmond Times-Dispatch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GEORGE TUCKER Tucker Hall commemorates the name of George Tucker, Professor of Moral Philosophy from 1825 to 1845. He was fifty years of age when he became a member of the University's original Faculty, and both before and after his career as a Professor he achieved distinction in other fields. Born 20 August 1775 in Bermuda of a leading family which was actively sympathetic with the American Revolution, he had received private tutoring and had been clerk in a law office when he came to Virginia in 1795 for courses at the College of William and Mary. Two years later he was graduated, was married, and had commenced a period of varied interests, social, legal, literary, and political, during which he resided successively in Richmond, in Chatham in Pittsylvania County, and in Lynchburg. He was elected to the Virginia General Assembly in 1815; and he served for three terms, 1819 to 1825, as a Congressman in Washington. It was at that stage that he was chosen as a member of the Faculty of the newly established University of Virginia. His selection appears to have been based more on his reputation as a writer than on his political distinction. On his part, the prospect of more leisure for literary pursuits was potent in the decision to accept the offer of a professorship. The School of Moral Philosophy was conceived by Jefferson as an essential instrument for the moral and political training of future citizens. During his tenure of office Tucker gave courses in a singular variety of subjects: Ethics, Metaphysics, Logic, Political Economy, Statistics, Belles-Lettres, Rhetoric, and English Composition. As there was no Professor of English Literature until 1882, the original direction and stimulation of competence in literary communication was largely supplied by Professor Tucker. Being the most mature among generally youthful associates, he was chosen the first Chairman of the Faculty; and in facing the problems of the formative period of the University, he exerted a steadying and a discerning influence on administration. His genial nature, his good humor, his racy comments made him perhaps the best liked of his associates. He continued his writing during this period—his productions thus far had a wide range, embracing novels (his novel The Valley of the Shenandoah had some vogue in England as well as in the United States, and his Voyage to the Moon anticipated by some years Poe's Hans Pfaall) and essays political, economic, and educational —and in 1837 there was published his two-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson. To secure more complete freedom for authorship, he resigned in 1845, at the age of seventy, though this decision appears to have been influenced also by the withdrawal from the University of his friend and kinsman, Henry St. George Tucker, who had been from 1841 to 1845 Professor of Law. George Tucker's last years were spent mostly in Philadelphia, and proved a prolific period for writing, including his Essays Moral and Metaphysical, his Political Economy for the People, and his four-volume History of the United States. His health continued to be remarkably vigorous; and his death resulted from an accident received in Mobile, Alabama, while he was on an informatory tour. He was taken to the home of his son-in-law, George Rives, in Albemarle County, and he died there on 10 April 1861, just on the outbreak of the War Between the States. He was married three times: in 1797 to Mary Byrd Farley, who died two years later; in 1802 to Maria Ball Carter, a granddaughter of George Washington's sister, who died in 1823; and in 1828, during his residence at the University, to Louisa Bowdoin Thompson, who died in 1859. At the University he lived in Pavilion IX. It is appropriate, especially since he was an ancestor to several faculty families, that his final resting place is in the University Cemetery—where, however, his tombstone incorrectly gives the date of his birth as 1 August instead of 20 August 1775. George Tucker's manuscript autobiography is in the Alderman Library. A master's thesis by Malcolm Lester, with a comprehensive bibliography, covers the life up to the coming to the University of Virginia. A contemporary appraisal by Robley Dunglison, who had been a faculty colleague, appeared in the 1862 Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, pages 64–70. The sketch of Tucker by Broadus Mitchell in the Dictionary of American Biography emphasizes the achievements as author and political economist. An article by Herman Patrick Johnson in the University of Virginia Alumni Bulletin for October 1914 deals with Tucker as an essayist; and an article by Tipton Ray Snavely in the Alumni Bulletin for April 1923 deals with him as an economist. Professor Snavely also contributed a comprehensive biographical sketch to the Charlottesville Daily Progress on the one hundredth anniversary, 10 April 1961, of Tucker's death. A critical volume-length study by Robert Colin McLean was published in 1961 by the University of North Carolina Press— and was critically reviewed by James Southall Wilson in the Summer 1961 issue of The Virginia Quarterly Review. Bruce and Patton in their histories of the University have full references to Professor Tucker.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARLES SCOTT VENABLE Venable Hall bears the name of Charles Scott Venable, Professor of Mathematics from 1865 to 1896. He was of the fifth generation of a family that had settled in Virginia in 1687, and had been composed of sturdy country gentlemen, prominent in public affairs and officers in the Revolutionary War and in the War of 1812. He was born 19 April 1827 at "Longwood" in Prince Edward County, a home eminent for culture, hospitality, and a wholesome outdoor life. His father, Nathaniel Venable, was one of the founders of Hampden-Sydney College, and the son, trained by private tutors, entered that College when twelve years of age and graduated when fifteen. He remained at Hampden-Sydney as a Tutor in Mathematics for two years, and then spent a session at the University of Virginia, after which he was called back to his alma mater as Professor of Mathematics. This post he held until 1856, but was on leave for a further year at the University of Virginia (where he completed the courses in six Schools), and for a year of study in Germany, at Berlin and at Bonn. In 1856 he received appointment as Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Georgia, but his stay there was for only one year, as he transferred to the chair of Mathematics and Astronomy at South Carolina College, later called the University of South Carolina. While there, in 1860, he was appointed on a commission to make observations in Labrador on the solar eclipse of that year. At the outbreak of the War of 1861–1865 he promptly volunteered, and saw active service from the bombardment of Fort Sumter to the surrender at Appomattox. In 1862 Venable was chosen by General Lee as one of his aides, and, attaining the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, he remained in close relationship with the General until the end of hostilities. Then, like his beloved Commander, he turned from grievously blighted hopes to the task of educating the new generation; and in 1865 he began his long term of thirty-one years as Professor of Mathematics at the University of Virginia. He was in the true sense a gentleman and a scholar. Dignified and forceful as a teacher, he possessed an instinctive comprehension of the individual needs of his students, and he made the School of Mathematics one of the largest and most highly respected in the University. In the post-war endeavor to provide text-books for use in the South, he prepared a number in Mathematics; indeed he would have covered that field completely had not other responsibilities prevented. He was elected Chairman of the Faculty for the years 1870 to 1873 and from 1886 to 1888; he had a large share in the establishment of new Schools, in Astronomy, in Biology and Agriculture, in Applied Chemistry, in Engineering, and in Natural History and Geology; and it was largely he who induced the Virginia Legislature to increase the annual appropriation for the University from $15,000 to $40,000. He was Chairman of the Trustees of the Miller Manual Labor School of Albemarle County, and he effectively aided in making that one of the foremost industrial schools of the South. At the University he lived in Pavilion VIII and in the Monroe House, rendering his home as hospitable a haven for the academic community as had been his ancestral "Longwood." He was married twice: first, in 1856, to Margaret Cantey McDowell, a daughter of Governor James McDowell, who died in 1874; and second, in 1876, to Mrs. Mary Southall Brown, the widow of Colonel J. Thompson Brown. There were five children by the first marriage and one by the second. One son, Francis Preston Venable, became President of the University of North Carolina; and another, Charles Scott Venable, son by the second marriage, won renown as a physician in San Antonio, Texas. Two of his daughters had the wedded name of Minor. Mary McDowell Venable married Dr. Charles Launcelot Minor, a medical specialist of international reputation; and Natalie Embra Venable married Raleigh Colston Minor, Professor of Law, thus uniting the Minor-Venable families which figure so notably in University of Virginia history. Professor Venable's sturdy physique stood him in good stead until he had well nigh reached three score years and ten. But ill health overtook him in 1896, compelling him to retire from his activities, and he was named Emeritus Professor. Death came on 11 August 1900, and he lies buried in the University Cemetery. The facts in Professor Venable's career are recorded in the article by Charles William Dabney in the Dictionary of American Biography. The background is portrayed in the memorial address by William Mynn Thornton which is printed in volume one of the Barringer-Garnett-Page History of the University of Virginia and is also published separately. Supplementary material is to be found in articles in the Alumni Bulletin for November 1896 by Francis Henry Smith and in the Alumni Bulletin for April 1901 by John William Mallet, in Bruce's History of the University of Virginia, and in Culbreth's Memories, and in Elizabeth Marchall Venable's The Venables of Virginia. There is a concise sketch in volume one of Who Was Who in America.</field>
