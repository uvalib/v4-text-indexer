His death is recorded on page 400, and mention of his death on page 90 also.

      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. The Annals of Henrico Parish down to Easter, 1884, were originally prepared by me at the request of Bishop Randolph, to furnish him with the facts of the history of St. John's for the preparation of his discourse for the Sesqui-Centennial, celebrated June 10, 1891. Shortly after that anniversary, I made up the Annals into an address and delivered it in St. John's, as Bishop Randolph had quoted only slightly from my gathered facts, his treatment of his theme having been rather philosophical. The annals of my own rectorship, as I say more particularly in the introduction thereto, are not meant for publication or expected to be generally read. I do not pretend to be a historian of my own time; much less do I wish to appear as magnifying my own ministry. Some of the minute details are of no importance in themselves, and probably will have no interest to the future historian of the parish, who may seek material in these pages; but they are put on record for the sake of those concerned, to whom the smallest things and simplest facts in and about the Church of their love are sacred and precious. On the other hand, I have told of things which everybody, now a member of St. John's, sees or knows; but I have been mindful of a time when these things may have disappeared or those who know of their history may have departed. The difficulties I found in preparing the facts concerning St. John's Church, through the one hundred and fifty years of its existence as a building, influenced me not a little in this matter. Authorities and references to which grateful acknowledgment is now, once for all, given: The Vestry Books of the Parish and of St. John's Church.

      <field name="fulltext">ANNALS OF HENRICO PARISH. BY RT. REV. LEWIS W. BURTON, D. D. The picturesque ruins of Jamestown mark the beginning of the Church in Virginia, in 1607. The history of Henrico Parish begins with the second established settlement in the colony. During the interregnum between the governorships of Lord De la War and Sir Thomas Gates, Sir Thomas Dale had acted as regent under the title of High Marshall of Virginia. On the arrival of Gates, Dale, by agreement, took advantage of the opportunity to carry out the cherished project of founding for himself a settlement. In the early part of September, 1611, at the head of 350 men, chiefly German laborers, he pushed up the river. He founded Henricopolis on the peninsula now insulated by Dutch Gap canal. Dale was almost a religious fanatic. He had named his new city in honor of Prince Henry, the eldest son of James I. After this prince's sudden death, Dale writes: "My glorious master is gone, that would have enamelled with his favors the labors I undertake for God's cause and his immortal honor. He was the great captain of our Israel; the hope to have builded up this heavenly new Jerusalem be interred, I think; the whole frame of this business fell into his grave." The Rev. Alexander Whitaker accompanied Dale. He calls the latter "Our religious and valiant Governor." He describes him as "a man of great knowledge in divinity, and of a good conscience in all things, both which," he adds, "be rare in a martial man." The settlement of Henrico, therefore, had from the first a decidedly religious character. Prominent and earliest among the buildings erected by Dale was a church. He built it even before he had laid the foundation of his own residence. Its site was near the line of the present Dutch Gap canal. A more handsome structure of brick was speedily undertaken. For defensive purposes, Dale located another settlement at the western angle of the junction of the Appomattox with the James. This received the name of Bermuda Hundred, by which it is still known. It quickly began to outshine its sister village of Henricopolis. The governor of the colony sometimes took up his residence at Bermuda Hundred. But the earlier settlement gave the name of Henrico to the county and parish with which we are concerned. When, in 1634, the colony was divided into eight shires, after the English fashion, the bounds of Henrico were made to include present Chesterfield and Powhatan counties, on the south of the river, and Goochland on the north. The parish lines were coincident with those of the shire. Mr. Whitaker was, of course, first rector of the parish. Dale enclosed a glebe of 100 acres and built a parsonage on the south side of the river, at a point convenient to both settlements. It was called, and the site is still known by the name of Rock Hall. Mr. Whitaker's father was Dr. William Whitaker, Master of St. John's College, an eminent theologian and controversialist of Cambridge, and a friend of the "judicious Hooker." Alexander Whitaker himself was a graduate of Cambridge. For some years he had been a minister in the north of England, beloved and well supported by his people. He enjoyed besides a handsome heritage from his parents. He seems to have come to this country purely under the influence of the highest missionary spirit, believing himself to have been called by God to do so. He experienced all the struggles with himself and all the opposition of friends that try the foreign missionary's soul. A contemporary thus writes of him* * The effort is made here and throughout this history to reproduce as nearly as possible all quotations and records. : "He did voluntarily leave his warme nest; and to the wonder of his kindred and amazement of them that knew him, under-tooke this hard, but, in my judgement, heroicall resolution to go to Virginia, and helpe to beare the name of God unto the gentiles." The unanimous opinion of him seems to be that he was "purest of men," "truly pious," and most zealous in that missionary work, especially among the Indians, to which he had devoted himself. "Every Sabbath day," he writes to a friend in London, "we preach in the forenoon and catechize in the afternoon. Every Saturday, at night, I exercise (exhort) in Sir Thomas Dale's house." Meanwhile, in 1612, Pocahontas had been taken prisoner by the English, and Dale had succeeded Gates as Governor. Dale labored long to ground the faith of Jesus Christ in the heart of this Indian princess. Of her he wrote: "Were it but for the gaining of this one soul, I will think my time, toils, and present stay well spent." Mr. Whitaker was undoubtedly his glad agent in the effort to evangelize this child of the forest. At any rate, this excellent clergyman had the delight of baptizing her under the name of Rebecca. In April of 1613 or 1614 he also married her to John Rolfe. Shortly she and her husband removed into the neighborhood of Henricopolis, where Rolfe had a plantation. They continued to be members of this parish until Pocahontas left Virginia. Whitaker sent a sermon of his to England, in which he had written: "Though my promise of three yeeres' seruice to my countrey be expired, will abide in my vocation here untill I be lawfully called from hence." He added an earnest and loving exhortation to others to come over and help. He resisted the temptation to return to England in 1616 with his attached friend, Dale. But within a brief time he was indeed "lawfully called" by Him whose providence is supreme. In the spring of 1617, this our first rector, the gentle, earnest Whitaker, known to history as the "Apostle of Virginia," was accidentally drowned in the James. A Mr. Wickham had served as an assistant to Mr. Whitaker, apparently laboring at Henricopolis while Mr. Whitaker gave most of his time to the larger and more prominent settlement of Bermuda. John Rolfe, when in England with his wife, Pocahontas, wrote to King James concerning the Virginia colony. He speaks of "Mr. William Wickham" as the "minister" at Henrico, and as one "who, in his life and doctrine, gave good examples and godly instructions to the people." Some authorities describe him as "a pious man without Episcopal ordination." Certainly he could only have been in deacon's orders, for Governor Argall, successor to Dale, begs that a minister be sent to Henrico, as Mr. Whitaker was drowned, and Mr. Wickham was unable to administer the sacraments. A Rev. Mr. Stockham is by some spoken of as a successor to Messrs. Whitaker and Wickham. The Rev. Jonah Stockton did come to the colony in January, 1621. The clergyman whom these historians have in mind must have been he. If so, he must have followed Mr. Bargrave. By 1619 a successor to Mr. Whitaker had been found in the person of Rev. Thomas Bargrave. If any modern missionary finds it hard to make ends meet with a small salary poorly paid, he may find some cool philosophizing on the subject in the legislation of this early day. "It was enacted that each clergyman should receive from his parishioners 1,500 pounds of tobacco and 16 barrels of corn." But if the "levy should prove unequal in value to 200 pounds, the law proceeded to declare that `the minister was to be content with less.' " It was under Mr. Bargrave's administration that the parish of Henrico was chosen to be the site of a great university. It was founded to supply both the English and the natives with that education which is the handmaid of religion. Fifteen thousand acres on the side of the settlement towards the falls were set apart as college lands by the Virginia Company. Large subscriptions had been secured in England in response to an appeal of King James, through the Archbishop of Canterbury. Laborers were sent over to till the lands appropriated to the college. Young women of good character were persuaded to cross over to be their wives. The colonists themselves were enthusiastically interested. The rector, Mr. Bargrave, donated his library. George Thorpe, a devoted philanthropist and pious scholar, was superintendent of operations. Happy progress was being made in the establishment of the institution. The Rev. Mr. Copland, who had been appointed its president, and who was still in England, was requested to deliver a thanksgiving sermon in London, for all the late mercies of God to the colony and for the bright prospects before them. Suddenly, without the slightest warning, there burst upon the fair scene a storm cloud. Its thunderbolt shattered forever this pious project. The city of Henrico never recovered from the blow. For four years a conspiracy among the thirty Indian nations had been forming. On the 22d of March, Marriage of Pocahontas. 1622, it was ripe. That day Henricopolis shared the fate of thirty other settlements. The inhabitants that escaped fled to Jamestown. There the governor concentrated the relics of his colony. The fatal day was by the next Assembly solemnized as a holy day. The result of this terrible catastrophe was a great revulsion of feeling on both sides of the water. Missionary effort with the Indians was considered a failure. Their conversion was deemed hopeless. A further severe blow was given to the cause of religion in these parts in the dissolution of the Virginia Company by the King in 1624. From this time on down to 1730 the annals of Henrico Parish are fragmentary and uncertain. The Rev. James Blair was the rector from 1685 to 1694. He was a determined and courageous Scotchman, who had been educated at Edinburg University. While still rector of this parish, in 1689, he was appointed commissary of the Bishop of London, Dr. Compton, who ex-officio had ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the colonies. Mr. Blair efficiently occupied this position of great responsibility and trust till his death, fifty-four years afterward. He resigned the parish to become founder and first president of William and Mary College. He was also a member of the Colonial Council. He resided first at Jamestown, preaching there and at a church eight miles off in an adjacent parish. In 1710 he removed to Williamsburg and took charge of Bruton parish. After filling with honorable and distinguished success a most prominent and trying part in the ecclesiastical history of the colony, he was laid to rest in the old graveyard at Jamestown August 3, 1743, at the ripe age of 88. The Rev. George Robinson is understood to have been in charge of Henrico parish in 1695. Nothing seems to be known of him besides that fact. In 1724 the clergy of the colony were called upon for a report by the Bishop of London. The name of the incumbent of Henrico Parish has been torn from the manuscript of his report.* * This was undoubtedly Rev. Jacob Ware.—J. S. M. He mentions that he had been in the parish fourteen years. Its bounds were 18 by 25 miles. It contained two churches and one chapel. There were 400 families and 1,100 tithable persons resident. The attendance at church sometimes numbered from one to two hundred. The number accustomed to commune at any one time was about twenty. To the parents and teachers was left the catechizing of the children. The families were so distant that it was difficult to gather the children together, and, like those of our day, when they grew to any bigness, they did not like to be publicly catechized. As for the servants, the masters did nothing for them except to let some of them, now and then, go to church. There was no public school for the youth. In 1730 we come to terra firma in our history. With October 28th of that year begins the record book of the Vestry of Henrico Parish. It is a folio 7½ by 12½ inches, bound in vellum. It contains 191 manuscript pages, and covers the period extending to September 24, 1774. It was accidentally discovered by Mr. Peyton R. Carrington in August, 1867, among the old records of Henrico County Court. With the permission of the Presiding Justice, he delivered it to the then rector, Rev. Dr. Wm. Norwood. He placed it in the possession of the Vestry of St. John's Church. It was printed in 1874, with an interesting introduction and valuable notes by Mr. R. A. Brock, Secretary of the Virginia Historical Society. The minutes of ten meetings of the Vestry, from April 8, 1807, to December 16, 1817, both inclusive, were written on sixteen pages of foolscap paper. The manuscript was found in the third story of the house of Mrs. George M. Carrington, at the corner of Twenty-eighth and Franklin streets, in 1867, by Mr. Peyton R. Carrington. Virginia vestries a century and a half ago were elected by the freeholders and housekeepers. Among the earliest members of the vestry in Henrico Parish were men whose names are intertwined with the whole of the social and political history of our Commonwealth. The income of the Parish was derived from tithes. For example, by the earliest resolution of our Vestry which has been preserved to us, it was "Ordered That Capte Joseph Royal do receive according to Law of Every Tithable "P'son within this Parish thirty pounds of tobacco, being the parish Levy for this year, "and that he pay the Several Allowances before mentioned to the respective persons to whom "the Same are due." At that date tobacco was the medium of exchange. Its value may be estimated from the fact, that in 1739 the wardens were forbidden to sell at private sale the levied tobacco for less than 12s. 6d. per hundred. At that rate the rector's salary was 100 pounds sterling, or about 500 dollars. In this connection it is interesting to recall the fact that Patrick Henry's genius as an orator first shone publicly in what was known as the "Parson's Cause," a case in which a minister of the Church of England brought suit for arrearages in salary: The Virginia Burgesses having decreed that, because of a failure of the crop, all debts payable in that commodity might be met in money at the rate of two pence per pound; the King having decided against this act, because tobacco was rated at six pence a pound when the salary of 16,000 pounds of tobacco was made the legal compensation of the clergy. This first Vestry book is principally filled with the transactions belonging to that body, as a factor in the civil government, under the establishment of the Church of England. These were chiefly what was known as processioning the land—that is, going around the bounds of each person's land and renewing the landmarks by chopping the trees. There was also committed to the vestries of that day, and especially to the church wardens, the care of the poor. We have among the accounts entered in this vestry book such as these:— "To John Jones for keeping his Daughter, being a Fool— 300 (lbs. of tobacco). "To Doctor Hopper for Cuting off Cowsells arm—500 (lbs. of tobacco). "Ordd that the Chwdns do agree with any person for the Cure of Pridgeon Waddles nose not exceedg* * Where a letter is italicised it is written above the line in the original. ten Pounds." When this vestry book was begun the principal church of the parish was situated on a plantation known as Curle's, lying on the north side of the James, some miles below the present city of Richmond. The church itself was called by the name of the plantation on which it stood. It is said to have been demolished within the past forty years. But the writer in a visit to the locality could get no certain information as to where its exact position was. The bowl of the baptismal font now in St. John's is the sole relic of the Curle's Church. It was discovered by Mrs. Margaret Pickett some miles away from Curle's Church, in the cellar of a house into which her family had just moved. It had been used as a mortar for beating hominy. Dr. John Adams, her father, brought it to Richmond and placed it in the hands of a stonecutter. Being very much mutilated, it was reduced to a diameter of 11, 9-16 inches. The original shape, however, was preserved. Dr. Adams then presented it as a "precious and sacred" relic to the Vestry of St. John's Church, May 13, 1826; and it was directed by them that it should be placed in the chancel. It is hardly to be wondered at that, when, in 1850, a member of St. John's presented to it a new marble font, the congregation was dissatisfied at the removal of the one piece of furniture that bound their present edifice to its predecessors in the parish, and after only a few years insisted upon its return. Mr. P. R. Carrington thinks that the new font and two oaken chairs given by the same gentlemen are now in the church in Ashland. To revert to our history, there was at this time also a "chapple," probably the one called in 1735 "the falls Chappel." Indeed, there had been a feeble attempt at a settlement at the Falls of James river before that at Henricopolis. In all probability this was the "one chapel" reported to the Bishop of London in 1724. Probably Curle's Church also was one of the "two churches" reported at the same time. Perhaps the other one of the two was the old church at Henricopolis. It is more likely to have been that one for which Mr. Thomas Jefferson, an ancestor of the President, had contracted in 1723, to be erected near Rock Hall. William Randolph had bought the whole of the 5,000 acres embraced in Dale's settlement, and had added as much more to his estate, so that it extended down to Four Mile Creek, on James river. Beside the Curle's plantation in this property, there was also in it one, nearer the falls, called Varina from the fact that its tobacco was supposed to have the same flavor as that of Varina in Spain. Next to the Varina plantation was the glebe of the parish, consisting of between 195 and 200 acres, which at an early date had taken the place of the one at Rock Hall, on the southern side of the James. The Henrico court-house, prison, etc., were near by. The situation was about where Rolfe had located his residence. It appears from the first entry in this earliest vestry book that the minister then in charge of the parish was, as he is styled, The Reverend Mr. James Keith. On his ministerial staff he had three lay readers. The salary of each was 2,000 pounds of tobacco, or about twelve and a half pounds sterling, equivalent to some $60.50 in our money. Sometimes, however, they were more "a thorn in the flesh" than a help. For in the minutes of the second meeting we read that the vestry "Ordered "That Sackfield Brewer be appointed Reader in the Chapple, Richard Williams being absconded from his Duty therein." October 12, 1733, Mr. Keith ceased to be minister of the parish. About this time the Assembly considerably lessened the size of Henrico county and parish. Goochland was cut off in 1727. Powhatan was taken along with it as a part of the original Goochland. Dale parish, in Chesterfield, was set up by itself in 1735. At a meeting held on June 17, 1735, a temporary supply of the pulpit was arranged. The Rev. Zach Brook was to preach a day in every fifth week at the Falls Chapel, and the Rev. David Mossom every fifth Sunday at the Church. For this service they were to be allowed 400 pounds of tobacco, or about two and one-half pounds English money, per sermon. This Mr. Brook had been the first minister of St. Paul's, Hanover, and had labored in that charge as early as 1724 at least. Mr. Mossom was at this time rector of St. Peter's, New Kent, a position which he occupied from 1727 to his death, in 1767. In that capacity he married General Washington at the "White House," in St. Peter's Parish. He came from Newburyport, Mass., and had the honor of being the first native American admitted to the presbyterate in the Church of England. This arrangement was continued until the following September, when "The Revd mr. Anthony Gavin" appeared on the scene. He produced "a letter from the Honble William Gooch, "Esqr, his Maj's Lieut. Governor of this Colony, and another from the Rev'd James Blair, Commissary, directed to the Church Wardens and Gent of the vestry, recommending the said Mr. Gavin to the Cure of this parish." These letters were read; "and the Vestry being desirious of first hearing him performe the office of his Ministereal function," resolved to "Suspend their opinion as to his reception till after Sermon, when they" agreed "to meet again." The trial sermon of this reverend candidate proved a success. For it is immediately afterward entered that— "Whereas the Revd Anthony Gavin hath performed his office both in reading and preaching to the General Satisfaction and approbation of the Vestry, it is thereupon unanimously agreed that he be received and entertained as minister of this parish." There is no note of Mr. Gavin's resignation in the vestry book. Bishop Meade says he served in Henrico only nine months. The Bishop pronounces him a zealous and laborious man, but very plain of speech. That latter trait of character, combined with the fact that he was opposed to slavery as "unlawful for any Christian, and particularly for Clergymen," may account for his short incumbency. But we find him Rector of St. James', Goochland, August 5, 1738, and he continued in that position until his death, in 1749. On Sunday, the 18th of July, 1736, the Reverend William Stith, after having gone through the same process as his predecessor, was received as Minister of the Parish. This Mr. Stith was the only son of Capt. John Stith, of Charles City, and the grandson, on his mother Mary's side, of William Randolph, of Turkey Island, Henrico. He was born in 1689. He received his academical education at the grammar school attached to William and Mary College. He pursued his theological studies in England, and was ordained there. On his return to Virginia, in 1731, he had been elected Master of the Grammar School at Williamsburg, and Chaplain to the House of Burgesses. He married his cousin, Judith, daughter of Thomas Randolph, of Tuckahoe. His salary as Minister of Henrico Parish was 16,000 pounds of tobacco, equivalent to 100 pounds sterling, or, in present money, $484. It was during the ministry of Mr. Stith that the project of building a new church began to be agitated. It was a comparatively easy thing in those days to build a church. The vestry had only to order a levy to secure the building fund. If any tithable person failed or delayed to make payment, the collector was empowered to distrain for the tax. A new church somewhere in this locality was beginning to be a necessity, because of the increase of population hereabouts. Already Richmond was looming up on the horizon of the future as the town of the parish. The first action is recorded as follows: "At a Vestry held at Curls* * Elsewhere Curle. Church for Henrico parish ye 8th day of October Anno Dom. 1737 for laying ye parish Levey— "The Vestry do agree to build a Church on the most Convenient place at or near "Thomas Williamsons in this parish to be Sixty feet in Length and Twenty-five in "Breadth and fourteen foot pitch to be finished in a plain Manner After the Moddle of "Curls Church. And it is ordered that the Clerk do Set up Advertisements of the particular parts of the Said Building and of the time and place of undertaking the Same. * * * * * * * * "It is ordered that the Collector do receive of every Tithable person in this parish five "pounds of Tobacco after the Usual deduction to be apply'd towards building the New Church at Williamsons." Had the resolution been literally carried out, the new church would have been located on the Brook Road. Through some unaccountable reason the matter was dropped for nearly two years. Then we find the following entry upon the vestry book: "At a vestry held at Curls Church for Henrico parish July ye 21st Ano Dom 1739 * * * * * * * * "It is Ordered that the Church Wardens do give Notice and Set up Advertisements at all publick "places in this parish, that on the Second thursday in October next, at Curls Church, will be "held a vestry in order to let out the Building of the New Church, at which Time the parish Levy will be Laid." Next appears the following record: "At a Vestry held for Henrico parish on the Twentieth day of Decr Anno 1739 "It is agreed that a Church be Built on the most Convenient Spot of Ground near ye "Spring on Richardsons Road, on the South Side of Bacons Branch, on the Land of `The Honourable William Byrd Esq. to be Sixty feet Long and Twenty-five broad And fourteen feet pitch'd, to be finished in a plain manner after the `Moddle of Curls-Church. Richard Randolph Gent undertakes the Said Building and engages to finish the Same by the Tenth day of June, which Shall be in the year of our Lord "Seventeen hundred and forty-one; for which the Vestry agrees to pay him the "Sum of three hundred and Seventeen pounds Ten Shillings Current Money to be "paid by the Ammount of the Sales of Twenty thousand pounds of Tob'o annually "to be Levyd on the parish and Sold here for Money till the whole payment be compleat." The contract price in United States figures was $1,536.70. An appropriation of 5,250 pounds gross tobacco had been made for this new enterprise out of the levy laid October 8, 1737. A levy of 20,000 pounds net tobacco had been laid October 11, 1739, for the new church. May 5, 1740, the vestry sold this last mentioned tobacco to Col. Richard Randolph 2 at the rate of 10s. per hundred, current money. The only additional appropriation toward this object found on record was a levy of 20,000 pounds net tobacco, laid October 13, 1740. But still another change in situation was necessitated. "At a Vestry held for Henrico parish the 13 Day of October Anno Dom 1740. "Richard Randolph Gentleman, produses a Letter Directed to him from the Honbl'e "William Byrd, Esquie, which is read as followeth—viz: `Sir—October 12th, 1740. " `I should with great pleasure, oblige the Vestry, and particularly your Self, in granting "them an Acre, to build their Church upon; but there are so many roads already thro that "Land, that the Damage to me would be too great to have another of a mile long cut "thro it. I should be very glad if you wou'd please to think Richmond a proper place, "and considering the great number of people that live below it, and would pay their "Devotions there, that wou'd not care to go so much higher I can't but think it wou'd be "Agreeable to most of the people, and if they will agree to have it there, I will give them "two of the best Lots, that are not taken up, and besides give them any pine Timber they "can find on that side Shockhoe Creek, and Wood for burning of Bricks into the Bargain. "I hope the Gen't of the Vestrey will believe me a Friend to the Church, when I make "them this offer, and that I am both theirs—. Sir— and your most Hum'l ser': W. Byrd.' "Whereupon the Questian is put whither the said Church should be Built on the Hill caled Indian Town at Richmond, or at Thomas Williamsons plantation on the Brook Road, and is caryed by a Majority of Voices for the former. "It is thereupon Ordered that the Church formerly Agreed on to be Built by "Richard Randolph Gen: on the South side of Bacons Branch, be Built on Indian Town at Richmond, after the Same Manner as in the said Former Agreement was mentioned." The allotment had been made in April, 1737. The two lots which Mr. Byrd gave for the church constitute the Grace street half of the present church yard. The Record Book was destroyed by the British under Tarleton. The record of the deed to these two lots is said to have been of the date of March 5, 1743. There is no record of the completion, or first use of this church. But by December 7, 1741, the Falls Chapel seems to have been abandoned; John Eals, its reader, and Eleanor Williams, its sexton, had been transferred to this church; and everything here was in full blast. The only thing left for us to suppose is that this church was completed at the date called for by the contract, June 10, 1741. Probably the erection of this church had rendered the Falls Chapel unnecessary. The lines of the church then erected are easily distinguishable. The present transepts lie exactly with the points of the compass. They formed the eastern and western ends, respectively, of the original church. Imagine the northern sides of the two transepts connected. The old church would thus be enclosed. All the portion of the present church lying north of that imagined line, or, in other words, the present nave of the church, was a later addition. The ceiling in the old church was a foot and two-thirds below the present cornice. The chancel, according to the then prevailing ecclesiastical custom, was in the eastern end. The present pulpit, with its sounding board and the latter's panel, stood there. The pews, of course, all faced in that direction. In the western end was a gallery. It projected as far as the present angle of the transept and the nave. Beneath it, on the south side, was the robing room. On the opposite side of the aisle were the stairs to the gallery and a lumber closet. The gallery was lighted by two small windows. The present are the original pews, but they have been lowered. Formerly their backs reached to the windows. The hinges are handwrought, and fastened on by nails made in the same way. The wainscoting and the window sash are those first put in. Any one examining the exterior will easily recognize the original weather-boarding. It is thicker and wider than on the newer part of the church, and fastened by nails wrought on the anvil with heads half an inch broad. The officers of the church at this time were as follows: The Rev. William Stith, Minister. James Powell Cocke, Church Warden. James Cocke, Church Warden. Richard Randolph, Vestryman. John Redford, Vestryman. Bowler Cocke, Vestryman. John Bolling, Vestryman. Edward Curd, Vestryman. John Williamson, Vestryman. John Povall, Vestryman. Robert Mosby, Vestryman. William Fuller, Parish Collector and Vestryman. Peter Randolph, Vestryman. Sackville Brewer, Reader at Curles Church and Clerk of the Vestry.* * Richard Rockett was clerk of the Vestry from Nov. 13, 1749, to Dec. 8, 1752. "Rocketts" is said to have been so known from Sept. 27, 1731. John Eales, Reader at Richmond Church. John Hobson, Sexton at Curles Church. Eleanor Williams, Sexton at Richmond Church. While in charge of Henrico Parish and living in its glebe house Mr. Stith wrote his History of Virginia. He published it in 1747. It went through the printing and bookbinding establishment at Williamsburg, then the only one in the colony. Its exceptional exactness gave its author the reputation of being "the accurate Stith." In his introduction he suggests a picture, which is a restful contrast to the busy life of the present clergy of this parish. He says that he wrote his history as "a noble and elegant entertainment for my vacant hours." December 3, 1751, the Rev. Mr. Stith resigned the parish to take effect the first day of the following October. The reason given is that he had been "Chosen Minister of S. Ann's." But in August of 1752 he was elected President of William and Mary College. He accepted that position, and died in it, three years later. The Rev. Rascow Cole declined the offer of the Parish. The Rev. Joseph Bewsher at first accepted the Vestry's unanimous election, but resigned before the date set for his taking charge. This could not have been the well-known Jonathan Boucher, who was tutor to Washington's stepson (young Custis); for Jonathan Boucher was only born in 1738, and ordained in 1762. Finally, August 25, 1752, the Rev. Miles Selden was unanimously elected minister. He accepted, to enter on his office the first day of the next October. He was the grandson of John Selden, the first settler of the name, who came to the Northern Neck of Virginia about 1690.* * His grandmother was Rebecca, daughter of Sir Jas. Roe. His father was Jos. Selden, proprietor of the estate of Buck Roe. His mother was of the family of Wilson Cary, of Elizabeth City County, Va. He was ordained in London. He was the first cousin of the Rev. Wm. Selden, Rector of Elizabeth City Parish, in 1771. The arrangement with him was that he should perform divine service at the Richmond Church once every five weeks. This Church had been called the "New Church," the "Upper Church," the "Richmond Church." Within a few years after its erection it was also spoken of as the "Town Church." How completely the tide had begun to ebb from the neighborhood of Curles is shown by the fact that in 1768 the Vestry recorded the opinion that Curles Church should be removed; and that a committee was appointed to choose a new location. But by 1770 it had been determined simply to repair the old building. The "Worshipful Gentlemen of the Vestry" began to hold their sessions at "Richmond Town." The first meeting of the Vestry in Richmond of which we know occurred November 13, 1749, when the Rev. Wm. Stith was present. That care for appearances had been attended to which such a situation demands. Eleanor Williams, the sexton, was put to work making curtains. There must needs be imported from England as quickly as possible— "One Parsons "Surples, a Pulpit Cushen and Cloth, two Cloths for Reading "Desks, a Communion Table Cloth and a Dozen of Cushens— "to be of good Purple Cloth, and the Surples good Hollond, also a "large Bible and four large Prayer Books." The Church lot in 1746 had been fenced in with wood. In 1770 it was walled in with bricks four and one-half feet high above ground. The remains of this improvement may undoubtedly be seen in the present Grace street wall and in the lower portion of the Twenty-fifth street wall of the church yard. By December 8, 1772, it had become necessary to enlarge the church. It is of record under that date that, "It is the Opinion of the Vestry that "An Addition of Forty feet in "Length and of the same wedth as the "pres't Church at Richmond is be "Built to it, at the North Side with "a Gallery on both Sides &amp; one End "with proper windows above and below, "&amp; Order'd that the Chwdns Lett to the "Lowest Bidder the Building the said "Addition." That improvement was the beginning of what constitutes the present nave. Probably the most valuable testimony as to what constituted the changes now made is that given by the Rev. Prof. Cornelius Walker, D. D., of the Virginia Theological Seminary. He became a Sunday school scholar and an attendant upon the services of St. John's in 1826, and continued so until the time of the changes, in 1830. He describes the building consistently with the action of the Vestry just quoted. The galleries were supported by light columns. He thinks there were two narrow aisles in this new nave, along the outer side of each of which ran the line of gallery columns. But I think the two aisles were introduced in 1830. The original gallery at the west end of the old church remained. Over it also continued the belfry, sustaining a bell. The chancel and pulpit were, of course, removed to the centre of the south side of the old church, so as to face the new nave. The panel of the sounding board stood up against the wall between two windows. There was as yet no door at the east end of the old church. But on its south side and east of the new position of the chancel was a door with an aisle running across the old church from south to north, where naturally there would have been a space before the original chancel. There was, I understand from another source, one pew between this aisle and the eastern wall of the transept. This south door opened upon the walk leading up from near the corner of Grace and Twenty-fifth streets. According to Mr. P. R. Carrington, this door was not closed until 1857 or 1859. All the interior woodwork was unpainted, but so smoothly finished as to have the appearance of having been varnished. Mr. P. R. Carrington is of the opinion that the original communion rail, which extended across the whole eastern end of the old church, remained even after the pulpit had been removed, and that behind this rail the President of the Virginia Convention of 1775 sat, when that body was in session within the building. Meanwhile the Vestry-book is witness to the fact that the glebe was also kept in good repair and enjoyed improvements from time to time. Nor by any means was the whole of the spiritual energies of the parish concentrated in the Richmond Church. Two other chapels had been erected, one at Deep Run, between 1742 and 1745,* * By deed dated October 1, 1753, and recorded in Henrico County Deed Book 1750-1767, Bowler Cocke, Jr., and Samuel Duval, Church wardens, bought the acre of land on which this chapel was standing from John Shoemaker. and the other, somewhere before 1773, near Boar Swamp, on what is now the site of Antioch Baptist Church, about twelve miles from Richmond, in the direction of the Nine Mile Road. Among the last entries in the oldest Vestry book is the following account of the obligations of the Parish: "At a vestry held at Richmond on Friday the 17th. Day of December 1773 for laying the Parish Levy. "Henrico Parish. Dr. Lbs. Tob'o "To the Revd Mr. Selden his annual Salary 17,150 £125. 1. "To Wm Street Clk.

Thence forward it is lost to view, except for infrequent momentary glimpses, till 1785. All that we know of it are the following facts: Its rector, Mr. Selden, was the chaplain of the Virginia Convention of 1775. That Convention met in this church March 20th of that year, under the presidency of Edmund Pendleton. This meeting of a political convention in a church was no unusual thing in those days. The first General Assembly, the earliest legislative body in America, had sat with their hats on, after the manner of the English Commons, in the church at Jamestown, July 30, 1619. A member left on record the reason. "The most convenient place we could find to sit in was the quire (sic) of the Church." At the session of the Virginia Convention referred to as having been held in St. John's Church, Patrick Henry flashed the electric spark, which exploded the colony in revolution. He stood, according to tradition, near the present corner of the east transept and the nave, or more exactly, as it is commonly stated, in pew 47, in the east aisle of the nave, the third one from the transept aisle. He, as we have already seen, faced the eastern wall of the transept, where were then two windows. In the more northern of these stood Col. Edward Carrington. He broke the silence that followed the orator's burning words with the exclamation: "Right here I wish to be buried." The situation of his tomb bears witness to the fulfillment, by his wife, of his request at his death, in 1810. At last, in 1781, when Richmond had fallen into the hands of Arnold, this sacred edifice was made a barracks for his British soldiery. It must have seemed then to pastor and people that the final word in their parochial history had been written. But Easter Monday, March 28, 1785, brings us to the beginning of a second Vestry book. It is a volume 6½ x 8 inches, bound in leather. It contains on 696 pages the minutes to April 5, 1887. From 1785 the history of Henrico Parish will be almost entirely localized in Richmond. We must, therefore, take a brief glance at the situation. The town when captured by Arnold is said to have had some three hundred houses. At about this time, when the seat of government was removed hither, the inhabitants, with the exception of two or three families, were Scotch. Their small tenements were scattered here and there between the river and the Hill. Colonel, afterward Judge Marshall, observed that the little cottages looked "as if the poor Caledonians had brought them over on their backs, the weaker of whom were glad to stop at the bottom of the hill; others a little stronger proceeded higher; while a few of the stoutest and boldest reached the summit, which, once accomplished, affords a situation beautiful and picturesque." The first record in the second Vestry-book is of an election of twelve Vestrymen, holden on March 28, 1785, at the courthouse, in the city of Richmond. Their names were: Edmund Randolph, Jaquelin Ambler, Bowler Cocke, Miles Selden, Jr., William Foushee, Hobson Owen, John Ellis, Turner Southall, Nathaniel Wilkinson, Daniel L. Hylton, Thos. Prosser, Wm. Burton. On the following Thursday, in is church, the majority subscribed the required promise of conformity and organized for duty. Edmund Randolph and Bowler Cocke were appointed church wardens. They were instructed to recover the church plate and other property, and to open subscriptions for the repairs of the churches and the salaries of sextons. One of these, appointed at this meeting for Richmond, was a woman. It is evident that, besides the Richmond church, those at Curles and at Deep Run were still in existence. But there was no minister. On the 10th of the following May the Rev. John Buchanan was unanimously chosen by ballot incumbent for the Parish. I am unable to reconcile with this action the statement which is said to have been copied from the Virginia Gazette of 1785, that the Rev. Miles Selden died May 23, 1785, being minister of St. John's at the time of his death.* * The Rev. John Buchanan may have been made Assistant Minister. Some question afterward arose whether the election of a minister was warranted by the powers then vested in the vestry. So the vestry, on June 7th, repeated the formality. His duties, with reference to services, were defined to be that he should preach every other Sunday in "Richmond Church," and on the intervening Sunday at Curles and Deep Run alternately. Discretion was given him as to the place for celebrating the festival days. On the 15th of June, 1785, the first convention of the reorganized Diocese of Virginia was held in Richmond. Probably the sessions for business were held in the capitol; but by resolution the Convention attended divine service on Thursday, at 9 A. M., in this, at that time, "the Church in this city," and listened to an "excellent sermon" preached in this pulpit by the Rev. John Bracken. It was a correspondence between the Rev. David Griffith and the rector of Henrico parish that led to the resuscitation of the Church in Virginia. Both Mr. Buchanan and the lay delegate of this parish, Edmund Randolph, took prominent parts in this Convention. Mr. Randolph was afterward Governor of Virginia and Attorney-General and Secretary of State in Washington's Cabinet. Mr. Buchanan was elected treasurer of the Diocese. He faithfully and efficiently occupied that position for nearly thirty years, until increased age and consequent infirmities compelled him to decline reappointment. Mr. Randolph was on a committee to prepare an address "to the members of the Protestant Episcopal Church of Virginia, representing the condition of that Church, and exhorting them to unite in its support." Its words have become famous in American Church history: "Of what is the Church now possessed? Nothing but the glebes and your affections." Mr. Randolph also reported, in behalf of a committee, the resolution that declared the willingness of the Virginia Convention "to unite in a general ecclesiastical convention with the members of the Protestant Episcopal Church." June 28, 1785, the Vestry acted on the recommendation of the late Convention and appointed a committee to prepare subscription papers for the expenses of consecrating and maintaining a Bishop, one subscription paper to be circulated by each member of the Vestry. A sad picture is drawn for us in a statement prefixed, April 2, 1789, by the Vestry, to other subscription papers, which they subsequently circulated. The minister and other officers had been serving for several years with little or no compensation; also they deeply deplore "the almost total decline of divine worship for some years past, and the consequent depravation of the morals of every denomination amongst us." A letter of Mrs. Edward Carrington, to an English friend, dated 1792, and quoted by Bishop Meade, reveals still more of the spiritual darkness then prevailing: "This evil (the want of public worship) increases daily; nor have we left in our extensive State three churches that are decently supported. Our metropolis even would be left destitute of this blessing but for the kind offices of our friend, Buchanan, whom you remember well, an inmate of our family. He, from sheer benevolence, continues to preach in our capitol to what we now call the New School—that is to say, to a set of modern philosophers who merely attend because they know not what else to do with themselves. But, blessed be God, in spite of the enlightened, as they call themselves, and in spite of Godwin, Paine, etc., we still, at times, particularly on our great Church days, repair with a choice few to our old church on the hill (St. John's) and by contributing our mite endeavor to preserve the religion of our fathers. Delightful hours we sometimes pass there," etc. Mr. Buchanan had come to Richmond from Lexington Parish, Amherst county, Va. He left there a salary of 10,000 pounds of tobacco. In all his ministry in this parish he received little beside the rent of the glebe and the perquisites of the office. That little was mostly bestowed in charity upon others. He was a frugal bachelor, and for ten years eked out his scanty pittance here by tutoring in the family of one of his kindest vestrymen, Mr. Jaquelin Ambler, for many years Treasurer of the Commonwealth. Afterward he was made comfortable by the inheritance of the property of his brother James, who had been a well-to-do merchant in this city. The Vestry, however, tried to fulfill its obligations to the rector. At its April meeting in 1789, it adopted a plan for securing a revenue, which it continued to follow for years. The city was divided into four wardships. Canvassers were appointed for each. As a result, on the 23d of May following they were able to pay Mr. Buchanan 20 pounds, the clerk and the sexton each two pounds eight shillings, and to appropriate a surplus of 3 pounds 14 shillings to repairs and other contingencies. The following December Mr. Buchanan was paid sixty pounds for the preceding half year's services. But the other evil mentioned by the Vestry—viz: the decline in church attendance—was not so easily overcome. In 1790 this church had been practically abandoned. Even the triennial elections of the Vestry were appointed to be held at the Capitol, the day to be subject to the weather. It was opened for service only at the great festivals, Christmas, Easter and Whit Sunday, when the Lord's Supper was administered. Thenceforth for years the services of our Church were held in the Capitol on alternate Sundays with the Presbyterians. Mr. P. R. Carrington says that Mr. Thos. H. Drew, who removed to Richmond in 1800, told him that, from that date until about 1815, Dr. Buchanan held service at St. John's only three times each year, Easter, Whit Sunday and Christmas, when the Holy Communion was administered and confirmations were held. The congregation in its personnel was much the same every Sunday. Between the pastor of the Presbyterians, Rev. John D. Blair, and Mr. Buchanan, the most delightful fraternity existed. The spirit of Church unity engendered by this joint worship prompted the Vestry, in this same year, 1790, to extend permission to any regular minister of any denomination whatever, professing Christianity, to use the country churches of the parish, when not used by the Rev. Mr. Buchanan or any other minister of the Protestant Episcopal Church. And in 1812 the custom of alternating services with the Presbyterians was transferred to this, the parish Church. A little glimpse into the musical features of the parochial history is now afforded us. July 24, 1790, the rector was requested "to contract with Mr. Purrington to conduct Psalmody every Sunday for three months in the time of divine service, for which he was authorized to promise Mr. Purrington six shillings for each day's attendance, or being ready to attend." It appears that the rector had to advance and wait some time for a repayment of the chorister's salary. Already the question of a new organ had been prominent. February 15, 1791, the Vestry had in hand £34, the proceeds of a concert and the sale of an old organ. This amount they determined to appropriate for a new instrument. But probably because the fund did not increase sufficiently for this purpose, the money was in 1794 loaned out to the minister. April 25, 1791, an inventory of property was taken. The glebe was reported to be worth about £1,000, and at the time was renting for £40 per annum. Its houses were out of repair. The personal property consisted of "one silver cup and salver." The older of the present patens and chalices bear the London Goldsmiths Co.'s mark of 1718. They are quite likely the communion vessels referred to in this inventory. In 1792 begins the lamentation which wails forth from many a modern Vestry book. Great difficulty was experienced in collecting money which had been subscribed or pledged for the support of the parish. But the Vestry of that day applied heroic measures. The balances due on subscriptions for 1791 were delivered to the town sergeant for collection. Where immediate payment could not be obtained, notes payable in three months were requested. In 1793 it was declared that promissory notes were preferable to subscriptions. And in 1794 it was determined that all arrearages up to the end of 1793 should be put into the hands of a collector, with instructions to commence suit on every delinquent that would not make immediate payment. All previous troubles and perplexities, however, were only as the penumbra of the eclipse now at hand. There is no record of a Vestry meeting between April 29, 1794, and May 12, 1812, except one held April 8, 1807. Indeed, the depressed condition of the whole Church in Virginia was so great between 1799 and 1812 that even the annual conventions were discontinued for several years. When the Vestry did meet in 1807 it was only to confess failure. For then was begun a movement looking to the purchase of ground and the erection of a church to accommodate the many members of the Protestant Episcopal Church who felt that it was no longer convenient to attend the services on Church Hill. Bishop Meade paints a distressing picture of the condition of the parish at this time. "My next Sabbath (that is, after his ordination at Williamsburg, February 24, 1811,) was spent in Richmond, where the condition of things was little better. Although there was a church in the older part of the town, it was never used but on Communion days. The place of worship was an apartment in the Capitol, which held a few hundred persons at most; and as the Presbyterians had no church at all in Richmond at that time, the use of the room was divided between them and the Episcopalians, each having service every other Sabbath morning, and no oftener. Even two years after this, being in Richmond, on a Communion Sunday, I assisted the rector, Dr. Buchanan, in the old church, when only two gentlemen and a few ladies communed. One of these gentlemen, the elder son of Judge Marshall, was a resident in the upper county." In the fall of 1812 correspondence began with a view to securing an assistant minister for the parish. Meanwhile the rector was requested to obtain help when necessary for any of the churches in the parish. But in the providence of God an event occurred which solved many perplexing problems, though apparently not at all for the advantage of this particular church. The terrible calamity of the destruction of the Richmond Theatre by fire, and the consequent holocaust of prominent citizens and precious lives had led to the erection on the fatal spot of a memorial church. This, in 1814, was opened for worship under the name of the Monumental Church. The Vestry of Henrico Parish welcomed the new addition so soon as they learned it was to be Protestant Episcopal in character. Thus at once was met the desire for a new and more convenient church on the part of those who had located around the Capitol on Shockoe Hill. And shortly an assistant, whose need had been felt as early as 1812, was also thus secured. Bishop Madison had died in 1812. In 1814 Bishop Moore was elected Bishop of the Diocese. Dr. Buchanan himself received one vote for the office. Bishop Moore also accepted the rectorship of Monumental Church. Thereupon Monumental Vestry proposed to pay $200 per annum to the Vestry of Henrico Parish towards an assistant minister for "the Richmond Hill Church," provided that, in the absence of the Bishop on Diocesan duties, that assistant should officiate once every Sabbath, alternately morning and evening, in the Monumental Church. The Vestry of Henrico Parish readily acquiesced and appropriated one thousand dollars per annum for three years as its share toward the assistant's salary. A unanimous ballot was cast for the Rev. David Moore, of New York, the eldest son of the Bishop by his first marriage. And in the following November the right of succession to the rectorship was given to Mr. Moore. Mr. Moore did not accept. The Rev. Wm. H. Hart, who had married a niece of Bishop Moore, laid before the Vestry testimonials as to "his good conduct for three years past," "as required by the 31st Canon of the Church of the United States." May 1, 1815, he was elected assistant minister, with the right of succession to the rectorship. He is described as stout, weighing about 170 pounds, and being 5 feet 10 or 11 inches in height. And yet the erection of Monumental sealed for many long years the fate of that congregation, whose history we are especially pursuing, to be weak and struggling. Monumental was spacious and handsome. In it was centered the melancholy and curious interest attaching to the awful calamity, from whose ashes it had sprung. It had the prestige of having for its rector the learned, godly, courtly and eloquent Bishop of the Diocese. It was situated near the brow of that hill on which the Capitol was the nucleus for the gathering of wealth and fashion. The statistics of the parochial reports in the Convention Journals tell the inevitable result. In 1816 Monumental had 120 communicants; "the Church on Richmond Hill" about 30. Before Bishop Moore arrived, Dr. Buchanan had generally preached at Monumental on Sundays. After the Bishop took charge, the Doctor frequently read the service. One of his auditors has left on record the judgment: "He was, I think, the best reader I have ever heard." And even after an assistant of Henrico Parish had been secured, according to the proposition of Monumental Vestry, it would seem that Dr. Buchanan himself assumed the duty of officiating at Monumental when the Bishop was absent. Dr. Buchanan had also been appointed, according to a plan then followed in the Diocese of Virginia, a sort of rural dean or presiding elder over the neighboring counties of Goochland and Louisa, as well as over Henrico itself. Even after the burden of years had weighed down Dr. Buchanan, Bishop Moore reports him as engaging every Sunday in ministerial duties without pay. The Bishop gratefully acknowledged his assistance at Monumental. While Dr. Buchanan thus devoted himself to Monumental and general church duties, his assistant, the Rev. Mr. Hart, was producing a revival of material prosperity in the congregation worshipping on the other hill. In 1815 and 1816 $988.32 had been spent on repairs to the church, which even then was beginning to be called "old." In 1816 Mr. Hart had been authorized to treat for and purchase an organ from a New York builder at a cost of $1,100. In 1818 the size of the church was deemed inadequate to the accommodation of all its members. It was determined to build a new, spacious and handsome brick edifice. The site chosen, according to the testimony of living citizens, was the northeast corner of Broad and Twenty-third streets. It is a matter of record, according to Mr. Chas. P. Rady, historian of "Richmond Randolph" Lodge of the Masonic Fraternity, that on June 24, 1818, a procession marched from its hall to "the old church on Richmond Hill"; that there an appropriate address was delivered by the Rev. Wm. Henry Hart; and that after the discourse the lodges present proceeded to the site chosen and laid the corner-stone of the new church amidst a large concourse of citizens. In 1819 the annual parochial report to the Bishop at the Convention noted that the new church had been begun, and was nearing completion. The Sunday school was reported to be flourishing. And the number of communicants had attained what proved to be high-water mark for years. The truth of the matter is the times were inflated; there was a "boom." Dr. Walker says that speculators insisted that Richmond would rival New York. Various additions to the manufacturing establishments of the city were located on and near Church Hill. And according to Dr. Walker, the bald scars on its sides tell the tale of uncompleted improvements. But before the year 1820 had reached its noon a terrible financial reaction had thrown the congregation back into weakness and despair. Already in 1817 there was evidence that the organ and other purchases had overstrained the congregation. The organ had cost $1,420.86. Only $978 had been paid. The balance was still due, even in June, 1825. Special means were taken to raise money. In 1819 there was in financial circles what we call to-day a "panic." So that to the Convention of 1820 the minister in charge reported that the congregation had almost been crushed by the pressure of the times. We hear no more of the proposed new and elegant church at the corner of Broad and Twenty-third streets. But Dr. Walker says its skeleton was not taken down until 1828 or 1829. As he remembers it, it had the appearance of a large, square building of fine red brick, with projections, making it almost hexagonal, a shape probably suggested by the Monumental Church, of which, I dare say, it was to be a rival. Its four sided roof rose to a point. There were to be three galleries. The structure was more than half finished when the work was abandoned. But the depression did not last long. The improvement that set in showed that the chastening had had its divinely 3 intended effect. Thenceforth the growth of the church was rather spiritual than material. At this period the church yard began to receive attention. In 1799 the municipal authorities had purchased from John Adams and from Richard Adams, Jr., the latter being the executor of Thos. B. Adams, the two lots lying between the church's property and Broad street, and had enclosed the whole square with a brick wall at the city's expense. At the same time the church yard was open as a burying ground for the city at large. An arrangement was subsequently entered into by the Vestry and the city fathers by which the church resigned the management of the burying ground in return for the city's bearing the expenses of the church yard. We are indebted to Mr. P. R. Carrington for a resumé of the city's action at this time with reference to the burying ground. July 18, 1814, an abortive effort was made at a meeting of the "City Hall" to provide an ordinance for "regulating the mode of interment in the burying ground belonging to the Corporation adjoining the Episcopal Church on Richmond Hill." But on the 19th of June, 1815, in "an ordinance for regulating the public burying grounds of this city," it was stated that "an arrangement had been entered into by the City Hall and the Vestry of the Parish of Henrico, by which all the grounds appropriated to the interment of the dead, which belonged to said Parish and situated on Richmond Hill, had been enclosed by one common wall with the lands which belonged to the corporation adjoining thereto, and that it was well understood that the Common Hall should at all times have power to establish such regulations as they might think most proper for the government of the same, and should moreover incur and defray all necessary expenses attending the erection of gates and steps and keeping the brick wall in good repair." It was ordained that the Church Wardens should have authority to appoint the sexton or keeper, and to remove him as well as to have authority over him during his term of office. No respect of religious denomination was to be allowed in interments; and the fee was fixed. The Wardens were to draw on the Chamberlain of the City for an amount not exceeding $50 per annum for repairing the wall, gates and steps to grounds. No subsequent changes were made for some time, save as to fees. But the whole arrangement was evidently merely a formal one for years; for in 1828 the Vestry gave the rector charge of the graveyard and authorized him to pay the sexton for care of the church out of the receipts from grave digging. And we are told by Mr. P. R. Carrington that the first "keeper" was appointed May 18, 1863, by City Council. Twenty years had now elapsed since the city's addition to the church yard in 1799. It must be remembered that this was the only public cemetery in the city until the opening of that known as Shockoe Cemetery, in 1826. The whole square had now been filled with graves. The Vestry protested against further interments therein. In November, 1820, they appointed a committee to obtain a burying ground elsewhere, and to secure subscriptions from the citizens generally to that object. The committee reported in May of the following year that it had been unable to secure a convenient site for the location of the proposed new burying ground on account of the high price charged for land. October 9, 1821, the Vestry requested the Wardens, "hereafter to prohibit the sexton from digging any graves in the old part of the burying ground without written permission from one of them." One who has carefully examined the records, reports that at this Vestry meeting, October 9, 1821, the first mention of the parsonage is made in the minutes. The plan of renting pews had been agreed upon in 1812. Only one-half of the whole number were at first offered for rent, and that only for one year. They were disposed of at public auction. Later the period was increased to three years, and the number of pews offered for rent was made two-thirds instead of one-half. The wardens reported that "the measure of renting the pews appeared very pleasing to a great portion of our parishioners." By 1816 the pew renting system had been so thoroughly engrafted on the congregation that in that year the Vestry was elected by the pew renters. In 1820, however, through the inadequacy of receipts to meet current expenses, the custom of weekly collections for voluntary contributions was added. This feature does not seem to have met with favor. For after seven months of trial the collections were confined to the first Sunday in the month. And now once more the question of a new church was agitated. A Mr. Day, of Maryland, had made certain propositions respecting the building of a new church on the site of the old one. July 1, 1822, a committee of two was appointed to act thereupon and report to the next meeting of the Vestry. But the project seems to have been "pigeon-holed" by the committee. December 19, 1822, the Parish was afflicted in the death of its rector, the Rev. John Buchanan, D. D. (William and Mary, 1794). The whole community mourned his departure. He was buried beneath the chancel, to the right of the communion table. Among the obituaries which appeared at the time in the secular press of Richmond, were such tributes as these: "He was faithful to the duties of a minister and a man." "One who left few equals and no superior; one whose loss is literally irreparable." "So good, so humane, and so benevolent a man. Always happy, always cheerful, always loving and beloved. He was the very soul of his companions." Mrs. Lydia H. Hart (wife of the Rev. Wm. H. Hart, his assistant and successor), on December 28, 1822, wrote: "Along the church-way path I saw him borne; * * * * * * * Beneath the altar had the grave been made; And there with solemn awe and reverence due, His dear remains were laid." Eight days after Dr. Buchanan's death Mr. Hart, in fulfilment of the arrangement made at his appointment to the assistantship, was requested to assume the rectorship. One of the first achievements of his rectorate was to save the glebe to the parish. It will be remembered that this property was situated on the north side of the James river, next to the Varina estate. There is no evidence that it had been purchased by a levy of the Vestry on the people. On the contrary, there is every probability that it was a gift to the parish by the London Company, and that it was secured to the parish by an old patent. Mr. P. R. Carrington states that the patent was from Sir William Berkeley, Governor, and was dated April 16, 1666. The boundaries given are 198 acres, three roods, 16 poles. The entry in the patent book in the Virginia Land Office is under date October 9, 1672. In 1817 the Vestry had protested against its confiscation, on the ground partly that it had been in all probability a private donation to the parish, and partly that the incumbent was still living. As soon as Dr. Buchanan was dead, the overseers of the poor pounced upon the glebe again and offered it for sale. But Mr. Hart obtained, in 1826, a decree in chancery in favor of this Church against all claims of the overseers of the poor. A purchaser for the glebe was found by the Vestry. But meanwhile the overseers had taken an appeal. The intending purchaser naturally declined closing the bargain until a final decision was obtained. The Vestry asked the overseers to unite with them in a petition for an immediate decision of the case. Under the succeeding rector an effort was made by the Vestry through him to lease the lands. But the record of this action, taken March 26, 1829, is the last entry on the Vestry book in reference to this matter. Bishop Meade says: "I am privately informed that the Vestry withdrew their claim or did not prosecute it, rather than involve the Church in what might prove a long and bitter controversy with the overseers of the poor, representing the citizens of Henrico, although well persuaded that the Chancellor was right in his decision." * * * * * * * * "In ceasing to contend for their rights, the Vestrymen of Henrico only did what other Vestrymen have done, preferring rather to suffer loss than promote strife, and thereby injure the cause of religion." Fortunately the Church was not left without a rectory. The rectors ever since the last decade of the previous century had been living in a parsonage situated on the east side of Twenty-fourth street, between Broad and Marshall. The south line of the lot began at a point 110 feet north of Broad street. The lot was 55 feet wide and 120 feet deep. It had been given for the use of the minister by Col. Richard Adams. October 9, 1821, trustees had been appointed to receive from his executor and legatees a deed of conveyance of this parsonage house. But a deed to it was not secured until March 3, 1871. Then Mr. P. R. Carrington (administrator of the estate of Richard Adams, Sr.) made one to the trustees of St. John's Church. It was duly recorded. Mr. Hart also was successful in developing the Sunday school to a high degree of prosperity. Among the 19 in his confirmation class of 1827 were 5 of his 22 Sunday school teachers and 6 of the 190 scholars. The rector enthusiastically testifies to the happy influence of the Sunday school upon the whole Church. The fact that he kept a day school for boys during part of his ministry may account for his success in Sunday school work, notwithstanding his reputation for using the rod freely. That year, through the exertions of the Sunday school teachers, aided by the congregation, the interior of the Church was painted and otherwise much improved. Some of the teachers and young men of the congregation personally engaged in the manual labor. Bishop Moore, in his Convention address, declared it to be "second in its internal appearance to very few of the churches in this Diocese." The Bishop said he had preached there to a very large congregation, and mentions the present prosperous state of the Church. July 13, 1828, Mr. Hart intimated his determination to resign his charge in consequence of an intended removal to New York. To Mr. Hart we owe the keeping of a parish register, from September 17, 1815, when he administered a baptism. The original was sent anonymously to the Rev. L. W. Burton, when rector. Back of that there are no official records. But Mr. P. R. Carrington has copied into the Parish Register, that in use in 1891, the original returns in the Henrico county records, from July 2, 1785, to May 28, 1791, both inclusive, and the notices which appeared in the Richmond Enquirer from April 4, 1808, to March 11, 1817, the latter date being that of the marriage of General Winfield Scott. The Rev. Wm. F. Lee was unanimously elected Mr. Hart's successor. He was to receive for his salary the entire income from the rent of pews. According to Bishop Meade's description, he was light as a feather, but possessed of a strong mind and will, and lived under the pressure of a heart and soul devoted to the love of God and man. Although physically unequal to the itinerancy, he had revived the foundations of the Church in Goochland, Powhatan, Amelia and Chesterfield, and had seen them supplied by ministers. His ministry in Richmond began in September, 1828. To Mr. Lee we probably owe the name "St. John's Church." This building had had, as we have seen, many names: "The New Church," "The Upper Church," "The Richmond Church," "The Town Church," "The Church on Richmond Hill," "The Richmond Hill Church," "Henrico Church on Richmond Hill," "The Church," "The Old Church," etc. There is no record of action agreeing upon the name "St. John's." But in the Vestry book shortly after Mr. Lee's advent it was written for the first time without comment: "At a meeting of the Vestry of Henrico Parish, at the lecture room of St. John's Church, Richmond, Saturday evening, April 25, 1829," etc. And in the Convention Journal for that same year this Church is entered in the parochial reports as "St. John's Church, Richmond, Henrico Parish." A little later we come to another change in titles. The Vestry continued until 1850 to record its minutes as those of Henrico Parish. But May 7, 1833, the wardens make a report, in which they style themselves "The Wardens of St. John's Church, Henrico Parish." It was, however, in 1840 that the rector of this Church was spoken of, no longer as rector of Henrico Parish, but as rector of St. John's Church. Mr. Lee's ministry was full of promise from the start. He reported to the Convention of 1829 that his weekly lectures were generally crowded. The Sunday school flourished. A library of nearly 200 volumes had been added to it. No longer was the gallery at the west end of the old church sufficient for the sessions of the school in winter, nor the other galleries in summer. A portion of the school overflowed into the pews below. And Dr. Walker also says that the Lenten services, especially those of Passion Week, were more largely attended. A missionary society, auxiliary to the Domestic and Foreign Society of the General Church, had been organized. The members of it had engaged with zeal and spirit in the cause of missions. It was during his ministry that night services were begun, apparently for the first time in the history of the parish; for, according to Dr. Walker, there had been previously no lamps. He says that evening lectures had been introduced at the Rectory soon after 1826. But now, according to the same eye witness, a few lamps were placed at the pulpit and at one or two other important points; and sperm candles, in little tin sticks, were attached by nails to the gallery columns and elsewhere. Neither before this time had there been a vestry-room, for Parson Hart, so Dr. Walker reports to us, wore only the black gown and robed and unrobed in the parsonage. But as the use of the surplice, in Dr. Walker's opinion, was introduced by Mr. Lee, so also in his judgment was the robing room placed under the gallery in the west end of the original church during the same ministry. It was at best only ten feet square, and made by a slight partition. But the question of a new church in another location, which had been agitated ever since 1807, now loomed up again. This time determined and energetic spirits backed up the enterprise, and they were led by the rector. Their project was to go down into the Valley below the hill and either build a new edifice or buy the Presbyterian church, that in 1825 had been erected on the south side of Grace street between Seventeenth and Eighteenth, and that was known, from the peculiar shape of the ornament on the apex of its spire, as "The Pine Apple Church." A church quarrel was the result. Bishop Moore mediated as arbitrator. He says in a letter, entered on the minutes December 31, 1829, that to his knowledge the expediency of building a church below Richmond Hill had been the subject of consideration for several years past, and before the Rev. Mr. Lee was appointed rector. The Bishop furthermore declares that the course of conduct pursued by the rector, wardens and a part of the Vestry, as proved before him, did not show that they, or any of them, used unfair means to effect that object, or that they knew, if such be the fact, that such a measure was against the wishes of a majority of the congregation. "But," said the Bishop also, "I am equally well satisfied that the building of a new church at this time is highly inexpedient and unadvisable, owing to the present divided state of the congregation." The issue of the controversy was that December 31st of 1829 the rector resigned; his followers purchased the "Pine Apple Church"; and they and he established there the congregation now known as Christ Church. A strenuous effort was systematically made to prevent the admission of Christ Church into union with the Convention. But its application was granted by a vote of 56 to 2. It is a happy thing that the Mother Church and this one of her oldest daughters, though they parted on hard terms, are now the warmest and most helpful of neighbors. After Mr. Lee's failing health had compelled him to resign Christ's Church, he founded the Southern Churchman, and continued to edit it even on his death bed. He was a great helper to Bishop Moore, and won many friends besides the Bishop by his amiable qualities and zealous piety. It is to be noted in passing that there were at the time of this dissension 46 pews in St. John's Church. This would not have been possible, unless there had been some previous addition to the Church where the present nave now stands. A band of devoted adherents was left at St. John's. Though few in number, they were indomitable in pluck and strong in influence. They requested the Bishop to officiate or to secure a supply of the pulpit during the vacancy. They determined at once to alter and repair the church. It was in all probability at this time that the nave was increased to its present size of 45 feet width and 39 feet depth. Two aisles were also introduced instead of the former central one. The galleries on each side of the nave were removed, and only the one in the rear of the nave, for the organ and choir, and that at the west of the original church, for the colored people, were retained. Instead of the single entrance in the centre, two front doors were introduced. The belfry over the west end of the original building came down, to be replaced, in the first half of the decade of 1830, by a tower and bell. Mr. P. R. Carrington finds in the proceedings of the "Female Charitable Association of St. John's," pp. 37 and 38, at a meeting held July 8, 1830, the following minute: "Resolved, That the sum of $100 of the funds of the Society be appropriated to the purchase of a bell for St. John's Church, Henrico Parish, and that the treasurer be authorized to pay the same so soon as the bell is purchased." It is possible that the former bell is now over the public school building in Martinsville, Henry county, Va. It was purchased of a Richmond firm in 1831, by a citizen of that town, and presented by him to the authorities for the present purpose. The tradition is that, when sold, it was represented as having hung in St. John's tower, in Richmond, and as having been discarded because of a crack. It is described as a small cracked bell, its tone thereby affected, evidently of last century work, of superior metal, and bearing some evidence of artistic embellishment. The grounds also at this time received attention. Dr. Walker describes their previous condition as one indicating utter neglect. The old-fashioned flowers were well-nigh hidden beneath underbrush. Young trees, chiefly peaches and cherries of the large Blackheart variety, flourished in a sort of wild abandon. Except in the walks from the main gates, tall grass and periwinkles abounded. The grave stones of whole families had disappeared, and the removal of remains to other cemeteries had begun. Apropos of interments, Dr. Walker notes that the funeral processions seldom entered Broad street gate, as is now the case, because the street itself was short and the gate smaller than at present; and there was no broad path to it. This was also the case with the gate near the Brick School-House. Hence these two gates were not always open. But the gates at the corner of Grace and Twenty-fifth streets, and on Twenty-fourth street, were the chief ones, and always open on public occasions. Broad paths led from them; and by the former the funeral processions were accustomed to enter. The Twenty-fourth street gate had been opened by friends of the Church for the sake of greater convenience, at their own expense, according to permission of the Vestry granted July 3, 1820. It seems to have been as late as 1882 when the Cemetery Committee of the City Council, at the instance of the Vestry, opened the present brick walk from the Twenty-fourth street gate to the Church, thence entirely around the Church, and also down to the Brick School-House. The Rev. Edward W. Peet, of Hampstead, King George county, was called to the rectorate of St. John's February 24, 1830. His salary was to be $750 a year, if the pew rents would yield that amount; and he was also to have the parsonage. In February Bishop Moore instituted him into the rectorship of St. John's. This is one of the three institutions which have occurred in this Diocese up to 1891. It may be accepted as a sign of quick reconciliation, such as becomes estranged Christians, that the sermon, at this institution of his successor, was preached by the Rev. Mr. Lee, rector of Christ's Church. In 1830 Mr. Peet reported 24 communicants at the Easter Communion. In 1831 he reported five accessions to the communion. But Christ Church by that time had 43 communicants. Mr. Peet was hindered in his work. He was compelled to be absent twenty-one Sundays through sickness and other causes. That the people of St. John's in their opposition to the formation of Christ Church had no idea of blocking all progress in the parish is evident. The Vestry instructed the representatives of the parish to use their exertions and influence to secure for Monumental that independent union with the Convention which that congregation desired. The lay deputy from Henrico became himself the patron of the memorial sent by Monumental congregation to the Convention. August 2, 1831, a petition was received asking the sanction of the Vestry to the establishment of a new Episcopal Church within the Parish of Henrico, to be located in a convenient situation on Shockoe Hill. Unanimous consent was given by the rector and vestry. In expressing it they said that they regarded with pleasure the prospect of promoting the welfare of the Episcopal Church within the parish, and did cheerfully assent, provided the church be located west of the Capitol. To the Council of 1832 St. John's reported 30 communicants. Christ Church reported 60, and Monumental 172. July 25, 1833, the Rev. E. W. Peet resigned. Rev. Robt. B. Croes, on the 31st of August, accepted the election of the Vestry. They offered him a salary of $750 per annum, payable semi-annually, and a house. In the spring of 1833 the ladies had held a fair. By it they accomplished what would be considered a remarkably fine result now-a-days: they raised more than $900. Eight hundred dollars were applied toward the erection of a tower; $100 toward the purchase of a bell. This tower was in the shape of a cupola or belfry, open so that the bell was exposed. It was also under Mr. Croes' ministry, in 1835, that the brick building in the southwest part of the church yard, now commonly known as the Brick Schoolhouse or the Brick Chapel, was erected for the Sunday school and for a week-day school. Its size was 37 feet by 25 feet. Its cost was $750. "As to spiritual things," says Mr. Croes, however, "the officiating minister has thus far met with very little to encourage his heart." Mr. Croes had previously been assistant to Bishop Moore at the Monumental, from 1825 to 1830. In this connection he was highly spoken of by the Rt. Rev. Rector. His ministry at St. John's was terminated January 21, 1836. On the next day the Rev. Wm. H. Hart was recalled from New York to his former position as rector of St. John's on a salary of $800 and the parsonage. Mr. Hart seems to have taught school in Richmond during this as also during his previous rectorship. The next year "the Vestry of Henrico Parish," as it still styled itself, joined that of Bruton Parish, and probably others throughout the Diocese, in a rebellion against the Convention. They refused to send a delegate, because the delegates were required by the amended constitution to be communicants. It was asserted by Bruton Vestry that nine-tenths of the church members were not communicants. In the fall of 1837 St. James' Church was organized. In 1839 it was admitted into union with the Convention, and the building consecrated. In the latter year there were more than 100 adults belonging to St. James' congregation, and between 30 and 40 communicants. The membership was composed largely of those who had been attending the Monumental. But the movement indicates the increase in the number of Episcopalians in Richmond, and the fact that they were settling westward of the centre of the city. In 1842 the communicants of St. John's numbered 31. The Sunday school had 72 scholars and 12 teachers. There is a still more certain manifestation of the low ebb to which affairs had run. At the meeting of the Vestry at which Mr. Hart's resignation was accepted, an organist was elected to serve till November 1, 1842, when Mr. Hart was to leave, "and (to serve) afterwards, if the church is kept up." Parson Hart died July 28, 1852. But the great lesson taught by St. John's history is that workers for Christ must have such faith in their Master that they will never be discouraged. Knowing that their labor is never in vain in the Lord, they must be "steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord." We must leave Him to decide when the "due season" for reaping shall have arrived. Meanwhile we must faint not, neither be weary in well doing. "Yield not to misfortunes, but advance all the more boldly against them." In its 150 years of history there is record of frequent occasions when its candle almost sputtered out and of times when even its own rector advised that the candlestick be removed from its place. But now St. John's is one of the strongest and most fruitful congregations in Virginia. To every sister church now struggling against many odds, and especially to those country churches whose most able and faithful supporters are moving away, St. John's message is: Be true to the loving command of Christ, written in Revelation 2:25: "Tenete donec veniam" ("Hold fast till I come"). The middle of our century marks a favorable turning point in our history. After consultation with the clergy of the city, a committee of the Vestry exercised the powers given it and appointed the Rev. J. H. Morrison, of Buckingham, the rector. His rectorship lasted from January 26, 1843, till May 15, 1848. His ministry seems to have been blessed with a substantial increase to the vineyard, both as to spiritual and as to material interests. In 1845 he reported to the Convention, as the fruits of his two and one-third years' ministry, a growth from 31 to 51 communicants, and an addition of some eight families. The whole number of families was now about 31. Five hundred and forty dollars had been spent in repairing and improving the church edifice. The school-house had been leased, and the proceeds applied to the support of the Sunday school. The object of the lessee was probably to use the building for a day school. In 1848, when Mr. Morrison resigned, the communicants numbered 64, of whom one was colored. This was a number more than double that reported at the time of his call to the parish. The correspondence between him and the Vestry in connection with his resignation indicates perfect harmony, and evinces mutual regreat at severing pastoral relations. The Vestry willingly bore testimony to the ability, zeal and faithfulness with which he had discharged his duties. Meanwhile important changes had taken place in the parish at large. St. Paul's Church had come into being. Its corner-stone was laid October 10, 1844, and it was consecrated November 11, 1846. The bulk of the congregation of Monumental, with its rector, Rev. Dr. Wm. Norwood, migrated to it in December of 1845. Their motive was to secure a larger edifice. But the portion of the former congregation remaining at Monumental invited the congregation of Christ Church to unite with it in Monumental, under the rector of Christ Church, the Rev. Geo. Woodbridge. A few of the former Christ Church people joined St. John's. This was a practical abandonment of Christ Church. April 16, 1846, St. Luke's Church had also been consecrated on the site of the present Clay Street M. E. Church. It was a building of small dimensions. With lot and fence its cost was about $2,850. It was intended to be a missionary station of the Rev. Dr. Bolton. St. Mark's now occupies the field first opened by St. Luke's. The Rev. Henry S. Kepler followed Mr. Morrison, and entered upon his duties about October 10, 1848. In 1850 he reported communicants—white, 52; colored, 1. Number of families, 50, embracing 185 individuals. One hundred and fifteen of these were adults. In the Sunday school were 12 teachers, 4 of whom were male, and 76 scholars, the average attendance of whom was 65. In 1851, Mr. Kepler reported contributions to different institutions amounting to $750. A new bell, 3 feet 2? inches in diameter, cast by Francis Meneely, in West Troy, in 1850, had been put in, the old one having been broken in the course of long usage. Extensive repairs were in progress, which, by the next Convention, he was able to report completed and paid for. In 1854 he reported a new furnace put in and paid for. May 2, 1855, a committee of the vestry was appointed "to apply to the Common Council of the city of Richmond" "for the protection and preservation of the burying ground attached to our Church." Their letter of May 5th calls "attention to the neglected condition of the old churchyard on Church Hill," and asks them to "adopt such prompt measures as to (them) may seem advisable to cause its ruins to be repaired." It refers to an ordinance passed some three years before, directing "that the grounds should be laid out in walks, beautified with trees and other shrubbery, and that a new wall, which the grading of the street rendered necessary, should be erected on Twenty-fourth street." Twenty-fifth street it must be, but the records say "Twenty-fourth." But the whole of the appropriation then made had been absorbed in the wall. The result is thus described in the committee's letter: "The lapse of three more years of neglect has but increased the desolations which overspread this ancient city of the dead. There is, perhaps, no spot within our Commonwealth around which there linger prouder and holier memories than this. Here the infancy of our great and prosperous country was rocked by our noble sires; and here, too, sleep the remains of some of our earliest and most worthy citizens." "To neglect such a spot is to forfeit our claim as the worthy descendants of such sires, and to proclaim our shame to the hundreds of our citizens from other States who annually visit it as a spot made sacred to them in the story of our struggles for national independence." * * * * * * * * "From this scene of ruin, what impression of us must they carry with them to their distant homes? Will you not adopt some prompt and effectual measures to remove this reproach from the honor of our city?" It was probably owing to this stirring statement and urgent appeal that, February 21, 1858, the City Council gave to one of its committees exclusive authority to give consent to interments in "this square," and that, on October 24, 1859, it was fixed that the appointment of the committee should be annually in December. By an ordinance approved on the 23d of March, 1886, a result was produced that went far beyond the best that the petitioners of 1855 could have dreamed of. Two hundred dollars were appropriated for expenses and $400 for the pay-roll. It was provided that the committee should consist of three members of the Common Council and two of the Board of Aldermen, appointed by the presidents, respectively. "The committee shall cause to be kept in order the whole of said enclosure, with gates and steps for passing through it, and everything within the enclosure and outside of the church." "Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the committee to prevent or interfere with the use of the church by the congregation thereof." No interments were to be made without the consent of the committee. It may be noted here that there was only one interment in 1891, and only twenty up to and including that year since November 1, 1869. The present appearance of the grounds is such as to make the square the most beautiful in Richmond, and to rival any churchyard the country over. For this condition, so delightful to members of the congregation and to our citizens generally, and so highly approved by visitors, the chief praise is due to the faithful, efficient and courteous sexton and keeper, Mr. Antoni Graffigna. In 1856 the tide of spiritual prosperity was high. That year the rector reported 77 communicants. Two new Sunday schools had been established; one an infant school of 20 scholars, the other a colored school, in which from 60 to 65 were taught orally by the rector. The old school had been much increased, and now numbered 17 officers and 102 scholars. But in 1858 had set in again that fatal reaction which is so often painfully noticeable in church work, as in all other enterprises. The communicants had dropped to 69; the two new schools had been abandoned or merged into the old one; that old one had decreased to 70 scholars and 14 teachers. The only residuum of the fine Sunday school enthusiasm of two years before was $600 on hand for a new Sunday school building. And now this project was abandoned. In lieu of it, on motion of the rector, it was unanimously determined to build a new church, if subscriptions sufficient for that purpose could be obtained. By May 5, 1859, probably owing to a depression in the church's financial affairs, it had been determined only to make an extension of the church. Even that proposition fell short of execution, in all likelihood through the resignation, on the 16th of the following June, 1859, of Mr. Kepler, to become Evangelist of the Diocese. He and his people parted on excellent terms, with reciprocal regards and good wishes. It may have been at this time, or at least at some time between 1857 and 1860, that the east transept door was cut through, the two east windows closed, the door at the southeast corner of the old part of the church closed, and the former aisle to it filled with a pew or pews. The Vestry still felt sufficiently strong to offer a salary of $1,200 per annum. October 2, 1859, the Rev. John T. Points accepted their call, his ministry to begin from November 1st following. He had been a missionary to China. Then he had labored in New Kent, building in the northern part of the county what used to be St. James' Church. St. John's enjoyed during his brief pastorate a delightful revival of all its best interests. Everything was again fanned up to splendid zeal. Twenty were confirmed in 1859 and 1860. There was an additional net gain of ten; the total number of communicants was 110. The Sunday school numbered 18 teachers, 138 scholars. He died June 10, 1860, in his thirtieth year, in King William county. A committee of the Vestry went there to escort his remains home. The Vestry bore glad witness to his lofty Christian virtues and noble ministerial labors. The church, by their order, was draped in mourning for sixty days. A monument "erected by the ladies of St. John's Church and his Masonic brethren, in grateful remembrance of his labor of love amongst them," now marks his resting place in the church yard. After the death of Mr. Points the Rev. Wm. C. Butler, of Halifax C. H., was called. He accepted the rectorship, with a salary of $1,500 and a parsonage, September 17, 1860. The number of communicants and the size of the Sunday school were a little increased. But the country was beginning to suffer the terrible throes of war. In consequence, the congregation was drained of men and money. Especially in view of this, the Vestry found that, in their zeal to get a rector, they had made offers they could not meet. And for the same reason the rector found he could not support himself. 4 The vestry insisted upon services on Sunday night and once on a week day. The rector resented this action as an encroachment upon his prerogatives. Having also premonitions of pulmonary trouble, he resigned November 27, 1861. A committee was appointed to secure temporary services. The Vestry resolved itself into a committee of the whole to consult the pew holders as to the choice of a successor. It fell upon the Rev. Wm. Norwood, D. D. For years, first at Monumental and then at St. Paul's, he had gone in and out among the citizens of Richmond and won their unanimous esteem and affection. He was called March 18, 1862, on $1,000 a year and the parsonage. He accepted April 5th, and began his ministrations on Easter day, the third Sunday in April. It fell to his lot to share with his beloved people the brunt of the war. Spiritual interests not only held their own, but increased somewhat. And there was a consequent material liveliness. A committee was appointed April 6, 1863, to confer with the administrator of the estate of the donor of the parsonage, Col. Richard Adams, with a view to selling it and investing the proceeds in bonds or otherwise till the Vestry could purchase another house or lot. If the project had been consummated, undoubtedly the proceeds would have been swept away amid the reverses of the war. This same year, 1863, the rector stepped out of his vestry room one Sunday morning to perform divine service, when the calamitous result of a wind storm met his eye at the northern or front end of the church. The steeple was prostrate. Two lower edges of the bell were somewhat scaled off; but otherwise it was uninjured. The spire was not restored until about November, in 1866. The plan was drawn and contributed by Col. Alfred L. Rives, C. E. The cost, including necessary and incidental repairs, was $1,213, the funds for which were mostly raised from a fair held in the basement of Trinity M. E. Church. December 10, 1866, weekly collections were again resorted to to meet incidental expenses. The crippled state of the congregation at the close of the war can be judged from the report of the treasurer, December 4, 1866. The arrearages in pew rents were $1,385, of which $365 were available. Though the treasurer had personally advanced $417.86, there was still due the rector, on the preceding six months, $348.37 out of the annual salary of $1,000. August 17, 1868, Dr. Norwood handed in his resignation, to take effect October 1st. He had accepted a call to Emmanuel Church, Henrico country. This was his last charge. He departed this life July 29, 1887, in the eighty-first year of his age, venerated by all who knew him. The Rev. Henry Wall, of Christ Church, West River, Md., was elected to fill his place. He accepted and began his labors October 25th. The parsonage was enlarged and put into repair. Chiefly by means of a fair held in the Sunday school room of Trinity M. E. Church, at the corner of Twentieth and Broad streets, in May, 1869, $647.64 were raised for its furnishing. The rector's salary was made $1,250. He reported to the Bishop at the next Council a net increase of 14 communicants and a total number of 127. The Sunday school had fallen off from 120 scholars to 109. The treasurer of the church was authorized by the Vestry to pay the expenses of the Sunday school. In 1869 and 1870 the congregation was consulted, and there was a thorough discussion of the pew system, the free church plan and the envelope method of raising a revenue. The result was that a modified form of the pew rent system with the envelope feature was adopted. The rector's salary was increased to $1,400 from November 1, 1870. In January of 1871 a joint committee of the Vestry and the Sunday school was appointed to devise a plan for raising means to build a new Sunday school house or enlarge the old one. On the 18th of the following March a committee was appointed to secure from the City Council permission to widen and extend the Old School-House. It may be noted that this building was at this time spoken of as "the lecture" —or "school-room." Meanwhile another misfortune had overtaken the congregation. The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, in tunnelling through Church Hill, had undermined the parsonage. The rector and his family were obliged to move out in the night. The railroad company behaved handsomely and enabled the trustees to secure what was at the time a fine property at the southwest corner of Twentieth and Broad streets, valued at $6,500. In the first half of 1874, the entrance door on either side of the tower was closed up, and the base of the tower was opened, as it appears at present. Thus a vestibule was secured at a cost of $159.88. May 29, 1874, the Rev. Jas. W. Shields, son of the late venerable and esteemed Senior Warden, became the assistant of St. John's. By his using here the office of a deacon well, he purchased to himself a good degree. To this estimable and promising young clergyman, on August 3, 1890, the last sad rites of mortality were rendered in this church, in which his ministry had auspiciously begun. Rev. Dr. Wall resigned July 15, 1875. He was a clergyman of vigorous mind and ripe scholarship. His sermons will be remembered by all his hearers as full of grace and power. He was a native of Ireland and a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin. His theological education was received at the Seminary of Virginia. The first year of his ministry was spent in South Carolina. His last charge was in Kent county, Md. The interval was chiefly devoted to the Diocese of Virginia. On account of ill health he retired from the active ministry about a year before he died. And August 19, 1889, in his 72d year, he passed away among the people to whom he had last ministered. During the twenty years preceding 1875, there had been great advances in the parish at large. Grace Church, under the rectorship of the Rev. Mr. Baker, had been consecrated January 14, 1859. July 6, 1860, Emmanuel, Henrico, under the rectorship of the late Bishop Wilmer, of Alabama, was consecrated. In 1862 and 1863 St. Philip's had been erected under the rectorship of Rev. D. F. Sprigg. In 1866 St. Mark's was reported as organized and as being built under the rectorship of the Rev. T. G. Dashiell. The present St. Mark's was erected in 1872 and 1873, and consecrated June 26, 1880. The former building of St. Mark's was bought for the colored people, and is now St. Philip's. In 1868 and 1869 a church was organized by Rev. J. E. Hammond in an "upper room" in Manchester. The present Meade Memorial Church was built in 1869 and 1870. Christ Church congregation had been reorganized by Mr. Dallas Tucker in 1870 and 1871. By July 12, 1871, a church had been erected and consecrated. In 1875 Moore Memorial Chapel of St. James' was reported as built. In 1880 it had become an independent church with Rev. Dr. Sprigg as rector. And finally, in 1876, St. Paul's reports the erection of St. Andrew's, with Rev. Pike Powers in charge. St. Andrew's was consecrated December 30th following. In 1875 Dr. Wall was succeeded by the Rev. Alexander Watson Weddell. He was called from Harrisonburg, Va., on $1,400, and the use of the rectory, and accepted to begin work the second Sunday in September. In 1876, the following year, he reported to the Bishop at the Council 196 communicants, 28 Sunday school teachers, and 169 scholars. In the fall of 1875 the sum of $200 was in hand for a new Sunday school building. The question arose, as it had during Dr. Wall's ministry, whether to enlarge the old or build a new school-house. Now also it was debated whether, if a new school-house was built, it should be within the grounds or outside the churchyard. Finally it was decided to build a new school-house within the grounds. The present frame Sunday school building was the result, September 11, 1876. February 12, 1877, action was begun looking to the alteration of the church. This was accomplished. The church was opened October 21, 1880, after being a month in the hands of the workmen. Then the gallery at the western end of the original church and the rooms below it had been removed. The chancel had been enlarged by a curved recess. A vestry room, ten by twelve, had been added in the rear of the chancel. The pulpit had been lowered some 12 or 18 inches, the steps and railing to it from the westerly side and the sounding board removed. New chancel furniture had been introduced. More specifically, a square holy table, with scroll work between its legs, was substituted for the oval fronted table, which, in turn, was placed in the frame schoolhouse; and oaken chairs took the place of the two of mahogany which had been given in the rectorship of Mr. Kepler. The gallery in the northern end of the nave, which had extended to the second window from the north, was reduced to its present dimensions. The organ was cleaned and repaired. The ceiling of the original church had remained flat all these years. Now the whole of the church was made to have one concave ceiling, and a large gas reflector was suspended from it. Old girders in the roof, which were discovered to have become weakened by dry-rot, were removed, and new, strong timbers were substituted. The entire church was renovated and repainted. By the change 11 new pews were added, while there was no lessening the number in the present gallery. The total cost of the improvements was $1,003.65. May 14, 1877, Dr. Weddell's salary was increased to $1,500 a year. In 1880 two new Sunday schools were started; the one now known as Calvary Mission, situated then and for years afterward at the southeast corner of Main and Nineteenth streets, under the superintendence of Sergeant B. F. Howard; the other a colored school, (There had been for a brief period a colored Sunday school during the rectorship of Rev. H. S. Kepler, in 1855-'56, started by a devoted church worker, Mrs. James M. Estes, in her kitchen.) A Sunday school organ and library had been purchased at a total cost of $332. It appears in the Council reports of 1881 that St. John's had 300 communicants and an aggregate Sunday school enrollment of 423. This indicates the prime of Dr. Weddell's indefatigable labors and noble gifts. From that time the strong, brave man, so true and forceful in speech, so boldly aggressive and perseveringly energetic in action, began to fail in health. And the machinery of the church began to falter with the slackened pulsations of that heart which had been for years the tireless motive power in it all. Arrangements were made for an assistant in the fall of 1882. The Rev. Lyman B. Wharton, D. D., first occupied that position for some three months, from February 26, 1883. Then the Rev. Francis M. Burch followed, from June 15, 1883. Most tenderly and generously did the appreciative and affectionate congregation minister to their pastor's every possible need. They took advantage of every opportunity to save the life of their beloved and devoted rector. They sent him to the balmy, soothing regions of the South; to the bracing air and the healing waters of our own Virginia mountains. But he bore in his body the marks of the Lord Jesus. December 6, 1883, after one and a half years of sickness, he commended his spirit to the Father who gave it. He rests within the morning shadows of this dear old shrine, whose truest interests he loved better than life. A tablet to his memory rests upon the wall to the east of the chancel, where the loving eyes of his former people may rest upon it. His monument, erected by this congregation, at a cost of $456, records his life story in the graphic, telling words of one of his most intimate lay friends: "Large hearted, Large minded: Devoted to God. A lover of the truth and of manhood: Bold, untiring, faithful, in the service of the Master: Tender, watchful and unceasing in the care of his flock; His people loved and revered him." The Rev. F. M. Burch resigned the assistantship, to take effect February 1, 1884. But at the request of the Vestry he continued his services as minister in charge until April 1, 1884. The vestry, in parting with him, commended him as a faithful, earnest and loving worker, who, under the most difficult circumstances of having to take charge of a congregation without being its rector, labored in and out of season.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HISTORY OF St. John's Church RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, From 1884 to 1904. By J. STAUNTON MOORE. AUTHORIZED BY THE VESTRY. St. John's Church 1903. With New Tower. INTRODUCTION. A history of Henrico Parish, and particularly of old St. John's Church, has been a long-felt want, embracing as it does statistical information, historic facts and Church data that are obtainable from no other source than its old records. Convinced of the importance of such an undertaking and impressed with this public need, the Vestry of St. John's Church, on the 4th day of February, 1902, on motion of Mr. G. G. Minor, adopted the following resolution unanimously, That a committee be appointed, to be known as the Committee on St. John's History, whose duty it shall be to gather from time to time material looking to the publication of a history of St. John's Protestant Episcopal Church. Members are as follows: J. S. Moore, Chairman; Cyrus Bossieux, Senior Warden; John F. Mayer, Junior Warden; P. R. Carrington, W. W. Davies. The committee met and delegated the compilation of the work and the writing of the history to its Chairman, Mr. J. S. Moore. Many of the records of St. John's have been lost or destroyed, and some of those in possession of the Church are fragmentary and imperfectly kept; hence this compendium is necessarily incomplete and contains errors and important omissions. The records since 1860 are fairly well kept, and are in good condition. During the period of the administration of Rev. William H. Hart (the exact date does not appear), the congregation was composed chiefly of "Heads of Families," and the members of the same, very few of whom were communicants. A list is given showing "Heads of Families" 63, members 204, of whom only 42 were communicants. In 1840 Mr. Hart gives the list of communicants as only 41 in number. At another period he gives the list of communicants as only 21, including the minister and his wife, and six of these belonged to the Adams family. The Church at this time was at a very low ebb. During the Rev. J. H. Morrison's incumbency, it appears that the congregation was composed of "pew holders." A list given by him in 1845 shows 45 by name, but it does not state how many of these were communicants. Rt. Rev. Lewis William Burton, when rector of St. John's, commenced the annals of the Parish and Church, and at the earnest solicitation of the Vestry, he kindly completed his labor of love after he became Bishop of the Diocese of Lexington, Ky. His annals of Henrico Parish are embraced in this volume. It was also deemed proper to include in this volume the portraits of all the Bishops of Virginia, the ministers and assistant ministers of St. John's Church, the portraits of Col. Wm. Byrd, Jr., who donated the grounds upon which the old Church stands; the site was then known as "Indian Town Hill"; of the Rev. Alexander Whitaker (the "apostle"), the first Episcopal minister of Virginia; of Patrick Henry, whose eloquence served to render the old Church famous; of the Church itself, with its furniture, etc. A copy of the Old Vestry Book of Henrico Parish, with notes by Dr. R. A. Brock, from 1730 to 1773, with its quaint entries, is also embraced in this volume. As the compiler of this work and as chairman of the Committee on the History of St. John's, I desire to testify to the faithfulness of the individuals of the committee, and to tender publicly my thanks for their helpful aid and cordial co-operation. Each has rendered efficient assistance, and without their help in getting together the portraits and other work my task would have been prolonged and difficult. I am under special obligation to Mr. W. W. Davies and Mr. P. R. Carrington for pictures of the Bishops and ministers that were unobtainable through any other source; and to Mr. Carrington for data, the result of tireless energy and deep research. Captain John F. Mayer has, during the progress of the work, shown that courtesy of manner and obliging disposition that have always characterized his individuality. Captain Cyrus Bossieux has by his prompt attendance at the meetings of the committee lent the encouragement of his presence and counsel. In fact, no chairman could have had more enthusiastic and interested associates than I have been blessed with. It was our sad misfortune to lose by death one of our companions, who was always the first to be present whenever a meeting of the committee was called, and who was deeply interested in the department he was so well qualifid to fill—the collection of portraits. In the midst of our labors, in December, 1903, our associate, Mr. William Williams Davies, was called to his eternal rest. The deaths in this family within a period of two months have been peculiarly touching and distressing. About the middle of November last his eldest daughter was stricken and died; she was the light of his life, the apple of his eye, the pride of his soul. Mr. Davies, though a man of strong will power, was physically weak and never recovered from this blow. He was completely crushed. Soon after her death he gave up, and had a premonition of his own approaching end; but he never lost interest in the work of the committee as long as he drew breath, and his love for the Church never waned. One of the last acts of his life was to donate by will a "Davies Memorial," to cost $1,500. To this munificent bequest Mrs. Davies has added the further sum of $500, making the total "Davies Memorial" $2,000. Mrs. Davies has also presented St. John's Sunday school with a splendid organ. Two days before his death the writer sat at his bedside and held in his grasp his feeble hand as he talked about the work upon which we were engaged, evincing to the last the keenest interest. A few days after Mr. Davies' death his other daughter and the last of his children succumbed also to the grim tyrant, leaving his widow entirely alone. Mr. Davies was entirely conscious of his condition. No fear of the future seemed to disturb his mind; having lived a godly life, he died the death of the righteous. He exhibited in his last moments that courtesy and consideration for others that characterized him in his daily life, and a chivalric feeling, a sympathetic thought, worthy of a Chevalier Bayard or a Sir Philip Sidney. A few moments before he drew his last breath he turned to his wife at his bedside and said, quietly and calmly, at the same time lovingly patting her hand: "Little Marie, go out for a little while, I don't wish you to see the last struggle"; but his wife, with true devotion and nobility of womanhood, replied: "Willie, for seventeen years I have been to you a faithful wife, and I will not desert you now!" Thus passed away one of the most kindly and courteous of gentlemen. Let us trust "His day is come, not gone; His sun is risen, not set; His life is now beyond The reach of death or change— Not ended, but begun." I think it but proper I should pay this tribute to one associated with us in this work, and who was so deeply interested in its success. The committee is greatly indebted to Dr. R. A. Brock, the distinguished historian and antiquarian, for placing at its disposal inscriptions from tombstones and monuments of St. John's Church-yard, taken soon after the late civil war. Many of these tombstones have since been destroyed by the elements and the disintegration of time; and but for Dr. Brock it would have been impossible to have secured them. Dr. Brock not only placed his copies of these inscriptions at our disposal, but has kindly added brief annotations to many of them that make them interesting and instructive. Our beloved Bishop, R. A. Gibson, has also added to the interest of this volume by his entertaining sketches; as has our beloved rector, R. A. Goodwin, in contributing sketches of some of the Bishops of Virginia. We are also under many obligations to Mr. W. G. Stanard, of the Virginia Historical Society, for brief biographical sketches of the same character. We are also greatly indebted to Mr. D. C. Richardson for permitting us to take from his notes of Henrico County Court Records, the list of marriages of Henrico Parish from 1682 to 1765. This list of marriages was copied by Mr. P. R. Carrington. I should also be remiss in my duty if I did not acknowledge the helpful services of my wife and my daughter, Mrs. Alice Moore Franklin, who have rendered material aid in the verification of this work—the only aid in this line that I have had during the tedious task. We are also indebted to Miss Stella Williams, Miss F. P. Gretter and Miss Pearl Bodeker, for pictures and portraits. Every effort has been made, but without success, to obtain the picture of Rev. David Griffith, the first Bishop-elect of Virginia. We have also been unable to obtain a picture of the Rev. Wm. Stith, the distinguished Virginia historian and the first rector of St. John's Church. The only thing we have been enabled to secure is the coat of arms and the autograph of Mr. Stith. This volume contains the names of two thousand communicants, all of whom were connected with St. John's since 1860. This does not include the special lists of "pew holders," "heads of families," etc., prior to 1860. Of these two thousand souls, 559 are males and 1,441 females, showing that the women still maintain their reputation for zeal, piety and devotion; they were in the days of old first at the sepulchre and the last at Calvary, and to their fidelity and faithfulness are due, in a great measure, the growth and usefulness of old St. John's. The number of marriages given is 779, of which 340 are since 1860. In this number are not included the marriages from the records of Henrico county. The number of baptisms, 1,922, of which 1,308 are since 1860. The number of burials, 1,335, of which 1,103 are since 1860. The number of confirmations during the administrations of Dr. Weddell, Rev. L. W. Burton, and Rev. R. A. Goodwin is 925; the records previous to this date are fragmentary and incomplete. This entire work has been a labor of love without any remuneration or reward—other than the pleasure derived from duty performed by all engaged and enlisted in the enterprise. If what we have collected and put in shape for the present and future generations shall prove of interest and use, we shall have accomplished our object and gained our reward. Richmond, Va.,January 1, 1904. J. S. Moore. HISTORY OF ST. JOHN'S CHURCH From 1884 to 1904. BY J. STAUNTON MOORE. As chairman of the Committee on the History of St. John's Church, it falls upon the writer not only to compile and gather together the fragments of its history, but to give a brief epitome or outline of the Old Church since 1884, at which period the interesting Annals of Henrico Parish, by the Rt. Rev. Lewis William Burton, end. Mr. Burton, in addition to his history of Henrico Parish, which he undertook while rector of St. John's Church, and completed after he became Bishop of the Diocese of Lexington, Ky., embracing as it does statistical information, historic research, and ecclesiastical data, the preservation of which for future use and reference becomes more valuable and precious as time goes apace, wrote also the Annals of St. John's Church during his incumbency. These annals show the growth of the Old Church in spiritual grace, and its material prosperity. These details are of inestimable interest and value to the communicants of the Church, during his administration. They contain accuracy of detail and incidents, and are written with that facility of pen and fecundity of thought characteristic of the man, and are striking evidences of his affection and a beautiful testimonial of his love for his old parishioners. But the committee, whilst not only appreciating the narrative but also reciprocating the generous sentiment and devotion that inspired it, does not deem the Annals of St. John's Church of sufficient importance or interest to the public at large to justify its publication in this volume. The committee, however, does recommend its publication in full in a separate volume in the future for distribution to the communicants of St. John's Church, each one of whom should cherish it as a souvenir and a testimonial of love; and would value it as a tie of communion between them and their late beloved rector. Mr. Burton states in his St. John's Annals: "They are not intended for publication, but only as a supply of material from which the future historian is to extract his facts." And whilst the writer has his doubts as to whether this sketch is entitled to the dignity of history, and questions his ability to appear in the role of historian, he will avail himself of the "supply of material" thus placed at his disposal by his beloved rector, gleaning and garnering such facts as time and space will permit, and as he thinks may best interest the public at large. In some instances the facts will be stated in the writer's own way; in other instances he will use not only the ideas, but the language of Mr. Burton, conceding that if there be any merit in his performance Mr. Burton is justly entitled to the credit. The difference between the Annals of Henrico Parish and the Annals of St. John's Church is this—one is the tender outpouring and evidence of the kindly love and interest of our beloved rector, showing his personal relations, his affection, his personality, his untiring zeal and his work among us, evidenced in facts, figures and personal incidents that make them peculiarly charming and dear to those under his charge during the period in the recital, with which the public has but slight interest; the other is a matter of more general importance, covering, as it does, the most romantic and interesting period in the history of Virginia. The writer was a frequent attendant at the services of St. John's under the rectorship of the late lamented Alexander W. Weddell, but in those days his religious opinions and convictions had not crystallized into faith sufficiently strong to justify his becoming a communicant. He had the pleasure of Dr. Weddell's acquaintance and enjoyed his friendship as a man and brother Mason for several years before his death, and discussed with him freely in a friendly and social way many doubts that beset and perplexed him on religious matters. Dr. Weddell preached at him many sermons that came from the heart of this good and faithful minister, but it was not until Mr. Moody's first visit to Richmond, and under his benign influence, plain and practical teachings, that the writer, coupled with Dr. Weddell's kindly ministration, induced was to cast all his burdens on our Saviour's shoulders, and to bury his doubts in the bosom of His love. Dr. Weddell impressed the writer as being liberal, broad-minded, free from cant and hypocrisy. Plain, simple and unaffected, devoid of slang and free from technical terms. He formed his opinions not in the academic schools, but from practical experience—from actual contact with men. His horizon of thought was bounded by no narrow limits; he thoroughly understood human nature. He did not look down upon humanity from an exalted pedestal. He took mankind as he found it, not as he thought it should be. He had familiarized himself with man's nature "in the tented field" as a Confederate soldier; he knew its capacities, its aspirations, its fallibilities. He exercised patience, temperance and moderation in treating its limitations. He was never pessimistic in his religious views or dogmatic in his discourses or self-conceited in his opinions. A beautiful optimism pervaded his thoughts and breathed in his utterances. A wonderful patience and submission during his lingering illness pervaded his conversation, and governed his actions. Many a time has the writer on his way to his home taken him "up the hill" in his buggy, when scarcely able to walk, yet still trying to perform his appointed duties. Nature cast him in an heroic mould, not only physically, but endowed him mentally with those graceful virtues calculated to win human hearts, and enshrined his soul in those lovely traits of character that endeared him to all who knew him. He was indeed a— "Happy, cheerful, loyal man, Built upon the God-like plan; Always doing something good For his humble brotherhood. Memory, with her magic spell, O'er the years shall fondly tell How his glorious, active mind Loved and wrought for all mankind." When he died a pall was cast not only over the Church he J. Staunton Moore. Editor and Compiler. 5 had so faithfully served and loved so well, but over the entire community; yet we are consoled with the reflection that— "They never quite leave us, the friends who have passed, Through the shadows of death to the sunlight above; A thousand sweet memories are holding them fast, To the places they blessed with their presence and love." The restoration—aye, it may be truthfully said the resurrection—of St. John's Church is due to the strenuous efforts and consecrated labors of Dr. Weddell. When he took charge in 1876 there were but 118 communicants. By his earnest zeal, his affability, his sincere piety, he increased the number the first year to 221, the membership continuing to increase yearly until he rested from his labors, adding during the eight years of his ministerial work 506 communicants, and presenting for confirmation 243—the largest increase, up to that time, in the annals of the Church since its foundation. But St. John's Church for the past forty years has been peculiarly a Church of transition. The constant change of the personnel of the congregation has been remarkable, and probably unparalleled in Church history. The tendency to "move up town" by the residents of the Old Hill as the city grows westward has been going on from year to year, thus causing a shifting membership—here to-day, gone to-morrow! The tale is told "in mournful numbers" as the words "removed" or "transferred" appear opposite the names on the communicant list. When the Rev. Lewis William Burton (under whose rectorship the writer became a communicant of St. John's) succeeded to the rectorship in 1884, there only remained 276 communicants as the result of the indefatigable work of the lamented Weddell. Mr. Burton was called from St. Mark's, Cleveland, Ohio. He took up the work with that energy and devotion characteristic of the man. In addition to a fine presence and intellectual physique, he possessed in a remarkable degree those personal qualities of mind and manner that at once favorably impressed all who met him. In the prime of life, active, zealous, full of divine fire, he at once set to work to build up Old St. John's. Tasteful and possessing a tact that at once gave him intuitive perception and apprehension of what was best to say and do under all circumstances; courteous, kindly, sympathetic, but not familiar, he at once won the hearts of his congregation. His enunciation clear, his language chaste, his utterances distinct—a master of elocution—he was happy in communicating his ideas. His preaching, non-Calvinistic, yet thoroughly orthodox, was of an inspiring, hopeful, trustful, helpful nature, that soon filled every seat in Old St. John's, and held his audience with breathless attention. Under his teaching he inspired all who heard him with faith, hope and trust; those who doubted had their doubts removed, those who believed were strengthened in their faith. Mr. Burton, during his pastorate of nine years, added to the communicants of St. John's 563, presenting for confirmation 337, but the same change of domicile, the same tendency to move westward, was going on, and when the Rev. R. A. Goodwin, our present rector, succeeded the beloved Burton, the number of communicants was only 442. Mr. Goodwin during the ten years he has been rector, by his faithful ministration and devotion to duty, has added 521 communicants, presenting for confirmation 345 persons. By comparing the work of these efficient ministers, it will be seen that (in round numbers) Dr. Weddell added 48 communicants and presenting for confirmation on an average 30 persons annually. Mr. Burton averages 63 communicants and 37 confirmations during the nine years of his rectorship. Mr. Goodwin has in the ten years he has been with us averaged 52 communicants and 34 confirmations. During Dr. Weddell's administration, including the number of communicants then on the Church roll, there were 506; Mr. Burton added 563 and Mr. Goodwin 521, making 1,590 persons, and yet to-day, owing to reasons already assigned, we have but 565 on the roll. It will thus be seen that Dr. Weddell planted, like Paul of old, and that Mr. Burton and Mr. Goodwin watered and God gave the increase, and we rejoice in the fact that Old St. John's, that has experienced so many mutations and has known so many vicissitudes of fortune, fire and war, time and change, storm and tempest, has Phœnix-like survived them all and stands to-day clothed in her chaste and comely garment of spotless white, amidst her green setting, old in years and yet young and vigorous in good works! St. John's, the Mother Church of the Parish, and the Mother of Missions, has again and again been bereft of her children. At periods of her history it is true her doors have been closed, no voice was heard from her pulpit, no songs or chants echoed within her silent and hallowed precincts. Her walls have reverberated to the mad shouts of a brutal foe, who laid his sacrilegious hand upon her sacred altar. Twice has her tower been dismantled by storm and tempest, but she has not been left desolate nor comfortless nor forsaken. The places of those who have passed away or moved to other sections of our city have been supplied by others, and we rejoice in the fact that to-day she is stronger spiritually and materially than at any period in her history. She is still the shrine at which worshippers assemble to pay that homage to Deity that is essential to civilization, good morals and just government. She is still the Mecca to which pilgrims travelling from after turn to draw fresh inspiration, and the spot where patriotism delights to point as the place where the fires of liberty were lighted. The fact that this old Church has survived so many disasters and mutations is the best evidence that she has been under God's special care. The fire upon the altar at times burned low, and the glory above the mercy seat had almost departed, but His Shechinah still dwelt among His people. In her old age she has been thrice blessed; the three ministers who have for the last quarter of a century presided over her destinies have so endeared themselves to the people of old St. John's that in their hearts they are known as Weddell, the lamented; Burton, the beloved; and Goodwin, the faithful. The individuality of these three faithful ministers has been such as to warrant at least in the heart of the writer the above appellations—not that either would be the less lamented had he been taken from us as Dr. Weddell was, nor that they were not all beloved and all equally faithful in the performance of their duties, but each possessed sui generis, certain qualities of mind and manner, that can only be distinguished by some affectionate cognomen; for we are told: "There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory." The Rev. Lewis William Burton was called to the rectorship of St. John's January 28, 1884, and preached his first sermon on Easter Sunday, April 13, 1884. On assuming charge of St. John's, Mr. Burton, like the general of an army, took his survey of the field of his future operations and laid off his plan of campaign. The problems confronting him were not only those already adverted to, the tendency of the population westward, but he found his territorial responsibility embraced (1) Church Hill; (2) the southernmost portion of Shockoe Valley (say from the river to Broad street, and from Fifteenth street eastward to the foot of Church Hill, and along Main street to Twenty-eighth street); and (3) the parts known as Rocketts and Fulton. These three neighborhoods were so geographically separated that one church building would not suffice them. Those living in the valley were unwilling to climb the hill to attend the old Church. The three neighborhoods were also socially divided. He found a mission established by Dr. Weddell in Shockoe Valley doing good work amongst a class that had no church near them; but recognizing the need of a mission in the section known as Rocketts and Fulton, six months after his arrival he established the enterprise known as the Weddell Mission Sunday School. In 1886 this school had grown to 141 officers, teachers and scholars. He also gave the name of "Calvary" to the mission established by Dr. Weddell in Shockoe Valley at Nineteenth and Main streets, and which was afterwards transferred and maintained for many years, under the charge of Sergeant B. F. Howard, at the old Mason's Hall on Franklin street between Eighteenth and Nineteenth. To assist in these missions the Rev. W. B. Everett, M. D., was made missionary assistant of St. John's in 1885. With Easter, 1885, Mr. Burton instituted a custom which still continues. The four Sunday schools (St. John's, Calvary, Weddell and Good Shepherd) were assembled in the Church; the Good Shepherd (colored school) sitting in the gallery. A printed programme would guide the exercises, some special device would characterize the same; a wooden light-house was built with large blocks; flowers were combined with names or designs, etc., texts or catechism were recited, carols sung, addresses delivered; reports were read by the superintendents of the different schools. These festivals are much enjoyed by the children and the Church is generally packed on these occasions. In 1885 Mr. Burton organized a junior branch of the Parish Brotherhood. When Mr. Burton took charge of St. John's in 1884, he found the church nearly $500 in debt, and at the end of his first year there was also a deficit in current expenses. This unbusiness-like condition confronted him—how to live within the income or how to make the income adequate to the expenses. He determined to attempt the latter solution of the problem by adopting the weekly pledge and envelop system. This plan worked so well that beginning with 1887 the Church not only paid its current expenses, but its contingent fund up to and including the year 1893, the last year of his pastorate. Mr. Burton is an admirable financier, and would make a good banker or a successful business man in any line. In 1886 the alms basin now in use and formerly belonging to Old Westover Church was bought and presented to St. John's by Edmund A. Saunders and Richard L. Brown in behalf of their little daughters, Mamie and Bessie, and is so inscribed in large letters punctuated by a cross pattee around the rim. On the base of the plate is the following original inscription, "Ex dono D'nae—Sarah Braine," and a hall mark, indicating its origin—1694-1695. In the centre of the basin is an ingenious monogram in script letters two and a half inches long, which spells out the name of Sarah Braine. The rim of the basin is in simple repousse work, of what might be called pie crust shape. In June, 1886, the Vestry determined to restore the sound board to its place. It had been taken down years before, and had been lying in the Brick School-House. It was placed in its present position and the pulpit steps were placed on either side of the panel and pulpit. In order to restore the sound board it was sent to a furniture establishment. In grinding through the successive layers of graining and through a coat of white paint and gold to the original wood, was found the design of a circle with inlaid nose, eyes and mouth, and with rays (also inlaid) diverging from it, alternately waving and straight. This old sound board that drank in the eloquence of Henry, and has heard the voices of so many who have ministered to the congregation assembled in Old St. John's now stands as it did originally. In 1886 Mr. Burton tried the experiment of a cornetist in the choir, with such gratifying results that it was continued during his entire incumbency. Under the inspiration of Mr. Burton's ministrations, the spirit of improvement took possession of the congregation, and extensive repairs were made both to the exterior and the interior of the old Church. The ceiling and walls were calcimined in colors, with simple ornamentations, the chancel richly decorated, the wood and pews revarnished, the chancel platform raised; the position of the gates in the rail were changed to their present position. The Vestry room was renovated and made comfortable and convenient. New carpets were laid on the floor, and, in fact, so many changes were made that one of the most venerable and respected parishioners said when the changes were contemplated, that "this Colonial Church in colors would look like a highly ornamented bonnet on an old lady's head," but the result was so satisfactory that all agreed, including the person who made the remark, that the change was for the better. At this time Captain John A. Curtis and wife presented a new communion table, and Mr. and Mrs. E. A. Saunders a prayer desk. These improvements cost about $1,000. At a meeting of the Vestry in March, 1887, it was decided that so much of the gallery as lay east of the organ (which was then in the gallery) be set apart for colored people. On the 4th of June, 1887, a great sorrow came upon our beloved rector and his wife; their only child, a beautiful and promising boy, who had been born to them in the rectory June 10, 1885, Lewis James Hendree Burton, was folded in the arms of the Good Shepherd. In their deep distress the rector and his wife had the heartfelt sympathy, not only of the congregation, but of the entire community. On January 5, 1888, the Rev. Pike Powers, D. D., was called to become the assistant minister of St. John's, in charge of Weddell Memorial Chapel. One characteristic of St. John's since its revival under the lamented Weddell has been its deep interest in missionary work. It is not only the Mother Church of the Parish, but the mother and founder of missions. Weddell Memorial Chapel was completed and open for services the first time November 20, 1887. Previous to the building of the chapel the mission had been conducted in other buildings. The first communion occurred December 18, 1887. The entire cost, not including the land and other things donated, was a little over $4,000, and in January, 1889, the chapel was out of debt; and in the following month of March it was consecrated by the Rt. Rev. F. M. Whittle. One of the lots upon which Weddell was built was donated by the open-handed and liberal hearted P. H. Mayo, Esq. In May, 1882, that saintly soul, Mrs. James M. Estes, now gone to her reward, began a mission Sunday school for colored children in a basement room of her residence. The first attendants were four small boys, but the room soon filled, and the school was removed to the Brick School-House in the Church yard. One hundred scholars were soon enrolled. Owing to the sickness of Dr. Weddell the school waned, and after his death it was disbanded. In the fall of 1884, under the rectorship of the Rev. L. W. Burton, the school was reorganized under the name of the Good Shepherd, and met in the Brick School-House. In 1885 the enrollment was, officers, teachers and scholars, 133. In January, 1887, it had increased to 148. This good work had so grown under Mr. Burton's indefatigable efforts that in January, 1889, fifty applicants had been turned away for lack of teachers and room. Realizing the necessity for larger accommodations for mission work among the colored people, upon the suggestion of Mr. Burton to Mr. E. A. Saunders, who was always ready and willing to respond to appeals of this character, a lot on Twenty-eighth street between L and M was cheerfully donated by him and his wife, and the chapel on this lot was given the name of "Good Shepherd." The building on this lot was formerly St. James', in St. Peter's Parish, New Kent county, Virginia, which stood on the land of Mrs. Sally D. Duval. This lady and Mrs. E. T. Drew were the sole surviving members of St. James', and they were about to leave the county. The church was rapidly falling to decay and would go with the land when sold, and Mrs. Duval desired to see the building utilized by the Church which had erected it. Moreover, it had been built under the rectorship of Mrs. Drew's first husband, the Rev. John T. Points, who had died as the rector of St. John's. Thus his first and last labors would be brought together. It was thus presented to St. John's Church, and was transferred to the lot upon which it now stands. The removal and transfer of the building cost, not including the furniture, about $900. This building was open for service October 7, 1888. While the building stood in the county of New Kent, some of the pew ends had been appropriated for head boards for the graves of soldiers. When restored to their place in the church at Richmond, the epitaphs rudely carved upon them were allowed to remain. It was especially through the interest of Miss Julia C. Emery, General Secretary of the Woman's Auxiliary, who secured in April, 1889, $300 from the "Society of the Double Temple" of New York, that the indebtedness involved in erecting this chapel was paid. The Chapel of the Good Shepherd was consecrated by the Rt. Rev. F. M. Whittle, the Rev. James B. Funsten preaching the sermon; the rector, the assistant minister, Rev. Pike Powers, and the rector's brother-in-law, the Rev. Arthur M. Backus, of the Diocese of Massachusetts, were present. Bishop Whittle, in his Council address, 1889, in speaking of churches consecrated, made the following remarks: "In 1889, March 31st, Weddell Memorial Chapel, a very pretty and comfortable building in Fulton, a neglected suburb of the city of Richmond.* * * "May 5th, Chapel of the Good Shepherd, a very nice and comfortable church for colored people, also belonging to St. John's, Richmond. This chapel is the outgrowth of a Sunday school commenced by a devoted lady in her kitchen, who has now the happiness of seeing a flourishing school and the church services regularly conducted in a suitable and sacred building." Mr. Burton was never satisfied unless he was continually progressing. The establishment of two missions in a field where none before had existed would have satisfied an ordinary mind, but his active brain and zealous heart and consecrated life, whose motto was "Onward, Christian Soldier," were not content unless he was continually advancing the banner of the Cross. Under a strong appeal preached December 18, 1887, from the text (Mark 13: 34), "To every man his work," the various voluntary organizations of the Church were banded and united together in a St. John's Union. Its motto was, "Laborers together with God"; its principle, "To every man his work." At the annual meetings the various organizations composing the Union submitted their reports for the year. Included within the Union were the choir and the Sunday schools as institutions belonging to the spiritual administration of the rector. There was a pleasant emulation and an individuality about these organizations that made them vie with each other in showing good results, that added a zest to their labors, and made them work more effectively and efficiently. With all his other work our beloved rector also found time one night in each week to teach a Bible class to aid the teachers in preparations for their instruction. With his own hand he prepared and had printed service leaflets containing selections from the Book of Common Prayer and from the Hymnal for the use of the Sunday schools. Under his administration not only were the home schools self-supporting, but, in addition, missionary scholarships were sustained as follows: The Eliza Carrington Scholarship, the Solomon Memorial Scholarship, and St. John's Sunday school also united with those of the Diocese in the support of diocesan missions during Lent. The organizations combined in the Church Union at the latter's organization were: The Brotherhood, devoted to parochial, benevolent and missionary work. The Sisterhood, devoted to parochial, benevolent and general missionary work. The Guild, devoted to parochial, charitable work, particularly the clothing of destitute Sunday school children. The Little Gleaners, devoted especially to missionary work in all departments, and incidentally to ministering to the needy in the parish. The Knights of Temperance, devoted to sobriety among young men and boys. Of the five organizations above mentioned, all except the Knights of Temperance had been started under Dr. Weddell's ministry. When it is remembered that most of these organizations met weekly, and that the rector was frequently present at their meetings, some idea may be formed of his busy life and the great tax upon his time and energy. Not satisfied with these various societies, another organization, called the Junior Aid Society, was instituted in 1890, under the auspices of the rector's charming and devoted wife. This society was composed of young ladies who stood between the Little Gleaners and the Guild, and, in addition to the parochial work, supported by their industry a scholarship at Cape Mount, Africa, and also assumed the rent of an aged and faithful, but indigent member of the congregation. Again, in 1901, did our rector show his zeal in good works by establishing the St. John's Chapter of St. Andrew's Brotherhood. Still another organization came into existence in 1893, entitled St. John's Missionary Association. In addition to these various organizations of the Mother Church, the missions also had their appropriate societies, at which the rector was sometimes present, he being ex-officio chairman of all of these organizations. In addition to the above societies, there were Committees on the Sick, a Committee on Burials, a Committee on Church Decency and Order, and a Committee on Strangers and Absentees, and a Charitable Committee, which was the first formed, and one of the most important; the objects and aims of these various committees are indicated by their respective names. It would not do to fail to mention in connection with these Church committees the "Committee on Entertainments," of which Mrs. R. L. Brown was chairman, a position for which she was exceptionally fit; by these entertainments considerable sums of money were raised for paying church debts and making improvements and for charitable and pious work. The character of the entertainments was always simple, refined, elevating and instructive, and promoted good fellowship and friendly intercourse amongst the congregation, and enabled many persons who were not pecuniarily able to contribute to the support of the Church to utilize their time and services in her behalf. Besides the entertainments, where cream and cake and oysters and coffee in season were sold at moderate prices, there were birthday offerings, excursions, lectures, etc. Through these instrumentalities the hungry were fed, the naked clothed, and the poor had the Gospel preached to them. As an evidence of the appreciation the Vestry had for these entertainments, the following preamble and resolutions were unanimously adopted on the 4th day of October, 1890: Whereas the Committee on Sociability and Entertainments of St. John's Church Union, together with the other members of the Church and friends outside, have within the last two years, by two large entertainments, requiring most skilful management and indefatigable labor, contributed upwards of $2,000 for the payment of debts and improvement of buildings; therefore be it 1. Resolved, That we, the Vestry of St. John's, do cordially acknowledge the peculiar ability of the committee in making a success of church entertainments, and do most heartily thank them and all their co-laborers for their great and kindly help. 2. Resolved, That the rector be requested to read this, our action, to the Church Union at its next meeting; and that the Register of the Vestry be also requested to spread the same on the minutes of the Vestry. In these entertainments objectionable features were eschewed and they were not only exceedingly popular with our congregation, but deservedly so with the community at large. In these amusements the wife of the rector was the soul and the spirit. By her charming manner and pleasant address she was indeed a help-meet and an inspiration not only to her husband, but to the congregation. It would seem almost impossible for one man to attend to all the above enumerated functions, preach three times a week, visit the sick, and attend to all parochial duties, and yet Mr. Burton did all this, and in addition served on the Executive Committee of the American Church Missionary Society, and was a representative of the Church Temperance Society of the Diocese of Virginia, and was Vice-President of the Richmond Protestant Episcopal Missionary Society, as well as a member of the Executive Committee of the Diocesan Missionary Society; a member of the Standing Committee of the Council on Church Property, and examining chaplain of the Diocese. With all these multifarious duties and responsibilities, is it any wonder our beloved rector's hair became prematurely gray? "But not with years, Nor grew it white, In a single night," but gradually as his cares and labors increased, until it is as white as the driven snow, but his face is still young, his step elastic, and his eye as bright as of yore. The Vestry purchased the present rectory, then in the occupancy of Mr. Burton, in April, 1888, at a cost of $3,100; it was fitted up in a convenient and attractive manner for the use of the rector and his wife, at an additional cost of about $1,600. The old parsonage on Twentieth street was sold the same year for $3,250, therefore there was nearly an exchange in money value. In May, 1887, the Vestry gave to Mr. R. L. Brown and the rector permission to occupy, each of them, one of the window frames on either side of the chancel and within it with a stained glass memorial window. The one on the right was erected to the little boy of the rector, Lewis James Hendree; the one on the left was erected to the two little children of Mr. R. L. Brown. In November of the same year (1888) the memorial window to the late Allen Y. Stokes was placed. Mr. Stokes was for many years a communicant and Vestryman of St. John's. Owing to the weakness of the tower and the supposed effect upon the tunefulness of the organ, which was at that time situated in the gallery, the bell was tolled and not rung with but one exception during the entire rectorship of Mr. Burton. The organ was moved to the main floor of the church under Mr. Goodwin's administration, and since that time its joyous peals and clear notes ring forth to gladden the hearts of the community. The old bell that formerly hung upon St. John's and known as the "Henry Bell," was for many years in use in the town of Martinsville, Va., and called the children to the public schools. It was donated by the town to the Virginia Historical Society, of this city, and is now in their possession. This famous bell called together the Virginia Convention of March, 1775, and beneath it Patrick Henry made his liberty speech. On June 5, 1888, it was ordered by the Vestry that the approach to the communion rail and kneeling at it by the communicants should be made easier and more dignified by removing one of the front pews of the transept rows that flank the chancel on either side, and by replacing it by an upright panel. At this time the arrangement, which still continues, was made as to the manner in which the communicants should come to the Lord's Table and retire from it. Those first to commune were to come from the western aisle and remain till all then kneeling had communicated; and while they were retiring those from the eastern aisle could come without collision. During the year of 1891 a valuable addition was made to the communion vessels by the bequest of $100 by Miss Nannie M. Sheilds, a faithful and lamented parishioner. Through her sister, Miss Cornelia R. Sheilds, was purchased a solid silver chalice and paten, which formerly belonged to an old James River Parish. The chalice is of unusual size, ten and three-eighths inches high, its cup four and a half inches deep. The old chalice to which it became a companion is seven and six-eighths inches in height, with a cup three and six-eighths inches in depth. The paten is seven inches in depth. Both are engraved with a design somewhat similar to that discovered in repairing the sound board—alternate straight and curved rays. In the centre of the design upon these silver cups is the monogram I. H. S., superimposed upon what seems to be an Archbishop's crozier. The hall mark indicated them to be upwards of a century old. In 1892 ventilators were introduced in the ceiling. In the same year Mr. L. Stern presented the Church with a handsome clock, and Mr. Peyton R. Carrington, with his wife, Mrs. Sarah J. Carrington, presented the Church with two handsome hymn tablets, which were placed upon the south wall in the centre panel on either side of the chancel. On the 29th of February, 1892, under the auspices of the Committee on Church Decency and Order, a brass font ewer was purchased. An overhanging sycamore tree had been largely responsible for rotting the shingles of the Church roof. Permission was obtained from the city authorities to cut it down. It was a sad though necessary sacrifice to make to the far more important welfare of the Church building. It was one of the most beautiful, largest and oldest trees in the Church yard. It stood close to the northeast corner of the Church. Its branches hung over the portion in which Patrick Henry spoke. It was certainly a good sized tree in his day. It was older than any portion of the Church. If its leaves could have heard, its heart remembered and its branches whispered to us of the burning words it heard that day, and of the knots of patriots that gathered under its shadow at that time to discuss with bated breath the questions of that eventful period! Its trunk averaged four feet in diameter; its age was estimated at 170 years. Grasped in its gnarled roots was a skull, face downward, which certain Hamlets standing around declared to be an Indian's, and perhaps apostrophized, as the Prince of Denmark did poor Yorick's. Sentiment, feeling, appealed in vain to the woodmen to spare that tree. The wood from this tree was preserved for souvenirs. It was made into canes and crosses and sold to the thousands of tourists who visited the old Church, and nearly $200 was realized from these sales. Some idea may be formed of the number of visitors when it is stated by the keeper that from 1888 to 1891 there were 11,924 visiting the old Church. The wear and tear upon the carpet of the Church was considerable; one eager souvenir collector was detected tearing off a scrap of the cushion in "Patrick Henry's pew." Finally an alms box for the benefit of the missions of St. John's was conspicuously placed in the pew during week days. It was observed by the sexton that itinerant patriots and prying antiquarians were noticeably less eager to be able to say that they had stood where Henry stood, and indeed often gave but a passing glance to this sacred spot, when the shrewd cicerone, in pointing it out, directed his finger at the alms box. In 1889 the city lowered the grade of Twenty-fourth street, involving the removal of between six and eight feet in the middle of the square between Broad and Grace streets, building a new brick wall on that side, surmounted with a tasteful iron railing. The yard was graded down to it. This closed the entrance to the Church yard, which had been its west side. The steps and gate were removed to Grace street near the corner of Twenty-fourth, so as to be convenient for access to the brick chapel, and so as to afford to those coming from the southwest a more direct approach to the Church. Afterwards the wall on Broad street was lowered and improved in the same way, affording a better view of the Church from the street. The northern half of the burying ground belongs to the city; the southern half to the congregation. The control of the whole is vested in the city. The buildings, except the keeper's lodge, are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the congregation. The City Council annually appoints a Committee on St. John's Burying Ground, and appropriates regularly a sum for the keeper's salary and another for the maintenance of the grounds. In 1889 the Brick School-House was put in thorough repair and was used during Mr. Burton's rectorship as now for the Primary Sunday School, for the meetings of the Vestry and some of the societies, committee meetings, etc. In 1892 the frame school building was repaired and enlarged to its present dimensions at a cost of about $1,000. We now again take up the story of the missions. The Rev. W. B. Everett, M. D., served as assistant minister from February 18, 1885, to March 19, 1886; the Rev. Pike Powers, D. D., from January 5, 1888, to June 30, 1890; the Rev. C. R. Kuyk, from October 6, 1891, to June 15, 1893; the Rev. J. H. Burkhead, from May 7, 1895, to June 1, 1897; the Rev. E. B. Snead, from February 1, 1900, to June 15, 1903. In 1891 the Sunday school at Weddell had increased to 200 scholars. Nine years after Calvary Mission was started, Sergeant B. F. Howard, superintendent, reported 183 children as having joined St. John's Sunday school during this period, and sixty-three from its neighborhood as having united with St. John's. The conditions that called for the establishment of Calvary Mission having ceased to exist, this mission was discontinued in 1902. At the time this enterprise was started by Dr. Weddell there was no mission or church in that immediate vicinity. Some years ago the Presbyterians built at the corner of Nineteenth and Franklin the beautiful little brick church known as the Hoge Memorial. More recently the Methodist Church established a mission in the old building, formerly known as the Union Hotel, at the corner of Nineteenth and Main streets. These two enterprises filled the place and supplied the needs of the people in this neighborhood so that Calvary Mission was no longer necessary. Not only did St. John's prosper in a material sense under the admirable and efficient rectorship of Mr. Burton, but two especial seasons of spiritual revival in St. John's congregation were vouchsafed us by God's Holy Spirit. A series of meetings in conjunction with the Rev. John B. Newton, rector of Monumental Church, were held by the rector in 1887; these meetings were held nightly, and were attended by a large and deeply affected congregation. Again in 1891, the rector, assisted by Dr. Newton and the Rev. H. M. Jackson, the rector of Grace Church, awakened great interest; many souls were gathered into the fold as a result of these two especial revivals. In January, 1893, the hour of service was changed from 8 o'clock at night to 5 P. M., which still continues. These services are much better attended and are more popular than were the nightly services. Three unusual services belong to the period which we are now covering. On February 5, 1889, the rector arranged with the Vestry for a service, to be held in St. John's Church April 30th following, commemorative of the centennial of the inauguration of George Washington as first President of the United States. The service was held in response to the proclamation of the President and the Governor of Virginia. It was felt that no place for such a service could be more fitting than old St. John's. The Episcopal clergy of the city of Richmond and Manchester not only participated, but also united in an urgent printed invitation to the congregations and to the brethren of the different denominations to attend. It was on a Tuesday at 8:15 P. M. that the service was held. A printed order of service was prepared by the rector, with the approval of Bishop Whittle, copying a form compiled by Dean, afterwards Bishop, Hale, which was as nearly as possible a reproduction of that used by Bishop Prevoost when, 6 after the inaugural exercises in New York, the President proceeded on foot to St. Paul's Church, and the Bishop of New York, as chaplain of the Senate, there conducted services. An impressively eloquent sermon was preached by Bishop Randolph. Fourth of July services were held in St. John's in 1890, on Friday, at 10 A. M., in response to a suggestion by the public press. It was urged by the rector as a means of promoting sectional harmony, as the associations both of the Fourth of July and St. John's Church belong to a common noble past; but being obliged to leave the city because of recent sickness in his family, the Rev. J. B. Funsten, rector of Christ's Church, generously accepted the chairmanship of the Committee on Arrangements. The address was delivered by Rev. W. W. Landrum, D. D., of the Second Baptist church, in Richmond, and was pronounced by those who heard it to be characteristically bright and able as well as appropriate. On June 10, 1891, there was a memorable celebration of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the erection of St. John's Church. The Vestry and the congregation united with the rector in elaborate and extensive preparations. The Bishops manifested their deep sympathy. The clergy and Vestries of all the other churches in the Parish of Henrico and those of Meade Memorial Church, Manchester, were invited. The Governor and officers of the State government, the Mayor, City Council and the municipal officers had seats reserved for them. A souvenir programme, containing the services prepared by the rector based upon the office for the consecration of churches, was approved by the Bishop of the Diocese and handsomely printed. It contained on the front of its enamelled cover a wood cut of the Church and yard from a photograph taken by Mr. W. W. Davies, of the Lee Gallery. As an appropriate memorial of the occasion, the Vestry determined to purchase the handsome lectern that now ornaments the Church. It was suitably inscribed: "A Thank-offering to God by the Congregation, on the 150th Anniversary of the erection of St. John's Church, Richmond, Virginia, June 10th, 1741-1891." It was sincerely meant by the people of the congregation to be a testimonial to their gratitude for His signal mercies so long bestowed upon St. John's. It was duly in its place on the appointed day, and upon it lay a new and handsome Bible, presented by Captain and Mrs. Cyrus Bossieux. Bishop Whittle, in reply to the application of the rector, declared that his pastoral as to the use of flowers in the churches of Virginia did not refer to sesqui-centennials, and the ladies tastefully decorated the Church. The Bishops and clergy vested in the robing room and were led by the Wardens and Vestrymen of St. John's and by the other Vestries of the Parish and of Manchester to the front doors of the Church. There the two Bishops entered first, each of them by one of the aisles, Bishop Whittle to the right and Bishop Randolph to the left, leading the clergy, who divided in following them, in antiphonal reading of the 24th Psalm. The Rt. Rev. H. M. Jackson, D. D., Bishop Coadjutor of Alabama, was also present on the occasion. The service was read impressively by the Bishop of the Diocese; the sermon, a powerful and telling one, was delivered by the Assistant Bishop. In the evening, after appropriate services provided for in the souvenir programme, a carefully prepared address was delivered by the Hon. Wm. Wirt Henry, a grandson of him who had given special historical distinction to the spot. Mr. Henry led before the congregation in animated procession the chief men of his grandfather's time, whose bodies were now lying in the Church yard. The congregations on both occasions were such as to justify the preparations. And the occasion, worthily commemorating the erection of the Church building, made that fane even more important and sacred and dear in the estimation of the people of Richmond. Growing out of the interest thus quickened, Mr. Joseph W. Johnston presented to the Church a Bible and Prayer Book printed in 1770. Mr. Burton had his convictions and was firm in the maintenance of the principles of the Church. With him there was no compromise with evil, and yet he was not conceited or self-opinionated. He did not think "he knew it all." He not only did not deprecate, but encouraged well meant and friendly criticism. On several occasions the writer took the liberty of commenting on his discourses; sometimes he agreed and at other times he differed with him, but he always received Mr. Burton's thanks and his assurance that the criticisms were not only helpful, but encouraging. He liked to know the opinions of thoughtful people of his efforts. Any comments made by his hearers were not deemed presumptuous if made in the proper spirit, but were appreciated and received prompt and courteous acknowledgment. It is said that death always chooses a shining mark, and it is equally as true in regard to Church "calls." In May, 1893, it was whispered that our rector had a "call"; it was soon ascertained that he had had two calls. Hope and doubt, fear and trust beset our minds; an air of sadness, of expectation, of subdued excitement pervaded our congregation. It is true that theoretically an Episcopal minister is "called" for life; but if they are called to greener pastures or better prospects, or if they think duty impels them and that they can do more good elsewhere, they always hearken to the "call." These rumors were confirmed when our beloved rector announced at a Vestry meeting held May 11, 1893, the reception of two "calls"—one to Moore Memorial, Richmond, and the other to St. Andrew's, Louisville, Ky. He expressed affection for each Vestryman and for the congregation; spoke of the many ties that bound him to the old Church. No pecuniary consideration entered into the question; he hoped to be governed entirely by a sense of duty. He requested the Vestry to talk freely, and to place before him every argument for remaining, and, above all, to pray. The Vestry exhausted every argument in their power and expressed in warmest terms their sincere affection, giving reasons from their standpoint why he should remain. On the afternoon of May 15, 1893, the ladies of St. John's congregation met at the "Old Carrington Mansion," the residence of Mrs. A. W. Weddell, and one hundred and seventy-five names were signed to a touching address asking Mr. Burton not to leave. On May 17th a meeting of the congregation was held in the Church to give them an opportunity to express their views and feelings in regard to the matter; whereupon a committee was appointed, consisting of J. S. Moore, F. P. Gretter, D. C. Richardson, F. J. Craigie, and George L. Currie, which presented the following resolutions, which were unanimously adopted, and it was further ordered, "That the secretary be requested to send a copy thereof to the rector, who was then absent at Winchester, Va., and to enter a copy of the same on the Church records, according to custom, and to publish the same in the Southern Churchman": "It having come to the knowledge of this congregation that our beloved rector, Rev. Lewis William Burton, has received a most flattering call to St. Andrew's Church, in Louisville, Ky., and has the same under present consideration, we desire hereby to express our sincere affection for him personally, and our hearty appreciation of his earnest and devoted consecration of time and talents to this congregation and community, as well as to every good work in this city and the Diocese of Virginia. Confident that in reaching a decision upon this most important question our beloved rector will be actuated only by a high sense of duty as to where lies his field of greater usefulness, we would place before him in detail the great work that by the blessing of Almighty God he has conducted with such signal success— 1. The congregation of old St. John's has been growing steadily under his faithful ministry. 2. A flourishing mission in Fulton, known as Weddell Memorial Mission. 3. A mission in the Valley, known as Calvary Mission. 4. A colored mission, known as the Good Shepherd Mission. 5. His position as Vice-President of the Richmond City Missionary Society. 6. His position as one of the examining chaplains of the Diocese of Virginia. 7. His prominence in the James River Convocation. 8. His position and relations to the clergy of the city, both in our Church and those of other denominations. 9. The high estimation in which he is held by the community at large. Believing that there can be no broader field for his faithful labors, and none where they can be more needed or more highly appreciated, we trust that he may be so guided by the Holy Spirit that he may still find his path of duty to lie in our midst, and we pledge our continued and increased efforts to the upholding of his hands in his many and arduous duties. [Signed] J. S. Moore, F. P. Gretter, D. C. Richardson, F. J. Craigie, Geo. L. Currie, Committee. To these public protests were added the pleadings of individuals—many of them special friends. The difficulty of our rector's deciding as to the course of duty and the pain in determining to remove from St. John's cannot well be imagined. In the mean time hope and doubt beset the congregation. It was with no little apprehension and anxiety that the congregation assembled on Sunday, May 21, 1893, when our beloved rector, with a care-worn face, showing the great strain he had undergone, announced his text (I. Samuel 20: 22, 23): "Go thy way; for the Lord hath sent thee away. And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold the Lord be between thee and me forever." The fear, the premonition of our loss, was confirmed, and before the sermon was ended tears, from eyes not accustomed to weep, could be seen trickling down the cheeks of many present. The congregation accepted the inevitable, fully satisfied that our rector had been influenced and actuated solely by his sense of duty. The bond of sympathy, the ties of affection, of congeniality and spirituality were at last to be severed. It was deeply affecting when each in turn the congregation approached the chancel and shook his hand and bade him good-bye; but the affection and regard in which Mr. Burton is held by the congregation of St. John's Church has been strongly evinced since he left us. At a meeting held on the 14th of October, 1894, a committee was appointed to "draft resolutions expressive of the sympathy of the Church with its former beloved rector, who had recently been called to mourn the death of his honored father." At a meeting of the Vestry held December 10, 1895, the Vestry tendered "their heartfelt congratulations to Rev. Lewis William Burton on his election to the Bishopric of the Diocese of Lexington, Ky." At a meeting of the Vestry held May 5, 1896, and again October 4, 1896, motions were offered and unanimously carried "cordially inviting Rt. Rev. Lewis William Burton to visit and preach at our Church at any time that it may suit his convenience." Since Mr. Burton has left us he has on two occasions accepted these invitations. He has on each of these occasions been welcomed with open heart and outstretched arms and with a love that can only be severed by death, and that will linger in the countless realms of eternity. To sum up Mr. Burton's administration, when he came to St. John's, 1884, he found the Church not only in debt, but its revenues insufficient to meet current expenses. He found that the contingent fund had not been paid in full for some years. He established two thriving and prosperous missions. When he left us the Church was entirely out of debt, the contingent fund fully paid up, and the congregation largely increased in numbers. Mr. Burton, in his "Succession of Ministers of Henrico Parish," has an interregnum of sixty-six years between Thos. Bargrave and James Blair, and one of thirty-five years between George Robinson and James Keith. These hiatuses, we think, are partially filled by the records from Henrico county court-house. The records show that previous to 1716, one, the Rev. Jacob Ware, was minister of Henrico Parish for a period of twenty years. The same records also show that in 1701 Claude Philippe de Richebourg* * C. Philippe de Richebourg was minister in charge of the Huguenot Church at Manakin Town, on James river, 1707-1711. is mentioned as minister of Henrico Parish. The Rev. William Fenney or Finney is also mentioned as minister of Henrico Parish, June 5, 1727; the last named was an M. A. of Glasgow University. The Rev. R. A. Goodwin, of Petersburg, was called to St. John's Church by the Vestry June 8, 1893. Mr. Goodwin accepted the call June 19, 1893, to assume the rectorship on the 15th of September next, on which date he assumed charge of St. John's, where he has been and is now laboring faithfully and efficiently in the cause of Christ. His interest in the missions established by Mr. Burton has manifested itself in earnest zeal and untiring efforts. In fact, he took up the entire work of the Church just where Mr. Burton left off, and the spiritual and material welfare and machinery of the Church has known no diminution or change. His faithfulness at the bedside of the sick, his constant attendance and sympathy when in trouble amongst the bereaved, who have been bowed down with grief, has been one of the characteristics of his personality and his ministerial functions. His earnestness, his thorough consecration to duty, his sincere piety have endeared him to old St. John's, and have bound him to the congregation with the strongest ties of respect and affection. One of the first suggestions made by Mr. Goodwin to the Vestry was one looking to the establishment of a permanent endowment fund for the support of missions, which, however, has only met with partial success. It was also at his suggestion and urgent appeal in 1895 that a deaconess was employed (the first in the history of the Church in Virginia), whose duty is to visit the poor and the sick of the parish, to make known their necessities and minister to their wants, all which has resulted in much good and has been of material assistance to him in his labors. Bishop Whittle thought so well of this appointment that in his report to the Council in 1897, he says: "In St. John's Church, Richmond, I had the great satisfaction of setting apart Miss Mary E. Jones for the office and work of a deaconess, she being the first of this order in the Diocese; the service was most solemn and impressive." The memorial tablet that now hangs on the walls of the Church to the Rev. Robert Rose was placed with consent of the Vestry by his lineal descendants in February, 1894. The organ, which for many years stood in the gallery of the Church, was moved to the main floor of the Church in June, 1894. A legacy for Weddell mission, amounting to $739.54, from the late W. J. Cussens, of Richmond, was received June 6, 1894, by the Vestry; the amount left by his will was $1,000, but as some of his heirs were not of age and the adult legatees tendered this amount in settlement, sooner than resort to litigation, the Vestry accepted this amount and the trustees were authorized to expend $39.54 of this sum on Weddell Chapel, and to invest the remainder at interest. At a meeting of the Vestry held October 2, 1894, the following letter was read and entered on the minutes: 31 West 33d St., New York,Sept. 14, 1894. To the Vestry of St. John's Episcopal Church, Richmond, Va.: Gentlemen,—On November 26, 1881, a tombstone by Messrs. Rogers &amp; Miller, of your city, was placed, at my request and expense, in St. John's Church yard to mark the grave of Governor John Page, of Virginia. It is near the south entrance to the Church. Without my knowledge or instruction (until I heard of it too late) a so-called coat-of-arms was made on the tombstone, a thing as ridiculous as it is incorrect. The foot-stone was also placed at the side of the walk instead of in it, with the initials facing the iron railing on Grace street, instead of facing the head piece. I respectfully and earnestly request that your honorable body allow and authorize me to make the proper corrections in the matter in the presence of witnesses, if necessary. Respectfully submitted, (Signed) Richard Channing Moore Page, M. D. P. S.—I respectfully refer you to Major John Page, at Beaver Dam P. O., Hanover county, Va. The Vestry having no authority over the grounds, no action was taken except to acknowledge the letter, and to suggest to Mr. Page that he apply to the Council Committee on St. John's Church Yard. A called meeting of the Vestry was held after morning service Sunday, September 1, 1895, and suitable resolutions adopted expressing the sympathy of the Vestry and congregation with our bereaved pastor in his deep affliction, occasioned by the death of his beloved wife. As an evidence of the affection in which our pastor's wife was held, an endowment fund of $200, to be known as a memorial to Mrs. Mary E. Goodwin, was raised by the congregation and turned over to the trustees for investment. December 10th of the same year, Miss Emma Lacy requested that she or her administrator be allowed to place a memorial window in St. John's Church to her parents and brother, to cost not less than $500, subject, "The Transfiguration," which was granted on condition that the design be first approved by the rector and Vestry. Subsequently the family of Mr. James W. Shields, for many years a Vestryman and Senior Warden of the Church, made a similar request, which was granted on the same conditions. At a meeting of the Vestry held June 2, 1896, a letter was received from Lewis H. Blair, Thomas M. Rutherfoord and A. Beirne Blair, grandsons of Geddes Winston, requesting permission "to replace the present tombstone erected to their ancestor, Geddes Winston, who died June 9, 1784, * * which is about to fall to pieces from age." This letter was referred to the Council Committee on St. John's Church Yard. The spire of St. John's Church having been blown down by the hurricane that passed over the city Tuesday night, September 29, 1896, at a meeting of the Vestry held October 6th, it was resolved that a tower similar to the one shown in a picture in the possession of Mr. W. W. Davies be erected (this being the original tower), and this tower to be surmounted by a cross. It was also resolved at this meeting that the Vestry be constituted a committee with the assistance of the presidents of the various societies of the Church to solicit subscriptions to build the tower called for by the resolutions of the Vestry. It was not only decided to replace the steeple, but to paint the interior and the exterior of the Church, also to take out the lights in the windows and replace the same with cathedral glass. The following is the report of the committee: To the Vestry of St. John's Church: As chairman of the Committee on Repairs of St. John's Church, I have the honor to submit the following report: On the night of the 29th of September last our city was visited by one of the most terrific wind storms ever known in this vicinity. Trees that had long stood the storms of many years were uprooted, houses unroofed, telegraph and telephone poles blown down, steeples tottered and fell, and great alarm and uneasiness was felt throughout the whole city. When the sun rose next morning a scene of desolation and wreck met the eye everywhere. Our tower was dismantled of its steeple, the graves in our church yard encumbered with falling limbs and the walkways strewn with the debris of uprooted trees. Fortunately the steeple fell outward; had it fallen upon or into our sacred old building, it would have crushed it to atoms, but an All-Wise Providence so ruled the storm that our old building was preserved intact. Immediately after the storm our venerable Senior Warden, the late James W. Shields, who has now gone to his eternal rest, was upon the grounds, and by his thoughtful and energetic attention, such temporary repairs were made as the exigencies of the occasion suggested and required. At the regular meeting of the Vestry, the following committee was appointed—viz: Rev. R. A. Goodwin, James W. Shields, Cyrus Bossieux, John F. Mayer, F. J. Craigie, Dr. L. C. Crump, and J. S. Moore. At a subsequent meeting of this committee it organized by the election of J. S. Moore as chairman. This committee was authorized to restore the tower and make such other repairs as it deemed necessary. In addition to the restoration of the tower, your committee was authorized to beautify the Church by substituting stained glass in the windows for the ordinary lights; to have the Church building and the two Sunday school houses repaired and painted. Each member of the Vestry was constituted a committee, with the assistance of such other members of the congregation as might aid in the enterprise, to raise funds for this object. Your committee desire to congratulate the Vestry upon the completion of their labors; they also desire to return thanks to those who have so liberally contributed of their means in the restoration of our house of worship, and unite in asking that our report be received and your committee be discharged. We take pleasure in turning over to you the old Church in its new dress of spotless white, emblematic of that purity of heart and rectitude of life that should actuate and characterize its communicants; your committee also, with, we trust, pardonable pride, calls attention to the beautiful and artistic windows that now ornament our Church, giving it that antique and sacred appearance that befits its ancient and time-honored walls, within whose hallowed precincts so many interesting events have occurred, not only in the history of the Church, but incidents notable and historic in the annals of the Commonwealth and of the nation; for it is well known that St. John's Church, on Richmond Hill, is not only the oldest colonial place of worship in our city, but bears the distinguished honor of having been the place in which the inspiring eloquence of a Henry aroused our people to resistance, which culminated in the birth of a nation! Within its sacred enclosure, "where the rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep," rest many of Virginia's distinguished sons, who there in their last and dreamless sleep await the resurrection morn. When, as is contemplated, our Church shall be further ornamented by the two memorial windows now bespoken, one in honor of our lamented Senior Warden and the other to the memory of the Lacy family, it will add very much to the beauty and harmony of the whole. Your committee desire to call your attention to the fact that in repairing the tower they have dispensed with the steeple that recently adorned it, and have restored this part of our building to the shape and appearance it bore previous to 1863, when the tower was blown down by a high wind. The steeple has been replaced by a cupola, being a fac-simile of the old tower and belfry, modelled from a picture of this ancient edifice kindly loaned by Mr. W. W. Davies. Your committee earnestly trust that our old Church, which is the Mecca at whose shrine so many strangers pay their homage, and within whose walls so many who have passed over the river offered their devotion to Deity, may be spared many years in its ancient form, its simple architecture, its spotless purity, its untarnished reputation, standing as it does within its sacred necropolis, and that it may remain not only to light the beacon torch of liberty to future generations, but may continue as the alma mater of Christian faith noted for its piety, zeal and good works. Respectfully submitted, J. S. Moore, Chairman. In 1898 a special committee was appointed by the Vestry, consisting of Mr. J. S. Moore, Chairman; Cyrus Bossieux, Senior Warden; Captain John F. Mayer, Junior Warden; Dr. L. C. Crump and Mr. F. J. Craigie, to look into the cost of the needed repairs to the Church building, and the putting in of a ventilator, painting, calcimining or frescoing the walls, carpeting the aisles and chancel and varnishing the interior woodwork—the said committee to solicit bids for the proposed improvements and report to the Vestry. Under this resolution the Church was renovated and restored to its present condition. At this time the shingles were removed from the roof and tin substituted. At a meeting of the Vestry held October 4, 1898, resolutions were adopted expressive of sorrow at the death of Mr. E. A. Saunders, "who for many years was connected with this Church as a communicant and Vestryman, in which connection, by his kindness of heart, his personal liberal nature, his sincere piety and devotion to duty, he won our love and esteem." A copy of these resolutions was ordered to be spread upon the minutes and a copy sent to his bereaved wife. At a meeting of the Vestry held January 3, 1899, it was requested that the Brotherhood of St. Andrew of this Church furnish six of its members to act as ushers, to take up collection on Sunday afternoon and at Wednesday night service, the object being to interest young men in Church work. At a meeting of the Vestry March 14, 1899, a committee was appointed "to draft suitable resolutions of respect to our deceased friend and Vestryman, Dr. L. C. Crump," and that a copy of said resolutions be sent to the family and entered upon the minutes, which were adopted. During this year extensive repairs, costing about $1,200, were made to the rectory, rendering it more convenient and comfortable, and enhancing the value of the property. At a meeting of the Vestry November 7, 1899, voluntary pledges for an indefinite period from four persons were made, amounting to $550, to pay the salary of an assistant at Weddell Chapel, and the Committee on Weddell were authorized to employ an assistant minister. At a called meeting of the Vestry November 22, 1899, to consider the resignation of Miss (Bettie) E. A. Fitzwilson, the blind organist, on her proposed removal to New York, the following resolutions, offered by Mr. J. S. Moore, were unanimously adopted: Whereas the Vestry of St. John's P. E. Church is in receipt of the resignation of Miss E. A. Fitzwilson, who has served as organist for more than a quarter of a century: Resolved, That the Vestry with deep regret accepts the same, begging to assure her of our high estimation of her faithful services through so many years, her lofty devotion to duty, her consecration of effort. The magic of her hand, the symphony of her mystic touch, will long linger in our hearts as a pleasant memory, a sacred benison, when her presence is no longer with us. Resolved, That in the sad bereavement (the death of her sister and mother) that has been the occasion of her resignation, the Vestry tenders its sincere and heartfelt sympathy, and indulges the hope, in the providence of God, that in her new home amongst strangers in a strange land a happy future awaits her, and we trust she may find many friends and form pleasant ties and associations that will surround her and guard her with the same watchful care, the same tender affection, cordial appreciation and sincere good-will which she has ever enjoyed with her Richmond friends in old Henrico Parish. Resolved, That these resolutions be entered on the minutes, and a copy of same be duly certified to Miss Fitzwilson under the signature of the rector and register. Minutes on the death of Mrs. Caroline Shields, the wife of our late Senior Warden, James W. Shields, and one of the most faithful workers and liberal contributors to Church work, were made by the Vestry April 3, 1900. Of this saintly soul it was truly said: "She never made a face grow dark, Nor caused a tear save when she died." At a Vestry meeting held January 1, 1901, Mr. J. S. Moore offered the following minute, which was adopted and placed on record: "In sad remembrance of the ending of the nineteenth, and in joyful commemoration of the twentieth century, the rector and Wardens of old St. John's Church had the bell solemnly tolled for five minutes before 12 o'clock on the night of the 31st of December, 1900, and for five minutes after 12 o'clock on the morning of January 1, 1901, it was merrily rung—thus ringing a requiem to the dying year and century, and giving a glad greeting to the new; and as the bell tolled sad and low we could hear it speak in tones reluctant: "Old year, you must not die; You came to us so readily, You lived with us steadily, Old year, you shall not die." But as the solemn sound ceased and the joyous peal thrilled upon the ear expectant, we could hear the old bell singing triumphantly: "There's a new foot on the floor, my friend, And a new face at the door, my friend, A new friend at the door." The Cussen Fund, in 1892, was appropriated to the building of a Sunday school and Guild room on the lot at Weddell Chapel, and to repairs on the chapel. The application, March 31, 1902, of George Pickett Mayo, an old Sunday school scholar of St. John's Church, a candidate for ordination as deacon, was cordially endorsed by the Vestry. A memorial window erected to the memory of the Lacy family by Miss Emma Lacy was placed in St. John's in 1902, and the Shields' window some time prior to this. About this time it was ascertained that the Church tower was in a dangerous condition, and it was ordered taken down and rebuilt. At a meeting of the Vestry after the return of our rector from his summer vacation in 1902, thanks were tendered Mr. F. J. Craigie "for his most efficient and highly enjoyed services rendered as a lay reader at the Sunday morning services during the rector's absence." May 5, 1903, a committee was appointed by the Vestry to express to her sons, Messrs. Joseph H. and James T. Estes, the sorrow of the Vestry at the death of their mother, Mrs. James M. Estes. For many years she was an earnest and faithful Church worker, whose prayers and alms continually went up to her Heavenly Father. At a meeting of the Vestry June 2, 1903, notification was received that Mr. David J. Baldwin, a former communicant of St. John's, had left a bequest to the Church of $500. At this meeting Mr. Guy Christian was engaged to take charge of the work at Weddell Chapel. Allusion has already been made in this sketch to the earnest effort of Mr. Goodwin at the beginning of his ministry in St. John's to raise an endowment fund for missionary work. It is proper just here to insert the splendid circular letter issued by the committee. To the Friends of Old St. John's Church, Richmond, Va.: St. John's is the mother church of Richmond, and of Henrico parish. It was built one hundred and fifty-three years ago, when the Old Dominion owed allegiance to George III., and the Protestant Episcopal Church in Virginia was in the jurisdiction of the Bishop of London. Within its walls was held the Virginia Convention of A. D. 1775; and here Patrick Henry's great oration, which fired the hearts of the people for liberty, was delivered. This Church is thus identified with the history of the Commonwealth and of our whole country. No one can compute what has been done for the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ by the ministers and people who have been identified with St. John's Church during the past one hundred and fifty-three years. In the beautiful graveyard surrounding the Church are buried some who were highly esteemed in Church and State, many who were the honored progenitors of distinguished families, and many others who, though "to fortune and to fame unknown," had their names written in Heaven, and were "rich in good works." There are few Episcopal Churches in Richmond which do not number among their most liberal contributors and most active workers some whose parents were trained in the way of righteousness, or who themselves once worshipped, at Old St. John's. There are many congregations, in this and other States, of which the same is true. This Church has now a larger membership (including her missions), than any other Church in the Diocese of Virginia, but the great majority of these members are poor in this world's goods. To this Church the poor have always been welcomed; and under the leadership of the sainted Weddell and the earnest and energetic Burton, three missions were established, and have been constantly carried on. The tendency for more than a hundred years has been for those blessed with wealth to move from Church Hill; but the number of souls in this part of the city has greatly increased. To help to meet the spiritual needs of the poor on and around Church Hill, our congregation is conducting the missions referred to. Not willing that the good work of our Church shall decrease, and greatly desiring to make our mission work more aggressive, the Vestry has decided to endeavor to secure a partial endowment for St. John's Church. It is proposed to enter in a well-bound book, to be preserved in the archives of the Church, the names of those who contribute to this endowment fund, with the amount given. One contribution has already been made to this fund. It is also proposed to preserve a part of this book for a record of special memorial endowments. A page will be devoted to the memory of the person designated. The amount of the memorial fund will be stated, with the name of the person or persons contributing, and no other entry will be made on that page. The interest only will be used. Such a memorial will last longer than marble, or brass, or stained glass; and will perpetually furnish a fund to carry on the good work which was dear to the hearts of departed saints while they lived here, and is now more precious to them since they see more clearly, in the light of Paradise, the importance of the Lord's work on the earth. Surely there are not a few whose loved ones are buried at St. John's or who have worshipped and labored for Christ there, though they be buried elsewhere, who will be glad to perpetually associate their names with the good work of the Church which they loved, and, at the same time, perpetually help forward the Lord's work. 7 In more than one instance money has been left, by will, to our Church which the Vestry did not receive, because it was not devised according to the laws of the State. Churches are not incorporated under the laws of Virginia, and legal difficulties generally arise when bequests are made to vestries or trustees of Churches. Bequests made to "The Trustees of the Funds of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Virginia" for the sole use and benefit of St. John's Protestant Episcopal Church, Richmond, Va., will be safe, because these trustees are incorporated. It is better to give while we live; but if any cannot do this without cutting off their own means of subsistence, we suggest this method of making bequests to the endowment fund of St. John's Church. R. A. Goodwin, James W. Shields, Cyrus Bossieux, G. G. Minor, Committee of the Vestry of St. John's Church. It is hoped that the reading of the above touching appeal may reach the hearts of many and kindle the missionary spirit sufficiently to induce them to respond, and in settling their earthly affairs to lay up treasures in Heaven, "where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal." To recapitulate, or even briefly sum up the work done by our faithful Rector, the Rev. R. A. Goodwin, in the ten years he has been with us, would take more time and space than is at the command of the writer. In addition to his pastoral duties, which have always been arduous, his most earnest efforts have been all along directed to the increase and extension of missionary work of the Church, and to that end he has (1) Extended the scope of St. John's Missionary Society to embrace all branches of missions—parish, city, diocesan, domestic and foreign. At his suggestion subscriptions are made by the year to be paid monthly in offertory. (2) Perfected the organization of the Woman's Auxiliary—divided into four sections, one of which is at Weddell Chapel, and all of which sections take part in most of the branches of the missionary work above mentioned. (3) Organized the Junior Auxiliary, of which there are two sections, one composed of girls and young ladies from 12 to 15 years of age, and the other of the smaller Sunday School children—both boys and girls. (4) Organized the Junior Brotherhood of St. Andrew. (5) Appointed one Sunday in each month as Missionary Sunday in the Sunday schools, the offerings on that day going to foreign missions. (6) Organized the Ministering League—composed of ladies willing to assist the Deaconess in her work among the poor and sick. During Mr. Goodwin's rectorship the choir has been enlarged, the Church repaired and beautified; cathedral glass introduced in the windows; the Weddell Memorial chapel has been enlarged and painted; a new furnace and pews put in; a Parish room built costing about $2,000, and as already stated the rectory has been repaired and enlarged, and a new tower built to the church, costing jointly about $3,000. The first of last June, notwithstanding all these outlays and expenditures, there was no debt on the church except for the new tower—the Easter offering being used for the liquidation of the debt on the rectory and leaving a balance to apply to the debt on the tower. The total contributions to St. John's Church in the last ten years have been nearly $60,000, of which sum (in round figures) $25,000 has gone to the regular expenses of the Church—the remainder going to charities and missions within and without the Parish; all of this sum has been contributed as free will offerings— none of it raised by entertainments, fairs, etc. The percentage of regular expenses to total contributions is remarkable, if not unprecedented in church history. It is also encouraging and instructive as showing that as a Church, though poor, we are not spending as much as half of our income on ourselves, including repairs, etc. The same simple worship characterizes St. John's to-day as did that of our forefathers and as the rubrics direct—no innovations. We have no Altar, but a Holy Table. If Bishops Madison and Meade should come back to officiate at St. John's they would find no change in ritual or chancel arrangements to perplex and disconcert them, and our rector has not forgotten the admonition, "Preach the Word." Space and time will not permit the mention of the many kindly acts of our faithful rector. To those of his congregation who have been afflicted with sickness and death he has at all times been at their call, without being sent for, if he knew of the necessity or desire for his presence. To comfort the distressed, to assuage their grief, to compassionate their miseries, to alleviate their sorrows, to extend to them the hand of sympathy, to speak the word of comfort, to sooth their distress, and to point to the Cross has ever been his constant and untiring effort and aim, and when he reaches the golden shores of the New Jerusalem he will certainly deserve the plaudit of "Well done, thou good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." The present appearance of St. John's Church-yard is quite different from what it was a half a century ago; it was then covered with mounds, indicating the resting places of those who sleep their last sleep beneath the sod that covers them. In more recent years these mounds have all been levelled, and the grounds present a beautiful and level surface. Until the year of 1825, when Shockoe Hill Cemetery was established, the interments of the dead in the city of Richmond were chiefly in the grounds of St. John's Church. In the Manuscript Reminiscences by Rev. Prof. Cornelius Walker, D. D., referred to by Bishop Burton in his annals, he says the number of graves and of grave-stones at that period (1826) was greater than now, especially slabs. Large numbers have disappeared. He says some years after, on looking for the head-stone of an old schoolmate, which stood with that of his father and other members of his family, he found only the fragment of a single one, all the rest had gone. He says as the funerals were frequent, and as St. John's was then one of the chief burying places, there were always fresh graves to be seen in some part of the grounds. It frequently occurred that from the bottom of a newly made grave fragments from earlier interments were brought up in digging it. Prof. Walker says he doubts whether there could be found a spot of any size that had not been used for burial purposes. In his reminiscences he says one object of mysterious interest in the cemetery was the vault, lying between the north door of the Church and Broad street. For some time it had not been opened, and there was great curiosity as to its interior. A sad opportunity for such opening, and for the satisfaction of all such curiosity was presented. One of our Sunday School teachers, a Miss Weymouth, on a visit to Norfolk, died there of yellow fever, and in due time the vault was opened for the reception of her remains. So, too, among the monuments, there were some noticeable as connected with the deaths of those of whom they were memorials and recent enough in point of time to be remembered. One was of Miss Claxton, not far from the door of the western transept, dying just before the time of her anticipated marriage. Another was that of Col. Gamble, between the northern door and the gate on the cross street, killed by a fall from his horse. Another was that of a Mr. McCredie, nearly opposite what is now the Cathedral, hurrying to a fire and failing to note the hail of the sentry was shot near the capitol; and still another of a young man, Denoon, near the gate on Broad street, killed by his employer in a fit either of business or domestic jealousy, the murderer committing suicide in jail a few days afterwards. Two others of interest to the Sunday School scholars were those, two of their number, of Sarah Haley, a little girl dying in her tenth or eleventh year, and Charlie Pulling, a little older, killed by a fall from a horse. The last two have disappeared. The others, and much the older, still remain. Some Indian relics having been exhumed in the grounds, it has been supposed that at one time a portion of them were used as an Indian burial place. The surface of the cemetery has been buried over and over again to a large extent, as in digging new graves the relics of former interments have been exposed. In instances graves have been opened to receive others of the same family. It is to be profoundly regretted that no regular and continuous record of the burials has been kept. Some years ago there was found in the crypt or basement of the Church a bronze tablet bearing the name "John Coles." He was the ancester of the distinguished family of that name of Albemarle county, Virginia. Several prominent families, among them the Adams, Carrington and Pickett, had their private cemeteries. Their remains have been re-interred in Hollywood—the final interment being in 1884. Burials of citizens of Richmond were also made in family cemeteries in the counties adjacent. At "Powhatan," the seat of the Mayo family, just beyond the eastern limits of the city, rests the remains of the Mayo, Cabell, Scott, and other families. And at Shield's place to the west of the city are the tombs of members of the Robinson and other families. Here among them is the modest head-stone of Mrs. Jean Wood, wife of Gov. James Wood, a woman of rare benevolence of character with poetic ability of high order. There was also a Jewish burying ground on the south side of Franklin street, between Twentieth and Twenty-first streets, containing the tombs of Israel and Mrs. Hester Cohen, covered in granite masonry. In conclusion, to those who wish a few moments of rest and quiet communion with God, we invite you to our old church-yard, where beneath the green sward "the rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep." The trees still whisper a gentle lullaby to the souls of the departed, and the meandering James murmurs a restful requiem. The breezes speak softly in sibilant tones of peace as the shadows come and go, and the sunlight gently kisses the flowers into perennial bloom as they lift their heads to catch its shimmering light and to rejoice in its life-giving warmth—verily, a quiet peaceful, restful spot amidst the noise of commerce and the sounds of city life where one can turn aside for thought and reflection. The attractiveness and beauty of these lovely grounds are in a great measure due to the constant care and labors of its courteous and efficient keeper, Antonio (Dodd) Graffigna, who succeeded his father, who for many years before him was also its keeper. In addition to his other talents, "Dodd" also makes the walls of Old St. John's resound occasionally to the burning words of Henry's fiery eloquence to admiring strangers, as with voice and appropriate gestures he repeats the famous speech that echoed within its walls more than a century and a half ago.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The following is the report of the committee: To the Vestry of St. John's Church: As chairman of the Committee on Repairs of St. John's Church, I have the honor to submit the following report: On the night of the 29th of September last our city was visited by one of the most terrific wind storms ever known in this vicinity.

When, as is contemplated, our Church shall be further ornamented by the two memorial windows now bespoken, one in honor of our lamented Senior Warden and the other to the memory of the Lacy family, it will add very much to the beauty and harmony of the whole. Your committee desire to call your attention to the fact that in repairing the tower they have dispensed with the steeple that recently adorned it, and have restored this part of our building to the shape and appearance it bore previous to 1863, when the tower was blown down by a high wind. The steeple has been replaced by a cupola, being a fac-simile of the old tower and belfry, modelled from a picture of this ancient edifice kindly loaned by Mr. W. W. Davies. Your committee earnestly trust that our old Church, which is the Mecca at whose shrine so many strangers pay their homage, and within whose walls so many who have passed over the river offered their devotion to Deity, may be spared many years in its ancient form, its simple architecture, its spotless purity, its untarnished reputation, standing as it does within its sacred necropolis, and that it may remain not only to light the beacon torch of liberty to future generations, but may continue as the alma mater of Christian faith noted for its piety, zeal and good works. Respectfully submitted, J. S. Moore, Chairman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Friends of Old St. John's Church, Richmond, Va.: St. John's is the mother church of Richmond, and of Henrico parish. It was built one hundred and fifty-three years ago, when the Old Dominion owed allegiance to George III., and the Protestant Episcopal Church in Virginia was in the jurisdiction of the Bishop of London. Within its walls was held the Virginia Convention of A. D. 1775; and here Patrick Henry's great oration, which fired the hearts of the people for liberty, was delivered. This Church is thus identified with the history of the Commonwealth and of our whole country. No one can compute what has been done for the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ by the ministers and people who have been identified with St. John's Church during the past one hundred and fifty-three years. In the beautiful graveyard surrounding the Church are buried some who were highly esteemed in Church and State, many who were the honored progenitors of distinguished families, and many others who, though "to fortune and to fame unknown," had their names written in Heaven, and were "rich in good works." There are few Episcopal Churches in Richmond which do not number among their most liberal contributors and most active workers some whose parents were trained in the way of righteousness, or who themselves once worshipped, at Old St. John's. There are many congregations, in this and other States, of which the same is true. This Church has now a larger membership (including her missions), than any other Church in the Diocese of Virginia, but the great majority of these members are poor in this world's goods. To this Church the poor have always been welcomed; and under the leadership of the sainted Weddell and the earnest and energetic Burton, three missions were established, and have been constantly carried on. The tendency for more than a hundred years has been for those blessed with wealth to move from Church Hill; but the number of souls in this part of the city has greatly increased. To help to meet the spiritual needs of the poor on and around Church Hill, our congregation is conducting the missions referred to. Not willing that the good work of our Church shall decrease, and greatly desiring to make our mission work more aggressive, the Vestry has decided to endeavor to secure a partial endowment for St. John's Church. It is proposed to enter in a well-bound book, to be preserved in the archives of the Church, the names of those who contribute to this endowment fund, with the amount given. One contribution has already been made to this fund. It is also proposed to preserve a part of this book for a record of special memorial endowments. A page will be devoted to the memory of the person designated. The amount of the memorial fund will be stated, with the name of the person or persons contributing, and no other entry will be made on that page. The interest only will be used. Such a memorial will last longer than marble, or brass, or stained glass; and will perpetually furnish a fund to carry on the good work which was dear to the hearts of departed saints while they lived here, and is now more precious to them since they see more clearly, in the light of Paradise, the importance of the Lord's work on the earth. Surely there are not a few whose loved ones are buried at St. John's or who have worshipped and labored for Christ there, though they be buried elsewhere, who will be glad to perpetually associate their names with the good work of the Church which they loved, and, at the same time, perpetually help forward the Lord's work. 7 In more than one instance money has been left, by will, to our Church which the Vestry did not receive, because it was not devised according to the laws of the State. Churches are not incorporated under the laws of Virginia, and legal difficulties generally arise when bequests are made to vestries or trustees of Churches. Bequests made to "The Trustees of the Funds of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Virginia" for the sole use and benefit of St. John's Protestant Episcopal Church, Richmond, Va., will be safe, because these trustees are incorporated. It is better to give while we live; but if any cannot do this without cutting off their own means of subsistence, we suggest this method of making bequests to the endowment fund of St. John's Church.

Robinson, 1695, and James Keith, 1733, is undoubtedly partially filled by the incumbency of Rev. Jacob Ware, who, as is shown by the Henrico Court Records in 1716, was minister of Henrico Parish for twenty years. Phippe De Richebourg, a French Huguenot, is also mentioned in the same records as minister of Henrico Parish in 1701. Wm. Finney is also mentioned as minister of Henrico Parish in 1727, and doubtless filled up the gap until the rectorship of Rev. James Keith. In my opinion, Rev. Jacob Ware was the minister alluded to by Bishop Burton, who made his report to the Bishop of London, whose name "has been torn from the MSS. of his report."—J. S. M.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Patrick Henry. 8 THE FAMOUS Revolution Speech of Patrick Henry, DELIVERED BEFORE THE VIRGINIA CONVENTION IN ST. JOHN'S CHURCH, 1775. "Mr. President," said he, "it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth and listen to the song of that siren, till she transforms us into beasts. Is this," he asked, "the part of wise men, engaged in a great and ardous struggle for liberty? Were we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes see not, and having ears hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation? For his part, whatever anguish of spirit it might cost, he was willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and provide for it." "He had," he said, "but one lamp by which his feet were guided; and that was the lamp of experience. He knew of no way of judging of the future but by the past. And in judging by the past, he wished to know what there had been in the conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years, to justify those hopes with which gentlemen had been pleased to solace themselves and the house? Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received? Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love? Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the implements of war and subjugation, the last arguments to which kings resort. I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not to force us to submission? Can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain any enemy in this quarter of the world to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies? No, sir, she has none. They are meant for us; they can be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British ministry have been so long forging. And what have we to oppose them? Shall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon the subject? Nothing. We have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication? What terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves longer. Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned, we have remonstrated, we have supplicated, we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned with contempt from the foot of the throne. In vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope. If we wish to be free—if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending—if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained—we must fight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms and to the God of hosts, is all that is left us!" "They tell us, sir," continued Mr. Henry, "that we are weak—unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be next week or the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak, if we make a proper use of those means which the God of Nature hath placed in our power. Three millions of people armed in the holy cause of liberty and in such a country as that which we possess are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but in submission and slavery! Our chains are forged. Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable—and let it come!! I repeat it, sir, let it come!! "It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry peace, peace, but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God. I know not what course others may take; but as for me," cried he, with both his arms extended aloft, his brow knit, every feature marked with the resolute purpose of his soul, and his voice swelled to its boldest note of exclamation, "Give me liberty, or give me death!"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Rt. Rev. A. M. Randolph, D. D., LL. D., Assistant Bishop of Virginia 1883-1892, when he became Bishop of Southern Virginia. ADDRESS Delivered by Rt. Rev. A. M. Randolph, AT OLD ST. JOHN'S CHURCH, JUNE 10, 1891, 150TH ANNIVERSARY. I must rely upon your love for this old Church and your reverence for its associations, for your interest and kind attention as I discharge the grateful duty which my valued friend, your rector, has assigned to me. It has often occurred to me in the last few years, that a sense of the value of our history and reverence for our past is growing in this, our new land and in this age, which we are in the habit of designating as above all others a material, mechanical and practical age. The organization of societies for preserving memorials of the past, the revival of interest in the historical societies of the different States, the reverence for the old churches and the efforts to rescue them, where it is practicable and in some cases when it is impracticable and useless, the renewed interest in our colleges in historical studies— all these are symptoms of a revival of the historic spirit and an assertion of the historic instinct which has always been one of the strongest elements in our Anglo-Saxon character and civilization. That historic instinct has been the characteristic of all the progressive nations of the earth—the races that have been without it have fallen further and further behind in the march of civilization; they have gravitated progressively toward the animal life of living from day to day; each day forgetting yesterday and oblivious of to-morrow, learning nothing, sowing no seed and gathering no harvest. How can we comprehend the present but through the past? Where are the roots of our laws, our institutions, our habits and customs but in the past? In studying the history of our forefathers and of our land we are studying ourselves. We are finding out how we came to be what we are; we are tracing back to their sources the streams of our liberties, our laws and our institutions. In following the fortunes of our fathers we are finding out the influences that formed our minds and educated our infancy and molded our nationality. That is true of our general, or as some would call it, our secular history. But there is really no such thing as secular history; all true history is the record of the education of nations and races under the teachings of Providence and the movements of the Spirit of God upon the hearts of men. But the highest kind of history is the history of Christianity—the Church, and when I say the church I mean the aggregate of all the forms of the churches that hold the essentials of Christianity. This Church in its spiritual work, in its intellectual work, in its influence upon individuals and upon masses, this constitutes the unity of modern history. The Church of Christ lies behind everything as a moving, modifying, conditioning force. Ever since it began its work in the world, on the side of good and blessing, it has been the soul of all true civilization; it has been the inspiration of all true liberty; it has been the guide and the light upon the pathway of all true knowledge. Upon the side of evil it has suffered its divine energies to be abased in the vile fetters of Priest-craft, in the blood paroxysms of fanaticism. All human passions have taken hold upon it, sheltered themselves behind it, justified themselves by its name. Its gospel of peace has been perverted and turned into a sword that has separated father and son, husband and wife, nations and people one from another, so it has penetrated in everything, modifying and conditioning the evil, and furnishing the motive forces of the good. Modern history is a body Christianity, and its churches are the soul of that body. To-day we are to think of some of the events, and gather some lessons from the history of one old Church, as we sit within its walls; they are one hundred and fifty years old. For these long generations it has been standing upon this hill, that is older than itself by illimitable years, it has been looking down upon the river that has been flowing on to the sea just as it is to-day, ages and ages before its foundation stone was laid, but if nature is older everything else around it is younger. It has seen the birth, the infancy, the growth and development of Richmond for 150 years. Well, how did it come to be here? And to answer we must go back for a brief sketch of history. On the 20th of July, 1588, the English Admiral Lord Howard went out from Plymouth, and early in the morning discovered the Spanish Armada entering the British channel. For ten years Philip, of Spain, with the Roman Catholic powers, had been gathering their resources and their strength to crush England, our mother land. The Armada had one hundred and thirty-six battle ships, the largest then known to naval architecture, beside one hundred vessels to attend them. From the other end of the channel the Duke of Parma, with another army, was to meet them; they were to drive the little British navy from the channel, land their armies upon the English coast and, gaining a foothold, pour in upon England the Catholic powers of Europe, to crush Protestantism. That was the plan. England had done her best to get ready for this death grapple with her enemies, but the odds were fearfully against her; she had 34 battleships, and they went out that morning, the 20th of July, 1588, to meet 136 battleships, all larger than any one of hers. The Armada moves with majesty up the Channel. The coast of England is crowded with her brave people, watching the stately ships in battle array. Are they to pass unscathed? Are the English captains, the daring sailors who have borne the English flag around the globe, are they afraid of the mighty odds? The Armada moves on, the English Admiral lets them pass, and gathers his vessels behind them, between them and the ocean, and bears down upon them with southwest wind. The next morning, the 21st of July, he is closing upon their rear. At daybreak the English captains call their brave crews to the deck. They join in this old Church service, the same as yours in this Church. They kneel around the Lord's table, and take the Holy Communion and sing a Psalm, and then they go down to the battle—Howard and Drake and Frobisher and Hawkins commanding and leading to the fight, and you know the story, the most gallant episode in modern history. For seven long days and nights they hang on to the rear of the mighty navy of their enemies. Manœuvering and fighting day and night, England was watching from the shore. The Spanish Galleons would close around them, but they would shake them off, and speed away upon the wind, and come back and close in again. They fought in four great battles. When the second is over, Sir Francis Drake sends a message to his brave Queen Elizabeth, "Your majesty must pray for us in all the churches in England, and by the help of God we will drive them from the sea." And England was praying in all her churches, the simple, solemn prayer of the old litany that we hear in this Church every Sunday, "From our enemies defend us, Oh Christ," and the prayer was answered, and the proud navy was driven and broken and shattered, and England was saved. And what has that to do, you will ask, with the colonizing of this continent, with Jamestown, with Richmond, with our Protestant religion in America? It has this to do: That gallant fight of your forefathers in the British Channel broke the Spanish and the Roman Catholic power on the sea, opened the free ocean for England's civilization and religion and people to plant themselves on this continent. But for that the civilization here as far as we can see would have been that of South America, or of Mexico. The Anglo-Saxon race, and the Protestant faith, and the Bible would have been kept back from America perhaps two centuries longer—that was 1588. Nineteen years after that our English forefathers landed and settled at Jamestown in 1607 and built the first Church, and the worship of the English Litany for the first time awoke the echoes of the wilderness in America, and four years after that (1611) Sir Thomas Dale comes over with a goodly company of English, passes Jamestown, pushes up our river, and settles upon the Peninsula that is cut off by what is now known as Dutch Gap; calls his settlement Henricopolis, after Prince Henry, the eldest son of James the First, builds what was at that time a handsome church, and Whitaker, a clergyman of the English Church, and one of the noblest Christian men of his age, is placed over it as its pastor and rector. That Church is the mother of this, the parish is the same, and Whitaker is its first minister. He was a graduate of Cambridge University. A contemporary thus writes about him: "He did voluntarily leave his warm nest, and to the wonder of his kindred and the amazement of them that knew him, undertake this hard but in my judgment heroical resolution, to go to Virginia and help to bear the name of God unto the Gentiles." Whitaker had a warm nest in his old English home; his friend says it was a wonder and amazement that he came to this wilderness country. That illustrates another historic lesson upon the motives and the spirit of our forefathers in coming to this land. By the kindness of a literary friend I have the recently published volumes by Alexander Brown, an honored citizen of Virginia, a member of the Virginia Historical Society, a member of the American Historical Association, and a fellow of the Royal Historical Society of England. Its title is, "The Genesis of the United States." In my judgment it is the most valuable contribution to the history of the origin of our country that has been made during the present century, made from materials that have been hitherto either inaccessible or unknown to exist. In the last fifty years there has been great advance in the study of history as a science, and it is a matter of congratulation that we have in Virginia this cultured gentleman, who has given and is giving his life to opening the fountains of history in the publication of original manuscript; so that we need no longer manufacture history out of our own brains or upon the plane of our passions or sectional prejudices, but from the only true sources of historic verities. I find in these volumes a published discourse by the Rev. William Symonds, of the English Church, delivered at White Chapel, London, delivered in the presence of the Honorable and Worshipful the adventurers and planters for Virginia, the 25th of April, 1609, just two years after the settlement at Jamestown. You must think of that congregation as composed of men, some of whom had made up their minds to come to Virginia, some were doubting and hesitating, others were skeptical; the leading spirits were full of high enthusiasm and religious hope in the enterprise. It was the first discourse ever published in behalf of Virginia and the infant colony. It gives you a living picture of their feelings that surprises the popular and the ignorant conception of their motives. They were not vulgar adventurers; they were not self-seeking traders. The appeal that is made to them in this sermon is upon the high plain of duty; encouragements to go are drawn from the promise of God, the guidings of Providence and the inspiration of religious faith. It seems to confirm the proposition I announced a few moments ago, that around all great movements in modern history Christianity is an atmosphere and the Church of Christ a leading factor and motive power. The text of the discourse is Genesis 12, verses 1, 2, 3: "For the Lord said unto Abraham, get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred and from thy father's house, unto the land that I will show thee, and I will make thee a great nation, and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed." He expounds his text with stately rhetoric but with the solid sense of our English forefathers. He is answering the various reasons for not going. "One saith England is a sweet country;" true indeed, and the God of Glory be blessed that whereas the country was wild as a forest and the people were naked, by the civil care of conquerors and planters it is now become a very paradise in comparison of what it was. "They shrink from the great deep, that were sure enough perils then." He tells them that Sir Humphrey Gilbert forty years before had told his officers and sailors as their little bark was tossed in the wild storm, "Be of good cheer, my friends, it is as near heaven by sea as by land." I give you these extracts to show that he is moving them to courage and to hope upon grounds of religious faith. Another discourse by Crashaw, a distinguished clergyman of the English Church, is preached in London before the company and the emigrants to Virginia in February, 1610. Of that the historian says: "There is no nobler sermon of the period than this." That comes still nearer to us, for those who listened to it were probably the men who came with Dale and settled Henricopolis in 1611. The text is Luke 22d chapter, 32d verse: "But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not." I have not the time to quote from it to any extent. Its divisions are seven discouragements from going and seven encouragements to go. It is full of genuine power and appeals to the loftiest motives that can move Christian men. It closes with this eloquent salutation to Virginia: "And thou, Virginia, whom though mine eyes see not, my heart shall love, how hath God honoured thee! Thou hast thy name from the worthiest queen that ever the world had, and thou shalt now have thy form from one of the most glorious nations under the sun. But this is only a little portion of thy honor, for thy God is coming towards thee, and in the mean time sends to thee and salutes thee with best blessing Heaven hath, even His blessed Gospel! Look up, therefore, and lift up thy head, for thy redemption draweth nigh! And He that was the God of Israel and is still the God of England will shortly, I doubt not, bring it to pass that men shall say, blessed be the Lord God of Virginia, and let all Christian people say, Amen." This sermon was printed and distributed to the company, and to all who came here to plant an old Commonwealth. Its title was, "A New Year's Gift to Virginia," and underneath the title was this stately Antiphon: ENGLAND TO GOD, "LORD, HERE I AM, SEND ME." GOD TO VIRGINIA. "He that walketh in darkness and hath no light, let him trust in the name of the Lord and stay upon his God." VIRGINIA TO GOD. "God be merciful to us and bless us and cause the light of thy countenance to shine upon us; let thy ways be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations." ENGLAND TO VIRGINIA. "Behold I bring you glad tidings—unto you is born a Saviour, even Christ the Lord." VIRGINIA TO ENGLAND. "How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings and publish salvation." Men to be reached by such noble appeals as that were not men of the common, the baser sort. This same high hearted religious spirit appears in them as we see them again, after they have crossed the Atlantic and landed here, near to us and begin the work of building America. Whitaker writes of Sir Thomas Dale, soon after they land in 1611: "Our religious and valiant governor, a man of great knowledge in divinity and of a good conscience in all things, both which be rare in a martial man." Again he writes a few months afterwards: "We preach in the forenoon, catechise in the afternoon; every Saturday I exhort in Sir Thomas Dale's house." In 1612 Pocahontas had been taken prisoner by the English, and Dale is now Governor of the whole colony. He labored long and tenderly to ground the faith of Jesus Christ in the heart of this Indian Princess. He writes about her in 1613: "Were it but for the gaining of this one precious soul, I would think my time, toil and present stay well spent." Whitaker baptizes her, and in April, 1614, marries her to John Rolfe. Very soon after this she and her husband removed to the neighborhood of Henricopolis, not far from Richmond, and there they live until Pocahontas leaves Virginia to die in England. There this famous Indian Princess and gracious child of the wilderness, whose blood flows in the veins of some of your own people to-day, listened to the sermons, joined in the responses of the English Liturgy and knelt at the communion table of this, your old parish, in its infant days. I should think you would always read that passage of your history with tender and loving eyes. Just after this Whitaker writes: "Though my promise of three years' service to my country be expired, I will abide in my vocation here until I be lawfully called from hence." Your rector, in his admirable summary of the history of the Parish, says: "He was indeed lawfully called by Him whose providence is supreme," within a very short time, for in the spring of 1617 this, our first rector, the gentle and earnest Whitaker, known to history as the "Apostle of Virginia," was called away by sudden death. In 1619 a successor to the rectorship of the Parish is found in the Rev. Thomas Bargrave. During his ministry a law was passed by the Colonial Legislature, which illustrates the connection between Church and State, imported to America from the mother country. Perhaps some clergyman with small salary and poorly paid, who struggles to do his work and feed and clothe his children, might find some grim comfort and cool philosophy in this provision and advice of the State to our early missionaries. The law enacts that each clergyman shall receive from his parishoners 1,500 pounds of tobacco and 16 barrels of corn, quite a good provision for the times. But the law proceeds to say that if the levy should prove unequal in value to 200 pounds the minister must be content with less. On the one side it was doubtless a signal advantage to the Episcopal Church in its infancy to receive the support of the State as the established Church; on the other hand there were disadvantages from that (to our American ideas) unnatural connection, which hindered its development and progressively weakened its power with the masses of the people up to the period of the Revolution, when the connection was dissolved. The Wardens of the Episcopal Church, under the laws of the State, discharged in a measure the duties of our chief of police and of your attorneys for the Commonwealth. They were the legal guardians of public order and peace, and the vindicators of justice. When these officers represent, as among us, the sovereignty of the people as the fountain of law, and when they discharge that duty faithfully, they ought to be among the most honored and popular of our citizens. Transfer that function to the officers of your churches and at once you would realize the inevitable estrangement of the hearts of the people from the church by reason of the unnatural coalition and identification of civic and ecclesiastical functions. The Episcopal Church suffered from this prejudice from no fault of its own. Nay, it is a part of the debt of gratitude that all of our citizens of every denomination owe to her, that in our early days she bore this burden and discharged this thankless duty that had been imposed upon her with becoming fidelity. With the time at my disposal I might tell you the story of the life of this Parish from 1619 to the building of this Church in 1741; of the great university for which the money had almost been raised in England and in the Colony, which would have been located at Henricopolis, or perhaps here in Richmond; of the great calamity of the Indian massacre in 1622, which swept over the Colony, destroyed Henricopolis and almost extinguished the Parish and put an end to the scheme of the university. The Parish revives from the calamity, struggles on with its ups and downs, its changes and vicissitudes, recording here and there noble work from faithful pastors, and noble sacrifice and devotion from its members. When your vestry book was begun in 1730, the principal Church in the Parish was Curles Church, on the north side of James river, ten miles below Richmond. That Church has been demolished in the last half century. The only relic of it that remains is the bowl of your baptismal font. It was found miles away from the site of Curles Church in a cellar, where it was used as a mortar for beating hominy. And here it is to hold the sacred symbol of the waters of baptism, wherein God declares your children to be His children, and the Holy Spirit His gift to them, and Christ's redemption their glorious possession. In 1739, under the ministry of the Rev. Wm. Stith, the grandson of William Randolph, of Turkey Island, who had received the best education that America and England could give, and who afterwards became the historian of Virginia, the plan for building a new church was agitated. After some debate, and acting under the advice of William Byrd, a distinguished gentleman of the Colony, who gave the land, the Vestry of Henrico Parish chose this spot, called Indian Hill, in Richmond. Under the superintendence of Richard Randolph it was built and entered for worship on the 10th of June, 1741, one hundred and fifty years ago to-day. Your kind rector and friends, who take a loving pride in the honored memories of the Parish, have pointed out to you and to visitors from all parts of our country, who never leave Richmond without a visit to St. John's Church, the lines, the walls and the dimensions of that old Church. It has been added to and altered since, but the old bricks, the pulpit, the sounding board, the timbers and the forms are all here in this building where we worship to-day. It stands here and does its blessed work for the infant days of Richmond, training its children, marrying its young men and maidens, burying its dead, and breaking the bread of life to its people through the colony days until the cloud of the Revolution breaks upon the land. The Virginia Convention of 1775 met in these walls on the 20th of March. Mr. Selden, the rector, and the ancestor of many of your worthiest families to-day, is the chaplain of that famous Convention. It is composed of remarkable men for any age or any country. Our children are familiar with the great debate upon the question of peace or war with the mother country. Yonder is the spot, tradition tells us, where Patrick Henry, the greatest natural orator of his time, arose and uttered the words that perhaps told more upon the world than any single speech that history tells us of. They tell us that his voice was calm when he began, but when he closed it shook the walls of this old church, and sounded like the shout of a warrior. When he sat down the assembly had lost its composure; they all leaned over and kept still, their eyes fixed on his pale face, and then by common consent, the die was cast and Virginia cast in her lot and led the cause which triumphed in the establishment of popular government and American liberty. Before the eight year war was done, this old Church passed through an experience of desecration and humiliation. When Richmond, during the Revolutionary War, fell into the hands of Arnold, this sacred place was made a barracks for the British soldiery. It must have seemed to pastor and people that the final word in their parochial history was then being written. But the storm passes away and the sun comes out again, and the old Church takes its place as the leader of the affairs of the Church in Virginia. In May of 1785 the convention of the reorganized Diocese of Virginia was held in Richmond, and its religious service was held in this church, the sermon being preached by the Rev. John Bracken. Edmund Randolph, afterwards Governor of Virginia and then Attorney-General of the United States, and then Secretary of State, and pilot at the helm of government in its first voyage over untried and stormy seas—this man was the lay delegate of your Church in that important Convention. He drew up this remarkable appeal to the members of the Episcopal Church in Virginia, representing its wasted condition, and exhorting them to rally to its support. In it occurs the sentence which has become famous in Church history: "Of what is the Church now possessed? Nothing but the glebes and your affections." Randolph also reported and advocated resolutions that were passed by this Virginia Convention with the members of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the other States of America! For thirty years the Rev. Mr. Buchanan ministered in this Church; years of depression they were for your Parish, but years of brave and cheerful and self-denying work for your pastor. A kindly and genial book has been published here in Richmond telling us of the loving brotherhood between your rector, Dr. Buchanan, and the Rev. John Blair, Presbyterian minister in this city. The Church was loaned to our sister Church, and each minister, Blair the Presbyterian, and Buchanan the Episcopalian, ministered to their respective congregations on alternate Sundays. It may be that the kindly relations between these two pastors of different churches may have helped to transmit to our people in Richmond a spirit of sweet reasonableness and of kindly brotherhood between the various denominations of Christians. To this simple beginning, under the blessing of God, may be traced perhaps a stream of higher Christian civilization upon the subject of the relations between the various Protestant Churches of Christendom than we find in some other communities. The Church that asserts exclusive claims for its ministry, its worship, its organization, is unconsciously to itself its own worst enemy. The Church that believes in itself, is loyal to itself, but loves and believes in and welcomes with a brother's fidelity the sister churches around it, is the Church for the people of our land. The time would fail me to tell more of the story of the rectors who have ministered to the generations through all the years of the present century—of the Rev. William Hart, who comes after the death of Dr. Buchanan in 1822, who seems to have been among the first of the Christian ministry in our country to recognize the power and the blessing of Sunday school work as the nursery of the Christian Church. Then the Rev. William Lee, who becomes rector in 1828, and under whose ministry the Church takes the name of "St. John's"; of the Rev. Edward Peet, the Rev. Robt. Croes, the Rev. J. H. Morrison, and of the Rev. Henry S. Kepler, of the Rev. John T. Points, the devoted missionary who occupied the rectorship in succession from 1830 to 1860; of the Rev. Dr. Norwood, who begins his ministry in 1862 and resigns the rectorship in 1868—years of tribulation, but years when your people were making names in history that are never going to die. Dr. Norwood's form, his face, his strong words in this pulpit, his faithful pastorate, are all living in the memories and the hearts of your people to-day. Then comes Dr. Henry Wall, of whom you 9 say that his preaching was full of grace and power. He leaves you in 1875. Then comes the Rev. Alexander W. Weddell; you can tell me more about him than I could tell you. He had high aims and a manly heart, a lofty enthusiasm in the work of ministering to souls. You have put a beautiful monument at the door of your church that tells in eloquent words the record that he made among you. For your children's sake may God keep his memory green, and here your old church has stood, all through these years that we have travelled. It has been looking down from this hill upon Richmond and seen all the stages of its life. It has rejoiced in the birthdays and in the cornerstone laying of all these other churches, its children. On the hill by the river it has watched the sure growth of your beautiful city of the dead, and through the trees it has caught glimpses from its tower of the marble monuments, in the morning and the evening sunshine. Down beneath, the scattered village of the colony is growing into a city; far out on the landscape iron roads are coming year by year to bring commerce to its merchants and custom to its industries. The hum of machinery, the multitudinous sounds of a city have been growing deeper year by year, as they have been borne up to the old Church on the hill. How wonderful is the moral, and spiritual significance of a city. Some one has said: God made the country, man made the city; but God made the city, too. The city is His ordinance for the necessities of human civilization. He ordained it to be the workshop for the country; the point where the commodities of all climes meet and thence are distributed to the peoples and the nations. And it is His ordinance that it is also the type and the prophecy of the final destiny of a redeemed humanity, of a city not made with hands, eternal in the heavens, its thronging toilers, its great charities, its courts of justice, its halls of education, and of legislation, its blessed homes, its sorrows, its sins, its shame, and amid them all its Churches, pointing away, pointing upward. What is a city but a realization, a living symbol of a world that is fallen, but a world that has been redeemed? And the Church of Christ the Saviour of men, how it stands at the centre of all the activities and varied life of the city, how it interprets the city to itself, how the home finds its meaning in the Church, to train its children to be members of Christ and His children, how the weary toiler, the merchant harassed with his cares in the week come to the Church on Sunday to drink of the springs of Elim in the worship and the word of God, to refresh him. How the dens of shame, the homes of the prodigal look away and up to the Church dimly and gropingly and cry, "Come to us, seek us, save us, for we are lost." Such is a city; such is the Church that stands in its midst. In closing, let me point to one or two lessons that St. John's teaches us to-day. It teaches us to persevere, it teaches us to hold on, it teaches us that the day of our usefulness and our work as a Church may seem to be at an end, but we must be patient. God has work for us to do. Three times in its history its Vestry and its people were about to move away and build a new church, but the providence of God kept it here. When the Monumental is built you said, "That will take away our life," and it seemed to do it for a long time. When St. Paul's is built you said, "Our fate is sealed, we must not expect our people to pass by these beautiful Churches and come miles away to worship in these old walls." But the old Monumental is new and strong and full of Gospel life, and St. Paul's is strong and beautiful, and old St. John's is here still —more vigorous in its old age a long way than in its youth, warmer with the spirit of Christ than it was in the morning of its life, doing a wider work than it has ever done before. The lesson is, hold on; the tide may ebb to-night but it comes in glad and strong in the morning. And then St. John's has its lesson to the country, to our loved land on this its one hundred and fiftieth birthday. You remember the name of the man I mentioned who superintended the building of these walls in 1741. You remember again the same family name of the man, the layman who represented you in the important councils of the Church after the Revolution. These men were great grandsons of one of the earliest members of your Parish. A simple, strong, true man he must have been; out of his loins sprang three great men. He was the ancestor of Chief Justice Marshall, the greatest jurist of America. He was the ancestor of Thomas Jefferson, the greatest political thinker of America. He was the ancestor of Robert E. Lee, the greatest soldier of America. He was also the ancestor of that other statesman who was Junior Warden after the Revolution, and who represented you in the Diocesan Council of your Church, and whom, though much misunderstood, I regard as one of the greatest and purest of American politicians. Strange that they all should have come of the offspring of this simple strong man, who lived at Turkey Island, just below our city. St. John's to-day reminds its country of old days of plain living and high thinking, and speaks words of warning to these days, when greed of gain threatens to paralize the intellect and corrupt the heart and undermine the foundations of the nation. It tells of days of political purity to these days of strange and defiant and shocking political corruption. It speaks words of hope, too, to its dear country. It says, I have had my dark days and have seen the light break through the clouds. Trust God— trust in the people led by the spirit of God. Trust your godly mothers to teach the children the ten commandments. Trust your godly fathers to teach your boys to keep their bodies in temperance, soberness and chastity. Trust your churches and stand by them as they raise the standards against the enemies that come in like a flood. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Love your neighbor as yourself and reform and redeem your country by first getting the spirit of Christ to reform and redeem you. That is St. John's message of hope to America. It speaks to us to-day of the permanency of the Christian Church and Gospel. Other institutions may grow old, like machines and old vehicles that are superseded by the forces of nature that we harness to do man's work and to turn the wheels of his material progress; but steam and electricity, natural selection and evolution, science and wealth cannot cure the soul. Each new soul that is born begins from the beginning; each new generation has the same temptation to fight; makes the same mistakes; wanders into the same errors; makes the same shipwreck. Sin and sorrow and death are always the same, always new, and the Church of the living God, and that brings to the nations the healing leaves of the tree of life, must stand to tell men of the fountain for sin and of the hope of redemption and of the gift of the Spirit. God bless you, dear old Church, minister and people, and give you in the coming years, when Richmond may widen out into a great city, a still wider field for your activities and blessings more abundant to crown your work. Keep close to the promise, "Lo I am with you always, even unto the end of the world."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ADDRESS Delivered by Hon. William Wirt Henry, GRANDSON OF PATRICK HENRY, AT OLD ST. JOHN'S CHURCH, JUNE 10, 1891, 150TH ANNIVERSARY. Few buildings in our land have withstood the varied casualties of time for one hundred years; very few have remained for one hundred and fifty years. We would fain believe that a special providence has watched over and preserved this frail wooden structure since 1741, when it was erected, and kept it as a sacred shrine, where piety and patriotism have mingled their devotions. It is most appropriate that this generation should be reminded of its history by these exercises, and their veneration be quickened in recalling the important events in Church and State of which it stands as a witness. In attempting to perform the part with which I have been honored on this interesting occasion, I shall be forced to take but a hurried view of the civil events, and of the distinguished actors in them, which have made this the most memorable building which remains in our State. Any attempt to do full justice to the subject would far transcend the limits of an address and would reach the proportions of a volume. In the Vestry Book of Henrico Parish the following entries are found: "At a Vestry held for Henrico Parish, on the 20th day of December, Anno 1739: Present—Mr. William Stith, Minister; James Powell Cocke and James Cocke, Church Wardens; Richard Randolph, John Redford, John Povall, James Williamson, William Fuller and Robert Mosby, Gent., Vestrymen. It is agreed that a Church be built on the most convenient spot of ground near ye spring, on Richardson's Road, on the south side of Bacon's Branch, on the land of the Honorable William Byrd, Esq., to be sixty feet long and twenty-five feet broad, and fourteen feet pitched, to be finished in a plain manner after the moddle of Curl's Church. Richard Randolph, Esq., Gent., undertakes the said building and engages to finish the same by the tenth day of June, which shall be in the year of our Lord seventeen hundred and forty-one; for which the Vestry agrees to pay him the sum of three hundred and seventeen pounds, ten shillings, current money, to be paid by the amount of sales of twenty thousand pounds of tobacco annually, to be lev'd on the Parish and sold here for money, till the whole payment be compleat." "At a Vestry held for Henrico Parish, the 13th day of October, Anno Dom. 1740: Present—Mr. William Stith, clerk; James Powel Cocke, James Cocke, Gent., Church Wardens, Richard Randolph, John Redford, Bowler Cocke, John Williamson and Wm. Fuller, Gent., Vestrymen. "Richard Randolph, Gentleman, produces a letter directed to him, from the Hon'ble William Byrd, Esquire, which is read as followeth, viz.: " `October 12, 1740. " `Sir,—I should, with great pleasure, oblige the Vestry, and particularly yourself, in granting them an acre to build their Church upon, but there are so many roads already through that land, that the damage to me would be great to have another of a mile long cut through it. I shall be very glad if you would please to think Richmond a proper place, and considering the great number of people that live below it, and would pay their devotions there, that would not care to go so much higher, I can't but think it would be agreeable to most of the people; and if they will agree to have it there, I will give them two of the best lots, that are not taken up, and besides give them any pine timber they can find on that side of Shockoe Creek, and wood for burning of bricks into the bargain. I hope the Gent. of the Vestry will believe me a friend to the Church when I make them the offer, and that I am both theirs, sir, and, 'Your most humble serv't, W. Byrd.' "Whereupon the question is put whether the said Church should be built on the hill called Indian Town at Richmond, or at Thomas Williamson's plantation on the Brook Road, and is carried by a majority of voices for the former. "It is thereupon ordered that the Church, formerly agreed to be built by Richard Randolph, Gent., on the south side of Bacon's Branch, be built on Indian Town at Richmond, after the same manner as in the said former agreement, was mentioned." "At a Vestry held at Richmond Town, on Tuesday, the 8th day of December, 1772, for laying the Parish levy: Present—The Rev. Miles Selden, Richard Randolph, Samuel Duval, Jos. Lewis, Rich'd Adams, Daniel Price, George Cox and Turner Southall, Vestrymen. "It is the opinion of the Vestry that an addition of forty feet in length and the same width as the present Church at Richmond, be built to it, at the north side, with gallery on both sides, and one end, with proper windows above and below; and ordered that the Church W'dns lett to the lowest bidder the said addition." These entries mark the erection and enlargement of the venerable building, the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of whose existence we this day celebrate. Let us turn the clock of time back one hundred and fifty years, and contemplate for a few moments our surroundings. Frederick the second, afterwards known as Frederick the Great, had just mounted the throne of Prussia, and without provocation had made an attack upon Austria, which proved to be the signal for a general European war, lasting seven years, and known as the war of the "Austrian succession," as it involved the right of Maria Theresa to the throne of Austria. The weak and prodigal Louis XV. was king of France, and the corruptions of the nobility and priests, together with their oppressions of the peasantry, were fast kindling the sulphurious flames which burst forth in the terrible revolution of the last of the century. His nephew, Philip of Anjou, was king of Spain, and thus the two kingdoms were linked together by Bourbon rulers, a fact destined to be of great importance in the history of Europe. Peter the Great was in his grave, and his daughter, Elizabeth, ruled over the people he had elevated to a position among the great kingdoms of this world. George II. was in the midst of his long reign in England, and was taking sides with his nephew, Frederick of Prussia. The strife raging in Europe had extended to America, where the English were at war with the Spanish and French. Thus all the world, so far as Virginia was brought in contact with it, was at war. The political firmanent of England was undergoing important changes. The corrupting influence of the celebrated Sir Robert Walpole was on the decline, and Wm. Pitt was rising in prominence, and already acknowledged to be the greatest of British orators, was soon to prove himself to be the greatest of English ministers. Dissent from the established Church was growing apace, the first steps towards religious liberty having been taken in the act of Parliament of 1689, granting religious toleration. John Wesley and George Whitfield were stirring the religious world to its depths, and founding what is now one of the strongest of religious denominations. In nothing was Virginia more dependent on England than in literature. Pope and Swift had finished their life work, and were rapidly hastening to their graves. Samuel Johnson was growing in reputation, but still struggling with poverty. Defoe, Richardson, Fielding, Thomson, Ramsey, Addison and Steele had won commanding positions in English literature, and delighted the Virginians, no less than the residents of England, with the charming productions of their pens. Hogarth was giving to the world those inimitable drawings, satirizing vice, which have immortalized him. Du Fay had, by his experiments, lately brought into notice the study of electricity, soon to be taken up and greatly enlarged by Benjamin Franklin, and destined to grow in importance, till now mankind utilizes the subtle fluid in the generation of heat, light and locomotion. Kepler and Newton had not been long in their graves, the first having with almost incredible labor and patience discovered the laws which regulate the motions of the heavenly bodies, and the second having added the great discoveries contained in the (Principia), the two having extorted from nature her dearest secrets, and laid the foundation for the wonderful knowledge we have of astronomy and natural philosophy. John Locke had performed the same office for moral philosophy in his memorable essay on the human understanding, and Bishop Butler had erected an imperishable bulwark to Christianity in his immortal "Analogy." At home we find ourselves in the midst of a most interesting period. William Gooch was Governor of Virginia, which contained about 300,000 inhabitants, of which about 125,000 were slaves. He had just agreed that the Scotch-Irish might settle the valley and enjoy religious liberty; under which agreement a bold stream of that hardy race soon poured down the valley and overflowed the Alleghanies, not only protecting the Eastern settlements from the savage foe, but in a few years controlling the political destinies of the colony. A band of 400 Virginians, commanded by the Governor, had just returned from the disastrous expedition against the city of Carthagena, where the discord between Admiral Vernon, commanding the English fleet, and Gen. Wentworth, commanding the attacking army, resulted in the sacrifice of so many brave men, and the failure of the expedition. The Virginians had nothing to console them but the fact that they, with Lawrence Washington as a leader, had displayed the greatest bravery in holding their position under a destructive fire of several hours. The expedition would have been gladly relegated to oblivion by the Virginians had not Captain Washington named his home on the Potomac after the Admiral and afterwards made it the home of the father of his country. The Spaniards, taking the offensive, had marched from Florida upon the settlers in Georgia, and been repulsed by Gen. Oglethorpe, the head of that colony, then but lately planted. Virginia had advanced rapidly in the development of her agricultural and mineral resources during the government of Governor Gooch, and of his distinguished predecessor, General Alexander Spotswood, and her tobacco had already become the source of great wealth, and was destined to be her mainstay in the troublous times which were to follow. It had at this time come to the aid of specie as a medium of exchange in the business of the colony. In 1736 the first newspaper was published in Virginia at Williamsburg. It was a weekly issue and called "The Virginia Gazette." A weekly post carried it northward, and a monthly post carried it southward. Looking more immediately to our surroundings on this spot, we find that the "Hill called Indian Town," as it is described by the Vestry, was so called because of an Indian settlement, which doubtless was found by Capt. Newport, John Smith and their companions, when they first explored the river to the falls, within a few days after landing at Jamestown in 1607. This settlement remained for years, and was broken up probably by one of the exterminating attacks of the whites, which gave the name of Bloody Run to the little stream which runs near by. Here on the north side of the river lay the quarter plantation of Nathaniel Bacon, Jr., at which the murder of his servant and overseer occurred, which caused that accomplished but impulsive man to make war on the murderous Indians against the order of the Governor, and gave rise to the celebrated Bacon's Rebellion of 1676. After the death of Bacon the Legislature in 1679 granted this in a large tract on both sides of the river, extending five miles in length and three and a half miles in width, to Capt. William Byrd, on condition that he settle on it not less than 250 tytheables, who were to be ever ready for military service against the Indians. In the year 1682, the fear of the Indians having ceased, the military force was disbanded and a trading post was established, and afterwards a tobacco warehouse was erected and called "Shockoes." In 1733 Col. Wm. Byrd, the son of Capt. Wm. Byrd, having inherited the lands at the falls of the James, determined to lay off a city at Shockoes, to be called Richmond. Major Mayo agreed to lay out the lots. In 1737 Col. Byrd advertised for settlers for the new town, and in May, 1742, the General Assembly incorporated it, and gave it the privilege of holding two fairs a year for four years. Col. Wm. Byrd, to whose generosity the Parish was indebted for a site for the Church, was the most remarkable Virginian of his day. He was a man of vast fortune, lived at Westover in a style of hospitable splendor before unknown in the colony, had collected the largest private library in America, which included a copy of the records of the London Company which settled Virginia, and was the most learned man in the colony. His writings display not only great learning, but true wit, and sometimes biting sarcasm and ridicule. His journal as commissioner to run the dividing line with North Carolina has become celebrated. He did not survive the completion of the Church more than three years, and lies buried in the garden at Westover under a marble monument which bears the following inscription and epitome of his life: "Here lieth the Honorable William Byrd, Esq. Being born to one of the amplest fortunes in this country, he was sent early to England for his education, where, under the care and direction of Sir Robert Southwell, and ever favored with his particular instructions, he made a happy proficiency in polite and various learning. By the means of the same noble friend he was introduced to the acquaintance of many of the first persons of that age for knowledge, wit, virtue, birth or high station, and particularly contracted a most intimate and bosom friendship with the learned and illustrious Charles Boyle, Earl of Orrery. He was called to the bar in the middle Temple; Studied for some time in the Low Countries, visited the Court of France, and was chosen Fellow of the Royal Society. Thus eminently fitted for the service and Ornament of his Country, he was made Receiver General of his Majesty's revenues here; was thrice appointed public agent to the Court and Ministry of England; and being thirty-seven years a member, at last became President of the Council of this Colony. To all this were added a great elegancy of taste and life, the well bred gentleman and polite companion, the splendid economist and prudent father of a family; withal the constant enemy of all exorbitant power, and hearty friend to the liberties of his country." Next to Col. Wm. Byrd, the Rev. Wm. Stith, the Rector of the Parish, was the most accomplished man in the Colony. He was at this time living at Varina, and preparing his admirable history of Virginia; for the materials of which he was confessedly greatly indebted to Col. Byrd. His culture and piety caused him to be transferred from his Parish to the Presidency of William and Mary College in 1752, which position he held till his death, in 1755. Richard Randolph, who undertook the building of the church, was also a man of mark. He lived at Curls, and had erected the church there, which was taken as a model for the original of this building. He was the son of Wm. Randolph, of Turkey Island, and he married Jane Bolling, the great-great-grand-daughter of Pocahontas. He was a member of the House of Burgesses from Henrico, Treasurer of the Colony, and the grandfather of the celebrated John Randolph of Roanoke. He died in 1748 while on a visit to England. Concerning the other Vestrymen who were present when the building of the church was determined on, we know but little. James and Bowler Cocke were successively clerks of Henrico county. John Povall and Robert Mosby were kin to if not the ancestors of the talented Valentine family of our city, to which belongs the distinguished sculptor. Thomas Williamson, whose plantation on the Brook Road competed for the site of the church, and John and James Williamson, of the Vestry, were of the family whence is descended Miss Amanda Williamson, now the widow of John Stuart, deceased, whose beautiful home, Brook Hill, was doubtless a part of Thomas Williamson's plantation. In the course of years this became the principal church in the Parish, and after being designated successively as the "Upper Church," the "Church at Richmond," "Henrico Church," the "Church on Richmond Hill," finally, about the year 1829, was named "St. John's." Since its erection some of the most important events in human history have taken place. Civil and religious liberty have advanced beyond all previous experience, not alone in America, but throughout christendom. The thirteen feeble colonies, with some two and a half millions of inhabitants, have shaken off their connection with England, and have constituted themselves into a grand republic, which has grown till it now stretches from the lakes to the Rio Grande, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and has sixty-five millions of inhabitants. Science has advanced in every department along the path pointed out by Sir Francis Bacon, until the human race may be said to live in a different world from that of our forefathers of a hundred and fifty years ago. Steam and electricity have made neighbors of the most distant nations, and the very destructiveness of the new implements of war has become the guarantee of peace. Christianity has advanced in the forefront of the world's progress, and now has a lodgment in every quarter of the globe. Could this old building speak, what a tale it would tell; not only of happenings of the outside world, but of those in and around itself! Doubtless of all the secular events which it has witnessed, the first it would speak of, as being the most important, would be the famous Convention which met within its walls on the 20th of March, 1775, and with which its name will be forever associated. Let us look for a moment at the stirring events which brought that celebrated body of men together. By the peace of Paris in 1763, England was left in possession of the whole North American Continent east of the Mississippi river, except the portion bordering on the Gulf of Mexico known as the Floridas. The wars she had been so long engaged in, had exhausted her treasury, and she sought to force her American Colonies, against all precedent, to contribute to her relief by a tax known as the Stamp Act, imposed by Parliament, a body in which the Colonies were not represented. This tax the Virginia House of Burgesses, in May, 1765, denounced as unconstitutional, null and void, and their resolutions aroused the Continent to the violent resistance of its enforcement. Finding it impossible to collect the tax, Parliament repealed the act, but in doing so reasserted its right to tax the Colonies. Later it attempted to collect a revenue by a duty on tea, and the effort met with opposition throughout America, and with such violence at Boston that the King, in order to make an example of the town, occupied it with British soldiers and closed the port. At the same time the Colonial Government of Massachusetts was changed and her liberties were restricted. In this condition of affairs the Colonies became alarmed for their rights and a General Congress was called, at the instance of Virginia, which met at Philadelphia in September in 1774 to consult as to the best steps to be taken to obtain the repeal of the oppressive acts of the British Government, under which their liberties were so sorely threatened. That celebrated body, upon which Lord Chatham and other English statesmen passed the highest encomiums, formulated a statement of the rights claimed by the Colonies; and among other able papers addressed communications to the people of Great Britain, to Parliament, and to the King, urging the repeal of the obnoxious acts. As an earnest of their determination to stand by those rights, they fixed on certain days for the stopping of all imports and exports in case their appeal was not heeded. It was the general expectation of the people and of their leaders that these measures would result in the repeal of the acts and the relief of Massachusetts. But there were one or two among the leaders who had properly estimated the stubbornness of the King and the subserviency of Parliament on the one hand, and the inflexible determination of the Americans on the other, and saw that war would be the inevitable consequence. A few months after the adjournment of the Congress the Virginia Convention convened to hear the report of its proceedings, and to deliberate on the political situation. It met in Richmond and in this church. The bitter hostility of Governor Dunmore to the patriotic cause made it unsafe to meet in Williamsburg, the capital of the Colony, and the importance and sacredness of the cause which brought the body together made it appropriate that they should deliberate in the sanctuary of God, to whom they humbly looked for guidance upon the sea of troubles on which they were launched. This the pious patriotism of the Vestry recognized, and offered to the Convention this, doubtless the largest building in the town. The interest in its deliberation was intense throughout the Colony, and many came from far and near to witness its action. The list of the members who answered to their names on assembling was as follows: The Hon. Peyton Randolph, Esq., a delegate for the city of Williamsburg. Isaac Smith, Esq., for Accomac county. Thomas Jefferson and John Walker, Esqrs., for Albemarle. John Tabb and John Winn, Esqrs., for Amelia. William Cabell, Jr., and Joseph Cabell, Esqrs., for Amherst. Thomas Lewis, Samuel McDowell and John Harvie, Esqrs., for Augusta. John Talbot and Charles Lynch, Esqrs., for Bedford. Andrew Lewis and John Bowyers, Esqrs., for Botetourt. Frederick Maclin and Henry Tazewell, Esqrs., for Brunswick. John Nicholas and Anthony Winston, Esqrs., for Buckingham. Robert Rutherford and Adam Stephen, Esqrs., for Berkeley. Edmund Pendleton and James Taylor, Esqrs., for Caroline. Benjamin Harrison and William Acrill, Esqrs., for Charles City. Paul Carrington and Isaac Reed, Esqrs., for Charlotte. Archibald Cary and Benjamin Watkins, Esqrs., for Culpeper. William Fleming and John Mayo, Esqrs, for Dinwiddie. Johnathan Clarke, Esq., and Peter Muhlenburg, Clerk, for Dunmore. Henry King and Worlich Wetswood, Esqrs., for Elizabeth City. James Edmundson and Meriwether Smith, Esqrs., for Essex. George Washington and Charles Broadwater, Esqrs., for Fairfax. Thomas Marshall and James Scott, Esqrs., for Fauquier. Isaac Zane, Esq., and Charles Minn Thurston, Clerk, for Frederick. William Christian, Esq., for Fincastle. Thomas Whiting and Lewis Burwell, Esqrs., for Gloucester. John Woodson and Thomas Mann Randolph, Esqrs., for Goochland. Nathaniel Terry and Micajah Watkins, Esqrs., for Halifax. James Mercer, Esq., for Hampshire. Patrick Henry, Jr., and John Syme, Esqrs., for Hanover. Richard Adams and Samuel Duval, Esqrs., for Henrico. Robert C. Nicholas and William Norvell, Esqrs., for James City. John S. Wills and Josiah Parker, Esqrs., for Isle of Wight. Joseph Jones and William Fitzhugh, Esqrs., for King George. George Brook and George Lyn, Esqrs., for King and Queen. Carter Braxton and William Ayelett, Esqrs., for King William. James Selden and Charles Carter, Esqrs., for Lancaster. Thomas Peyton and Josiah Clapham, Esqrs., for Loudon. Thomas Johnson and Thomas Walker, Esqrs, for Louisa. Richard Claiborne and David Garland, Esqrs., for Lunenburg. Edmund Berkeley, Esq., for Middlesex. Robert Burton and Bennett Goode, Esqrs., for Mecklenburg. Lemuel Riddick and Willis Riddick, Esqrs., for Nansemond. Burwell Bassett and Bartholomew Dandridge, Esqrs., for New Kent. Thomas Newtown and James Holt, Esqrs., for Norfolk county. John Burton, Esq., for Northampton. Rodham Kenner and Thomas Jones, Esqrs., for Northumberland. Thomas Barbour and James Taylor, Esqrs., for Orange. Peter Perkins and Benjamin Lankford, Esqrs., for Pittsylvania. Robert Lawson and John Nash, Esqrs., for Prince Edward. Richard Bland and Peter Poythress, Esqrs., for Prince George. 10 William Robinson and Christopher Wright, Esqrs., for Princess Ann. Henry Lee and Thomas Blackburn, Esqrs., for Prince William. Robert Wormley Carter and Francis Lightfoot Lee, Esqrs., for Richmond. Edwin Gray and Henry Taylor, Esqrs., for Southampton. George Stubblefield and Mann Page, Jr., Esqrs., for Spotsylvania. John Alexander and Charles Carter, Esqrs., for Stafford. Allen Cocke and Nicholas Faulcomn, Esqrs., for Surry. David Mason and Henry Lee, Esqrs., for Sussex. William Langhorn, Esq., for Warwick. Richard Henry Lee and Richard Lee, Esqrs., for Westmoreland. Dudley Diggs and Thomas Nelson, Jr., Esqrs., for York. Champion Travis, Esq., for Jamestown. Joseph Hutchings, Esq., for Norfolkburrough. These were all well tried patriots, who did not hesitate to risk their lives in attending what was denounced by the Royalists as a revolutionary body. As the Governor had frequently dissolved the House of Burgesses during the controversy with England, when they uttered sentiments not in accordance with his own, the patriots had fallen on the plan of holding conventions, which were not under his authority, and consequently were held by him to be treasonable. No Virginian can read this roll without a feeling of pride; for in all the annals of history no State has been able to collect in one deliberative body so many men of pure lives, of unselfish patriotism, and of the highest order of genius. The race and the civilization which could produce such a body of men at one period may well be held up to the admiration of the world. The members came together in ignorance of the effect of the papers of Congress in England; indeed, their latest information was contained in a letter of 14th December, 1774, relating the gracious reception by the King of the address to him; and adding that, "The buzz at court is, that all the acts will be repealed, except the admiralty and declaratory," which had not been considered very grievous. The Convention organized by electing the venerable Peyton Randolph president, who had just presided over the Continental Congress. He was escorted to a chair placed where the eastern door of the building is at present. The Rev. Miles Selden, the rector of this church, was then requested to act as chaplain to the Convention. The body next recorded their hearty approval of the proceedings of Congress, and their thanks to the Virginia delegation for the faithful discharge of the very important trust imposed on them. On the third day a petition and memorial of the Assembly of the Island of Jamaica, addressed to the King, was laid before the Convention and read. It ably defended American rights, but indicated Toryism in tracing all colonial rights to the King, and denied that the Colonists ever would attempt forcible resistance to Great Britain, dwelling at the same time on their weak condition. Upon the reading of this paper a member offered a resolution of thanks to the Assembly of Jamaica, adding: "That the Assembly be assured that it is the most ardent wish of this Colony (and we are pursuaded of the whole Colonists of North America) to see a speedy return to those halcyon days when we lived a free and happy people." Neither the address nor the resolution of thanks suited Mr. Henry, who had not hesitated to declare on the floor of the Continental Congress his conviction that war was inevitable, and who was painfully impressed with the importance of immediate preparation for it. He at once arose and offered the following resolution, to which a suitable preamble was prefixed: "Resolved, That this Colony be immediately put into a state of defence, and that————— be a committee to prepare a plan for embodying, arming, and disciplining such a number of men as may be sufficient for that purpose." This resolution was opposed by Richard Bland, Benj. Harrison of Berkley, and Edmund Pendleton, who had been Mr. Henry's associates in Congress, and by Robt. Carter Nicholas, the Treasurer of the Colony. They insisted that it was premature, and that no such step should be taken till the replies to the addresses of the Congress had been received. The reply of Mr. Henry has been rendered immortal by the report of Mr. Wirt, made up from the recollections of the hearers, and by his sounding the watchword of the revolution in the sentence, "Give me liberty or give me death." I need not repeat here his speech, which is familiar to every school boy in our land, and which has been well epitomized in the lines— "He spoke of wrongs too long endured, Of sacred rights to be secured; Then from his patriot tongue of flame The startling words for Freedom came. The stirring sentences he spake Compelled the heart to glow and quake, And, rising on his theme's broad wing, And gasping in his nervous hand The imaginary battle-brand, In face of death he dared to fling Defiance to a tyrant King." I will, however, read an account of the scene by one of the Vestry of the Church, Edmund Randolph, an eye witness. He says: "A resolution was passed for immediately putting the Colony into a posture of defence, and for preparing a plan of embodying and disciplining such a number of men as might be sufficient for that purpose. Henry moved and Richard Henry Lee seconded it. The fangs of European criticism might be challenged to spread themselves against the eloquence of that awful day. It was a proud one to a Virginian, feeling and acting with his country. Demosthenes invigorated the timid, and Cicero charmed the backward. The multitudes, many of whom had travelled to the Convention from a distance, could not suppress their emotion. Henry was his pure self. Those who had toiled in the artifices of scholastic rhetoric, were involuntarily driven into an inquiry within themselves, whether rules and forms and niceties of elocution would not have choked his native fire. It blazed so as to warm the coldest heart. In the sacred place of meeting, the church, the imagination had no difficulty to conceive, when he launched forth in solemn tones, various causes of scruples against oppressors, that the British King was lying prostrate from the thunder of heaven. Henry was thought in his attitude to resemble St. Paul while preaching at Athens, and to speak as man was never known to speak before. After every illusion had vanished, a prodigy yet remained. It was Patrick Henry, born in obscurity, poor, and without the advantages of literature, rousing the genius of his country, and binding a band of patriots together to hurl defiance at the tyranny of so formidable a nation as Great Britain. This enchantment was spontaneous obedience to the working of the soul. When he uttered what commanded respect for himself, he solicited no admiring look from those who surrounded him. If he had, he must have been abashed by meeting every eye fixed upon him. He paused, but he paused full of some rising eruption of eloquence. When he sat down, his sounds vibrated so loudly, if not in the ears, at least in the memory of his audience, that no other member, not even his friend who was to second him, was yet adventurous enough to interfere with that voice which had so recently subdued and captivated. After a few minutes Richard Henry Lee fanned and refreshed with a gale of pleasure; but the vessel of the revolution was still under the impulse of the tempest which Henry had created. "Artificial oratory fell in copious streams from the mouth of Lee, and rules of persuasion accomplished everything which rules could effect. If elegance had been personified the person of Lee would have been chosen. But Henry trampled upon rules, and yet triumphed, at this time perhaps beyond his own expectation. Jefferson was not silent. He argued closely, profoundly and warmly on the same side. The post in this revolutionary debate belonging to him was that at which the theories of republicanism were deposited. Washington was prominent, though silent. His looks bespoke a mind absorbed in meditation on his country's fate; but a positive concert between him and Henry could not more effectually have exhibited him to view than when Henry with indignation ridiculed the idea of peace `when there was no peace' and enlarged on the duty of preparing for war. "The generous and noble-minded Thomas Nelson, who now for the first time took a more than common part in a great discussion, convulsed the moderate by an ardent exclamation, in which he called God to witness that if any British troops should be landed within the county of which he was the lieutenant, he would wait for no orders, and would obey none which should forbid him to summon his militia and repel the invaders at the water edge. His temper, though it was sanguine, and had been manifested in less scenes of opposition, seemed to be more than ordinarily excited. His example told those who were happy in ease and wealth that to shrink was to be dishonored." The motion of Mr. Henry was adopted, and thus Virginia threw down the gauntlet of war in the face of Great Britain, and by determining to arm for the conflict made it inevitable, unless England receded from her position towards the Colonies. The committee appointed under the resolution were Patrick Henry, Richard Bland, Thomas Jefferson, Robert Carter Nicholas, and Edmund Pendleton. The Convention then entered upon a series of war measures, putting the Colony in a state of defence not only by raising an army, but by establishing manufacturies of articles needed in a state of war. The wisdom of Mr. Henry's motion was demonstrated by events which had already happened in England, but which were unknown in America. In January Lord Chatham had moved in the House of Lords the withdrawal of the troops from Boston, and in February he had introduced a bill for settling the troubles in America by the repeal of the obnoxious acts. Both had been voted down by large majorities, and an address to the King had been moved and carried in the House of Commons, in which it was declared that a "rebellion at this time actually exists in the province of Massachusetts Bay." Orders had also been sent to the royal officers in America to take possession of the ammunition in the Colonies. The execution of this order soon brought on the battle of Lexington, and the march of the Hanover Volunteers upon Williamsburg to force Governor Dunmore to replace the gunpowder taken from the Powder Horn Arsenal. The Virginia Convention assembled again on July 17, 1775, in this Church, and at this session the organization of the Virginia troops was completed by the election of officers, and further war measures were adopted, including the appointment of a Committee of Safety, which took charge of the affairs of the Colony and entirely superseded the Royal Government. All men saw by this time the wisdom of Mr. Henry's motion for arming the Colony, as the war had actually commenced, and Washington had been placed at the head of the American army. In justification of its action in entering upon war with Great Britain, the Convention issued an address, which is one of the ablest of the State papers of that period. It preceded the Declaration of Independence a year. In it causes of the difficulties with England are clearly set forth, and the Colony is fully justified to the world for entering upon war with the mother country. In the spirit of piety which animated our forefathers of the Revolution, and which so appropriately exhibited in this sacred edifice, this memorable paper concludes with these words: "It remains a bound duty on us to commit our cause to the justice of that Supreme Being who ruleth and ordereth all human events with unerring wisdom, most humbly beseeching Him to take this Colony, and the whole continent, under His fatherly and divine protection, and that He will be graciously pleased to soften the hearts of all who meditate evil against our land, and inspire them with the purest sentiments of justice, moderation, and brotherly affection." It thus happened that this church is directly connected with the first decisive step in Virginia in the Revolutionary War; and the fact that within its walls sat the men who debated the great question of arming the Colony and determined on taking the decisive step, trusting their all to the God of battles, has made it the object of the deepest interest to every patriot. The Revolution which followed saved not only the liberties of America, but of Great Britain as well, as has been declared by some of the greatest statesmen. Within less than six years, and near the close of the arduous struggle for independence, a very different scene was witnessed in this venerable building. During the last days of 1780 a British fleet entered Chesapeake bay and steered for James river and the city of Richmond, which had become the capital of the State. Governor Jefferson had not taken steps to defend the city in time, and on January 6, 1781, the traitor, Benedict Arnold, having landed at Westover, and marched from thence, entered the city on this side at the head of some 900 troops. Colonel Simcoe was sent to Westham and destroyed the military stores there, and Arnold destroyed what he could find in the town. That night part of his troops were quartered in this building, thus desecrating, as far as in their power, the sacred edifice. On the next day Arnold retired to his ships at Westover, annoyed on his retreat by the militia, which were gathering in force from every quarter. The traitor, despised by his own troops as well as those he had betrayed, was soon recalled from Virginia. Cornwallis, with his shattered army from the Carolinas, not long after joined the British forces here, and was met by men smarting under the disgrace of the capture of their capital. The ravages in the State and the desercration of this church were fully avenged in a few months, however, by the capture of the entire British force at Yorktown, which secured the independence of America. In the thanksgiving services which were held in the churches throughout America, none were more sincere than those within these walls. As the wheels of time rolled on civil events of the utmost importance crowded each other. Peace with England, and independence, was followed by a stronger Federal Constitution, which was adopted by Virginia in a Convention which sat in another building in Richmond, after high debate. War with the Indians, with England, and with Mexico followed in succession, but none of these disturbed the devout worshippers in this building. At last the irrepressible conflict over slavery, which smouldered and flickered ever after the Revolution, burst forth in a furious flame, and the terrible conflict between the States commenced in 1861. Richmond became the Confederate capital, and was beleaguered by immense armies, and for months the roar of battle resounded around these walls. At last the end came, and the troops of the beseigers marched past the old church to occupy the twice fallen city. In a discourse on the connection of this church with the civil history of the country, we cannot overlook the long roll of Vestrymen, among whom were so many who made their impress on their country, and who exemplified in their daily lives the truths of Christianity taught them from this sacred desk. Only a few can be mentioned here, and these mostly from among those whose names appear after 1785, when the church had a separate Vestry. Edmund Randolph was the most distinguished on this list. He was the son of the accomplished John Randolph, the King's Attorney-General for the Colony, who adhered to the Royal cause and embarked for England on the breaking out of hostilities. His son, only twenty-two years of age, made his way to the camp of Washington and offered his services to the patriot cause. He was taken into the General's military family as aide-de-camp. Soon afterwards he was elected to the Virginia Convention of May, 1776, which declared independence, and was one of the committee which framed the Bill of Rights and the Constitution—memorable papers, which have shaped the government of America, and through them are influencing all Christendom in liberalizing their governments. It should never be forgotten that this Convention, with a majority of the established Church, placed in the Bill of Rights the principle of religious liberty. The Convention placed Mr. Randolph in his father's office in organizing the new government, and he served in it and as a member of Congress till 1786, when he was made Governor of the State. While Governor he was sent to the Convention which framed the Federal Constitution, and on behalf of the Virginia delegation introduced that plan which proved to be the skeleton on which the system of government was framed. He was a member of the Virginia Convention of 1788, which adopted the Constitution, and was the first Attorney-General of the United States, and the second Secretary of State. While in that position he fell under the suspicion of Washington as the betrayer of State secrets, a suspicion which we now know was created by the false translation by an enemy of an intercepted dispatch of the French minister, Adet, to his home government. Indignantly resigning his seat in the Cabinet, he gave the key to his department to the porter, without arranging his papers. His enemies afterward claimed that he was a defaulter to the government. Conscious of his innocence of the charges which were brought against him, he yet was forced to pass the latter part of an honorable life under a cruel suspicion. Fortunately for his memory, there has now been found a letter from the French Minister to his government, written before he knew of the capture of his previous letter, which absolved Mr. Randolph from the charge of betraying State secrets, and the matter charged as a default has been fully explained, and Congress has ordered his account at the Treasury to be marked satisfied. In his latter days Mr. Randolph composed a history of Virginia, and in it he showed the true nobility of his character by the ample justice he has done his contemporaries, even where politically opposed or personally aggrieved by them. Colonel Edward Carrington entered the Revolutionary army as lieutenant-colonel of artillery in November, 1776, and was engaged in the memorable campaigns in the Carolinas, and as quartermaster to General Greene saved his army on its retreat before Cornwallis by securing its passage of the Dan. His services have been imbedded in history by Light Horse Harry Lee, in his volume on the war. This brilliant soldier, orator and writer, after describing the difficulties which beset General Greene and his retreat, adds: "In this most difficult crisis Carrington commenced his official duties; his subordinate officers, habituated to expedience, and strangers to system, his implements of every sort in a wretched condition, without a single dollar in the military chest, nevertheless he continued, by his method, his zeal, and his indefatigable industry, to give promptitude to our movements, as well as accuracy and punctuality to the supplies of subsistance, and to collect in due time all the boats upon Dan above Boyd's Ferry, at the two points designated for the passage of that river." He was afterwards at Yorktown. After the Revolution Colonel Carrington enjoyed the closest intimacy with Washington, and was consulted as to his appointments in Virginia. He also served the State as member of the Continental Congress, and was appointed Quartermaster-General by Washington when he again was put at the head of the American army. Dr. William Foushee was a prominent man in his profession and in the affairs of the city. He had the honor of giving his name to one of our streets, an honor also accorded to Colonel Richard Adams. Dr. Foushee was a graduate of the Medical College of Edinburgh, was made medical director of Virginia during the Revolution, was the president of the James River Company, was the first Mayor of Richmond, and afterwards for many years its postmaster. One of his daughters married Thomas Richie, the famous editor. Says Dr. Mordecai in his "Richmond in By-Gone Days": "Dr. Foushee was a gentleman of fine personal appearance and deportment, and a favorite physician with the ladies, who said his visits were restoratives without the aid of medicine, so bland and kind were his manners and conversation. This calm and sunshine which distinguished his medical character could be changed to storm and thunder in his political one." Thomas Adams was for years a member of the Continental Congress, and afterwards a State Senator and a member of the Convention of 1775 from Augusta county; as a member of Congress he was one of the delegation entrusted with the duty of signing for the State the articles of confederation, the first Federal Constitution in America. Thus his name is forever impressed upon the page of his country's history. Colonel Richard Adams and Samuel Duval were the members from Henrico in the Convention of March, 1775, which met in this building, and each were men of great prominence in their day. They were afterwards placed on the committee charged with the execution of the act removing the seat of government from Williamsburg to Richmond, in 1779. Richard Adams was frequently a member of the House of Burgesses, and of the Virginia Assembly. He was a man of large means, and to him the Church was indebted for its parsonage. His elegant mansion on Church Hill is still standing, and is now used as a Catholic Convent. It shared the fate of the church during the occupancy of the town by Arnold, and sheltered some of his troops; and doubtless the traitor himself. Samuel Duval was a member of the House of Burgesses and a gallant officer in the Revolution. He was a business man of high character, as is evidenced by his appointment as sheriff of the county and parish collector, offices then only conferred on men of merit and spotless integrity. Joseph and William Mayo were two brothers from Barbadoes, whose names are linked with the history of this city. They first settled at Powhatan, the residence of the Indian King, who met the English on their first visit to the falls of our river in 1607, and the second was the surveyor who in 1728-'29 ran the dividing line with North Carolina for the commission on which Colonel Byrd served. He was the Maj. Mayo who laid off the town of Richmond for Colonel Byrd, in 1737. He served in the State line during the Revolution, and in the House of Delegates afterwards. The name of these brothers is not alone preserved by their numerous and worthy descendants, but in the bridge which spans our river, erected by Colonel John Mayo, an achievement deemed of such importance that it was inscribed upon his tombstone. Colonel John Harvie was a successful lawyer, who served his country ably in many capacities. He served in the House of Burgesses, the House of Delegates, and the continental Congress, and was united with John Walker as a commissioner to treat with the Indians at Fort Pitt. He served for years as Register of the Land Office. He enjoyed the friendship of Washington, and this he could not have done had he not been, as he undoubtedly was, a man of strict integrity, and of the highest sense of honor. Through the marriage of one of his sons the family became connected with that of Chief Justice Marshall. Near Colonel Harvie resided Jacqueline Ambler, a man of similar character, who was a member of the Executive Council during the Revolution, and afterwards treasurer of the State for many years. Daniel L. Hylton, a wealthy and influential merchant, also served in the Council of State, and will be remembered when most of his contemporaries are forgotten, as his name is imbedded in the reports of the Supreme Court of the United States in the great case of Ware vs. Hylton, involving the collection of the British debts contracted before the Revolution, and confiscated by Virginia during the war. Turner Southall was a member of the Legislature for years during and after the Revolution. He was one of the most highly useful citizens of Richmond, and filled many local offices of trust and importance. Oliver P. Baldwin, the accomplished Belles Lettres scholar and brilliant writer, must not be omitted, nor George M. Carrington and John Enders, who did more, perhapse, to sustain the church than all others in its most trying time. But time would fail me to notice at length the representative men among the foremost families of Richmond who have acted as Vestrymen of this church. The families of McRobert, Pollard, McRae, Nicholson, Williamson, Greenhow, Hay, Taylor, Ambler, Baker, Shepherd, Shelton, Enders, Myers, Dove, Burton, Burwell, Lancaster, Crump, Mitchell, Cosby, Whitlock, Sublett, Van Lew, Massie, Williams, Womble, Fisher, Isaacs, Grant, Taliaferro, Palmer, Alfriend, Yarbrough, Greanor, West, Baldwin, Randolph, Johnston, Knox, Brown, Stokes, Yerby, Carrington, Glenn, Bossieux, and others who are equally worthy of mentioning, but whose representatives are still living or lately lost by death. Let us turn now for a few moments from the church to the cemetery which surrounds it. The lots given by Colonel Wm. Byrd adjacent to the church were early used for the burial of the dead, and in 1799 the city added to them and enlarged the grounds to their present proportions. For years and until the establishment of the cemetery on Shockoe Hill, in 1815, all denominations used this church-yard for the burial of their dead. The oldest date remaining on any tombstone is that which commemorates the death of Rev. Robert Rose, in 1751. This learned and able clergyman of the established Church was a prominent character in Colonial history. He was a man of affairs. He first proposed the canal along the falls of James river, and he was the friend and executor of Governor Alexander Spottswood. He left a diary which is of great value, as it gives an interesting picture of his times. Without following any chronological order, let us note a few of the graves of other prominent men who lie buried here. And first I would name Governor John Page, soldier and statesman, and at the same time so much of a theologian that his friends urged him to take holy orders. He was with Washington in the French war, served afterwards in the House of Burgesses, in the Colonial Council, in the Committee of Safety, in the Convention of 1776, which framed the State Constitution, in the first Executive Council of the State, in Congress, and finally in the office of Governor, succeeding Monroe, in 1802. On the invasion of Arnold he headed the Gloucester militia and attacked him on his retreat. He was an eminent patriot, and like Governor Thomas Nelson, he did not hesitate to use his own fortune to aid his State in the hour of her need. Near the western entrance of the church there is an unmarked grave, which is filled by one of the most illustrious of our Revolutionary patriots, the learned and accomplished Chancellor, George Wythe. From 1758 to the Revolution he served in the House of Burgesses, and prepared some of the ablest papers which appeared during the controversy with England. In 1765 he opposed Mr. Henry's resolutions against the stamp act, and in 1775, as a member of the Convention, he opposed the motion to arm the Colony, but in both instances it was because he differed with Mr. Henry in judgment, not in principle. As a member of Congress in 1776, he advocated the motion for independence, and signed the declaration. Afterwards he was made Chancellor, in which office he served many years with great distinction. He will ever be remembered as the friend and patron of Henry Clay, who read law in his office. His integrity, patriotism, urbanity, learning, and impartiality endeared him to his country, and a greater shock could not have been given to its people than was experienced when he was poisoned by a dissolute nephew, his heir expectant, who could not wait the course of nature to enjoy the inheritance, but who happily was cut off by a change of his will on his death bed. The next grave that should be mentioned is that of James Mercer, a judge of the first Virginia Court of Appeals, who, previous to his election, had the honor of serving in the House of Burgesses, in all of the Virginia Conventions, on the Committee of Safety, in the Continental Congress, and as a judge in admiralty. He died in Richmond while attending a session of the Court of Appeals, October 31, 1793, in the fifty-seventh year of his age, greatly respected and admired. Charles Coupland and General Andrew Ronald will complete my mention of the lawyers. The first was a man of great eminence in his day, and the second of such standing in his profession as to be one of the counsel in the celebrated British debt cause. Here we find the remains of that saintly man, Rev. John Buchanan, long a rector of the church, whose affectionate relations with his Presbyterian brother, the Rev. J. D. Blair, has been so often the theme of tongue and pen, and were so beautifully described in the eloquent sermon of the Bishop this morning. One minister's grave attracts our attention as seemingly out of place. It is that of Rev. William Graham, the intellectual giant of the Valley. Commencing life as a laborer on his father's farm, he acquired the rudiments of an education by studying after his day's work was over. Afterwards by teaching while studying, he passed through a classical course at Princeton, and was selected as principal of Liberty Hall Academy, which has become Washington and Lee University. He entered the ministry, but continued to conduct the academy, and when soldiers were called for in the Revolution he formed the students into a company, of which he took command, and offered their services to the State. As evidence of his varied acquirements it may be mentioned, that he wrote the Constitution adopted by the men who attempted to set up a new State in the western part of North Carolina, called the State of Franklin. And he entered into the discussion of the Federal Constitution when it was proposed, resisting its adoption in its unamended form. He was one of the most active and powerful advocates with his pen and tongue of the measures which resulted in the entire separation of Church and State in Virginia. As a clear and cogent reasoner, it is believed he had no superior among his contemporaries, and the impress of his mind has been continued on his country in the distinguished pupils he trained. The ablest of them all was Dr. Archibald Alexander, who through his presidency of the Theological Seminary at Princeton may be said to have moulded the Presbyterian Church in America. Dr. Graham died June 8, 1799, in this city, while on a visit to his friend, Colonel Robert Gamble. More than one memoir of him exists, but perhaps the most interesting is that by his distinguished pupil, Dr. Alexander. Colonel Robert Gamble, the friend of Dr. Graham, also lies buried in the yard. He was of the Scotch race which settled in Augusta county. After gallant service in the Revolution, he acquired a large fortune as a merchant, and removing to Richmond, occupied an elegant residence on the hill that bears his name. At that residence his two accomplished daughters were wedded, one to William Wirt and the other to Judge William H. Cabell. Colonel Edward Carrington lies buried, according to his request, at the spot where he stood and heard through an open window the great debate on the arming of the colonies. He felt that here the ennobling spirit of patriotism was kindled in his bosom, which animated and sustained him ever afterwards in war and in peace, and here he desired that his last resting place might be. Among the eminent physicians who are buried here may be mentioned Drs. James Currie, Andrew Leiper, with whom President William Henry Harrison studied medicine; James McClurg, one of the most eminent men of his time, who served with great distinction on the medical staff during the Revolution, and was one of the Virginia delegates to the Convention that framed the Federal Constitution; John Dove, beloved by more than one generation, and especially honored by his Masonic brethren, and James Beale, whose grave is still fresh. In this yard we also find the grave of Geddes Winston, son of the emigrant William Essex Winston, and a representative of the numerous and honorable family of Winston. But I must bring these short notices of the dead to a close, and yet there is one other I cannot omit, as his early life was most intimately linked with mine, and the recollection of his name and person fills me with the deepest emotion. In the fall of 1848 there matriculated at the University of Virginia, a youth of slender frame and of a remarkable handsome face, in which were blended sweetness and genius in an unusual degree. We attended a number of classes together, and were members of the same literary society. Soon a friendship sprung up between us such as only schoolmates enjoy, and this grew and strengthened for two sessions, until in June, 1850, we graduated together, he taking the degree in two years, an unusual feat, and only achieved by youth of extraordinary capacity and industry. When the day came for us to part, we exchanged our society badges in token of our lasting friendship, and wrote sentences in each other's autograph books breathing the warmest affection. I can recall now the pale student, in whom all had come to recognize the happy blending of the lion and the lamb, as he wrote in my book these words: "When hereafter you think of your college friends, may the most pleasant emotions be experienced by you when thinking of the most sincere of them all. John Tevis Points, Staunton, Va." Our lives, which had flowed so intimately together for two years, now diverged. I entered upon the drudgery of the law, he chose the higher calling of the Christian ministry, and prepared himself as a missionary to China, for which his great aptitude for languages seemed so well to fit him. But the deadly climate of that country soon shattered a physical constitution, never strong enough for the spirit it held, and he was forced to return with impaired health. When sufficiently restored he entered upon the duties of a country charge. In the winter of 1859-1860 he was called to this church, and was recognized at once as a model rector. Listen to the recorded testimony of his Vestry: "He found our church destitute of means and material. From a bankrupt congregation, cold and listless audience, and an emaciated Sunday school, and general supineness pervading the whole church, he introduced warmth, activity, vigor. Seats heretofore vacant suddenly became filled to repletion, and an extension of the accommodations became necessary; our treasury became adequate to the demands made upon it, and that treasury which was always the object of his deepest solicitude had accessions made to its members. The interest imparted by him to the church soon found its way to its adjunct, the Sunday school, and its crowded walls soon resounded to the 11 glad voices of a happy little congregation. We do not mean to attribute this success solely to the frequency of his public ministrations. It would be unjust to his memory were we, while according him praise in this particular, to omit to enumerate his constant devotion and attachment to his congregation, incessantly manifested by his untiring energy in visiting the sick, consoling the afflicted, sympathizing with and appropriating to himself their afflictions; ever on the alert to administer the consolations of his office and heal the wounded and broken hearted. Whether affliction visited the parlor or the garret, there was he to be found, and if one of those accustomed happy little faces was absent from its place in the Sunday school, straightway he bent his steps to know the cause of detention." But this happy pastorate was not to last long. It became apparent that the seating capacity of the building must be enlarged or a new church built. This last, which involved the abandonment of this venerated building by the congregation, was not to be thought of, and it was determined to close the building for a short period, in order to add new pews. The rector in the mean time visited his old parish in King William. While there, a guest of his kinsman, Robert E. Hill, the disease which had driven him from China returned upon him with great violence, and after a sickness of a few days, death on the 10th of June, 1860, ended his short but brilliant career. The ladies of his congregation and his brother Masons claimed the honor of placing a stone over his grave. Seldom has one tomb closed over so much consecrated learning in a youthful form. He was learned beyond his years, and was fitted with an unquenchable desire for knowledge. But he loved knowledge only as she was the handmaid of wisdom; out of the service of her heaven-born mistress he trusted her not. "Who loves not knowledge? who shall rail Against her beauty? May she mix With men and prosper? Who shall fix Her pillars? Let her work prevail. But on her forehead sits a fire; She sets her forward countenance And leaps into the future chance, Submitting all things to desire. Half grown as yet, a child, and vain, She cannot fight the fear of death. What is she, cut from love and faith, But some wild Pallas from the brain Of demons, fiery hot to burst All barriers in her onward race For power. Let her know her place; She is the second, not the first. A Higher hand must make her mild, If all be not in vain; and guide Her footsteps, moving side by side With wisdom, like the younger child: For she is earthly of the mind, But wisdom heavenly of the soul, O, Friend, who camest to thy goal So early, leaving me behind, I would the great world grew like thee, Who grewest not alone in power And knowledge, but by year and hour In reverence and charity." But my task is done. It only remains for me to utter the sincere prayer which finds a response in the heart of every Christian patriot, that the same kind providence that has heretofore preserved this building and filled it with sacred memories may continue to keep it as the Mecca towards which an ever-increasing throng of liberty-oving pilgrims shall bend their steps; and when the sands of another hundred and fifty years shall have fallen from the hand of time, and our children and children's children shall lie with us in the tomb, may a new generation, in the full enjoyment of civil and religious liberty, gladly commemorate its three hundredth anniversary, and find a pure religion still ministering at its altar.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">SKETCHES OF THE Bishops of Virginia. REV. DR. DAVID GRIFFITH. BY J. STAUNTON MOORE. Rev. Dr. David Griffith was chosen Bishop of Virginia by the second Virginia Convention, held in 1786, by a vote of 32 out of 49. He resigned his claim upon that office in May, 1789. He was the de facto Bishop of Virginia for this period, but was not such de jure. At the Convention held in Richmond in 1787, Dr. Griffith was its president. The Convention urged the churches to raise funds to pay the expenses incident to the consecration of a Bishop, and instructed the Standing Committee to apply without delay to Bishops White and Provost, or either of them, to admit the Rev. Dr. Griffith to consecration, by whom the request would have been granted but for the obligation to the English Bishops, to whom they felt in honor pledged not to admit any one to consecration until three Bishops had been obtained from England. So depressed was the condition of the Church in Virginia, and so little zeal was found in her members, that it was impossible to raise funds sufficient to defray the expenses of the Bishop-elect to London. In response to the appeals of the clergy, only twenty-eight pounds were raised, a sum totally inadequate for the purpose. Dr. Griffith's want of means were so limited he could not himself bear the expense across the Atlantic. Dr. Griffith, as shown by Saffell's Records of the Revoutionary War, was both chaplain and surgeon of the Third Virginia Regiment, as it stood in 1777-1778. The following certificate attests his service: "These are to certify that the Rev. Mr. David Griffith was recommended to the committee of Congress and appointed by me to do the duty of chaplain to my brigade at the time the committee came to Valley Forge, which I think was about the 1st of February last. Given under my hand this 16th day of October, 1778. "(Signed) Wm. Woodford, Brigadier General." The following resolution is extracted from the minutes: "In Congress July 23, 1776. "Resolved, That Dr. David Griffith be appointed to the station of chaplain and surgeon in the Third Virginia Regiment, he being a person of uncommon merit, and there being few surgeons of abilities who will enter into the army in that State. This appointment not to be drawn into precedent. That Dr. Griffith draw pay in both these capacities for the time he has served in the regiment." Under the act of the General Assembly of Virginia he received land warrants for Revolutionary services. In 1789 he was appointed by the Virginia Convention a representative to the General Convention at Philadelphia, which met that year in Philadelphia. His health at this time was feeble; he reached the city, but was never able to take his seat. He died at the house of the Bishop of Pennsylvania on the 3d day of August, 1789, and the journals of the Convention attest the respect which was entertained for his character. The senior clergymen of the deputation from each State attended his funeral as pallbearers, the residue of the Convention as mourners, while his friends, Bishop White and Mr. Andrews, the lay delegate for Virginia, were chief mourners. Dr. Griffith was born in the city of New York, and was educated partly in that place and partly in England for the medical profession. After taking his degree in London, he returned to America and entered on the practice of his profession in New York about the year of 1763. Determined to enter the ministry of the Episcopal Church, he went to London in 1770, and was ordained by Bishop Terrick, August 19th of that year, and returned as missionary to Gloucester county, New Jersey. The following year he accepted the charge of Shelbourne Parish, Loudoun county, Va. He continued in it until May, 1776, when—being an American not only in birth, but in heart—he entered the service as chaplain and surgeon. He continued in this service until 1779. In 1780 he became the minister of Christ Church, Alexandria. He is represented as a man of good size and prepossessing appearance and pleasant manners, and as enjoying the confidence of General Washington and the army. From the year of 1780 to his death, in 1789, Dr. Griffith was the much esteemed pastor of Christ Church, Alexandria, and that called Little Falls, on the Potomac. During the greater part of his rectorship General Washington was his parishioner, having a pew in Christ Church, and Dr. Griffith was a welcomed guest at Mt. Vernon. Dr. Griffith was not only a patriot at this crucial period in the history of his country that tried men's souls, but his love for and interest in the Church shows that whilst not consecrated a Bishop according to the rubrics of the Church, his heart was thoroughly consecrated to her interests. His deep concern in the welfare of the Church and his earnest solicitude for her condition is voiced in the following letter, written in 1783, to Dr. John Buchanan: "Dear Sir,—You may recollect the conversation we had when I had the pleasure of seeing you at Richmond; that we mutually lamented the declining state of the Church of England in this country, and the pitiable situation of her clergy, especially those whose circumstances are not sufficiently independent to place them beyond the reach of want. I am satisfied our Church has yet a very great number of powerful friends, who are disposed to give it encouragement and support, and who wish to see some plan in agitation for effecting a business so important, and at this time no necessary. It is (and very justly) matter of astonishment to many that those whose more immediate duty it is to look to the concerns of their religious society should show so much indifference and indolence as the Church and clergy do, while the leaders of almost every other denomination are laboring with the greatest assiduity to increase their influence, and, by open attacks and subtle machinations, endeavoring to lessen that of every other society, particularly the Church to which you and I have the honor to belong, in whose destruction they all (Quakers and Methodists excepted) seem to agree perfectly, however they may differ in other points. Against these it behooves us to be cautious. But, unless the clergy act conjointly and agreeably to some well-regulated plan, the ruin of our Church is inevitable without the malevolence of her enemies. Considering her present situation and circumstances—without ordination, without government, without support, unprotected by the laws, and yet laboring under injurious restriction from laws which yet exist—these things considered, her destruction is sure as fate, unless some mode is adopted for her preservation. Her friends, by suffering her to continue in her present state of embarrassment, as effectually work her destruction as her avowed enemies could do by their most successful contrivances. "In the late contest for a stake of the last importance to this country, it would have been imprudent to enter on a regulation of ecclesiastical affairs, or to attempt anything that might interrupt that union which was so necessary for our mutual security and preservation. But that time, God be thanked, is happily over, and those reasons no longer exist. It seems to be high time for those whom it concerns to be engaged in the important business of regulating the affairs of the Church. I have been for some time in the hope that some of my brethren near the seat of government would have set on foot this necessary business; and my reason for addressing you at this time is to be informed whether anything of the kind is begun or intended—the time when, the place where, and manner how—and if nothing of the kind should be yet determined upon, to request of you, as your situation renders it no way inconvenient, to undertake to promote a Convention of the clergy for that purpose. I shall also presume to offer my advice. In order that the measures agreed on may be generally acceptable to the clergy and no objection remain to impede their future execution, it will be necessary to have as numerous a meeting as possible. I would recommend to have the clergy summoned to this Convention both by public notice and private information; for, as the Virginia newspapers seldom come into this and several other quarters, perhaps the end would be best answered by sending printed circular letters to all quarters of the State; if circular letters were not sent, many of the clergy might not have timely notice. I would recommend this Convention to be called on the authority of the few clergy contiguous to the seat of government—the notices to be signed by the whole of them, or one as chairman. I would advise the notices to be couched in general terms, to avoid, as much as possible, assigning reasons for it, especially such as may alarm the Dissenters and rouse them into opposition. The time for sending and publishing these notices should be near three months before the intended Convention, that the clergy might with certainty be informed of it and be prepared to leave their homes. As Richmond is near the centre of the State, I think it is the properest place to hold the Convention at. The time for holding the Convention I would recommend to be about the 20th of April next. It will be impossible to have anything like a full meeting in the winter season; and about the season I have mentioned, the weather is generally fine for travelling and the roads settled. Besides, our plans should be agreed upon previous to the session of Assembly, as we must necessarily have recourse to it for the repeal of those existing laws which made a part of the old establishment, and which, while they do exist, must prove ruinous to the Church in spite of any regulations the clergy may adopt. I have not the pleasure of knowing Mr. Blagrove, chaplain to the House of Assembly, but I think his name, or yours, or both, would not appear improperly at the bottom of the notices, or anything that will answer the purpose. If the above proposal should be adopted, I shall be much obliged to you for informing me of it as soon as it is determined on. Please direct to me at Alexandria, either by post or some private hand. If a meeting is likely to take place, it would not perhaps be amiss if yourself and our brethren in your neighborhood were to digest some plan for the consideration of the Convention. If it was well considered by sensible men what regulations were wanting and what reform necessary, it would save abundance of time. If I have timely notice, I will cheerfully devote all the spare time I have to this service. And if the Convention is resolved on, I will engage to send the notices to all the clergy in the Northern Neck above Falmouth, if the copies or a form are sent to me in time. You may remember that when I had the pleasure of seeing you I expressed a wish that a coalition might take place between us and the Dissenters; it is still my most earnest wish, but I am now satisfied it is a vain one; and I think our Church has no chance of preserving any of its ancient and excellent forms of worship, but from the united zeal and efforts of her clergy. I think it is this alone that can preserve her very existence. I am, etc., "David Griffith." RT. REV. JAMES MADISON, D. D., BISHOP OF VIRGINIA 1790 TO 1812. BY W. G. STANARD, OF THE VIRGINIA HISTORICAL SOCIETY. The Rt. Rev. James Madison, D. D., a member of the same family as President James Madison, was a son of John Madison, who was long a prominent citizen of Augusta county, and was born in 1749. He was educated at William and Mary College, and prior to the Revolution was professor of natural philosophy and mathematics in that institution. He succeeded John Camm as president of William and Mary in 1777, and in conjunction with Jefferson, then a member of the Board of Visitors, made many improvements in its constitution, notably that of introducing the elective system. In 1790 James Madison was chosen first Bishop of the Diocese of Virginia, and was consecrated at Lambeth Palace, London, in September of the same year. Bishop Madison seems to have entered upon the duties of his office with a sincere desire to elevate the character of the Church and to employ a commendable zeal in the prosecution of such measures as would be likely to promote its prosperity, but his efforts proved of but little avail, and the Church sunk so low that some even of its best friends began to despair. We know now that the disestablishment of the Church laid the foundation of its present vigor and usefulness; but at the moment this reform, like many reforms, seemed to work chiefly for evil. The loss of Church property, the poverty of the people, the moral degeneration consequent upon a long war, the violent opposition of other branches of the Church, and the spread of French infidelity combined to almost work its ruin. Though almost any one might have failed to stem the tide of destructive influences that threatened the Church in Virginia, Rt. Rev. James Madison, D. D., First Bishop of Virginia. Bishop Madison may not have been the best man for the difficult task. There is no doubt that he was learned and good, and his broad Christian charity is shown by the fact that in the General Convention of 1792 he introduced a proposition for a union "with all sincere Christians." It has been sometimes thought that his devotion to scientific subjects and to the affairs of the college detracted from his usefulness as a Bishop, and it is evident that, while profoundly a Christian, the bonds of Churchmanship lay lightly upon him. Bishop Madison married Miss Tate, of Williamsburg, and died in 1812, leaving several children. RT. REV. R. CHANNING MOORE, D. D., BISHOP OF VIRGINIA 1814 TO 1841. BY W. G. STANARD, OF THE VIRGINIA HISTORICAL SOCIETY. Richard Channing Moore, descended from a prominent New York family, and son of Thomas Moore and Elizabeth Channing his wife, was born in the city of New York on August 21, 1762, and died at Lynchburg, Va., on November 11, 1841. He was educated at King's College (now Columbia University), studied medicine, and commenced the practice of that profession, but becoming a communicant of the Episcopal Church, he not long afterwards determined to enter the ministry, and was ordained a deacon July, 1787, by Bishop Provost, of New York. Admitted to priest's orders in September of the same year, he was called to the charge of Grace Church, Rye, Westchester county. In 1789 he became the rector of St. Andrew's, Staten Island, and in 1809 of St. Stephen's, New York City. In each of these parishes he was much beloved and did very successful work. In 1814, when Dr. Moore was elected Bishop of Virginia, the Church was at its lowest ebb here, and there was only one Parish in the diocese which could promise proper support to its rector; this was the new "Monumental," in Richmond, and as there was then no "Bishop's Fund," the only way in which it was possible to provide for a bishop was to elect him rector of the new Church. For twenty-seven years he presided over a parish and a diocese alike devoted to him. The work he did can be best shown by the statement that in the Convention that called him to the Episcopate there were only seven clerical members, while at his death there were ninety-five clergy in the Diocese. As a man he was gentle, tender and sympathetic, admired and beloved by all who knew him; as a preacher eloquent, Rt. Rev. R. Channing Moore, D. D., Second Bishop of Virginia. fervent and forceful, setting forth the truths of the Bible and the teachings of his Church with earnestness and conviction. As a Bishop he was strong in his maintenance of the principles of the Church, wise and firm, but gentle in his discipline, and untiring in his labors. Bishop Moore was twice married and has many descendants in Richmond and elsewhere. RT. REV. WILLIAM MEADE, D. D., BISHOP OF VIRGINIA 1841 TO 1862. BY W. G. STANARD, OF THE VIRGINIA HISTORICAL SOCIETY. William Meade, son of Richard Kidder Meade, a distinguished officer of the Revolution, was born near Millwood, Virginia, November 11, 1789, and died in Richmond, March 14, 1862. He graduated at Princeton; studied theology, and became deacon February 14, 1811, and priest January 10, 1814. So hopeless was the state of the Church at the time of his ordination—only one person having been ordained for a long time by Bishop Madison, "and he," says Bishop Meade, "a most unworthy one," it created surprise that a young Virginian should enter the ministry of the Episcopal Church. But William Meade was not to be daunted and he has the glory of being one of the group of godly and brave young men who at this dark time laid the foundation stone of the Church as she now exists. He became, in 1811, rector of Christ Church, Alexandria, but after two years returned to Millwood as assistant, and became rector of that Parish in 1821. On August 19, 1829, he was consecrated, in Philadelphia, Assistant Bishop of Virginia, and succeeded Bishop Moore in 1841. He had been active in the selection of Bishop Moore as leader in the movement to rebuild the fallen Church, and his labors through life, as rector and Bishop, for the same great end bore such fruits as to make them of enduring memory. Not only does the Church in Virginia owe to his devotion and tireless energy vast increase in numbers and vitality, but his personal influence and the character of his Churchmanship have left a stamp upon the Diocese which it still bears. Bishop Meade was a man of courage and convictions. With Rt. Rev. William Meade, D. D., Third Bishop of Virginia. him there were no compromises. In the intensity of his feelings in regard to right and wrong he has been compared to the best type of the old Puritan. In addition to all he accomplished in building up the Church in his native State, he was its historian. He was the author of numerous works, by far the most valuable of which is the well known "Old Churches and Families of Virginia," published in two volumes in Philadelphia in 1857. It may interest students of heredity to learn that the Bishop was descended lineally from Richard Kidder, Bishop of Bath and Wells, and also from a sister of Reginald Pole, the last Roman Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury. He was twice married, both of his wives being members of the well known Nelson family of Virginia, and he has numerous descendants. RT. REV. JOHN JOHNS, D. D. BY RT. REV. R. A. GIBSON. The Rt. Rev. John Johns, D. D., third Bishop of Virginia, was born in New Castle, Delaware, July 10, 1796. He was the son of Kensey and Anne (Van Dyke) Johns. In his eighteenth year he became a communicant of the Episcopal Church. When nineteen he was graduated from Princeton College. There he also studied theology, and with the greatest exactness, according to the testimony of the Rev. Dr. Hodge, a lifelong friend. He was ordained deacon by Bishop White in St. Peter's Church, Philadelphia, May 19, 1819, and priest probably about 1820. His first Parish, when too young for priest's orders, was All Saints Church, Frederick, Maryland. In 1829 he became rector of Old Christ Church, Baltimore. The tide of population was moving westward, a new Church was erected in 1837-'38 on Gay street (now the Church of the Messiah), of which Mr. Johns was rector, until he was consecrated Assistant Bishop of Virginia, to which office he had been elected on Saturday, May 21, 1842, at the Council in Staunton. In Monumental Church, Richmond, October 13, 1842, he was consecrated Bishop by Bishops Griswold, Meade, Ives and Whittingham. In his address to the Council the year after Bishop Meade said: "For this kind dispensation of Providence to myself and the Diocese of Virginia I have cause for daily gratitude." As the years went by Bishop Meade felt it more and more a cause of gratitude that Bishop Johns was with him. After living in Richmond a few years Bishop Johns was, in 1849, elected president of William and Mary College, to which position he remained for several years. Of this period Rt. Rev. John Johns, D. D., Fourth Bishop of Virginia. 12 Bishop Meade says: "During the five years of his continuance, notwithstanding the arduous labors of his Episcopal office, he so diligently and wisely conducted the management of the College as to produce a regular increase of the number of the students, until they had nearly reached the maximum of former times; established a better discipline than perhaps ever before had prevailed in the institution; and attracted more students of divinity to its lectures than had ever been seen there in the memory of any now living." In 1854, feeling that Alexandria was the centre of the Diocese, so far as travelling facilities were concerned, he built a house near the Theological Seminary, and in September of that year removed thither with his family. At the death of Bishop Meade, in June, 1862, he became Bishop of Virginia. The Journals of 1863 and 1864 show how busy he was in supplying the Confederate army, personally and officially, with the ministrations of the Gospel. Gen. Jackson, just before his death, sent him a special request to send, if possible, forty faithful ministers to supply that number of vacant Chaplaincies in the army on the Rappahannock. Gen. Lee added his earnest request, and the Bishop appealed to the Council. By a solemn resolution the Bishop was asked to call upon the ministers then without Parishes to render religious services to the army for such a time and at such a place as he might designate; and the whole clergy of the Council, in a body, offered themselves for the work. In 1865, the re-union of our Diocese after the war between the States took place. Bishop Johns was ready to participate in this movement, but the Diocese preferred to wait until the General Council of Confederate Dioceses sanctioned such action. Alone now in the office of the episcopate, Bishop Johns began the toilsome work of rebuilding the wasted Parishes, and cheering the many darkened homes and broken hearts of his clergy and people. The re-united Episcopal Church proved immensely attractive to the people of the Diocese and the confirmations numbered a thousand or more every year. Though blessed with an uncommon degree of health and vigor, Bishop Johns soon began to feel the incessant labor too great for one who had already attained his "three score years and ten." In the spring of 1867 he intimated his need of an assistant. The majority of the committee to whom were referred the subjects of an assistant and the division of the Diocese were in favor of a division; but as the need seemed pressing, they yielded their own wishes to the Bishop's necessity. His request was granted by the election of the Rev. Francis M. Whittle, of St. Paul's Church, Louisville, Ky. Eight years longer was our Bishop spared to us, fulfilling more than thirty-three years of a most useful and honored episcopate. The Psalmist's description was true of him, he "shall bring forth fruit in old age, his leaf also shall not wither." His love to God and his fellowman seemed to increase as he grew older. His mind and heart expanded and grew more tender. His influence in the House of Bishops was year by year more distinctly felt and acknowledged. His opening sermon at the General Convention of 1871, "The love of Christ constraineth us," touched a chord in every true Christian heart, and largely promoted the spirit of harmony and charity and missionary zeal which marked the proceedings of that body. It was at this Convention, also, our Bishop showed his unabated vigor of mind, and his skill in the command of language, as well as his increasing influence among the Bishops, by the important part he took in framing the "Declaration of the House of Bishops" on the use of the word "regenerate" in the baptismal service. It cost him nights' sleep to fix upon the single word "determine" in the sentence, "We declare that in our opinion, the word `regenerate' is not there so used as to determine that a moral change in the subject of baptism is wrought by that sacrament." But the expression was satisfactory to the two warring factions, a burning question was removed from the midst of an imperilled household of faith, and the declaration was adopted almost unanimously. On the 19th of February, 1876, the Bishop preached his last sermon, and soon after had a slight attack of paralysis. His death occurred April 5, 1876, and his burial took place on the seventh of the same month from the chapel of the Theological Seminary; Bishops Pinkney, of Maryland, and Dudley, of Kentucky, and the Rev. Dr. Packard, of the Seminary, officiating. Bishop Johns was a preacher of consummate power and of exquisite polish. His memory was trained in his seminary days on the elaborate divisions and subdivisions of "Turretin Theology" and his voice was sweetened and extraordinarily flexible. It was his habit to distribute mentally the different sections of his sermon to different parts of the church building in which he was speaking. This seemed to help his memory, for he always spoke without notes, and at the same time prevented the suggestion of the effort of speaking memoriter. The Southern Churchman of April 16, 1876, says of the Bishop: "He was devoted to the Protestant Episcopal Church, and in times when others were thought careless of such things was himself strictly rubical. He was inclined to be conservative in practice, hopeful of the future of the Church. "The influence of his steady adherance to evangelical truth and unabated confidence in the formularies and standards of our Church, will always be remembered by those who write the history of our Zion." RT. REV. F. M. WHITTLE, D. D. LL. D. BY RT. REV. R. A. GIBSON. Francis McNeece Whittle, fifth Bishop of Virginia, was the son of Mr. Fortescue Whittle, of Mecklenburg county, Va., and was born in that county July 7, 1823. He was next to the youngest of nine sons. Only one of his brothers survives him. Bishop Whittle was educated at the Episcopal High School, and taught for a while after leaving school. He entered the Virginia Seminary and graduated with the class of 1847. Of that class of fifteen he was the last survivor, except the Rec. C. Winter Bolton, of Pelhoweville, N. Y. He was ordained deason in St. Paul's Church, Alexandria, July 16, 1847, by Bishop Meade, and he was ordained priest in St. John's Church, Charleston, Va. (now West Virginia), October 8, 1848, by the same Bishop. As deacon, he was sent to Kanawha Parish, in what is now West Virginia. In October, 1849, he accepted a call to St. James's, Northam Parish, Goochland county, Va., and there fulfilled his ministry till October, 1852, when he went to Grace Church, Berryville, Va. In Berryville Bishop Whittle remained, doing not only his Parish work, but much active missionary work, until October, 1857, when he accepted the rectorship of St. Paul's Church, Louisville, Ky. Here he became a conspicuous leader in Church affairs and represented the Diocese in the General Convention. He was in Louisville during the trying times of the war between the States, and though he was known as an ardent Southern sympathizer, so high was his character, so splendid his integrity and so pure his conduct, that he lost no part of his influence or power for usefulness because of his views. On the 17th day of May, 1867, he was elected Assistant Rt. Rev. F. M. Whittle, D. D., LL. D., Fifth Bishop of Virginia. Bishop of the Diocese of Virginia, and was consecrated Bishop April 30, 1868, in St. Paul's Church, Alexandria (where he had been ordained deacon). His consecrators were Rt. Rev. John Johns, Bishop of Virginia, Rt. Rev. Alfred Lee, Bishop of Delaware, and Rt. Rev. G. T. Bedell, Bishop of Ohio. Bishop Bedell preached the sermon. Upon the death of Bishop Johns, April 5, 1876, Bishop Whittle became Bishop of Virginia. There were then twelve thousand communicants in the Diocese of Virginia, which consisted of the States of Virginia and West Virginia. The Diocese covered about sixty-seven thousand square miles of territory. Much of the travel could be done only in private conveyance, and private conveyances were scarce in the country. The ravages of the war had been only partially repaired and the Church people had suffered worse proportionately than any other part of the population. Into this field of work the Bishop threw himself with characteristic zeal, energy and self-denial, and when West Virginia had been cut off, in 1877, he held the other 42,000 square miles alone in spite of every effort on the part of clergy and laity to divide it until 1883, when Bishop Randolph was consecrated as his assistant. In 1892 the Diocese of Southern Virginia was organized with Bishop Randolph as Diocesan, and now has more communicants than the entire old Diocese had when Bishop Whittle succeeded Bishop Johns. Bishop Whittle married Emily Cary Fairfax, daughter of Stewellyn Fairfax, of Alexandria, and had five children, three of whom survived him. Bishop Whittle was a faithful and godly man, a positive man, a power and a power-making for uprightness of life in whatever company he moved. Although apparently strong beyond the ordinary, he suffered much pain and his sufferings were borne with great fortitude. In every position which he held in the Church his service was marked by diligence, faithfulness, wisdom and courage. He went in and out among his people, known of all men as a faithful minister of Jesus Christ. His character was laid out on large lines, his mind was vigorous, his memory singularly accurate and retentive, and his utterances, especially in the pulpit, were strong and emphatic to a degree which his hearers will never forget. He was buried in Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond, Va., on June 20, 1902, and the epitaph on his gravestone, after his name and title, is by his own direction simply this: "Psalm 51." Rt. Rev. R. A. Gibson, D. D., Sixth and Present Bishop of Virginia. RT. REV. ROBERT A. GIBSON, D. D. BY REV. R. A. GOODWIN. Rt. Rev. Robert A. Gibson, D. D., sixth Bishop of Virginia, was born in Petersburg, Va., on July 9, 1846. He is the son of Rev. Churchill J. Gibson, D. D., who for more than fifty years was the rector of Grace Church, Petersburg, Va. His mother was, before her marriage to Dr. Gibson, Miss Lucy Fitzhugh Atkinson, sistor of Bishop Atkinson, of North Carolina. Bishop Gibson was educated at the Episcopal High School, near Alexandria, Va., at Mt. Laurel Academy and at Hampden Sidney College. He studied theology at the Theological Seminary of Virginia, graduating in 1870. Though but a boy, he was in the Confederate Army. As a member of the Rockbridge Artillery he loyally and faithfully served his country in the last trying year of the war between the States, and reluctantly surrendered with his command at Appomattox. He was ordained deacon by Bishop Whittle in the chapel of the Theological Seminary, June 24, 1870. Immediately after his ordination he began work as missionary of what was then called the Southeastern Convocation of Virginia. He labored faithfully to revive old Parishes which had been desolated by war, and to open new places for the Church in Dinwiddie, Nottoway and three other counties on the south side of James river. While engaged in this work, he was ordained priest by Bishop Johns in Grace Church, Petersburg, Va., on the 4th of June, 1871. Obliged by sickness to leave this field of missionary work, after eighteen months of active service, he became assistant to Rev. Dr. Peterkin, of St. James Church, Richmond, Va., and continued in that position for six years. The last four years of this time his energies were given chiefly to Moore Memorial Chapel (now the Church of the Holy Trinity), which had been built by St. James' congregation as a mission. While assistant at St. James he married Miss Susan Baldwin Stuart, a daughter of Hon. A. H. H. Stuart, of Staunton, Va. The joy and success of his future ministry were doubtless increased by her earnest interest and loving sympathy in his work. In 1878 he became rector of Trinity church, Parkersburg, W. Va. The Diocese of West Virginia had but recently been organized, and Parkersburg was the Bishop's place of residence. Active, earnest work in the centre of the new Diocese was very important, and no mistake was made when Dr. Peterkin's assistant was called to do this work. During the nine years of his rectorship of Trinity church a new stone church was built and consecrated. A Parish house was built, a chapel was built on the southern edge of the Parish, and the Episcopal residence was designed and completed under the superintendence of the Vestry of his church. In 1887 he removed to Cincinnati, Ohio, to take charge of Christ church—the mother church of all that section of country. Under his rectorship the church was rebuilt, and the Constitution of the ancient corporation adapted to modern needs. The membership of the church increased, and the Sunday school was doubled. When Bishop Randolph was elected Assistant Bishop of Virginia, Mr. Gibson received a number of votes for that office. When Bishop Newton was elected he was again voted for. After the death of Bishop Newton he was elected Bishop Coadjutor of Virginia on June 30, 1897. He was consecrated on November 3d of the same year in Holy Trinity Church, Richmond, Va. His consecrators were Bishops Whittle, Peterkin and Randolph. He was presented by Bishops Peterkin and Vincent. The sermon was preached by Bishop H. M. Thompson. Bishop Gibson entered upon his new duties with his accustomed earnestness and zeal. Owing to the age and infirmities of Bishop Whittle, most of the work of the Diocese devolved upon him. Upon the death of the beloved and revered Bishop Whittle, June 18, 1902, he became the sixth Bishop of Virginia, and is now zealously leading his Diocese in its great missionary work from the mountains to the sea. Rt. Rev. J. B. Newton, D. D., Assistant Bishop of Virginia 1894-1897. RT. REV. JOHN B. NEWTON, D. D. BY REV. R. A. GOODWIN. The Rt. Rev. John Brockenbrough Newton, D. D., Bishop Coadjutor of the Diocese of Virginia, was born in Westmoreland county, Va., February 7, 1839. He was educated at the Episcopal High School near Alexandria, the Edge Hill School, and Schouler's School, near Fredericksburg. He attended a Medical School in Winchester, Va., and afterwards graduated from the Medical College of Virginia, at Richmond. At the beginning of the war he entered the Confederate army as a private in the Fortieth Virginia Regiment, Gen. A. P. Hill's division. He was soon appointed assistant surgeon; afterwards was promoted to full surgeon, in which capacity he served till the close of the war. He married Miss Roberta Page Williamson, November 5, 1862. At the close of the war he settled in his native county, and began to practice his profession. In the absence of a rector, Dr. Newton conducted lay services. While thus engaged, he felt the Master's call to enter the sacred ministry. He studied theology privately, and supported his family by practicing medicine. He was ordained deacon by Bishop Whittle, June 25, 1871, and presbyter the following year by Bishop Johns. He commenced his ministry in South Farnham Parish, Essex county, Va., where he did excellent work for four years. His next charge was St. Luke's, Norfolk, Va. In this church his work was much blessed. During his rectorship of eight years the congregation grew so steadily and rapidly that it was twice necessary to enlarge the church building. In September, 1884, he accepted a call to the Monumental church, Richmond, Va., where he worked earnestly, faithfully and successfully till the day of his ordination to the Episcopate. Dr. Newton was elected Assistant Bishop January 31, 1894, by a special Council which met in St. Paul's church, Richmond, Va. He was consecrated in Monumental church on the 16th of May, 1894. Within less than one week he was off on his first visitation through the Diocese; and from that time until his sudden death on the 28th of May, 1897, he grew in the respect, the confidence and the love of the clergy and laity of his Diocese. For several years Bishop Newton had represented the Diocese of Virginia in the General Convention. His clear judgment, high character, earnest manner and sound churchmanship won the confidence of both clergy and laity of all schools of thought. That he was called to the Episcopate in Virginia, where his whole life had been spent, and, consequently, where he was best known, shows that his brethren loved and revered his manliness and piety. As a preacher his style was simple, earnest and energetic. He preached "Jesus Christ and Him Crucified" with the true eloquence of a loving heart. He was sought for as a mission preacher, and he led many to Christ. He was a man of gentle, modest, simple habits. His heart was warm and affectionate. His mind was clear, and led straight to the truth. His life was pure, true and faithful. He was buried in Hollywood, Richmond, Va., by Bishops, clergy and laymen, who felt that a dear brother and faithful servant of God had gone to be with Christ.</field>

The vestry book has been mutilated. On the page before the burials for 1836 seven pages are cut out; these doubtless contained the burials between the above dates. Many burials were made between 1815 and 1830 of which no record exist. Thos. H. Wynne, Esq., fills an unmarked grave near the frame school building; his grave is enclosed with an iron fence. Chancellor Geo. Wythe also occupies an undesignated grave, as do hundreds of others in the old churchyard. The two last were not buried during this interim, but the fact of their burial in the churchyard is noted here because omitted from all the records.—J. S. M.] 1836.

So help you God. K NOTES. By Dr. R. A. Brock. Note 1. Curls Church.—Though the orthography Curls appears to have quite generally obtained at the period of the text, and is, we are led to conclude, the only usage at the present time, it is obviously incorrect; the derivation being undoubtedly from the Virginia family name of Curle, to members of which, grants of land, extending over a period of one hundred years, may be found recorded in the books of the State Land Registry Office. A prominent representative of the family was the patriot Wilson Roscow Curle, of the Revolutionary era. The church was situated on the north side of James river, distant some eight or nine mile below the city of Richmond. Bishop Meade terms it "the Four Mile Creek, or Curls Church," and erroneously, [as is patent from the text,] gives the time of its erection as 1748. He bases his conclusion upon the following extract from a letter bearing date that year, from Richard Randolph of Curls, to his son Richard: "Pray assist Wilkinson all you can in getting the church finished, and get the shells that will be wanted carted before the roads get bad. The joiner can inform you what shells I have at the Falls; if more are wanted you must get them."* * Old Churches and Families of Va., vol. 1, p. 138. The Randolphs frequently undertook building. It is said that William Randolph, of Turkey Island, the first of the name in the Colony of Virginia, laid the foundations of the wealth and importance of his family, from the profits acquired in "building barns."† † Grigsby's Va. Convention of 1776, p. 77. Campbell's Va., p. 424. One account states that he landed in the Colony of Virginia with a "broad-axe upon his shoulder."‡ ‡ Neill's Va. Papers. Col. Richard Randolph contracted, in 1739, to build the church at Richmond, agreeing to complete it by the 10th of June, 1741. It is not likely that it was so late as 1748 in being finished. At a meeting of the parish vestry, held October the 2d, 1742, a meeting of the Vestry was agreed upon, to be held at Curls Church in November following, to treat with undertakers for building a Chapel at Deep Run, and an appropriation was made towards the same of 10,000 lbs. of tobacco. This was, in all probability, the Church mentioned in the letter above quoted from. In May, 1826, Dr. John Adams presented to the Vestry of St. John's Church, Richmond, the baptismal font which had been used at Curls Church.§ § Ms. Vestry Book of St. John's Church. [Period commencing 1785.] It is of white marble, and is in perfect preservation. Curls Church was demolished within the past twenty years. Note 2. Col. Richard Randolph of Curls, the son of Wm. Randoph of Turkey Island, was the grandfather of that meteoric, though most erratic genius, John Randolph of Roanoke. He married Jane, the daughter of John Bolling of Cobbs, who was the great-grandson of Pocahontas, his mother being Jane, the daughter of Thomas Rolph, or Rolfe, hence the royal aboriginal descent so much vaunted by these families. Richard Randolph was a member of the House of Burgesses from Henrico, in 1740, and succeeded his brother William as Treasurer of the Colony. He died in England, December 17th, 1748, in the 58th year of his age. His widow died March 4th, 1766, aged 62 years. Mss. Mem. Book of John Randolph of Roanoke. Note 3. Thomas Jefferson.—The ancestors of the Jefferson family in Virginia are said to have emigrated from near Mount Snowden, in Wales. They were among the first settlers of the Colony. The name, Jefferson, appears as the representative from Fleur de Hundred, in the Colonial Assembly, which, by order of Governor Yeardly, was convened in the choir of the Church at Jamestown, on the 30th of July, 1619. This was the first legislative body of Europeans, [so far as our historical records exhibit,] that ever assembled in the New World. The first Jefferson of whom any definite accounts are preserved, was Thomas Jefferson, who resided at Osborne's, on James River, in the now county of Chesterfield, which was formed from Henrico in 1748. He occupied a respectable social station, and was possessed of a competency. His children were three in number—sons: Thomas, of the text, [who died in year 1731, his brother Peter being his executor,] Field and Peter, the father of President Jefferson, who was born February, 1708, and married, in 1738, Jane, the daughter of Isham Randolph, of Dungeress, in Goochland county. Peter Jefferson, though he enjoyed but few advantages of early education, was a man of vigorous intellect. Having adopted the profession of a surveyor, by continuous application he had made himself so proficient in his calling, that he was chosen, in connection with Joshua Fry, Professor of Mathematics in William and Mary College, to continue the boundary line between Virginia and North Carolina, and afterwards assisted Mr. Fry in preparing a map of the Colony of Virginia. Peter Jefferson was one of the first settlers, [about the year 1737,] of that portion of the county of Goochland which now forms that of Albemarle —the latter being formed in 1744. Goochland itself was carved from Henrico, in 1727. Peter Jefferson was a man of extraordinary physical strength; he could "head up," that is raise from their sides to an upright position, at once, two hogsheads of tobacco weighing near a thousand pounds each. He died in 1757, leaving a widow, [who survived until 1776,] with six daughters and two sons, of whom Thomas, then fourteen years of age, was the elder. Randall's Jefferson, vol. 1, pp. 5, 6. Campbtll's Va., p. 604, and the text. Note 4. Parish Levies.—By enactment, the sheriffs of the county, or an appointment of one of their number by respective parish vestries, was required to collect the public and parish levies, giving bond and security for the faithful performance of his duties. The assessments were made for loose tobacco, and for every hundred pounds paid in hogshead, an allowance of eight per cent. was made for the hogshead or "cask." The collector was empowered to distrain for failure or delay in payment. Each parish was required to support its own paupers, and the inhabitants of one parish were forbidden, under a penalty, to entertain, hire or employ any tithable person from another parish, unless he or she could produce a receipt from the collector of the parish from whence removing, for the taxes for the preceding year. All vagrants were adjudged "rogues and vagabonds," and were bound out for one year, if a hirer could be found. But if of such evil repute that no one would receive them, the County Court was empowered to order them "thirty-nine lashes on the bare back, well laid on, at the whipping-post, and then discharged." They were liable, however, to re-arrest and repeated punishment. Vagrants and paupers were authorized to be returned to the parishes of which they had last been resident. The Church Wardens were empowered to bind out, to the age of maturity, the children of such persons as were deemed incapable of supporting or bringing them up in "honest courses." Hening's Statutes, vol. III, p. 264; vol. VI, pp. 29, 32. Note 5. Joseph Mayo emigrated from the Island of Barbadoes, to Virginia, about the year 1727.* * Bishop Meade's Old Churches and Families, vol. II, p. 39. He was a merchant, and from the text, appears to have also followed surveying. His residence was Powhatan, the location of which is well authenticated as a residence of the aboriginal potentate of this name.† † Mss. Deed Book of Wm. Byrd of Westover, p. 93. It is about a half mile below Richmond, and lies "to the south of the road which runs parallel with the river, and on a verge of the second bank, or upper level of alluvium, some forty feet above the lower. The ground falls abruptly on the front or river side, and more gradually on the other quarters. On the east, the deep channel of a brook separates it from the most commanding point of the upland." Immediately on the selection of Jamestown for the seat of the Colony, "Newport, Smith and twentie others were sent to discover the head of the river. By divers small habitations they passed, in six days they arrived at a town called Powhatan, consisting of some twelve houses, pleasantly seated on a hill; before it three fertile isles; about it many of their corne-fields; the place is very pleasant, and strong by nature—of this place the prince is called Powhatan, and the people Powhatans—to this place the river is navigable; but higher, within a myle, by reason of the Rockes and Isles, there is not passage for a small Boat; this they call the Falles."‡ ‡ Smith Hist. of Va., Richmond, Reprint, 1819, vol. I, pp. 151-2. "A granite boulder, about a ton in weight, is pointed out as `Powhatan's Tombstone,' " but there is no evidence justifying the designation. It bears many traces of rude carving. A row of symmetrical holes, an inch or more deep, runs along the top. On the sloping side, are graven marks of the shape of a child's and an adult's foot, a horse-shoe, and others less distinguishable. These are obviously of far greater age than other cuttings on the same surface, which are dated 1741, and which give in two or three places, the initial M., of the family in possession: Mayo."§ § Loungings in the Footprints of the Pioneers W. C. Bruce, Harper's Mag., May, 1859. In a narrative of "Capt. Newport's discoveries, Virginia," May 21st, 1607, Powhatan is thus described: "We came to the second inlet described in the ryver; over against on Popham syde, in the habitatyon of the greate Kyng Pawatah [one of the early modes of spelling Powhatan,] which I call Pawatah's Tower. It is scituat upon a highe hill by the water syde; a playne between it and the water, twelve score over, whereon he sowes his wheate, beane, peaze, tobacco, pompions, gowrds, hempe, flaxe, &amp;c.; and were any art used to the naturall state of this place it would be a goodly habitatyon."? ? Archeologia, Americana, Trans. and Coll. Am. Ant. Soc., vol. IV, p. 44. The brother of Joseph Mayo, Major William Mayo, is supposed to have settled in the Colony about the same time. He accompanied, as one of the surveyors, in the years 1728-9, the commission which ran the dividing line between Virginia and North Carolina, so racily chronicled in the Westover Mss. He also, in 1737, laid off for Col. William Byrd, [the second of the name,] the town of Richmond. The brothers were the ancestors of the present very respectable family of Mayo in Virginia. Col. Wm. Mayo, Jr., of Pawhatan, served in the State line during the revolution, and was a member of the House of Delegates in 1780. The late Hon. Joseph Mayo, for a long series of years Mayor of Richmond, a worthy representative of this family, compiled, we have been informed, a genealogy which connected with the Mayos of England. It is to be hoped that it will be made public; the editor craves the privilege of copying. Note 6. Processioning.—By Statute, every fourth year, between the last day of September and the last day of March following, the bounds of every person's land were required to be processioned, or "gone round," and the land-marks renewed. Such marks being made by chopping the trees. The parishes were divided into precincts, and free-holders, at least two to every precinct, appointed to perform such duty. They were required to make a return, in writing, to the parish vestry of the result of their action. It was "Provided always, That the processioning and settling the bounds of any lands belonging to any person being within the age of one and twenty years, feme covert, non compos mentis, imprisoned or out of the Colony, shall not be conclusive to such person until after the expiration of six years from and after the said severall capacitys shall be removed and determined." Hening's Statutes, vol. III, pp. 327-8. Note 7. Field Jefferson, the brother of Thomas and Peter Jefferson, who died young and unmarried. Note 8. William Randolph was the second of the name, of Turkey Island, where he is buried. He married Eliza Beverley, of Gloucester county. Had issue: Beverly, of Turkey Island; Peter, of Chatsworth, and William, of Wilton. The following is the inscription upon his monument: Here lieth the Honorable William Randolph, Esquire, Eldest Son of Colo. William Randolph, of this place, and of Mary, his wife, who was of the antient and eminent family of the Ishams, of Northamptonshire. Having been introduced early into Business, and passed thro' many of the inferior offices of Government, with great reputation &amp; eminent capacity, He was at last, By his Majesty's happy choice, and the universal approbation of his country, advanced to the Council. His experience in Men &amp; Business, The native gravity &amp; dignity of his Person &amp; Behaviour, his attachments to the Interests of his Country, knowledge of the laws in general, and of the laws and Constitution of this Colony in particular, his Integrity above all calumny or suspicion, the acuteness of his parts, and the extensiveness of his genius, Together with that solidity of Sense and judgment which were predominant in all he said or did, Rendered him not only equal, but an ornament to the high office he bore, and made him universally lament'd as a most able &amp; impartial Judge, and an upright magistrate in all other respects. Neither was he less conspicuous for a certain majestic plainness of Sense and Honour, which carried him through all parts of private life with equal dignity and reputation, and deservedly obtained him the character of a just and good man in all the several duties &amp; relations of Life. Natus, Mortuus, Nov., 1681. Natus, Mortuus, Oct. 19, 1742. The following in relation to the origin of the designation, Turkey Island, we hope may not be thought uninteresting. It is extracted from a quaint tract: "A relatyon of the discovery of our river (James) from James Forke into the Maine; made by Capt. Christopher Newport, and sincerely written and observed by a gentleman of the Colony." (State paper office America and the West Indies.) The author of which has recently been determined, upon proofs adduced by Prof. William Green, LL. D., Richmond, Va., to have been Capt. Gabriel Archer. On Thursday, May 21st, 1607, (Campbell, Hist. of Va., gives the date as June 4th,) Capt. Christopher Newport "having fitted our shallop with provision"—"tooke five gentlemen, four maryners, and fourteen saylors; (the names are all given, Smith mentions only himself, Newport and twentie others,) with whom he proceeded, with a perfect resolutyon not to returne; but either to find the head of this ryver, the laake mentyoned by others heretofore, the sea againe, the mountynes Apalatsi, (Appalachian, modern,) or some issue." Having narrated a voyage of thirteen miles, the account proceeds as follows: "May 22, Friday. Omitting no tyme, we passed up some sixteen myle further." [By recent measurement, the distance from City Point, near which is Turkey Island, to Newport News, (properly and originally Newport Nuce,) has been ascertained to be thirty miles, and to Jamestown, forty miles,] where wee found an ilet, on which were many turkeys, and greate store of young byrdes like black birdes; whereof we took dyvers, which we brake our fast with all," "the ryver skants of his breadth two mile before we come to the ilet mentyoned, (which I call Turkey Ile.") Archeologia Americana—Trans. Am. Ant. Soc., Vol. IV. pp. 41-2. Note 9. John Bolling, of Cobbs, the son of Robert Bolling, (son of John and Mary Bolling, of Bolling Hall, who lived in the parish of All-halloway, or Allhallows, Barkin Parish, Town street, London, the first of the name who settled in Va.," born Dec. 26th, 1646, arrived in Va. Oct. 2d, 1660,) and Jane Rolfe, the grand-daughter of Pocahontas, was born Jan. 27th, 1676, and died April 10th, 1729. He devoted himself to commence and amassed a large fortune.* * Memois of the Bolling Family, p. 4. His daughter Jane, married the first Richard Randolph of Curles. Mr. John Bolling, Surveyor, is mentioned in 1704.† † Papers of the Virginia Church, Steevens, p. 96. Note 10. The Rev. James Keith.—The Rev. Mr. Keith removed to Maryland in 1735‡ ‡ Perry's Va. Papers, p. 358. —doubtless him of the text. The name is a prominent one now, not only in that State, but also in Pennsylvania and Virginia. Note 11. The Rev. David Mossom was born in London, Mch. 25th, 1690, and died Jan. 4th, 1767. He was the Rector of St. Peter's Church, New Kent Co., Va., for a period of forty years preceding his death. A beautiful marble tablet in the wall, on the right hand side of the pulpit, did record his virtues. "He officiated at the nuptials of General Washington, at the White House, a few miles from St. Peter's Church."? ? Bishop Meade's Old Churches, &amp;c., Vol. I, p. 386; Vol. II, p. 490. This venerable place of worship was the victim of the vandalism of the Federal troops during the late war, its associations with the memory of the Father of his Country finding no responsive chord in the breasts of those zealous patriots, to stay their vengeful hands. "The Church itself was broken and battered, and rendered wholly unfit for use. The old massive stone font, in which the children of two centuries had been baptized, was broken and scattered in fragments over the floor. The chancel was torn down, the pulpit and desk broken and defaced, and not a sash was left in the windows."§ § The Communication in the "Richmond Dispatch" of Feb. 6, 1871, over the signature "Senex." The monument to Mr. Mosson was also destroyed—nought but fragments remaining. The parishoners lately appealed to the public for contributions to aid them to so far repair the old church, that divine service might be resumed within its hallowed halls. Note 12. Darby Enroughty.—The locality, Darbytown, situate a few miles below Richmond, owes its designation to its having been at one time almost exclusively peopled by those bearing the name Darby or Enroughty. It being a remarkable fact that the two names, in common parlance among them, are regarded as synonymous and interchangeable. The first, Darby, obtaining prevalence because of its brevity and easier pronunciation. (It is claimed, and with apparent reason, that the name was originally Derby, which among the lower English classes is even now pronounced, as by those simple people.) Those of them, however, who are able to write their names, (in doing so,) generally use that of Enroughty—which name indeed a majority of them affix to legal instruments. We venture the highly probable conjecture that the individual above was the progentor of this humble, honest and simple family. His neighbors and succeeding generations, with a wayward ruthlessness which is constantly repeating itself in matters of popular designation, adopting the cognomen which least taxed their linguistic skill. Note 13. Isaac Winston.—The Winstons of Virginia are said to be descended from the ancient and honorable family of that name in England. Four of the name emigrated from Yorkshire, England, some time previous to the year 1710. Three brothers—Isaac, of the text, William Essex and James, and a cousin, Pleasant Winston. They were of the Society of Friends, and left England to enjoy freedom of religious opinion. 1. Isaac,1 resided first in Henrico and afterwards in Hanover County, Va. He married Sarah —. They had issue: 2. I. Anthony.2 3. II. William.2 4. III. Mary2 m. John Coles. 5. IV. Sarah2 m. first, Col. John Syme, second, Col. John Henry. 2. Anthony,2 (Isaac,1) b. Sept. 29th, 1723; m. Feb. 27th, 1747, Alice, (b. May 21st, 1730,) daughter of James and Alice Taylor, of Caroline Co., Va. They had issuse: I. Sarah, b. Feb. 9th, 1748, died unmarried. 6. II. Anthony, b. Nov. 25th, 1750, m. Mch. 11th, 1776, Kezia Jones. 7. III. Alice, b. Mch. 20th, 1753, m. her cousin, Judge Edmund Winston, d. Feb., 1784. IV. Martha, b. June 3d, 1759, m. Charles Woodson, of Buckingham Co. 6. Anthony3 (Anthony,2 Isaac,1) removed to Buckingham County, near the "New Store," in 1771; m. Mch. 11th, 1776, Kesia, (b. Feb. 1760,) daughter of John and Elizabeth (Walker) Jones, from Wales. Anthony Winston was a Member both of the House of Burgesses and the patriot Virginia Convention of 1775, from the County of Buckingham. He was also a Captain in the Army of the Revolution, and a gallant officer. He was the purchaser of Peter Francisco, famous for his feats of valor and strength, whom he released from slavery to allow to enlist in the patriotic army. He was sheriff of Buckingham County for a long series of years. He removed to Davidson Co., Tenn., in the autumn of 1801. Anthony and Kezia had issue: I. Anthony, b. Dec. 5th, 1782. II. John Jones, b. May 31st, 1785. III. Edmund, b. May, 2d, 1787, died in childhood. 8. IV. William, b. Mch. 24th, 1789, d. 1859. 9. V. AliceTaylor, b. Dec. 21st, 1790, m. John, son of John Pettus, of Fluvania Co., Va. His sister, Mrs. Shelton Burgess, was living May, 1871, in her 80th year, with her son John, near Bremo Bluff, Fluvanna Co. VI. Joel Walker, b. Dec. 6th, 1792. VII. Isaac, b. Jan. 22d, 1795. VIII. Mary Walker, b. Nov. 6th, 1796, m. Jesse Jones IX. Betsy, b. Sept. 15th, 1798, d. an infant. X. Edmund, (second of the name,) b. June 15th, 1801, d. since the late war. XI. Thomas, b. May 3d, 1804, settled in Davidson Co., Tenn. In 1811 or '12, all of the children of Anthony and Kezia Winston, excepting the two youngest (who remained with their parents in Tennessee,) removed to that locality of Mississippi Territory, which now constitutes Madison County, Alabama. "In 1813, when the war with the Creek nation commenced, a family council was held in Madison County, to determine which one of the seven brothers, and brothers-inlaw should be selected to remain and protect all the families," whilst the other six "went to the war." "Wm. Winston was selected on account of his firmness and prudence to protect the young families." The wives as well as their husbands were in the Council. "John Jones Winston was a Captain, and his eldest brother, Anthony, a Lieutenant in his company—the other five served in the ranks." General Jackson "was the personal friend of all these young men," and bore cheerful testimony to the gallantry of each. 10. John Anthony Winston,5 son of (William4 Anthony,3 Anthony,2 Isaac,1) d. Dec. 22d, 1871. He represented Sumpter Co., Ala., for many years in the General Assembly as Representative or Senator. He was Colonel of the — Ala. Regt., Volunteer Infantry, during the Mexican war; for two terms Governor of Alabama; President of the State Senate; Colonel Eighth Alabama Infantry, during the late war, participating in the battles fought on Virginia soil. He was elected United States Senator in 1866, but was not allowed to take his seat. He is described as having possessed an "unbending will" and a vigorous intellect. His style of speech was "bold and incisive." He was never called an orator, but as a debater, he had few, if any, equals in the State. His personal courage was undoubted. He was as he represented his family as being: "very tolerant in matters of religious faith." 11. John Jones Pettus,5 son of (John and Alice Taylor,4 Pettus, Anthony Winston,3 Anthony,2 Isaac,1) was educated for the bar, but preferred planting. He was for many years before the late war a Member of the Mississippi Legislature in both of its branches. He was twice Governor of that State. Edmund Winston Pettus, brother of the preceding, was Solicitor for the State of Alabama for eight years; Judge of the Circuit Court of the State; Major and Lieutenant Colonel 20th Regiment Alabama Infantry, and Brigadier-General Confederate States Army during the late war. He was a gallant and efficient officer, and received the encomiums of his superior officers. He is now a distinguished practitioner of law in Selma, Ala. 12. William Winston,2 son of (Isaac,1) was called Langaloo William. "He was a great hunter; had a quarter in Bedford or Albemarle County; spent half the year there hunting deer. He was fond of the Indians, and dressed like them, and was a favorite with them. An amour with the daughter of an Indian Chief, who was engaged to another Chief, involved him in difficulties with the savages. They besieged him in a log fort for a week. He defended himself with the aid of three negroes with rifles. Tom, one of the negroes, stood guard every night; at length the favorite squaw went out and made peace between the belligerents. Langaloo William was a great Indian fighter."* * Article in the Virginia Standard, 185—. He was endowed with those impassioned powers of natural and all-prevailing oratory, which rendered his nephew, Patrick Henry, the patriot, immortal. Wirt, in his life of the latter, quotes the following anecdote from a correspondent—Wm. Pope: "I have often heard my father, who was intimately acquainted with this William Winston, say, that he was the greatest orator he ever heard—Patrick Henry excepted. That during the last French and Indian war, and soon after Braddock's defeat, when the militia were marched to the frontiers of Virginia against the Indians, this William Winston was a Lieutenant of a company. That the men who were indifferently clothed, without tents, and exposed to the rigor and inclemency of the weather, discovered great aversion to the service, and were anxious and were clamorous to return to their families; when William Winston mounting a stump (the common rostrum of the field orator of Virginia,) and addressed them with keenness of invective, and declaimed with such force of eloquence on liberty and patriotism, that when he concluded, the general cry was `Let us march on; lead us against the enemy!' and they were now willing, nay anxious, to encounter all those difficulties and dangers which but a few minutes before had almost produced mutiny." William Winston2 had issue: I. Elizabeth, a beauty, m. Peter Fontaine. L II. Frances, m. Dr. Walker. III. Edmund, State Judge, m. first, his cousin, (Alice,3 daughter of Anthony,2 Isaac,1) died in 1813, in the fifth score year of his age; second, Dolly, (Dandridge) the widow of Patrick Henry.

He was an early settler of Richmond, where he was engaged in merchandizing. A small frame building recently demolished, (1871) situated on Twenty-second, between Broad and Marshall streets, was pointed out as having been his residence. Many of the timbers, though more than a century old, were in a perfect state of preservation. Major John Coles was buried beneath the old Church at Richmond, the floors of which being removed in 1857, to replace the joists which were in a decayed condition, a metallic plate, bearing his name, was found. It was, however, so much corroded that it fell to pieces. John and Mary Coles had issue: Four sons and five daughters, of whom— I. Walter m. Lightfoot, of Sandy Point. Issue: Mildred m.

The late George Winston, of Richmond, is supposed to have been a descendant of Pleasant Winston, one of the original emigrants—the connecting links cannot, however, be stated by his family. His children were: I. James. II. Pleasants, now residing in Missouri. (He makes claim to a portion of the Chimborazo property of Richmond, which was the site of a Confederate Hospital during the late war.) III. Virginia J. m. W. F. Butler; d.

Winston was Lieutenant and Adjutant of Lee's Legion of Cavalry during the Revolution. The names of John and Benjamin Winston are among the list of officers pensioned by the State of Virginia for service during the Revolution. "Joseph Winston, born in Virginia, 1746; d. near Germantown, N. C., 1814. He joined a company of rangers in 1760; was twice wounded in an Indian fight on the Greenbrier; was pensioned by the Legislature for his gallantry; removed to Stokes Sounty, N.

We take this occasion to express our indebtedness for valuable information embodied in the preceding note, which was rendered us with a prompt heartiness, by the late Hon. John Anthony Winston, of Mobile, and General Edmund Winston Pettus, of Selma, Ala.; whose action is the more highly appreciated, because they were the sole representatives of the Winston Family, from whom we received any manner of assistance—the remainder of our many applications having been entirely neglected, or met with unpardonable rudeness. Our office may have been an unimportant one; it has surely been as thankless as it has been gratuitous. Note 14. The Reverend Wm. Stith was the son of William Stith and Mary, the daughter of William Randolph, of Turkey Island. The issue of William and Mary Stith, was: I. William, b. 1789; m.

His theological studies were completed in England, where he was ordained a Minister of the Episcopal Church. On his return to Virginia, in the year 1731, he was elected Master of the Grammar-school in the College, and Chaplain to the House of Burgesses."† † Bishop Meade's Old Churches, &amp;c., Vol. I, p. 138. On the 16th of July, 1736, he was installed as Rector of Henrico Parish. At the Glebe House, of which at Varina, he wrote his history of Virginia. In August, 1752, he was elected President of William and Mary College, to which he removed, and over which he presided until his death in 1755. Note 15. Peter Randolph, of Chatsworth, was the second son of the second William Randolph, of Turkey Island. He married Lucy, daughter of Robert Bolling, of Bollingbrook. He was Clerk of the House of Burgesses, and Attorney-General of Virginia. Later, a Judge of the State Court. His portrait is at "Shirley," on James River. Note 16. Beverley Randolph, of Turkey Island, was the first son of Wm. Randolph. He married Miss Lightfoot, of Sandy Point, and had no issue. Note 17. Major John Coles.—Vide Note 13. Note 18. Richard Randolph, Jr., Member of the House of Burgesses, 1769; son of the first Richard, of Curles, married Ann, daughter of David Meade, of Nansemond County. They had issue: I. Richard married Maria Beverly, of Blandford. II. David Meade, b. 1769, d. September 22d, 1830; Col. of cavalry in the Revolution; m. Mary Randolph, of Tuckahoe. He was appointed Marshal of Virginia by Washington, which office he held until the Presidency of Mr. Jefferson when, being a Federal in politics, he was displaced. The Colonel and his lady were a jovial couple, and dispensed a generous and hearty hospitality. Their residence at Richmond was the commodious one now known as Allan's, (the present owner being the widow of the late John Allan, Esq., commonly termed "Jock," the patron of Edgar Allan Poe,) situated at the corner of Fifth and Main streets—the grounds of which extended to Sixth street. A frequent guest, Mr. Edmund W. Rootes, a prominent merchant of that day, of skillful rhyming capacity, of a highly facetious order, dubbed the Randolph mansion Moldavia, thus ingeniously uniting the christian names of host and hostess.* * Richmond in By-Gone Days, Second Ed., p. 127. "A letter from Hickory Cornhill, Esq., to his friends in the Country," humorously and graphically depicting in rhyme, the follies and vices of fashionable society of the beginning of the present century, when card playing, to which both sexes were addicted, was a feature of every social gathering, and the costumes were as ludicrous as they were indecent, is attributed to Mr. Rootes; claim, however, has also been laid for it, for both the accomplished William Wirt, and the learned St. George Tucker, the elder. We cannot decide the question upon the intrinsic or internal character of the composition, and we are much too youthful to be able to more than transmit further the several traditions. It was republished in the Southern Literary Messenger, May, 1838. It appears also in Mr. Mordicae's entertaining little book, "Richmond in By-Gone Days," Second Edition. He ascribes the lines to George Tucker. III. Brett m. Lucy Beverley, of Blandford. IV. Ryland m. Elizabeth Frayser. V. Susanna m. Benjamin Harrison, Jr., of Berkeley. VI. Jane m.

Miles Selden was the son of Joseph, first settler of the name in Virginia. He was Chaplain of the Virginia Convention of 1775. A son, Miles Selden, Jr., represented the County of Henrico, in the Virginia Assembly for several years. Note 22. Thomas Adams was one of the Delegates from Virginia to the Convention held in Philadelphia in 1778, and a signer of the articles of Confederation between the States. He was a member of the Virginia Senate of 1786, from Augusta County. He was a brother of Colonel Richard Adams, the elder. Note 23. Ryland Randolph, son of Richard Randolph, of Curles. He inherited an ample fortune, which, remarks his sarcastic Kinsman, "of Roanoke," "he squandered to the last shilling." Note 24. Turner Southall was a member, successively, of both branches of the Virginia Assembly for a series of years during the Revolutionary war, and afterwards. He was a zealous patriot and a highly useful citizen, being frequently elected to local offices of trust and importance. Note 25. Richard Adams.—This was Col. Richard Adams, the elder, (son of Ebenezer, of York County,) born in 1723; died August 2d, 1800; married April 10th, 1755, Elizabeth Griffin, (sister of Judge Cyrus Griffin, of Virginia, President of the old Congress of 1788,) born 1738, died Dec. 23d, 1800. Colonel Adams was a member of the House of Burgesses 1773; of the Convention of 1775, and of the Virginia Assembly frequently afterwards. He was an enterprising and public spirited citizen, inaugurating many and fostering most of the schemes of local improvement of his day. His means were ample and his landed possessions within the limits, and in the immediate vicinity of Richmond probably more extensive than any other, then resident. His residence on Richmond or Church Hill is still standing, being the large wooden building at the corner of 22d and Grace streets, so long occupied by the late Loftin N. Ellett, Esq., and now used as a convent by the Roman Catholic Church. When first occupied by Colonel Adams it was within the outer limits of a thick grove of forest trees, a representative of which, a primeval oak, of monarchial dimensions, is still standing a few hundred yards distant, near the corner of 24th and Grace streets. Both the mansion of Col. Adams and the venerable St. John's Church were used as barracks by the British soldiery, under the traitor Arnold, during his occupancy of Richmond in 1781. The efforts of Col. Adams to induce the tide of improvement in the growing little town and embryo city of Richmond in the direction of his landed possessions on Richmond Hill, were constant and strenuous. A venerable descendant, a grand-daughter—Mrs. Eliza Griffin Carrington, now in her 83d year, relates an authentic tradition of her childhood: That quite a warm friendship at one time existed between her ancestor and Thomas Jefferson, who was a frequent guest of Col. Adams. During a visit of the former, not long preceding the Resolution of the Assembly of Virginia, to remove the seat of government from Williamsburg to Richmond, Jefferson, who was cognizant then of the measure, pledged himself to Col. Adams, in case of its success, to secure the location of the public buildings on Richmond Hill. Colonel Adams, in view of the prospective ultimate advantages in the enhancement in value of his surrounding property, promising a donation of the requisite sites, for which were proposed commanding points. The Act for the removal of the seat of government was passed June 4th, 1779,* * Journal Ho. of Delegates, ed. Williamsburg, 1779; p. 41. though the definite location of the building was not indicated until the May term of 1780, when it was directed to be made upon Shockoe Hill. The following were the directors therein nominated to carry into effect the provisions of the Act, viz.: "His Excellency, Thomas Jefferson, esquire, Archibald Cary, Robert Carter Nicholas, Richard Adams, Edmund Randolph, Turner Southall, Robert Goode, James Buchanan, and Samuel Du Vall."† † Hening's Statutes, X; p. 318. Mr. Jefferson incurred the life long enmity of Col. Adams because of the disappointment of the latter. Colonel Adams, at a period little later, erected, in Shockoe Creek Valley, upon the site now occupied by the depot buildings of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad, a substantial and spacious market house for the convenience of the residents of Richmond Hill. Three sons of Colonel Adams were also prominent and useful citizens: Colonel Richard, Jr., (born Nov. 28th, 1760, died January 9th, 1817;) Samuel Griffin, (born May 5th, 1776, died July 15th, 1821;) (both of whom served in the Virginia Assembly,) and Dr. John, (born July 14th, 1773, died June 23d, 1825,) who was, for some time, Mayor of Richmond; a daughter, Annie, (born Oct. 27th, 1762, died Oct. 27th, 1820,) married Col. Mayo Carrington, of Cumberland County. Colonel Adams and many of his descendants lie buried in the family cemetery, provided by himself, situated at the corner of 23d and Marshall streets. It occupies one-fourth of a square, and is substantially enclosed with a high brick wall. There is within our knowledge, only one other private burying-ground for the dead within the city limits, which is that of the Pickett family, immediately adjoining this, the enclosure of which has fallen to decay, and all of its tombstones have been shattered or defaced by the sacriligeous hands of wanton urchins, who, until police surveilliance was instituted, threatened to reduce the hallowed grounds of the time eloquent St. John's, to the same lamentable condition—many of its monuments presenting painful evidences of their earnest assiduity in the heartless work of mutilation and obliteration. We are not aware that there have been any interments in the Pickett grounds for a number of years past. Colonel Richard Adams, Jr., inherited the paternal residence; his brother Samuel erected the large mansion which formerly stood at the corner of 22d and Broad streets, and which was latterly known as Bellevue Hospital. It was destroyed by fire some years since. One of the Public School Houses now occupies its site, and Dr. John built and occupied that which is now known as the Van Lew residence, situated at the corner of 24th and Grace streets. The descendants of Col. Richard Adams, the elder, are still represented by family names, the most prominent and of the first social position in the State, Note 26. John Ragland was the son of John and Anne (Beaufort) Ragland, who emigrated from Wales to the Colony of Virginia about the year 1723, and settled in Hanover Co. Grants of land to the extent of 16,000 acres are recorded in the Land Registry Office of Virginia, in the name of John Ragland.1 His issue was: I. John (of the text,) married Ann Dudley, and settled in Goochland County. II. William2 married and had issue. III. Samuel2 married and settled in Louisa County. Had issue. IV. James2 married Catharine Davis. Had issue. V. Evan2 settled in Antrim Parish, Halifax Co.; married. Had issue. VI. Pettus.2 VII. Martha2 married Thomas Tinsley. VIII. Francis2 married Jeremiah Pate. Pettus Ragland2 (John1) married Elizabeth Davis, of Hanover County. Daughter of John Davis of Wales. Had issue: I. Jean,3 born April 12th, 1755, married Wm. Chick. II. John,3 born July 29th, 1756. III. William,3 born September 17th, 1757. IV. Sarah,3 born February 5th, 1759, married William Rice. V. Elizabeth,3 born March 24th, 1760, married B. Wright. VI. Pettus,3 born July 8th, 1761.

Fendall,3 born 1780, died 1833, married Sarah, (died 1833) daughter of Edward and Amelia Nelson, who were cousins and descendants in the third generation of Edward, born 1690, (son of James Nelson, of Essex County, England,) who emigrated to Virginia in the year 1718, and married in 1719, Mary, the daughter of Edward and Jane Garland, of New Kent County, Va. The issue of Fendall3 and Sarah (Nelson) Ragland was eight sons and four daughters—of whom Elizabeth Mildred,4 born Feb. 20th, 1814, married May 19th, 1836. Robert King, (son of John Philip and Elizabeth [King] Brock,) born December 15th, 1801, died May 27th, 1850. The editor, who is of their issue, and who has much material towards a genealogical account of the Ragland, Davis, Nelson and Garland families, would most thankfully enter into correspondence with any representative of either family who may be kindly disposed to further his object. To all such, he most heartily tenders any desired information he may have in possession. Note 27. John Randolph married Francis, daughter of Richard Bland. Issue: I. Richard married Judith Randolph. II. Theodrick Bland died young. III. John, (of Roanoke) M. C. and Minister to Russia. IV. Jane Randolph. Note 28. Nathaniel Wilkinson, Member of the House of Delegates of Virginia, 1778-95. A prominent and most useful citizen. Note 29. Thomas Watkins.—The Watkins family of Virginia is supposed to be of Welsh descent. The name of James Watkins appears among the early emigrants of 1608. He may have been the ancestor of the family in Virginia. The first of the name of whom anything definite is known, was Thomas Watkins, of Swift Creek, Cumberland County, whose will bears date 1760. He had eight children. His eldest son, Thomas, of Chickahominy, (of the text) is thus spoken of by the late Benjamin Watkins Leigh, his great nephew: "Of Thomas Watkins, of Chickahominy, I have heard very full accounts from my mother, (his father was the Rev. William Leigh, of Chesterfield County,) and from my uncle Thomas, both of whom knew him well. He was a man of the highest respectability, in every point of view, and in particular, a man of indefatigable industry." He reared a large family of children, four sons and seven daughters, from whom have proceeded many descendants of various family names, in Virginia and the Southern States. His brother, Benjamin Watkins, married Miss Cary, of Warwick. He was the first clerk of Chesterfield County, which office he held until his death. He was a man of capacity and a sterling patriot. He was a member of the Convention of 1776, and took an active part in the affairs of the Revolution. One of his daughters married the Rev. Wm. Leigh, the father of the chaste and elegant orator and able statesman, Benjamin Watkins Leigh, and the pure minded and learned Judge William Leigh, who so long and spotlessly wore the ermine. Another daughter, Francis, married Wm. Finnie, of Amelia County, from whom are descended the numerous families of Finnie, Royall, Worsham, Sydnor and others, in Virginia and North Carolina. His son, Thomas Watkins, married Rebecca, the daughter of the Rev. Miles Selden; and one of their daughters was the first wife of Benjamin Watkins Leigh; another of Dr. Thomas Barksdale, of Halifax County. Note 30. William Randolph.—This is presumed to be William Randolph, of Bristol, son of Isham, of Durgeness. Note 31. Boar Swamp Church.—This church, so designated from the swamp near which it was built and which still retains its original name, was situated about twelve miles east of Richmond, upon the continuation of what is known as the Nine Mile Road. We have been informed that the original church was destroyed by fire, and another built upon its site by the Baptist denomination. The following extract determines the latter event: "About 1773, he—Rev. Elijah Baker, began to stretch his lines, and to travel more extensively. Coming down into the lower end of Henrico, he, in conjunction with one or two others, planted Boar Swamp Church."* * Semple's Hist. of Va. Baptists, p. 393. The church has been frequently repaired, and its appearance, doubtless, somewhat altered. It has for a number of years past been known as Antioch Church. M Note 32. Peter Winston.—We are led to conclude this Peter Winston to have been the son of James, one of the three brothers, emigrants to Virginia.—Vide Note 13. The issue of Peter Winston was: I. Isaac2 m. Elizabeth, daughter of Capt. Wm. Burton. II. William2 m. Martha Mosby, removed to Ky. III. Peter2 m. Louisa Mosby. IV. John2 m. Susan, daughter of Capt. John Austin, of Hanover County. Of the same family was Moses Austin, the founder of Texas, who was a merchant in Richmond in 1789. He was also engaged in the manufacture of shot, by the old method of towers, for some years. He was the contractor for covering the State Capitol with a leaden roof. V. Susan3 m. Anderson Grubbs. Isaac Winston2 (Peter.1) Issue: I. Emily3 m. Dr. Reuben Meredith. II. Elizabeth3 m.

Mrs. Mary Randolph, the wife of William, the first of the name who settled in Virginia. The date of her death was unknown to that indefatigable genealogist, her brilliant descendant, John Randolph, of Roanoke, and it has been obliterated by the ravages of time from her monument at Turkey Island. APPENDIX. A.—Bowler Cocke, p. 3, line 8. He, together with his brother, were among the patentees of the rich land of Curle's Neck, on James River, which was granted in one hundred acre lots. He was clerk of Henrico County in 1738. B.—Four-Mile Creek, p. 5, line 13. So called from its distance from Henrico Town. C.—James Cocke, p. 16, line 16. Clerk of Henrico County in 1699. D.—Cornealious's, p. 22, line 38, (Cornelious's Creek.) So called from Cornelius De Hull, who owned land contiguous to it. E.—Joseph and John Pleasants, p. 26, lines 22-3. These were the sons of John Pleasants, who emigrated to Virginia from England in the year 1665, and settled in Henrico County. The editor has in his possession a genealogical "Tree" of this family, which though unbroken as regards names, and extending almost down to the last generation, is deficient in dates. He has also manuscript material pertaining to the history of the family, who were originally, in point of religious belief, of the Society of Friends. The late Governor James Pleasants, Jr., John Hampden Pleasants, his son, the able journalist, founder and until his death in 1846 editor of the Richmond Whig, and Hugh Rose Pleasants, the brother of the latter, so well known, more recently in connection with the Richmond Press, were the descendants of Joseph Pleasants of the text. The editor desires to perfect as far as may be practicable, a genealogy of the family, and would be grateful to any of its members, who might be kindly disposed to aid him with information concerning it. F.—Robert Pleasants, p. 70, line 2. The son of John, the younger, (vide preceding note.) He possessed a vigorous intellect, and was a man of most indomitable energy. He engaged in mercantile pursuits as well as planting, and was remarkably successful in the acquisition of wealth. He owned and resided upon the Curle's Plantation. He entered heartily into all schemes of philanthropy, and agricultural and mechanical improvements. A subject, in which he was deeply interested, was the emancipation of the African race from slavery in this country—in behalf of which he was in constant correspondence with the early advocates of the measure, both here and in England. The warmest esteem existed between him and the prominent philanthropists of Pennsylvania, Anthony Benzenet, James Pemberton, John Smith and others. Though he possessed a number of slaves, he emancipated them all by will. He conducted a correspondence with Robert Bolling, Jr., of Chellowe, Buckingham county, on the culture of the vine, the manufacture of wine in Virginia, and upon kindred subjects, in 1765-70. He died near the close of the last century. G.—St. Peter's Church, New Kent County; vide note 11. Rev. David Mossom. It affords us deep gratification to be able to present the following extracts from a local announcement in the columns of the "Richmond Daily Dispatch," of the issue of November 14th, 1872, concerning this sacred relic of the past: "This old church has been substantially and beautifully repaired, and will be re-opened for service ——. The original designs which had been shamefully changed, have been restored. The high arched ceiling has been replaced, the walls replastered, finished with a hard coat, and pencilled to represent stone. A new gallery has been put up in the end of the church, and other modern improvements not inharmonious with its original design introduced. It is now one of the most beautiful, comfortable and effective of the country churches." H.—Jonathan Boucher, page XI, second foot line. John Mercer, the editor of an abridgement of the Laws of Virginia, printed by William Parks, at Williamsburg, in 1737, in a diary kept by him in Spotsylvania county, in 1766, mentions a "Parson Bouchier." Could this be adopted as the correct rendering of the name, the variable orthography of the text might readily be accounted for as apparent attempts at adaptation to its pronunciation. I.—Page XXII, foot note. New Church. Since the committal of the foregoing pages to the printer, the editor has been informed that the entire walls of the New Church were erected prior to the abandonment of the work. J.—Joseph Mayo, note 5, page 163. A recent visit of the editor to the old burying ground of the Mayo family at Powhatan,* * Now owned by Mr. Geo. S. Prince. enables him to present what he hopes will not be considered an uninteresting addition to this note. The Cemetery is in area about fifty by one hundred feet, and is well enclosed by a brick wall—several cedar trees within the inclosure, measuring nearly two feet in diameter, are evidently of indigenous growth. The Cemetery is distant from the mansion some two hundred yards, following the current of the river, (between the two, lie the recently erected depot buildings of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad.) It occupies the summit of an eminence rivalling that on which is built the mansion. Its military advantages caused its selection during our late unhappy strife as the site of fortifications, which remain a little to the left of the Cemetery, almost as well-defined as when they were manned by the heroes of the "lost cause." The Cemetery (in which there is doubtless a number of unmarked graves) contains more than a score of monuments to the dead, bearing the family names of Mayo, Poythress, Macon, Scott, Cabell, Fulton, Thom and Atkinson—among the more interesting of them are the following: [Mayo Arms.] Here lyeth interred the Body Of Joseph Mayo,* * The Joseph Mayo of the text. Gent., Born in Sumersetshire, March 25th, 1693, and died March 25th, 1740. Aged, 47 years. Near this Tomb, also lie Interred The Bodys of three of his children; who died in their infancy, viz: Joseph Mayo, born March the 28th, 1729, and died Oct. ye 9, 1732; Marianna Mayo, born May ye 24th, 1731, and died Sept. 5th, 1732; Steph., the 2d, born Sept. 18th, 1735, and died Oct'r, 1736. [Mayo Arms.] Here lyeth Interred the Body Of George Mayo, Eldest son of Joseph Mayo, was born In the Island of Barbadoes, August 30th, 1717, Died Feb. ye 19th, 1739. The two preceding are companion stones, lying side by side, prone upon the earth. They are, in dimensions, six feet six inches in length, by three feet three inches in width, and are fully five inches in thickness, the edges being rounded into the ogee form. The material is apparently a kind of marble of great hardness and density; in color, a slatish gray. The perfect preservation of the inscriptions in all of their minutiæ and the still unmarred and polished surface of the stones, are evidences of their unusual durability. The carved inscriptions were palpably by a skilled hand. The family coat of arms being most artistically executed. The Mayo coat of arms is as follows: Azure, vair gules argent, between three coronets or. Crest, a unicorn's head erased, bearing a chevron vair gules and argent. Here the arms appear with a crescent for difference, and are rendered with an Esquire's helmet surmounting the shield, and an exquisite mantling of scroll work. The two following are head-stones of gray sandstone. Sacred To the Memory of John Mayo, Who died June 17, 1786. Aged, 50 years. Inspired by a grateful recollection of parental care and protection, this stone is rais'd by Filial Affection. Sacred To the Memory of, Mary Mayo, Spouse of J. M., who died Sept. 1792, in the 60th year of her Age. Now follows a venerable couple—the tombs side by side, altar-shaped and of white marble: In Memory of Our Father, William Mayo, Who was born in the county of Gloucester Sept. 26th, 1757. Died in Richmond, August 12th, 1837. Aged, 84 years. In Memory of Our Mother, Elizabeth Poythress, Consort of William Mayo, Born in the County of Prince George, 1759. Died at Powhatan seat, Aug. 6th, 1806. Aged, 47 years. The two next are handsome monuments of white marble, obelisk in form. The inscriptions, which are presented on four sides of the one and three of the other, are as follows: N. Sacred To the Memory of Colonel John Mayo, He was born the 21st October, 1760, at Deep Creek, Powhatan county, and died at Belleville, in the County of Henrico, May 28th, 1818. Aged, 57 years and 7 months. W. He was endowed with an active mind, a feeling heart, and liberal spirit. Richmond will long remember his useful life, to which she owes various improvements, particularly the important Bridge which bears his name and connects her with Manchester. A work suggested and accomplished by individual enterprise and energy and perseverance. For many years He represented Henrico in the General Assembly, and was elected by that body A Member of the Executive Council of State, But earthly pageant's have passed away, His mortal remains lies beneath this stone, His soul humbly offers itself to God. Reader pray thou with the widowed and the fatherless, that it may be mercifully accepted and graciously appointed to Seats of Bliss. N. Sacred To the Memory of Mrs. Abigail Mayo,* * Her maiden name was De Hart, and she was a native of Elizabethtown, New Jersey. relict of the late Col. John Mayo, of Belleville, near Richmond, Virginia, The remembrance of her virtues, her strength of mind and character, her kindness and usefulness, will ever be cherished by her bereft children and friends. She lived beloved and respected, and died sincerely deplored, In the the 83rd year of Her Age. W. Obit. 2nd of October, Anno Domini 1843 S. Green be the turf above thee, Mother of our other days; None knew thee, but to love thee, None named thee, but to praise. E. Nat. 14th of February, Anno Domini 1761. We will conclude with the following inscription to the memory of two children of the late General Winfield Scott, who married a daughter of Col. John and Abigail Mayo, whose epitaphs precede this. The tomb is altar-shaped, with white marble slab and panelled slate sides, which, from the mouldering of the cement, are now falling away: In Memory of Two lovely children, John Mayo Scott, Born April 18th, 1819, Died Sept. 23rd, 1820, Buried at Montpelier, the seat of Ex-President Madison; And Edward Winfield Scott, Born Mar. 23rd, 1823, died May 17th, 1827, who lies Beneath this tomb, Sons of Winfield and Maria Mayo Scott. My soul melteth away for very heaviness, Comfort thou me, Oh, Lord! K.—Note 13. Isaac Winston. Though the origin of the Winston family in Virginia, is traditionally accepted by its members as rendered in the note, yet the following early mention of the name, which has come to the knowledge of the editor since the latter was penned, he deems it proper to offer here: He finds upon record in the Virginia Land Registry Office, grants of land to William Winston, the first, of date October 21st, 1687, and the last, 1706, numbering nearly 7,000 acres, and a grant of 1,079 acres in New Kent county, to Anthony Winston, dated October 24th, 1701. Page 171, lines 11 and 12. The editor is now conclusively satisfied that Isaac Winston1 had only two daughters, Mary and Sarah, the former of whom was grand-mother of Mrs. Madison. He extracts the following from "The Paine Family Register," No. 1, Albany, N. Y., January 1st, 1857, edited by Henry D. Paine, M. D.: "John Payne was an English gentleman of affluence and education. He settled in Goochland county on James river, Va. He married Anna Fleming, grand-daughter of Sir Thomas Fleming, second son of the Earl of Wigdon, who came to this country in 1616, and settled in New Kent county, Va., where he lived and died. John Payne,* * John Payne was of the religious tenets of the Society of Friends, and acted for a number of years as Clerk at their "Yearly Meetings" held in Hanover county. His penmanship, specimens of which are in the possession of the editor, was of great beauty, regularity and minuteness. It would thus appear that the marked and graceful caligraphy of Mrs. Madison was hereditary. his son, married Mary Coles, of Hanover county, Va. His children were: William, Temple, Dolly, Lucy, Anna, Mary, John and Isaac. William died unmarried. Dolly married James Madison, 4th President of the United States. Lucy married 1st, G. Washington; 2d, Hon. T. Todd, one of the Judges of the Supreme Court of the United States. Anna† † "A sister of Mrs. Madison, and every way worthy of the same parentage." [John Quincey Adams. married Hon. Richard Cutts, M. C. from Maine. Mary married Hon. J. J. Jackson, M. C. from Virginia. John married Miss Wilcox, of Canada. Isaac died unmarried.

It contains several monuments of white marble, one of which, erected to the memory of John Prosser, who died Oct. 25th, 1810, in his 38th year, is quite handsome. It is a plinth, some four feet in height, surmounted by an urn. The only remaining name appearing, is that of Wright, and the latest inscription bears date, 1821.

      <field name="fulltext">"October 12, 1740. "Sir: "I fhould, with great pleafure, oblige the Veftry, and particularly your felf, in granting them an Acre to build their Church upon, but there are fo many roads already through that Land, that the Damage to me would be too great to have another of a mile long cut thro' it. I fhould be very glad if you would pleafe to think Richmond a proper place, and confidering the great number of people that live below it, and would pay their Devotions there, that would not care to go fo much higher, I can't but think it would be agreeable to moft of the people, and if they will agree to have it there, I will give them two of the beft lots, that are not taken up, and befides give them any Pine Timber they can find on that Side Shockoe Creek, and Wood for burning of Bricks into the bargain. I hope the Gent. of the Veftry will believe me a Friend to the Church when I make them the Offer, and that I am both theirs, "Sir, and "Your moft Humble Serv't, "W. BYRD."</field>
