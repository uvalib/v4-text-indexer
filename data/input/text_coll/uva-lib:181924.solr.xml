      <field name="fulltext">GENERAL INDEX 1931-1945 LESTER J. CAPPON: An Appreciation THE completion of fifteen annual reports (the eleventh through the fifteenth with a cumulated index forming volume two) affords opportunity for us to pay a highly deserved tribute to the services rendered by Dr. Lester J. Cappon in the collection and preservation of historical materials. Those services have extended throughout the period covered by these fifteen reports; namely, from 1930 to 1945. They have included the initiation and a share of the execution of the archival activities at the University of Virginia, and they have been of significance also for the development of similar activities throughout the United States. In 1930 it was generally admitted that the University of Virginia had fallen far behind in the collection of manuscripts. Doctor Cappon's appointment to the new post of Archivist was made in 1930 (with the effective cooperation of Dr. Wilson Gee, Director of the University's Institute for Research in the Social Sciences) for the purpose of stimulating such collection. It was the intention, however, to make this more than a project for collection of manuscripts. Priority was to be given to a survey of the historical materials existing in Virginia which should serve as a guide to research; accessibility was to be emphasized as well as preservation; and the principle of cooperation with other state agencies was to be adopted as a definite policy of the programme. Doctor Cappon broadened the range of the undertaking by interpreting `historical materials' as including every written form of record bearing on human relationships, and he formulated far-reaching plans for the accomplishment of the project. It so happened that in this planning Doctor Cappon was a step in advance of a nationwide movement. The years between the first and the second world wars saw the emergence of a new viewpoint in historical research, in which economic and social planning became central. Involved in this movement were such organizations as the American Council of Learned Societies, the Social Science Research Council, the Public Archives Commission of the American Historical Association, the Public Documents Committee of the American Library Association, and state and national archives commissions. Developing directly out of the movement were such organizations as the Society of American Archivists and the American Association for State and Local History (in both of which Doctor Cappon has held official position). And coincident with the movement were rapid developments in microphotography. The movement was powerful enough to be able to adapt itself to such violent disturbances of social conditions as those which were injected by a worldwide economic depression and by a second world war. Doctor Cappon's plans for a survey of the manuscript resources in Virginia involved the slow and laborious investigation of each of the one hundred counties in turn. This was only well under way when the Historical Records Survey, an offspring of the depression, undertook a similar county by county examination for the whole country, and rendered further effort in this University of Virginia undertaking unnecessary. But the administrators of the Historical Records Survey turned to Doctor Cappon, as a pioneer in such a project, for counsel and for the initial direction of their efforts in Virginia. Again, when the ominous signs of an approaching second world war turned the attention of the new archival movement to the collection of war materials, Doctor Cappon was called upon to review the efforts for such collection which had been made during the first world war and to prepare a manual for systematic procedures during the progress of the coming conflict. He was also appointed the first Director for the Virginia World War II History Commission. In 1930 the University of Virginia had been far behind in its work with manuscripts. A decade later it was supplying both example and leadership. As has been stated, the actual collecting had been subordinated to broader plans for service to historical scholarship. Notwithstanding this, the growth of the manuscript collection at the University of Virginia during those fifteen years was phenomenal. Many people and agencies contributed to that growth. Doctor Cappon's own survey and collecting activities throughout the State, wide publicity concerning the receptive attitude of the University of Virginia, the opening of the Alderman Library with its special equipment for the preservation and accessibility of manuscripts, the availability of three funds for the purchase of Virginiana, both books and manuscripts (the Byrd Fund established by the family of Alfred Henry Byrd, the Coles Fund bequeathed by Walter DeR. Coles in memory of his aunt Elizabeth Cocke Coles, and the grants for the Tracy W. McGregor Library by the Trustees of McGregor Fund), the assistance rendered by the American history professors in the selection of material for purchase, the generous interest of a large number of alumni and friends of the University, and the skilled services for this collection (this should be emphasized) of of an exceptionally able staff, all contributed to the expansion of the manuscript collection from 2,177 pieces in 1929 to 1,591,984 pieces on 30 June 1945, and to such handling of the material that its use by research scholars has continued and has increased even through those fifteen tumultuous years. However widely distributed, the credit should be large for each contributing individual and agency; and a plentiful share which reaches to the very beginning should be designated for Doctor Cappon. In 1945, however, he is departing from the University of Virginia for another new post, that of Research Editor for the Institute of Early American History and Culture in Williamsburg. Regret this as we may, there is at least the assurance that our plan and practice of cooperation with other state agencies have been still further established. Furthermore we have been able to prevent the severance from becoming complete. For he is to continue his connection with the University and its Alderman Library under the title of Honorary Consultant in Archives. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE Doctor Cappon has to an unusual degree left printed record of the activities of the decade and a half covered by these fifteen reports. It was his thorough and painstaking compilation of the Bibliography of Virginia History Since 1865 (which had been prepared under the supervision of Prof. Dumas Malone and which was issued in 1930 as a monograph of the University of Virginia Institute for Research in the Social Sciences) that had called attention to his eminent fitness for the post of Archivist. During his tenure of that position he supervised the preparation of fourteen of the fifteen annual reports. (The ninth was prepared by Dr. W. Edwin Hemphill, Acting Archivist during 1938-1939 while Doctor Cappon was on leave of absence.) In these can be found statements of the original planning, details of survey and collecting activities, year by year records of the expansion of archival undertakings throughout the nation, a manual for collectors (fourteenth and fifteenth reports), and a description of the handling of manuscripts in the Alderman Library (thirteenth report). As volume one of the Guide to Virginia Historical Materials there was published in 1936 Doctor Cappon's volume on Virginia Newspapers, 1821-1935: a Bibliography with Historical Introduction and Notes, this being issued by the Appleton-Century company as a monograph of the University of Virginia Institute for Research in the Social Sciences. Other contributions towards that survey and guide took the form of the `Parish Records of the Diocese of Virginia, 1653-1900' (compiled by Doctor Cappon and published as an appendix to the fourth annual report), of the `Parish Records of the Dioceses of Southern and of Southwestern Virginia, 1648-1900' (compiled by Dr. W. Edwin Hemphill for the fifth annual report), a `Bibliography of the Unprinted Official Records of the University of Virginia' (compiled by Doctor Hemphill for the sixth annual report), a `Bibliography of Original Baptist Church Records in the Virginia Baptist Historical Society, University of Richmond' (compiled by Doctor Cappon for the seventh annual report), a `Checklist of Bound Business Records in the Manuscript Collections of the University of Virginia Library' (compiled by Mr. Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., for the eighth annual report), and a `Checklist of Newspapers to 1821 in the Alderman Library, University of Virginia' (compiled by Dr. Glenn Curtis Smith for the ninth annual report). As marking the transition of the county project to the Historical Records Survey, the first volume issued in Virginia under the national supervision, the inventory of the archives of Chesterfield County, was issued by the University of Virginia as publisher in August 1938, and contained, on pages 5-33, an essay by Doctor Cappon on `The Evolution of County Government in Virginia.' In addition there have been at least a dozen articles by Doctor Cappon on phases of the collection of historical records which have appeared in various periodical or other publications. A list of these follows. Doctor Cappon was himself the Editor of The War Records Collector from its first issue in March 1944 through the third number of volume two, which bears the date of May 1945.

      <field name="fulltext">General Index To First Fifteen Annual Reports On Historical Collections University Of Virginia Library 1931-1945 This index will serve as a partial guide to the University's archives; to the manuscripts, newspapers, and broadsides in the University's collections; to the parish records of the three Episcopal dioceses in Virginia, the main depository of which is the Virginia State Library; and to the Baptist association records located in the Virginia Baptist Historical Society, at the University of Richmond. It supplants the general index issued in 1940 for the first ten annual reports, and includes the appendices covering church records, bound business records, and University archives, which were omitted from that index. Index entries to each annual report by number, as well as by page, are made necessary by the lack of continuous pagination, and it should be noted that in the case of the appendices, numbers refer to items, and not to pages. Since materials pertaining to Virginia predominate in the University's manuscript collections, Virginia subject headings appear as main entries, with relatively few appearing as subheadings under "Virginia." Place names should be assumed to be in Virginia unless otherwise identified. Information on towns and cities, especially those of recent origin, should be sought also under the name of the county. Parish names are in general not identified by county. Such information is readily available in other sources, and the Virginia counties were formed from the parishes, hence the same parish may belong to more than one county. Italics are used for titles, for names of ships, and for names of country estates. Abbreviations are those in common use. Like the annual reports, this index is the joint product of the staff of the Division of Rare Books and Manuscripts. I have read it critically, and am responsible for its faults. Francis L.
