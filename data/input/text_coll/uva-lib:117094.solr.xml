Assistant in Economics Howard Daniel Goldman Assistant in Economics Wilkie Wysor Hunt Assistant in Accounting GENERAL STATEMENT The development of separate schools of Commerce and Business Administration in the colleges and universities of the United States has taken place within a comparatively recent period. Only three such schools had been established prior to 1900, but since that year the teaching of Economics, Commerce and Business Administration has had a rapid development. Separate schools exist in a score or more of the larger institutions and nearly all schools of collegiate grade offer one or more courses in the field. The large demand for business training developed somewhat less rapidly in the colleges and universities of the South than in those of the Northern States. Owing partly to this fact and partly also to an insufficiency of funds for the establishment of new departments, the growth of Business Schools in the South has taken place almost entirely in less than a decade. Courses in Political Economy have been given by the University from the opening of its doors to students in 1825 continuously to the present time. Some of the courses taught at the beginning were, the Principles of Political Economy, Money and Banking and Statistics. Later a course in Sociology was given. From 1825 to 1868 the work formed a part of the School of Moral Philosophy, and after that date was connected with the School of History. In 1906 the School of Economics was established separately. In 1915 the University extended the work already being given in Economics by the addition of courses in Business Law and Economic Geography. In response to the insistent demand which came during and since the World War, the following courses were added to the School of Economics in 1918: Accounting, Statistics, Money and Banking, International Trade, Business Organization and Corporation Finance. Several other courses were offered a year later. In 1920 President Alderman in a statement on the needs of the University spoke as follows: "The University has for years sought to train for his career the great lawyer, doctor, engineer and teacher. It most earnestly seeks the opportunity to train the great business man for his career in these days of great specialization and amazing opportunity which await the country and South in this field. Something much greater and wider than the ordinary business college is contemplated. The complexity of the modern industrial and commercial situation is bewildering unless special training is provided. We owe something to this vocation which absorbs two-thirds of our youth. The training we propose would not be calculated to lead a youth to look merely for a higher rate of interest or profit, but would fit him to compete with all comers in interstate and international trade, to keep faith with everybody, to understand foreign languages and peoples, and to comprehend the laws and methods of wise and just commerce." In 1920 the School of Commerce was organized and in the spring of 1921 Mr. Paul Goodloe McIntire gave the University the sum of $200,000 as an endowment for the School. As the result of Mr. McIntire's gift, the income from which became available with the session of 1922-1923, the University has been enabled to take a leading position in business instruction in Southern Universities. The faculty has been increased by the appointment of four new members and by the addition of several instructors and assistants. Special lecturers will supplement the work of the regular faculty from time to time. A well defined course of study leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Commerce has been established. AIMS AND STANDARDS The School aims to give thorough training in the fundamental principles underlying business. While this necessitates a knowledge of facts and methods, it is not the primary purpose to concentrate on those details of business which should be quickly grasped by the man with a trained mind after he enters his chosen field. The definite objective is to train for leadership in business, rather than to train the student merely to become a worker in a business house. It is the aim also to foster the development of the professional point of view. In keeping with the ideals of other schools and departments of the University, the student will be given every encouragement to achieve a high position in business leadership and service. ACCOUNTING The modern business corporation requires constant analysis by means of proper methods of accounting. The several courses which are offered by the School of Commerce in this field are designed to give the student training in the recognized forms and principles of this subject, to prepare him for the profession of accountancy and for accounting work in business concerns and public service bureaus. It also offers general preparation necessary for the C. P. A. examination. All students applying for the Bachelor of Science in Commerce are required to take the course in Elementary Accounting. BANKING AND FINANCE The success of any business enterprise today is dependent to a large extent upon a sound knowledge by its leaders of the laws of banking and finance. Business men who have been highly successful in the producing or distributing phases of business often manifest a lamentably weak judgment in their financial policies. Training in banking and finance has come to be recognized as essential not only to the professional banker but also to the business man. In addition to the courses in money and banking, a course in corporation finance is given which treats of the financial policies of corporations with respect to the kinds of securities they may issue, the administration of income and related subjects and the various types of corporate government and municipal bonds with respect to their investment status. COMMERCE AND TRADE The work in commerce and trade is divided into several courses, depending upon the nature of the specialized fields included in these terms. The economic resources and development of the principal trading countries of the world are studied, particular attention being given to their relationship to American Commerce. In the treatment of ocean navigation and trade routes, special emphasis is placed upon the underlying principles governing the movement of commodities. An advanced course in foreign trade is also given, which deals with the forms and methods of commerce, business practices abroad, foreign tariffs, sales methods, credit factors, and foreign exchange. The principles and applied problems arising in connection with domestic trade are treated in the courses devoted to Marketing, Business Organization, and the Economics of Agriculture. Emphasis is placed upon the distributing agencies of farm products and manufactured goods, the evolution of the middleman in modern trade, and the factors determining marketing costs. Consideration is given in this branch of the subject to certain fundamental differences between wholesale and retail trade and the economics and psychology of advertising. TRANSPORTATION The subject of Transportation under modern conditions is very complex. The principles governing railroad transportation are in many respects different from those governing water transportation, and those governing motor transportation different from either. The subject of ocean shipping, including freight rates and handling facilities, is taken up in connection with Foreign Trade. On account of its great importance the study of railroad transportation is receiving increasing attention from students in commerce and business. The work in this subject covers the economic principles of railroad transportation, the location of systems, operating revenues and expenditures, railway finance, accounting, reorganizations and receiverships. Attention is directed to the organization of the freight and passenger services, the general forms of corporate organization and the relationship of the railroad to the general public. Special emphasis is placed upon the character and development of rate-making agencies and systems, and the relationship between railroad rates and industrial growth. BUSINESS ORGANIZATION The typical business unit of today is highly organized. The course in commerce embraces a study of the principal forms of organization and their legal status. Special attention is given to the growth of corporations and combinations, to the study of the relative economic efficiency of small- and large-scale production in various forms of business. The development of large marketing organizations in recent times is also treated as a phase of the general movement toward larger business units and wider cooperation in business. The subject of "scientific management" is given considerable emphasis. Other topics which receive special study in this subject are the personnel of the business establishment, the relations of labor and capital and the means by which industrial harmony may be promoted, the organization of the different groups of workers in a plant for increased production, and the general economic effects of improper sanitation, too great fatigue, monotony of work and general discontent. STATISTICS A method of analyzing economic problems in any field of business is advantageous to the student and to the executive. A course in Statistics treats of the principles and methods whereby economic problems may be taken out of the realm of conjecture and definite conclusions obtained. The course deals, not with the collection of statistics, but with the devices for using them, such as averages, index numbers, correlation, etc. PUBLIC SERVICE The rapid growth in the functions and forms of activity of all branches of government service has made it highly important that those who wish to enter this field should receive special training. The University is especially desirous of providing such training and ample facilities are offered in the study of our federal system of government, and the spheres of authority exercised by the state and local units. Opportunities are afforded for the study of foreign and diplomatic service, and a wide range of courses may be selected in the customs, languages and literature of foreign countries. Likewise provision is made as fully as possible by which the student may gain familiarity with the various federal bureaus and agencies at Washington. Free use is made of governmental documents, attention being given not only to the contents of these but also to the forms and methods of preparation. The significance of the statistical data presented in the various reports of such agencies as the Census Bureau, Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, Interstate Commerce Commission, Bureau of Labor Statistics, etc., is also shown. A similar study is made of the State documents of Virginia and of other States. FIELD WORK It is the purpose of the School to supplement the class room instruction with field work whenever this is feasible. Students will be assigned problems which require first hand investigation in the business houses of Charlottesville. In this way concrete information may be obtained in such courses as Accounting, Business Organization, Marketing, Banking, Public Finance, etc. SURVEYS OF VIRGINIA COUNTIES The University has recently added courses in Agricultral Economics and in Surveys of Virginia Counties. The latter work embraces detailed studies at first hand of the economic and social conditions in representative counties of the State, with a view to pointing out the particular needs and opportunities in each county. The surveys, when completed, will be published as bulletins of the University. It is hoped that in this way the University will be able to increase its service materially in the rural life of Virginia. LIBRARY EQUIPMENT The general library contains more than ninety thousand volumes, including the standard works in history, literature and science, and is particularly rich in materials for the study of the causes, the conduct, and the results of the world war, and generally of political, social and economic achievements and tendencies. The reference section is well supplied with journals, encyclopedias and research documents. It has been the effort of the School of Commerce primarily to secure the standard publications in all lines of economic and commercial activity. Additions are constantly being made to the library equipment of such books as have received recognition from authorities in the various fields of commerce and business. While the University aims to maintain a fairly complete selection of books in this field, more care is given to the selection than to the number of publications secured. The library subscribes to the leading American publications on commerce and finance and to some of the principal English journals. The periodicals are regularly used for reference purposes, and students are urged to keep in constant touch with current business news and problems. The library also contains complete sets of the more important magazines in the field of economic theory which are of especial use to those who wish to engage in research. POSITIONS FOR GRADUATES The School of Commerce has been quite successful in securing positions for its graduates. Through the members of its Faculty it has been able to maintain a connection with business firms, banking institutions, government bureaus, etc., which has enabled it to obtain employment for students who have made a good record in the School. Graduates of the University who have received extensive training in the School of Economics and School of Commerce have experienced little difficulty in finding satisfactory positions. EXPENSES Students in the School of Commerce are subject only to the regular fees of the academic departments. The necessary expenses of a Virginia Student (all University fees, board and room, books and laundry) need not exceed $245 for the session. The actual expenses are usually greater than this, but are largely within the control of the student himself. One who is willing to practice strict economy can live at a more reasonable cost at the University of Virginia than at most institutions of similar rank. Free tuition in the academic departments, equivalent to a scholarship worth $125, is given to each student from Virginia. There are also available for deserving students many scholarships, including thirty which yield from $250 to $600 a year. Moreover, there are 119 scholarships for prospective Virginia teachers, ten endowed fellowships, and seven loan funds. Rooms may be had in one of the University dormitories and meals may be obtained either in the University cafeteria or in an approved private boarding house. If preferred both room and board may be obtained in such boarding house. Good, wholesome food is served at the University cafeteria at costs ranging from $20 to $30 per month. Many of the students are finding it possible to board at the lower rate. STUDENT SELF-HELP Many opportunities for self-help are offered by the University and by the city of Charlottesville. At least half of the students at the present time are paying their own way in whole or in part. Answers to a recent questionnaire submitted to the students of the University showed that approximately 54 per cent. of the entire student body are paying a part or all of their expenses, not including the holders of scholarships or those borrowing money. It was found that more than seventy different occupations are engaged in by those working their way through the University. The Secretary of the Y. M. C. A., assisted by a committee of the faculty, is always ready to help find part time positions for those who must work while they study. Every possible opportunity for obtaining remunerative employment is afforded to students who are desirous of helping by this means to pay their way through the University, and it may be safely stated that any student with sufficient resources to carry him through the first half of the session, can be reasonably sure of obtaining work which will pay a considerable part of his living expenses and university charges for the remainder of the academic year. While it is difficult for any student to be assured of remunerative work before he reaches the University, information as to such employment may be had from the Secretary of the Committee on Student Self-Help, Madison Hall. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS For admission to any department of the University, the general conditions are the following: 1. Sufficient Age.âThe minimum legal age is sixteen years; the faculty advise seventeen or more. 2. Good Character.âThis must be attested by a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended, or by other valid proof. 3. Adequate Preparation.âThis must be such as will enable the candidate to meet the requirements for admission to the several departments of the University. For admission to the College, the candidate must present a certificate or pass an equivalent examination. In either case the amount of preparation required is measured in terms of units. A unit represents a year's study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year's work. This definition of a unit takes the four-year high-school course as a basis and assumes that the length of the school year is from thirty-six to forty weeks, that a period is from forty to sixty minutes in length, and that the study is pursued for four or five periods a week; but under ordinary circumstances a satisfactory year's work in any subject cannot be accomplished in less than one hundred and twenty hours, or their equivalent. Schools organized on any other than a four-year basis can, nevertheless, estimate their work in terms of this unit. Admission by Certificate For admission by certificate, the applicant should file with the Dean of the University not later than September 1 a Certificate of Preparation, made out on the blank form furnished by the University. This certificate must come from a recognized institution of collegiate rank, from an accredited public high school, or from an accredited private secondary school. The candidate for admission from a public high school must be a graduate of an accredited four-year high school. The candidate for admission from a private secondary school must be a graduate of the school, or must present a certificate showing that he has completed at least the equivalent of four years of satisfactory high-school work of standard grade, covering at least fifteen entrance units. In every case the candidate for admission must have the recommendation of the principal of the certifying school. Private secondary schools in Virginia are accredited by the faculty of this university after inspection and report by a committee of the faculty. The University also accredits all four year public high schools which are fully accredited by the State Board of Education of Virginia. The Dean of the University is further authorized to accept certificates from schools outside Virginia, accredited by their own state universities or institutions of equal rank, or by their own state departments of education, provided the courses of study offered in such schools meet the requirements demanded of accredited schools in this state. If in any accredited school the number of periods given to a study, or the length of the period, is below the specified standard, the credit for such subject is reduced pro rata. In the science subjects only half-credit is allowed unless individual laboratory notebooks, properly attested by the teacher in charge, are filed with the certificate. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must in all cases take the entrance examinations. Admission by Examination For admission by examination, the candidate must present himself at the University in June or in September, according to the dates given in the Program of Entrance Examinations. The examinations are held under the honor system, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge. All candidates who take their examinations at the times appointed are tested free of charge. In case of delayed entrance, where the grounds of postponement are good, the President of the University may admit the candidate to a special examination, for which a fee of five dollars is charged. This fee is payable in advance, and is in no case returned. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREE OF BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN COMMERCE The degree of Bachelor of Science in Commerce will be conferred upon regular students who have completed not less than 63 session-hours of undergraduate courses, taken in conformity with the following programme: (1) Required Subjects.âCandidates for the Bachelor of Science in Commerce must take 33 session-hours of required subjects as stated below, 3 hours of which must be in Physical Training. Of the remaining 30 session-hours of required subjects, not less than 24 hours must be taken during the first two years and the remaining 6 hours not later than the third year. Foreign Languages.âSix session-hours from one of the following languages: French, German or Spanish. Mathematics.âThree session-hours in Mathematics A1 or A2. Natural Science.âSix session-hours. English.âSix session-hours, 3 of which shall be in English A1, A2 or A3, and 3 in English B3. Social Science.âNine session-hours in United States History B3, Government B1 and Economics B1. History B3 should be taken in the candidate's first year, and Government B1 and Economics B1 in the candidate's second year. Physical Training.âThree session-hours, which must be completed during the first two years. (2) Major-Electives.âOf the remaining 30 session-hours required for the degree, 24 session-hours must be taken from commercial subjects in the School of Economics and School of Commerce, 18 session-hours of which shall include the following courses: Commercial Geography B2, Commercial Law B1, Economics B2, Economics B3, Economics B4 and Economics B5. The remaining 6 session-hours may be elected from any courses in the academic schools for which the candidate has adequate preparation. Note: 12 session-hours of technical courses in one of the professional departments of Law or Engineering may, with the approval of the Dean and Faculty of the School of Commerce, be substituted under the requirements in commercial subjects. In any case, however, 18 session-hours must be taken from commercial subjects in the Schools of Economics and Commerce and Business Administration. THE HONOR SYSTEM For eighteen years after the opening of the institution, written examinations were conducted under the surveillance of a committee of three professors. This was not altogether satisfactory, and in June, 1842, Judge Henry St. George Tucker, Professor of Law, offered the following resolution, which the Faculty at once adopted: Resolved, That in all future written examinations for distinction and other honors of the University, each candidate shall attach to the written answers presented by him on such examination a certificate in the following words: "I, A. B., do hereby certify, on honor, that I have derived no assistance during the time of this examination from any source whatsoever, whether oral, written, or in print, in giving the above answers." This was the beginning of the honor system at this institution, and it has been in operation ever since without interruption. Later the pledge was extended so as to preclude the giving as well as the receiving of assistance. Still more recently the scope of the honor system has been enlarged so as to cover other phases of student conduct. Its administration is entirely in the hands of the students, the essence of the system being that the violation of a student's word of honor is an offense not against the university authorities, but against the whole student body, and on the rare occasions on which it has occurred, the students themselves have quietly and promptly sent the offender away from the University without need of faculty action. Examinations are required to be held in one place and in the presence of the professor in charge of the course or one of his assistants. These regulations in no way conflict with the spirit of the honor system, but are regarded as being necessary to give a proper dignity and formality to the occasion.
