      <field name="fulltext">Foreword “Every generation which fights a great war wants to read about it afterward.” Thus began an article on “The War History of Virginia” in the University of Virginia News Letter seven weeks before Germany surrendered in 1945. This acute observation was made by Lester J. Cappon, one of the founders of the Albemarle County Historical Society and its first Editor, who was then serving as the Director of the Virginia World War II History Commission and has since become Vice President of the Southern Historical Association. Not only he but also other members of the Albemarle County historical Society had already taken thought about the morrow of peace when historians would search out records of the Second World War and would attempt to recreate its story. On January 25, 1945, soon after American forces in the Ardennes Forest had turned back Germany's final desperate counterattack in the Battle of the Bulge, the Society devoted one of its quarterly meetings to a program entitled “Albemarle County Goes to War, 1941–1945,” consisting of reports from leaders of various local war activities. Henry McComb Bush reviewed the history of the Charlottesville and Albemarle County Civilian Defense Council, Gus K. Tebell told how national war price and rationing policies were made effectual in the community, several leaders of the Albemarle County Chapter of the American Red Cross described various divisions of its war work, Louis Chauvenet traced the development of Victory Gardens in the city and the county, and Mrs. Robert V. Funsten summarized the services of the U. S. O. in Charlottesville. The Society was confronted during the course of that evening with a graphic illustration of the value of recording the fleeting facts of history while they are still remembered or ascertainable. One of the speakers had sought in vain to discover simple facts about the location, program, and number of volunteer workers of the Albemarle County Chapter of the American Red Cross during the First World War. Having been unable to locate any records pertinent to these questions, she had then with complete lack of success interviewed numerous persons of vigorous minds who recalled vaguely that they had participated in Red Cross activities during 1917–1918 but whose memories failed to authenticate a single detail relative to where they worked, under whose direction, and with what results. A member of the Society was able to relieve the concern produced by her narration of this vain quest for any knowledge of local Red Cross volunteers of a generation ago and of how they had met their problems. This distressing gap in local history was filled—or at least a condensed summary of the matter was found—in the presence of all persons assembled when someone read a paragraph or two from the brief sketch of Albemarle County's part in the First World War which was published by the Virginia War History Commission of 1919–1927. The value of a published record could not have been more memorably revealed nor the obvious moral more effectively pointed if the entire scene had been dramatized, rehearsed, and staged for the purpose. It was quite evident that evening that members of the Society found this incomplete and summary review of home front mobilizations both interesting and inspiring. It was clearly worthwhile to look back into the darker days through which the community and the nation had recently passed. It was good to evaluate the influences and the democratic techniques under which American people had worked unitedly for the victory which was to come, quite in keeping with the optimistic expectations which then generally prevailed, within the year. The Society knew that it had enjoyed a foretaste of a story which should be told in richer detail. It was high time that something should be done to preserve permanently a more complete record of the community's part in the attainment of victory. This impetus to further accomplishment by the Society in the field of local war history was soon accentuated. In the spring of 1945 the Virginia World War II History Commission proposed to the governing officials of Charlottesville and Albemarle County that they should use public funds to finance the collection of local war records and the publication of one or two local war histories. The recommendation by this new agency of the state government, which had established its headquarters and research office in the Alderman Library of the University of Virginia, had been made in keeping with specific statutory authorization and in accord with a statewide policy of the Commission. Since this suggestion met with no favorable response, the hopes of interested members of the Society soon began to center upon the Society itself as a very proper alternative agency for the direction of a war history project. In the Society's first meeting after the Japanese surrender its membership voted that it should undertake the preparation and publication of a local war history and that its President should appoint a committee to supervise all phases of the work. The War History Committee which has now seen the project to its completion consists of members of the Society and some other community leaders, each of whom has contributed something of value to its ultimate success. Members other than the writer include Miss Mary Stamps White (Mrs. William Gerhard Suhling, Jr.), chairman, Chester R. Babcock of the city, Henry McComb Bush of the county, Dr. Lester J. Cappon, now of Williamsburg, Virginia, Miss Nancy B. Gordon of the city, Mrs. John W. MacLeod of Crozet, Dr. Bernard Mayo of the University of Virginia, Mrs. W. Allan Perkins of the city, Leonard H. Peterson of the city, and Mrs. Larned D. Randolph, formerly of Keene and now of North Garden. When the committee had considered several possible means of financing what would obviously be great expenses for compilation and publication, if the intended volume was to be at all creditable, and sought the respected counsel of William S. Hildreth, President of The Peoples National Bank of Charlottesville, the resources of that public spirited institution were voluntarily offered. Thus the committee's first problem was solved. The bank agreed to advance to the Society for this purpose funds which are to be repaid to it on a non-profit basis from proceeds of the sale of the book at a price equivalent to the actual cost of production. The bank has subsequently enlarged its original commitment and has thus eliminated possibilities that desired quality would have to be ruthlessly sacrificed to economy and that the quantity of copies produced would have to be decreased far below the anticipated demand. In return, the Society's War History Committee has avoided all temptations to become profligate in the expenditure of these indispensable advances, for it has been motivated by a desire to keep the price per copy within the means of every interested reader of this record of the community's part in the war. Its first barrier having been hurdled, the committee retained in January, 1946, the services of Mrs. Gertrude Dana Parlier for the compilation of the volume. The University's Alderman Library graciously welcomed her into the fold of the research workers who constantly investigate therein every conceivable topic from prehistoric man to yesterday's news. The staff of the Virginia World War II History Commission afforded her space in its quarters within the Alderman Library and free access to its files. Thus began a cooperation between the War History Commission, the Alderman Library, and this new phase of the Society's program which has been of immeasurable value to the latter. All who know from experience the almost inevitable tendency of research projects to expand beyond their originally foreseen scope will understand sympathetically the fact that the ultimate limits of this comprehensive study were not visualized in advance by any of the persons concerned. Every step forward toward its completion broadened Mrs. Parlier's receding horizon. Almost every recorded fact or development suggested that she pause to investigate some new ramification of her many-sided subject, that she divert her forward steps to trace some significant byway, or that she must blaze a new trail in exploring some previously unsuspected forest. Indeed, in all that she did she was plowing new ground, for there was not in existence among all the millions of books in the world a single one which could be directly and helpfully comparable to her projected volume. Nor was her unprecedented task made easier by the fact that the Society's War History Committee had its eyes opened to new vistas as she progressed. In every meeting its originally somewhat limited vision of the length and significance of the story which it was pledged to summarize was very properly enlarged. Literally every one involved found that new implications and desirable extensions were suggested by each milepost along the way—a fact which is a compliment to the intelligence of Mrs. Parlier and her associates. Hence it was obviously no discredit to anyone concerned that Mrs. Parlier could not complete within the allotted time her journey toward a destination which had been pushed far beyond its original distance from her point of departure. When it became evident that she could not reach the new goal before previous plans would take her away from the community during a portion of last year, she was relieved of a task which she had pursued with unusual diligence and interest. In the period of slightly more than a year which she had devoted to this work, she had helped to plan this entire volume, had gathered materials pertinent to all of its twenty chapters, and had prepared incomplete drafts of most of them. Despite the innumerable additions and revisions of her subsequent collaborators and of the editor, which have not in all details been of her choosing, she has cooperatively reviewed and, in general, approved their handiwork. The final form of a much altered manuscript still bears her impress. “Of the making of books there is no end” runs the familiar quotation. Of the variety of ways by which they are made there is also no end. But the evolution of this one is so unusual as to be unique. That is one reason why I have traced its story. This volume is also uncommon in another respect. There are more than three thousand counties in the United States. None of these, so far as I have been able to learn, has yet had its civilian and military participation in the Second World War recorded on as comprehensive a scale as has the Charlottesville-Albemarle County community. I am hopeful that other Virginia counties and cities which have their war histories in preparation will soon begin to publish volumes comparable to this one or even better. In the whole effort of which Pursuits of War is the fruit, our goal has been to present with accuracy in readable, durable, and economical form the most complete practicable summary of the participation of the people of Charlottesville and Albemarle County in all phases of the war effort. More than usual care has been devoted to the verification of facts and to the considered evaluation of the limited interpretations in which the authors have permitted themselves to indulge. A degree of objectivity in their approach to the subject which is unusual in the publications of local historical societies is implicit in the fact that only one of the authors is a native of the community or has been identified with it for as long as a decade. They have taken pains to point out instances in which its residents failed to measure up to standards of wartime cooperation which were expected of them. Omissions imposed upon the authors by the obvious necessity of selection within a story too long for retelling in its entirety have not been chosen in such a way as to hide ugly skeletons which might prove embarrassing in a well ordered and justly proud household. For the benefit of the rare but deserving research scholar who may wish to substantiate the facts or opinions which are included, reference notes have been appended as unobtrusively as possible. The Index will add to the convenience of readers in both the present and future generations. It is my privilege to acknowledge the indebtedness of the Albemarle County Historical Society and my personal gratitude to several agencies and many individuals who have freely given vital assistance in the prosecution of a publication project more ambitious than any other which the Society has yet undertaken. The cooperation which has been received from the Peoples National Bank of Charlottesville, chiefly through William S. Hildreth and Charles N. Hulvey, Jr., has been an absolute prerequisite of success in this project. The support of the Society's War History Committee and particularly the sympathetic and judicious counsel of its chairman have been a constant mainstay. To the really considerable aid of the six named persons who, as authors and co-authors, have helped me during the past year to prepare final drafts of all chapters can be attributed some of the best features of the book; and even the assistance of unnamed typists and proofreaders has been a valuable and appreciated resource dear to the heart of a busy editor. Participants in certain local war activities have reviewed portions of the manuscript which described matters with which they were respectively concerned, and in some instances they have graciously suggested revisions which have corrected misleading impressions or minor misstatements of fact. Dr. Staige D. Blackford, Dr. Everett Cato Drash, Dr. Byrd Stuart Leavell, and Miss Ruth Beery approved the sections of two chapters which deal with the 8th Evacuation Hospital; James E. Hudson, Louis Matacia, Clay S. Purvis, and Edward V. Walker were consulted in connection with chapters concerning local military units on the home front and on the battlefronts; Miss Louise O. Beall and Miss Nan Crow read the chapter involving the local U. S. O. Club; R. O. Hall, Strother F. Hamm, and Charles E. Moran similarly examined the Selective Service chapter; Larned D. Randolph, T. O. Scott, and Mrs. Ruth Burruss Huff gave constructive criticism to the chapter reporting wartime agricultural developments. A score or more others have “done their bit” quite helpfully through consultations and other services, providing information and pictures, which cannot be acknowledged in detail. The owners of certain copyrighted matter have granted to the Society permission to reprint excerpts from their publications, and these authorizations are specifically mentioned in the reference notes. The privilege of quoting at will from the Charlottesville Daily Progress has been of especial value. Finally, in behalf of the Albemarle County Historical Society and of the many cooks who have stirred and spiced this broth, the editor, in the role of chef, expresses the hope that the finished dish when served to the community will prove so palatable as to engender the warmest response to this service which the Society and its supporters have performed.

      <field name="fulltext">Preface When I began the preparation of this record of the participation of the people of Charlottesville and Albemarle County in all phases of the Second World War, both at home and overseas, I hoped that space would permit considerable analysis of national and international developments and implications related to each narrative chapter of this volume. It was my desire to correlate rather fully all local transitions or incidents with corresponding changes or events on the larger scale. So sweeping was the local story found to be, however, that it has been incumbent to subordinate the overall view to the local picture. Nevertheless, my collaborators and I have attempted to retain a sufficient amount of pertinent materials on the national and international levels to provide something of a framework for local data. Purely local facts are not presented without a larger perspective. In other words, the part which is local has been related to the whole which is national. I have attempted in Part I to show how residents of both city and county worked together in such home front activities as Civilian Defense, war bond drives, salvaging, rationing, and increased agricultural and industrial production. At the same time I have pointed out that the programs themselves were actuated by the needs of a people engaged in war and that, though effectuated by local personnel throughout the United States, they received their primary impetus from the national crisis. Though it may be inferred throughout the pages of this first section of the volume that the nationwide programs submitted to the civilian population were inspired in great part by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, it is with deliberate intent that I have chosen this Preface as the most fitting place in which to make a direct tribute to him. No history of the Second World War, however fragmentary or localized, can fail to include an expression of gratitude to the great leader whom the United States was fortunate in having during a most difficult and demanding period. Franklin D. Roosevelt had unfailingly directed his efforts towards furthering justice in one form or another for the working man prior to the war. His efforts had won for him the trust of peoples in all justice-loving countries of the world. When the Germans set forth upon their conquest of Europe, when the Japanese extended their invasions in the East, had it not been for Roosevelt's grasp of the historical significance of the rebirth of Pan-Germanism allied with militaristic Japan; had it not been for his recognition of the intrinsic evil embodied in the methods employed by the enemy nations in their concerted drive for world conquest; had it not been for his discernment of the moral issues then at stake, many Americans would not have been sufficiently aware of the poignant danger to which they themselves were exposed. Roosevelt's clarity of vision prevailed over his humanitarian desire to keep his country out of war. He summoned his people to total cooperation in preparing the defeat of the Axis powers. That the Americans responded wholeheartedly is to their everlasting credit. But the wisdom that warned of the peril threatening mankind as a whole; the discrimination that appraised the true value of the allied nations; the foresight that compassed the prodigious scope of the United States' responsibility; the ingenuity that launched the towering strength of this country into war, will always be associated with Franklin D. Roosevelt, a name which ever will be held in honor. In Part II of this volume the story of local individuals' participation in the military and naval operations of the war has been told. Whenever possible, my collaborator and I have incorporated extracts from their letters into the body of the text, letting them speak for themselves and giving the reader insight into their observations and reactions. Though general histories of the Second World War can be bought at the corner book store for as little as twenty-five cents, it is obviously desirable that a community possess a narrative record of the wartime experiences of its own servicemen and servicewomen. A word or two must be added regarding the factors which determined the choice of biographical incidents. First let me say that I make no pretense of having included them all. There must be and undoubtedly are countless anecdotes deserving of mention which have been left out merely because they were not recorded in accessible sources. It was indeed difficult to acquire a great quantity of material in a limited period of time. Moreover, an almost universal modesty characterizes the average “G. I.” This, together with their desire to forget the grimmest memories, makes it all but impossible to obtain more than such official data as are included in the four rosters at the end of the book. I appealed through The Daily Progress to mothers and wives of servicemen for stories of their sons and husbands; but, as I received only one reply, I confined my subsequent efforts to recording what information was available within practicable limitations. If, however, in a confessedly incomplete chronicle of these men and women who were “lately taken from the ways of peace,” I have succeeded in preserving even a little of their absolute bravery, a mere trace of their infinite forbearance, some faint notion of the selflessness that was theirs, I shall feel rewarded. The four rosters of service personnel which comprise Part III should include, theoretically, the names of every man and woman of this community who served in the armed forces of the United States during the war years. However, some unavoidable, indeed inevitable, omissions will doubtless be found after issuance of this volume. The public should be assured that this compilation of the community's collective military and naval Honor Roll has been made as nearly complete and as free of error as painstaking work upon all accessible and pertinent materials by several people extending over many months could possibly make it. In the final analysis the major portion of all deficiencies which may be discovered in the two Blue Star Honor Rolls are attributable to the failure of many servicemen and servicewomen to have their discharge certificates copied into the public “Induction and Discharge Record, World War II” which is maintained under state statute by the clerks of the city and county courts. In regard to the role of the University of Virginia in the war effort, I must explain why no extended treatment of its wartime services has been included in this book. When the Albemarle County Historical Society began its local war history project in 1945, the University was formulating a plan for the writing and publication of a history of its fifth quarter-century, which would include the war years. Naturally, therefore, it seemed proper to all concerned with Pursuits of War that the University's internal wartime developments should be left to its own chronicler. Consequently, the various transitions and services on the Grounds—the uniformed students in training, the curricular changes, and the research work directly related to the war which numerous professors carried out with distinction—will provide ample and significant scope for a separate history of the University of Virginia in the Second World War. Obviously, however, the University is so integral a part of the community that some phases of its wartime story are necessarily reflected in the following pages. From the first my associates and I have been hopeful that our work will place some markers to point out byways which the University's war historian might not otherwise explore. In addition to the acknowledgments which the editor has made in his Foreword, I wish to express my personal gratitude to certain persons who gave me especially helpful assistance during the period of my work upon this study. Miss Isabella N. Burnet encouraged me to use the clippings from The Daily Progress and the file of this newspaper, covering most of the war years and the period of postwar transition, which she assembled for the Albemarle County Historical Society. Henry McComb Bush, Mrs. Milton L. Grigg, and Miss Mary Stamps White (Mrs. W. Gerhard Suhling, Jr.) were of real assistance to me in recalling the conditions under which the local Civilian Defense organization developed. Access to the annual reports of the County Agent, T. O. Scott, and of the successive Home Demonstration Agents, Mrs. Bessie Dunn Miller and Mrs. Ruth Burruss Huff, was given, always graciously and with patience, by Miss Bessie Jones. I wish to express my indebtedness to County Agent Scott and to Mrs. Huff for the cooperation and interest they manifested during my efforts to understand the basic explanation of agricultural accomplishments in the county. Mrs. James Gordon Smith, President of the Albemarle County Chapter of the American Red Cross, kindly consented to contribute her own account of the war activities of the Chapter. This was a purely voluntary labor of love on her part, and I have welcomed her interesting and appreciated narrative. In compiling the rosters of service personnel, I was assisted by Mrs. John W. MacLeod, Miss Nancy B. Gordon, Miss Mary Stamps White, and Mrs. Larned D. Randolph. It was, however, Mrs. MacLeod who gave most liberally of her time, strength, interest, and good humor to aid me in this phase of the work. Her thorough acquaintance with county names enabled her to throw light on many a problem which arose to perplex us. She shared my enthusiasm for the fine records of many of the men, unknown to us both, and I consider it my good fortune to have been able to work with her. Finally, I am indebted to Dr. W. Edwin Hemphill for the remarkably just attitude he has displayed during his work of editing the volume. I am also sincerely grateful for his seemingly inexhaustible supply of patience and understanding. Since this volume contains quotations from many sources and is a product of the collaboration of eight authors, its occasional expressions of opinion and its inclusions and exclusions should not be taken to be an accurate or complete representation of the personal viewpoint of any one of them.

      <field name="fulltext">Part 1 On the Home Front “The hand that held the dagger has struck it into the back of its neighbor.” I Introduction The attention of a world already extensively engaged in warfare or subjugated by invading forces was focussed upon Charlottesville and Albemarle County on June 10, 1940, when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, addressing the graduating class of the University of Virginia, made a declaration of a new American foreign policy. He pledged that “we will pursue two obvious and simultaneous courses; we will extend to the opponents of force the material resources of this nation; and, at the same time, we will harness and speed up the use of those resources in order that we ourselves in the Americas may have equipment and training equal to the task of any emergency and every defense.”1 This speech was made on the afternoon of the day which had seen the entrance of Italy as an active Axis belligerent, shortly after the removal from Dunkirk of 335,000 men—all that remained of the British Expeditionary Force in France. The darkest hour for France was approaching—German troops would enter Paris without opposition four days later.2 Within the past nine weeks Norway, Denmark, Belgium, The Netherlands, and Luxemburg had fallen before the Nazi onslaught. Italy's declaration of war against the Allies in the face of President Roosevelt's urging that she maintain her neutrality served only to deepen the general gloom. The President denounced Italy's action in terse and picturesque phraseology. “The hand that held the dagger has struck it into the back of its neighbor.”3 It is neither necessary nor appropriate that a recapitulation of the causes and opening phases of the Second World War should be included in this volume. Adequate coverage of prewar “incidents” and the earlier offensives has been provided by a large number of publications, ranging from day-by-day accounts of journalistic writers to narratives compiled with greater scope and perspective by participants in the action, by editors, and by historians.4 It is sufficient to point out that the stage was set for a supreme effort on the part of the people of the United States of America and that in this effort residents of Charlottesville and Albemarle County played a major role. In 1940 Albemarle County comprised an area of 739 square miles and a population of 24,652 persons, of whom 18,990 were white and 5,662 were Negro. The city of Charlottesville had at that time an area of six square miles and a population of 19,400 (15,246 whites and 4,154 Negroes). Nearly half the county's labor force (48.6 per cent, or 3,839 persons) was employed in some form of agriculture, with 1,068 individuals engaged in business or professional services, 584 in manufacturing, 539 in wholesale and retail trade, 427 in construction, and 92 in mining. Of those employed in the city of Charlottesville, 2,432 were engaged in business and professional services, 1,763 in wholesale and retail trade, 1,194 in manufacturing, 618 in transporation, communication, and other utilities, and 530 in construction. Of the 2,591 farms in Albemarle County, 15.9 per cent were operated by tenants and fifty-five per cent had productions valued that year at less than $400, although the average value of all county farms was $8,165. The value of farm products sold, traded, or used by farm households was $2,323,000, of which 35.1 per cent derived from livestock and livestock products and 33.8 per cent from crops.5 Charlottesville was governed in 1940 by a five-man council presided over by Dr. W. D. Haden, who was elected mayor by members of the council, with Seth Burnley as city manager. At that time Albemarle County had been for seven years under the county executive form of government, with Henry A. Haden as executive. The county was, in fact, the first in the state of Virginia to adopt the county executive form, which it inaugurated on May 3, 1933, shortly after the General Assembly passed in 1932 the Optional Forms Act permitting this type of county government.6 Neither city nor county was unaware in 1940 of the trend of world events. Already the local chapter of the American Red Cross was engaged in providing clothing for European war-sufferers, and soon the chapter was to enter into a production program which would place Charlottesville and Albemarle County in a position of national leadership. The Monticello Guard was girding itself for action, and plans for defense were an increasingly common topic of local conversation. The world had been troubled throughout the past nine years. Japan invaded Manchuria in September, 1931, and established the puppet state of Manchukuo the following year. Italy overran and conquered Ethiopia in 1935–1936. Spain was torn in 1936 by a civil war of international implications. Japan renewed her attacks on China in 1937. Hitler's territorial aggrandizement and internal terrorization policies on the European continent began in 1933 and reached a climax with the German march into Poland on September 1, 1939. To the peoples of all nations had come an increasing sense of insecurity and a foreboding of the approach of worldwide conflict. To many residents of Charlottesville and Albemarle County the fight seemed inevitable and near at hand in 1940. In the light of Germany's overwhelming successes of the past two months President Roosevelt stated to his University of Virginia audience and to the world in lucid and forceful terms the position of the nations of the Western Hemisphere, as yet unengaged in actual hostilities. “Perception of danger to our institutions may come slowly,” he said, “or it may come with a rush and a shock as it has to the people of the United States in the past few months. This perception of danger has come to us clearly and overwhelmingly; and we perceive the peril in a world-wide arena—an arena that may become so narrowed that only the Americas will retain the ancient faiths.”7 In the course of the next five years more than 5,400 young men and women from Albemarle County and Charlottesville were to serve in the armed forces of their country, and of these nearly 200 would not return. Residents of both city and county were destined to work harder than ever before, to do more with less, and to give to the utmost of time, strength, materials, and money. In the summer of 1940, more than a year before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the nation's defense program was launched and its citizens were beginning to prepare for the long struggle toward ultimate victory. Until the surrender of Germany (V-E Day, May 8, 1945) and the capitulation of Japan (V-J Day, September 2, 1945) the people of Charlottesville and Albemarle County were to remain among the nation's leaders, both in mobilization at home and in theaters of battle. Successive parts of this volume summarize in turn the participation of civilians in the war activities of the home front and the experiences of local residents who went forth in military and naval uniforms to serve in every corner of the globe. “I call for effort, courage, sacrifice, devotion. Granting the love of freedom, all of these are possible,” President Roosevelt told the American people on June 10, 1940. Charlottesville and Albemarle County heard the call and gave what he asked. Throughout the trying years ahead the county and city, together with the rest of the country, justified the unfaltering faith which the President expressed on the eve of total war: “And the love of freedom is still fierce and steady in the nation today.”8 II Organizing for Civilian Defense More than a year before Pearl Harbor the people of Charlottesville and Albemarle County learned through their newspapers and radios that the Second World War differed from all its predecessors in certain shocking respects. With a new kind of horror they paused occasionally in the course of their relatively tranquil lives to ponder the quick and cruel efficiency with which the Germans overwhelmed Poland in 1939 and overran France in the spring of 1940. With an awe akin first to disbelief and later to sympathy they discussed the merciless destruction which German airplanes and bombs rained upon Great Britain after Dunkirk in 1940 and through many nights in 1941. Each additional and ruthless air raid left peace-loving people figuratively holding their breath. Would England stand or fall? They scarcely dared to formulate the question, for the fate of civilization itself seemed to hang in the balance. And in the course of those tense and harrowing days the grim realization that the fall of England might well presage a shower of airborne missiles upon our American homeland obtruded itself into many minds. There were in every community some persons who could not with any assurance convince themselves that the ultimate outcome of the issue would be favorable and that men could preserve the democratic principles and spiritual values which had been laboriously nurtured through some two or three thousand years of progress against various forces of barbarism. Aside from any such philosophic fears, it was painfully obvious in those days that modern warfare had become “total war” and that it took its staggering toll among civilians as well as soldiers. The property destruction which German raiders left under the slip streams of their dreaded bombers throughout the British Isles was frightening, but it was the suffering and deaths inflicted upon the bloody but unbowed British people—men, women, and children—that Americans found most heart rending. As Great Britain endured these unprecedented aerial assaults without collapsing, American admiration was unforgettably inspired by Prime Minister Winston Churchill's tribute to the valiant pilots of Royal Air Force fighter planes. Perhaps it was true, as he asserted, that never in human history had so many owed so much to so few. But many a Nazi flyer succeeded in penetrating the thin cordon of the R. A. F. and in dropping his fire bombs and death-dealing explosives over densely populated English cities. Therefore it was also true that Great Britain was spared greater losses and possible subjugation because an effective organization of civilian workers was developed to obviate and correct all types of damage to property and life. Gradually, too, the government and citizens of the United States began to realize the necessity of preparing a large body of trained volunteers to counteract whatever threats to national security might materialize. No one knew whence or when some attack against the nation might come, and speculation on this subject was almost a daily concern among many Americans, especially residents of coastal areas and urban dwellers, before as well as after that sunny Sunday of December 7, 1941, when the Rising Sun of Japan shone with such malevolent fury upon Pearl Harbor. For more than two years after that date it seemed to be a reasonable probability that German warplanes would somehow manage to attack at least a few strategic centers near the Atlantic Coast in “token” bombing raids by suicide pilots designed to bolster Nazi morale, if indeed they did not do vastly more. Such considerations account adequately for the development throughout the nation of a Civilian Defense organization which was enormous in respect to the number of its volunteer enlistees and the millions of hours they served without compensation. This mobilization was one of the more amazing of all the civilian activities of the home front. In Charlottesville and Albemarle County one out of approximately every seven resident adults was recruited to learn under its aegis a specialized duty and to give valuable time to the performance of it. The roster of volunteer workers included, with few exceptions, true patriots who did their “bits” under conditions sometimes dramatic, sometimes monotonous, almost always unpublicized. If there was a single man, woman, or child anywhere in the community whose life was not directly affected or temporarily altered at least once by the Civilian Defense effort, he or she has not yet stepped forth to proclaim the fact that blackouts and other manifestations of this inclusive program did not cause him to pause and conform. It was one of the greatest blessings enjoyed by Americans during the war that their Civilian Defense forces were never confronted with the actual test of the feared mass aerial incursions. Yet one should not conclude from this fortunate fact that preparation for enemy air raids represented a profligate waste of manpower, for Civilian Defense proved to be the nucleus of home front activities from which stemmed groups of trained workers willing to serve in other valuable phases of civilian mobilization for total war. In June, 1940, when the Battle of Britain was just under way, an eleven-man Home Defense Council was organized on their own initiative by Charlottesville and Albemarle County veterans of the First World War. Their avowed aim was to prepare their city and county for “the part they will be called upon to play in providing adequate defense for our country” and to cooperate in every way with any other defense councils which might be organized. Members of this council included Edward V. Walker, J. Callan Brooks, Robert Kent Gooch, Fred L. Watson, F. D. G. Ribble, Charles P. Nash, Jr., William S. Hildreth, Ernest Breeden, A. Hewson Michie, John S. Battle, and Colonel Henry B. Goodloe. This group, acting for Legionnaires of the city and county, emphasized the fact that it had no idea of excluding from membership those who were not vet erans of the last war or members of the American Legion. Police Justice J. Callan Brooks told members of the Charlottesville Kiwanis Club on June 17 that the committee had been formed for the purpose of combatting evils from within and without. Asserting that America faced her greatest danger, he told his audience, “The skies are dark and lowering, and we know not where the end will be. We must meet force with force. What we do must be done at once, and we must face the future with courage.” He pointed out, reassuringly, “There is no cause to become jittery,” and he declared his belief that in the end Hitler would meet “his Waterloo.”1 Nearly a year later but more than six months before Pearl Harbor, in May, 1941, Governor James H. Price appointed Seth Burnley, Dr. W. D. Haden, and Edward V. Walker of the city, E. L. Bradley, A. G. Fray, and Dr. L. G. Roberts of the county as members of the Northern Virginia Regional Defense Council, which consisted of nineteen men who represented an area comprising twelve counties and several independent cities.2 Dr. Haden and Randolph H. Perry became director and assistant director, respectively, of the Charlottesville and Albemarle Civilian Defense Council, and with their Advisory Committee they built during the last half of 1941 the first general organization designed to protect the welfare of the community in case of wartime emergency.3 The Advisory Committee consisted of Louis Chauvenet, Dr. L. G. Roberts, E. L. Bradley, A. G. Fray, Seth Burnley, and Edward V. Walker. Committee and division chairmen included: Communications, J. P. Borden; Education, James G. Johnson and R. Claude Graham; Recreation, Miss Nan Crow; Utilities, Raymond Hunt; Disaster Division, Sterling L. Williamson; Demolition, Jack Rinehart; Food and Clothing, W. Towles Dettor; Medical, Dr. Harvey E. Jordan; Housing, W. A. Barksdale; Transportation, E. G. Lee; Publicity, A. W. Quinn and Charles Barham, Jr.; Civilian Defense Corps Division, Bernard P. Chamberlain for the county and Charles P. Nash, Jr., for the city; Fire Protection, Berlin Eye and Charles R. Carter; and Police, J. Mason Smith and M. F. Greaver.4 Miss Mary Stamps White of “Flordon,” near Ivy, was executive secretary for the Charlottesville and Albemarle Civilian Defense Council, and Louis Chauvenet served until the spring of 1942 as the secretary who kept minutes of its meetings.5 During the summer of 1941 a Committee of Civilian Volunteer Services, assisted by Miss White and Mrs. Milton L. Grigg, registered all residents of the city and county who wished to volunteer their services for Civilian Defense. Randolph H. Perry was appointed by Gardner L. Boothe of Alexandria, Virginia, chairman of the Northern Virginia Regional Defense Council, to head this committee for the city, with Mrs. Lyttelton Waddell as co-chairman. E. L. Bradley of Scottsville and Mrs. J. Gordon Smith of Greenwood were named chairman and co-chairman, respectively, for the county. It was stressed that many types of service were necessary and that no one should fail to volunteer because of a feeling of inability to perform specialized tasks. On July 12, the first day of registration, a total of 2,995 persons in the city and county volunteered their assistance, 2,150 in the county and 845 in Charlottesville. By December more than 2,000 county and 1,300 city residents had registered at the local Volunteer Office.6 In October, 1941, Charles P. Nash, Jr., and Bernard P. Chamberlain were appointed co-chairmen in charge of forming a Civilian Defense Corps in the city and county. This organization, which later was renamed the Citizens Defense Corps, obtained its authority from both Federal and state statute. When the 77th Congress approved Public Law 415 in January, 1942, and the Virginia General Assembly in February of the same year passed the Commonwealth's Defense Act, legalizing the state Civilian Defense organization and giving authority and responsibility for civilian safety to the duly constituted officers of state and local governments, the Charlottesville and Albemarle Civilian Defense Council was reorganized and direction of Civilian Defense in the area was delegated to the governing bodies of the city and the county. Seth Burnley, Charlottesville city manager, became coordinator, but under him the organization which had previously evolved remained almost unchanged.7 Even the name of the council was not altered, though corresponding local councils in many other Virginia communities were renamed after the fashion of the new State Office of Civilian Defense. Throughout the autumn of 1941 local authorities proceeded to organize and to strengthen agencies for the defense of Charlottesville and Albemarle County, with special emphasis on some which might render service to other areas of the state and the nation. One of the strongest and most perfectly-organized medical defense units in the country evolved under the leadership of Dr. Harvey E. Jordan, Dean of the University of Virginia Medical School and local Chief of Emergency Medical Services. Nurses of graduate and practical status, hospital beds, first aid stations, blood donors, hospital equipment, hospital staffs, doctors, dentists, laboratories, ambulances, bandages, dressings, and four Emergency Field Units, composed of four doctors, four nurses, and four orderlies each, were available to Charlottesville's medical unit, which was cited by Dr. Albert McGowan, Chief of the Medical Service, American Red Cross. “Your organization is to be complimented on the speed in which it has become a workable body—a speed which puts it far ahead of similar organizations everywhere, which have been slow in getting down to business,” he told Dr. Jordan. In order that a list of possible blood donors might be compiled for an eventual emergency, city and county residents were urged to have their blood typed at the local Civilian Defense office. Under the leadership of Mrs. Oron J. Hale and the medical supervision of several cooperating physicans, fingers were pricked, a drop or two of blood was smeared on a slide, and the University Hospital classified each slide by blood type. Donor's names and blood types were then incorporated into a master list at the University Hospital, from which donors of needed types could be summoned should an emergency arise. Mrs. Eleanor Howard was the first blood donor to have blood typed at the local Defense office. By September, 1942, many of these volunteers whose blood had been subject to call in an emergency had actually given it in advance of any disaster. As is related elsewhere in this volume, a liquid plasma blood bank was built up at the University of Virginia Hospital. The official publication of the State Office of Civilian Defense pointed to this emergency reserve with pride as the one “which is said to be the largest blood bank in the State.”8 This liquid plasma reserve locally maintained is not to be confused with the Red Cross Mobile Blood Donor service, which later visited the community to obtain blood for transformation into dried plasma and shipment overseas. As a growing need for organization to meet any eventuality spurred residents of Charlottesville and Albemarle County, together with other United States citizens, to occupy themselves more and more with plans for home defense, many persons of this more favored locality felt it incumbent upon them to offer a refuge for any Britons who might be able to leave their embattled island. Few adults would or could take advantage of such an offer, but numbers of English families entrusted their children to Americans “for the duration” in the hope that they might be spared suffering and all-too-possible death from German air attacks. Mrs. Wayne Dennis, president of the local chapter of the American Association of University Women, headed the movement in this vicinity. Twelve local homes had been opened to refugee children by June, 1940. In July a niece and a nephew of Queen Elizabeth of England arrived at “Mirador,” near Greenwood, estate of Ronald Tree, British member of Parliament, and the former home of the famous Langhorne sisters. The children, Simon Bowes-Lyon, eight, and Davina Bowes-Lyon, ten, son and daughter of Queen Elizabeth's brother, the Honorable David Bowes-Lyon, were accompanied by three young cousins, Francis, Anne, and Jeanne Nichols, and their grandmother, Mrs. H. H. Spender Clay, a sister of Lord Astor, husband of the former Nancy Langhorne.9 In May, 1941, W. Glenn Elliot, director of the Army-sponsored Virginia Aircraft Warning Service, announced the appointment of 110 organizers throughout the state, including H. P. Campbell of Charlottesville and N. McG. Ewell of the University. The new appointees fell to work at once in an effort to enroll 18,000 volunteer observers in Virginia before June 15. During the summer and fall of that year Civilian Defense heads urged volunteer registration, appealing to civic clubs and other groups in the vicinity in an attempt to swell the roster of those who were willing or able to give time and service as airplane spotters in case of need.10 By the time of Pearl Harbor C. Venable Minor had been appointed by the Aircraft Warning Service as its area supervisor for the city and the county. Soon he found in Henry McComb Bush an active assistant. Together they led the work of more than 1,300 airplane spotters for the duration of the need for this part of the Civilian Defense program—the phase of it which would, if enemy raiders were sighted, set in motion the wheels of other Civilian Defense machinery. The Japanese bombs which dealt destruction and death at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, shocked many Americans on the mainland into a realization that the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans no longer constituted impregnable defenses for their homes and their persons. Civilian Defense quarters in Charlottesville—located in the Early Building on Fifth Street, N. E., and later moved to other offices in that vicinity—remained open all day on December 8, and a new drive for aircraft spotters was opened.11 Recruitment of volunteers for this necessary but uninspiring service was no easy task. Other Civilian Defense workers had more active duties to perform and could look with satisfaction upon the more tangible accomplishment of their assigned tasks. In contrast, members of the Aircraft Warning Service were expected simply to stare for tense hours on end, straining every nerve and muscle in an effort to see, starting in alarm at every bird which appeared over the horizon. Moreover, members of other service groups could look forward to some slight relaxation on holidays, but throughout the city, county, and nation aircraft spotters stood their ground on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year's Eve and Day, and for many weary months to come. At the University student fire and air raid wardens planned to keep twenty-four-hour vigil of the Grounds for the duration of the war.12 On December 17, 1941, Charles P. Nash, Jr., as head of the Charlottesville Civilian Defense Corps, announced air raid warning signals for the vicinity. The alert or preparatory signal was given at this time by winking of the city's street lights and by radio announcements, with telephone warnings for defense organizations and essential industries, while action warnings and the “all clear” were signalled by the fire house siren, the Barnes Lumber Company whistle, and the whistle at the University power plant. Two blasts repeated five times at one-minute intervals constituted the action warning, while one blast repeated five times at one-minute intervals announced the “all clear.”13 These same signals had been announced to the city as a blackout warning on December 9, when they appeared in a conspicuous position on the front page of The Daily Progress. Despite early precautions, Charlottesville and Albemarle County did not experience a blackout until March 2, 1942, when the area began to participate in the all night, every night partial blackouts or dimouts demanded by Director James M. Landis of the United States Office of Civilian Defense in a zone reaching 300 miles inland from all coasts. In preparation for the period of semi-darkness Mayor W. D. Haden issued specific instructions for all residents of the city, covering activities of industrialists, owners of business buildings and apartment houses, and private families.14 Although a lunar eclipse took place and snow fell on the night of March 2, The Daily Progress of the next afternoon quoted local defense authorities as having said, “Charlottesville's first night of partial blackout was distressingly bright despite the efforts of nature to correct man's indifference,” and added that Civilian Defense Coordinator Seth Burnley had declared this initial effort to be “practically a 'downright failure.' ” The paper went on to describe the scene of the night before and to issue a warning to residents of the city. “Large neon beverage-advertising signs flickered through the falling snow. Numerous store fronts remained lighted as usual until automatic switches darkened them near midnight. All of these lights which could not be extinguished promptly if a complete blackout were necessary should be turned out when employees leave the building. The partial blackout is not ended. It will continue tonight and every night until further notice. If voluntary blackout is impossible, Mr. Burnley believes that an ordinance will get results.”15 The following day, March 4. City Sergeant and Air Raid Warden Jack Martin explained to home owners that they need not darken their homes but should only stand ready to do so should the need arise. On the same day an enterprising Charlottesville firm advertised “black-out cloth” in The Daily Progress. “Buy yours now while the supply lasts,” area residents were counseled. “An ideal black-out fabric,” it was described. “Dark gray color—a 200 watt bulb will not show through. It's 30-inches wide and moderately priced, too!” By March 11 the paper could report, “After nine days of partial blackout, Charlottesville is learning how to comply with the regulations which resulted in so much confusion.”16 Charlottesville's air raid defenses had been augmented during the past month by the installation of special telephonic warning apparatus at city police and telephone headquarters and by three new air raid sirens. For about two months a room on the third floor of the Monticello Hotel was used as the local control center; thereafter a basement room in the post office served in great secrecy as the spinal cord through which the telephonic nervous system transmitted all local Civilian Defense impulses to various arms of the air raid defense service. Faithful volunteers manned the switchboard there and watched the yellow, blue, red, and white signal lights which were connected by direct wire with the interceptor center of the Aircraft Warning Service in Norfolk, Virginia. If enemy aircraft had been sighted at sea or by airplane spotters of the Ground Observer Corps or if a practice raid were to be held, the Norfolk office would notify all localities potentially concerned by flashing the yellow or caution light. This signal served only to warn key personnel; the public never knew how often or when this inaudible alert was flashed. When any community was more specifically endangered by the proximity of real or imaginary bombers, a blue light indicated that they were within range. In the earlier evolution of a system which improved as it developed, the blue signal was also inaudible to the public, but it meant that the local control room telephoned many additional Civilian Defense workers to go to their posts. Soon the blue warning was sounded as a steady one-minute blast of the sirens for all to hear and served to send all air raid wardens and other volunteers scurrying to their respective duties, while the public prepared to douse all lights and traffic proceeded slowly. The theoretical arrival of hostile planes within ten minutes' flying time from the locality resulted in the blue light turning to red and in the fluctuating wail of sirens which put all Civilian Defense volunteers to work and immobilized the public under whatever shelter could be found. All lights were then to be blacked out or extinguished, all traffic should be halted, and the switchboard of the control room received and transmitted hundreds of calls in keeping in touch with defense personnel. When immediate danger had passed, the blue signal was restored lest planes return and was again sounded by the sirens. The public learned of the final white light or “all clear” signal, which would permit a revival of normal activity, only through announcements broadcast by the local radio station, which was always in close communication and full cooperation with the control room.17 During the early spring of 1942 some residents of Charlottesville were agog over rumors concerning a mysterious airplane. The legend stated, approximately, that an unlicensed plane flying in a suspicious manner was noticed by a spotter on Observatory Mountain. The wary look-out telephoned a warning to the interception center, and Army planes, sent up to “blow 'er down,” forced the wicked-looking craft to land in the Potomac. Investigators then discovered that the plane contained maps of Waynesboro and Radford, Virginia, railway trestles, highway bridges, and equipment and cameras for photographing vital and strategic industries. A columnist of The Daily Progress pointed out acidly that in rumor and detective stories investigators always know when cameras and other supplies are to be used for illegitimate purposes, just as they know when a plane is flying in a suspicious manner. The true story, as reported in the same column, was at once more drab and more credible. An airplane flown by a Gordonsville, Virginia, pilot crossed over a line marking the western boundary of the coastal defense areas. A spotter reported the violation of regulations to Norfolk. An aerial traffic officer ordered the flyer to “pull over,” checked his credentials, bawled him out for his carelessness, and sent him home.18 Later that spring, however, local and railway police combed the city and county in an unsuccessful search for saboteurs after an attempt was made to wreck a train on the Southern Railway within the Charlottesville city limits near the crossing at Shamrock Road. Although the train ran unharmed over the obstruction which had been placed under the tracks, members of the crew noticed the jar that was caused and notified the railway office, which began investigations immediately. All employees of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company were put on the alert against sabotage at the same time, as a bulletin from the superintendent of its Clifton Forge Division stated that information “from important sources indicated that the C. and O. had been singled out for sabotage attempts.”19 Throughout the first months of 1942 city and county officials strove to accelerate Civilian Defense coordination. Both the City Council and the County Board of Supervisors appropriated funds for use by local defense authorities, enacted blackout and air raid regulations, and added legislation designed to prevent the possession of explosives which might be used for purposes of sabotage. Charlottesville's three new sirens were tested, to make sure that they could be heard by all residents of the vicinity, the post office in common with other places of business and public assembly displayed a chart showing employees of the building where to go in the basement in case of an air raid, and sand was distributed through residential areas of the city for possible use against incendiary bombs. Coordinator Seth Burnley urged that home owners store buckets of this sand in the attics of their houses and that they attempt at the same time to clear attics of inflammable materials.20 Private individuals were no less busy than government officials and defense authorities. Men, women, and children took classes in such training courses as first aid, aircraft spotting, protection against incendiary bombs, bomb demolition, and recognition of poisonous gasses. Cub Scouts learned the names and locations of all important streets in the city and the locations of hospitals, post offices, police and fire stations, and railroad and bus depots in preparation for a possible emergency. Women who would have been afraid to light a firecracker learned theories of dealing with incendiary bombs, and men who would have stared helplessly at a splinter in Junior's finger spoke with authority of “square knots” and “pressure points.” Householders provided themselves with sand, long-handled shovels, water buckets, coils of rope, fire extinguishers, and other defense equipment. Despite the fact that these and other preparations were the subject of some jesting and levity and did, indeed, have their humorous aspects, they must be regarded as manifestations of the firm and cheerful determination to protect their homes and families against any danger and to win an eventual victory over all that menaced them which most Americans displayed during the entire conflict. If they served no other purpose, these home protective outfits provided psychological armor, so to speak, during harried, sorrowful days and restless, dream-filled nights. Many an American, having listened to the late news broadcast from bombtorn England, reassured himself with thought of the sand and shovel in his attic as he tossed upon his pillow in the darkness. Many a woman with a husband or sons involved in conflict staved off loneliness and dread by throwing herself into defense activities at home. Residents of Albemarle County and Charlottesville participated in defense activities on state and national as well as local levels. Randolph H. Perry was chosen by W. Glenn Elliot, state director, as one of twelve members of a statewide advisory board for the Virginia Aircraft Warning Service. Dr. Garrard Glenn. professor of law at the University, was appointed by the War Department as one of six lawyers on a fourteen-man Board of Review to report on applications for quick amortization of defense facilities.21 On March 20, 1942, residents of Charlottesville and Albemarle County awaited the area's first test blackout. Mayor W. D. Haden ordered full cooperation with municipal and Civilian Defense authorities in case of blackouts in a special proclamation which announced regulations for blackouts and penalties for their violation. The Daily Progress published a series of articles giving information as to procedures to be followed and the names, duties, and telephone numbers of Civilian Defense personnel. Local banks reported a problem in conforming with blackout regulations, since clauses in some insurance policies require that a light which shall be visible from the street be left burning above the door of the vault office. A compromise was finally effected by use of a low-power bulb.22 At 9:02 P.M., March 20, the city's three sirens, abetted by steam whistles atop the Barnes Lumber and University power plants, wailed the signal for total blackout. Within five or ten minutes afterward, defense officials surveying the city from the Monticello Hotel roof were complimented on the Stygian darkness which had enfolded the city by Midwestern visitors standing beside them. “So black were blacked-out Charlottesville, Crozet, Scottsville, and Farmington that Charlottesville's city manager and defense coordinator, Seth Burnley, jokingly declared this morning that the Army planes scheduled 'to look us over couldn't even find us,' ” The Daily Progress reported on the following afternoon. City and defense officials were high in their praise of the cooperation accorded them by area residents, and even crime appeared to be blacked out, as only one arrest, that of a man who appeared to be intoxicated, was made during the entire night. A few lights, however, remained unextinguished. Two persons refused to comply with air raid wardens' requests, and a light, thought to have been burning for years in the attic of the Elks' Home, was discovered and finally darkened, while a group of boys on a side street dealt in a summary fashion with a forgotten bulb by putting out its gleam with a sling shot. Both the local newspaper headquarters and the County Office Building had to be told that their lights were showing, but both remedied the situation quickly. Red lights continued to shine from a radio tower, and unofficial sources explained that they were a precaution to prevent the expected Army pilots from colliding with the steel spire. Officials estimated the cooperation of Charlottesville citizens at approximately ninety-nine per cent, while the blackout in Scottsville was one hundred per cent effective. Charlottesville officials cited as a typical example of the efficiency of air raid wardens the action of a Negro warden, Norman Byrd, who found three danger flares burning beside an open excavation on Sixth Street and doused them all, standing watch at the site until the blackout ended, when he relit the flames.23 One man, charged with deliberate violation of the city's blackout regulations, was sentenced to serve ninety days in jail and to pay a fine of $100, and other residents of the city were warned that infractions of regulations would be punished to the limit of the law.24 Shortly after this trial blackout, Charlottesville's City Manager-Civilian Defense Coordinator Seth Burnley was advised by the State Office of Civilian Defense that the Army, in preparing itself for “token” coastal attacks, might at any time order complete darkening of all communities within striking distance of the waterfront. Area residents were counseled to “keep cool” and to carry out the same procedures observed in practice blackouts. The original three air raid sirens bought by the city, which had been delivered early in March, 1942, had been installed atop the Monticello Hotel, north of University Circle on Rugby Road, and in the Fry's Spring area. Some residents complained that they could not hear the sirens, and Civilian Defense officials tried one or two apparently unsuccessful experiments in the placement of them to assure that their sound would carry better to the reaches of the city limits. Within five or six weeks the problem was solved when a fourth siren of great volume was delivered and installed on the Monticello Hotel, replacing a strong one which in turn was substituted for the weaker one in the Fry's Spring section.25 Charlottesville's first daylight test air raid, staged on May 29, 1942, was less successful than the March blackout and revealed a number of weak points in the city's defenses. The realism of the “raid” was heightened when four Civil Air Patrol planes dropped missiles on the objectives of the mock attack. The four pilots were Roy Franke, W. P. Kilgore, C. B. Lewis, and Arthur Eidelman. This ingenious experiment was thought to be the first use of artificial missiles in a test air raid drill anywhere in the nation. Upon the “bombs,” which consisted of long streamers weighted with small bags of sand, was written information concerning the objectives bombed and the resulting amount of damage which was supposed to have been done. Girl Scouts in uniform, labeled with tags indicating their “injuries,” served as casualties. A surprise squadron of planes operated by student pilots which accompanied the “raiders” lent verisimilitude to the scene. Civilian Defense personnel were alerted for action, and all residents of the city were supposed to be on guard against “incidents” which would be announced by the streamers from the circling planes. Although the defense organization, for the most part, performed smoothly, the general public acted exactly opposite to the approved procedure for air raids. Men, women, and children lined the streets and watched the planes drop their “bombs.” Traffic on Main Street moved east and west unchecked, despite the fact that wardens in charge of the Route 29 entrances to the city had halted all automobiles from the time of the alarm until the “all clear” signal. Residents made little effort to perform any fire-fighting maneuvers when messages dropped from the planes declared their homes to be on fire. The first report which reached the control center came from a woman who said that her house was full of smoke. Firemen who rushed to the Oxford Road address actually found a small fire in a sofa. “Injured” and “dead” Girl Scouts performed their roles with enthusiasm and some histrionic ability. One girl, lying on a truck, laughingly refused a photographer's request that she turn her head a little forward for a picture. “I can't,” she replied, “my back is broken.” Another, told to lean on her arm for the same photograph, answered sadly that she could not lean on the designated arm, as it had been torn off by a bomb! Although the test was less successful than defense officials had hoped it might be, Defense Coordinator Seth Burnley pointed out that much had been learned from the maneuvers.26 Residents of Albemarle County and Charlottesville participated with other Virginians in the first statewide blackout on the night of June 17, 1942. Local defense authorities had reason to be pleased with area observances of rules and regulations, and state officials pronounced the entire operation a success. Two months later, on August 18, city and county residents for the last time received in advance definite information about hours of a blackout period and air raid test. Subsequently it was necessary for them to be on the alert day and night for the sound of the community's sirens, which would come without previous warning. Linwood Chisholm, nine-year-old Negro boy, received minor injuries when he ran into the street in the course of the August 18 blackout and struck the side of an air raid warden's car. He was treated for bruised knees at the University Hospital. Sterling L. Williamson, assistant Civilian Defense coordinator, expressed surprise that there were no other casualties, warned pedestrians against remaining on the streets during blackouts, and stressed the fact that the lighting of matches on the streets by smokers constituted a violation of the regulations.27 As the first year of America's participation in the war drew to a close, the State Office of Civilian Defense announced in November, 1942, that local test air raids and blackouts were no longer considered to be necessary and that future blackouts would be arranged on a wider basis than previously. J. H. Wyse, state Civilian Defense coordinator, promised that the duration of the next statewide blackout, which was to come as a complete surprise, would not exceed sixty minutes. He warned that this blackout would be a rigid test of the effectiveness of the protective measures of Civilian Defense. The blackout, which came without warning on December 3, was termed “highly successful” in Charlottesville. Shortly afterward Civilian Defense officials appealed to Charlottesville citizens to use their telephones only in case of necessity during blackouts, as the local telephone company reported that 6,456 calls came into the office during the last blackout, of which fewer than 1,000 could have been calls made by wardens in the regular performance of their duties. One observer at the telephone office related, “At the first signal, the entire telephone board lighted up,” and a number of individuals talked constantly during the entire test, according to operators. An editorial in The Daily Progress pointed out that thoughtlessness was responsible for so many calls at a time when lines should be kept clear for necessary reports of defense officials or to summon aid in case of an emergency.28 As the need continued for twenty-four-hour aircraft warning service, Albemarle County and Charlottesville opened a drive for new airplane spotters. Area Supervisor C. Venable Minor outlined the plan of the service and explained its work. “Despite its weaknesses the Aircraft Warning System of this county is not a makeshift plan,” he said. “It has been well thought out and is modeled, with necessary modifications, after the method which has proved most successful overseas in warning against attack from enemy planes. It differs from some of our other types of defense work in that its value is dependent upon its readiness before the raids occur and not during or after an emergency.” Minor emphasized the preventative aspects of Aircraft Warning Service. “During or after is too late,” he pointed out. “It has no fixed quota to fill, no goal at which to aim except to be always on the alert to report to the Army Filter Center anything that flies which doesn't flap its wings. There is no implication here that aircraft warning duty is more important than any other defense duty, but it is just as important and in all likelihood it is more tiresome and has less glamor attached to it.” By way of assisting in the recruitment of spotters, one city retail store displayed in its window a replica of an air raid warning station, complete with imitation pine wall, old desk, lantern, telephone, flag, and the usual instructions to watchers, telling them not to talk to strangers, to speak clearly to the control center, and to be on time so that previous shifts would not have to work overtime. This window was left illuminated each night until ten o'clock, with an outside switch to facilitate extinguishing the lights in case of a blackout.29 Throughout the first two years of the war these members of the Ground Observer Corps kept watch at twelve to fifteen posts in Albemarle County and Charlottesville, including Miller School, Crozet, Covesville, Red Hill, Greenwood, Talcott, University Law Building, Garth Road, Stony Point, the Henry M. Bush estate, Earlysville, and Scottsville. A post at Shadwell was discontinued before the relaxation of Aircraft Warning Service activities, and one at Monticello was installed in 1943. Whereas elsewhere in the nation, according to stories prevalent in current conversation, buzzards and hawks were transmuted into enemy aircraft by the vivid imaginations of spotters stationed in lonely places and were duly reported to Aircraft Warning Service authorities, the only recorded instance of such an occurrence in this area involved an aural rather than a visual error. A story circulated that Raymond Uhl, chief spotter at the post atop the law building, flashed a warning reporting a plane. The Army called back, and Uhl confirmed his report. But as he replaced the receiver he sighted the potential raiders—three of the University's motor-driven lawn mowers coming across the Grounds in V-formation.30 The city of Charlottesville gave up its Christmas lights in December, 1942, as the national Office of Civilian Defense announced the curtailment of such decoration because of “the use of critical materials, consumption of electric power, and possibility of attack, as well as to eliminate potential fire hazards.” No attempt was made to discourage decoration in private homes, provided that any lighting conformed to applicable dimout regulations.31 In the same month Miss Mary Stamps White, executive secretary of the Civilian Defense Council and chairman of the Volunteer Special Service Corps of the local chapter of the American Red Cross, left the country to serve overseas as a Red Cross worker. Commenting on Miss White's varied and extensive wartime activities, an editorial in The Daily Progress remarked, “There are in each community a few who are ready to meet an emergency as it arises or even to anticipate it. Such a person is Mary Stamps White, who soon will leave this city to join a Red Cross Club Unit that probably will take her into or close to the actual battle fronts in some theatre of this War of Wars. Service is as much a part of Miss White's life as eating is to the average man or woman. She seems to thrive on service alone, asking nothing in return but more opportunities to serve.” To many residents of the community she seemed to typify the dauntless spirit of the locality and the nation. She was succeeded in turn by Mrs. Trent Terry, Mrs. Ella Plunkett, and Henry McComb Bush, the last named of whom took office in September, 1943, and continued to hold it through some two years until the organization gradually disappeared after V-J Day.32 In the early part of 1943 renewed efforts were made to secure volunteer air raid spotters, as replacements for others whose services had been lost. All who considered joining in this phase of Civilian Defense work were reminded that the local ration boards would readily grant priorities for automobile tires and allot sufficient gasoline to enable volunteers to make their regular trips back and forth to observation posts. But these later days of the war brought to the Ground Observer Corps a more significant development in the form of aircraft recognition schools. Several local residents went in turn to Richmond, Virginia, to attend classes of this sort and returned to instruct the personnel of their respective posts. Other spotters studied the distinguishing features of hostile and friendly airplanes in classes taught in Charlottesville and Scottsville. A meeting of spotters from all parts of the county was held in Scottsville, where United States Army personnel stressed the need for continuation of spotter vigilance. Thomas Jefferson's home entered the war in January, as an aircraft warning observation post was established at Monticello.33 In February Charlottesville sustained another daylight air raid test. Area blackouts held throughout the spring and summer went smoothly in both the city and the county, with defense officials generally pleased with the tests. A number of Charlottesville residents were guilty of violation of blackout regulations on several occasions, with the result that arrests were made and fines imposed. Among these were three local merchants.34 Difficulties in hiding lights during blackouts continued to harass individuals and defense authorities in this vicinity as elsewhere in the country. George T. Starnes, professor of economics at the University who served as an air raid warden, reported one knotty problem in a letter to Chief Warden Jack Martin after a blackout in April. “Dr. [Jesse W.] Beams tells me they face a real problem at the Physics building,” he wrote. “When they have to turn off the current it spoils some very valuable experiments and they have to start all over again. To hear him talk they are winning the war over there at the Physics building and I would prefer not to prolong the war if we can at all avoid it! He says it will cost them $200.00 and frequently more every time they have to turn off the juice. Do you have any suggestions as to what might be done to help them? I suggested that they black the place out but he said it was impossible to do so.”35 In July, 1943, ground observers of the Aircraft Warning Service were relieved of twenty-four-hour duty, although they were notified that they must be ready to resume such operations on short notice. This dispensation was made “on the basis of present enemy capabilities for air attack.” Vigilance was not abandoned, however, and tests continued to be made during the remainder of the year, both by day and at night.36 Aircraft spotters throughout the vicinity received honors and awards for their faithful service rendered during long and often lonely vigils. Mrs. Harrison Taylor was presented with the Merit Award Medal, the highest which the Army awarded for airplane spotting service by civilians, in recognition of her work at the Shadwell post, where she manned the midnight to 6 A. M. shift unaccompanied, at all times and in all kinds of weather. A supervisor's pin and a badge emblematic of 500 hours of service were awarded to C. Venable Minor, Aircraft Warning Service area supervisor, while approximately 1,300 members of the Charlottesville and Albemarle County Ground Observer Corps received service awards in September, 1943.37 Blackouts and air raid tests continued in Charlottesville and Albemarle County during the winter of 1943 and the spring and early summer of 1944. In August, 1944, however, the city and the county, together with other sections of central and western Virginia, were exempted from participation in future blackout tests. Civilian Defense organizations were not demobilized, despite this relaxation of duties, but were ordered to hold themselves in readiness for calls to duty if they were needed and to keep their equipment in shape for any emergency. Issuing the stand-by order, John J. Howard of the State Office of Civilian Defense congratulated Charlottesville and Albemarle defense workers on their accomplishments. “I want to take this opportunity to thank you for the splendid work accomplished by you and the people of Charlottesville,” he wrote in a letter to Coordinator Seth Burnley.38 In December, 1944, the Charlottesville and Albemarle County Civilian Defense Council was alerted for the last time, as Governor Colgate W. Darden, Jr., asked that all such councils remain on guard against a possible enemy attempt to launch V-2 robot bombs from off-shore vessels against residents of the eastern United States. No such attempt was made, however, and the alert ended without action. The community had had its last blackout, its last air raid. All possibility of danger from Europe ended with Germany's capitulation on May 8, 1945, when Charlottesville's sirens were sounded as a signal of victory. On May 17 Mayor Roscoe S. Adams issued a proclamation rescinding all city regulations for the conduct of blackouts in Charlottesville, three years and four months after Mayor W. D. Haden had promulgated the regulations on January 5, 1942.39 Throughout the entire duration of the conflict Charlottesville and Albemarle County had reason to be proud of area residents as a whole and of individuals and groups throughout the community. Civilian Defense in England included participation in actual conflict, fighting fires, administering first aid to the wounded, demolishing bombs, clearing rubble, saving lives, and preserving property. It constituted an actual defense of the homeland. Civilian Defense in America consisted of the routine performance of tiring and frequently irksome duties not actually demanded by immediate emergency. Its volunteers were motivated only by the knowledge that the practice might, on some occasion, prove useful. Civilian Defense in America rarely seemed heroic to those who took part in it or to those who were defended. Yet who can say that the raw stuff of which heroes are made was lacking in these members of the various Civilian Defense corps? They were called and they answered. They did all that was asked of them. Of what group anywhere can more be said? They manned their posts and walked their beats unswervingly through rain and snow, through heat and cold, despite the fact that they knew they probably could waver in the performance of the task without bringing direct harm to a single individual. With only a sense of duty to urge them on, they continued their work until victory had been assured. Surely, though no bomb more deadly than a small sand-filled sack fell on the city, though no plane more alien than one from a nearby county was spotted, though no unusual danger lurked in the blackouts, the Civilian Defense workers of Charlottesville and Albemarle County belong to the gallant company of those who have been tested and have stood the test. III Buying War Bonds An outstanding record was made by Charlottesville and Albemarle County in the purchase of war bonds and stamps. Under the leadership of William S. Hildreth, president of the Peoples National Bank, who served as permanent chairman of the local volunteer sales promotion organization throughout the entire period of the war, each of the eight loan drives exceeded its over-all quota. Defense Bonds At a luncheon of the Charlottesville Kiwanis Club on December 15, 1941, at which he read an appeal urging all wage-earners to buy U. S. defense bonds and stamps, Hildreth reported that the citizens of Charlottesville and Albemarle had been purchasing “defense bonds” for months but that in the week since Pearl Harbor sales had increased from $1,000 daily to $5,000 daily.1 By the New Year daily sales had climbed until Charlottesville averaged over $10,000 per day. This figure would have been even higher had not a bond shortage developed. Local banks, having sold out of the popular bonds and being unable to secure an adequate resupply, were holding large sums of money with which to buy when bonds again became available.2 This fast pace continued, and by the middle of March Charlottesville had bought nearly $900,000 worth of “offense bonds” since the Japanese attack, an average of $45 per citizen. But April saw a decline in sales.3 The first wild enthusiasm passed and was replaced by a more systematic war bond program. The most intensive effort since the Victory Loan Drive of World War I was initiated on May 1, 1942, all over the United States. In President Roosevelt's Fireside Chat of April 28, Americans were asked to pledge ten per cent of each pay check to the bond campaign. A goal of $600,000,000 of war bonds and stamps was set for the month of May, for June, $800,000,000, and for every month thereafter, $1,000,000,000. The first E bond quota assigned to Charlottesville and Albemarle County was $143,950 for the month of May, 1942, but sales totaled only $104,573. This figure, however, does not give the complete picture, since other types of bonds were bought in large blocks and a number of persons had made important purchases in other communities. Sales in the three Charlottesville banks for the six months following Pearl Harbor amounted to a maturity value of $1,146,675. There had been a marked drop after the record average of $10,000 a day for January, February and March.4 Bond selling campaigns were carried on in the city and county by groups of every type. Schools and industries, civic clubs and women's organizations, had their goals. Accounts of only a few of these campaigns can be included here. Manned by volunteer workers dressed in patriotic pinafores and caps, the American Legion “40 and 8” car, replica of the French railroad car of 1918, was stationed on Main Street in Charlottesville to assist in the Retail Merchants' campaign to increase the sale of war stamps and bonds in the city during July, 1942. Other booths were located in various parts of the city.5 The first wartime parade was sponsored by the Retail Merchants Association in an effort to sell $25,000 in bonds and stamps on American War Heroes Day, July 17. E. R. Newman, parade chairman, assembled a colorful series of units which took six minutes to pass a given point. Randolph H. Perry, the marshal, and most of the other participants, including the city officials, traveled on foot. There were, however, a number of bicycles and saddle horses in the parade. The Charlottesville Muncipal Band and the Jefferson High School Band furnished music to which marched the Virginia Protective Force, the various veterans organizations, the Red Cross units, and others. The University Volunteer Unit, which consisted of forty-five students who had cut classes at the last minute to shoulder realistic wooden rifles, was cheered as it marched along Main Street. Overhead droned the Civil Air Patrol. The city's American Heroes looked on by proxy from a store window where their photographs were displayed. The spirit of the day led customers to flock to the bond booths. All morning a line stood before the “defense window” at the post office.6 The visit of movie actress Greer Garson to Charlottesville in September was a gala event. Judge Armistead M. Dobie, toastmaster at the dinner given Miss Garson, paid high tribute to her and to the sunshine of her radiant presence. She in turn spoke of how much she enjoyed visiting Virginia. “Here in the Old Dominion you have wonderful towns and great little cities,” she said. “The heart of the country is in the big little towns.” At her appearance at a local theater she was heartily applauded. Stimulated by Miss Garson's visit, E bond sales soared, and reached a peak of $294,922 for September.7 “Women at War Week” the latter part of November saw about twenty women's organizations selling bonds and stamps in booths located in various stores in Charlottesville. On the first day, November 23, the United Daughters of the Confederacy, led by their president, Mrs. John R. Morris, set a record by selling $10,570 worth at their booth in the C. H. Williams department store. During the week the American Legion Auxiliary sold $7,984 worth, and the Jack Jouett Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution sold $4,119 worth. All together, more than $27,000 in war bonds and stamps were sold during the six days.8 On December 3 the Scottsville Lions Club put on a highly successful minstrel show at the Victory Theater in Scottsville. Edward N. (“Uncle Jim”) MacWilliams of Keene directed the show. From admission charges a sizeable contribution was made to the Lions' fund for the blind. A number of servicemen, including some British seamen, were in the audience, and several had an impromptu part in the show. The highlight of the evening was the auction of objects to purchasers of war bonds and stamps. The necktie of Sergeant Merril L. Carter of Scottsville, then serving in India, brought the high bid of $2,000. More than $20,000 worth of bonds and stamps were sold.9 First War Loan The Victory Fund Drive, later known as the First War Loan, brought 1942 to a close. It was carried on jointly by the local city-county War Savings Committee, appointed by the U. S. Treasury Department, which promoted sales of Series E savings bonds, and by the Victory Fund Committee, appointed by the Federal Reserve Bank, which promoted sales of securities other than E bonds. Series E bonds were ten-year appreciation bonds issued at three-fourths of maturity value. Both locally and nationally the drive was a success. The division of responsibility led to some confusion and makes it difficult to secure accurate and complete figures, but there was less uncertainty here, where both promotional agencies had enlisted William S. Hildreth to serve as chairman of their local committee, than in many other communities. Between November 30 and December 31, 1942, the people of Charlottesville and Albemarle County purchased $842,755 worth of government bonds. Of this amount $106,668 represented purchases of E bonds, for which there was a quota of $150,000. Purchases made by commercial banks were excluded from the tabulation of these sales and were never included in the sales credited to the community in later drives. Nearly thirteen billions were subscribed by the nation as a whole. This made a good beginning to the financing of the war.10 Second War Loan On Monday, April 12, 1943, the Second War Loan Drive to raise thirteen billion dollars began. Charlottesville and Albemarle County, assigned a quota of $1,313,900, again went to work buying bonds under the leadership of William S. Hildreth, who was assisted by a committee of the Lions Club in the city and a similar committee of citizens, under Harry Frazier, Jr., in the county. Although the campaign began officially on April 12, the sales of Series E, F, and G bonds between April 1 and May 8 were counted toward fulfilling the quota. Other U. S. Treasury securities were on sale between April 12 and May 1. Alex Thompson was chairman of publicity in this and all subsequent drives. Full page advertisements in The Daily Progress urging the purchase of bonds had been sponsored jointly by thirty local business organizations each week beginning on February 10. With some changes in sponsors, these continued to appear regularly throughout the war. Local firms frequently supported the bond drives individually with advertisements in the newspapers, over the radio, and on billboards.11 The drive was a success from the start. By Friday of the first week $628,450 worth of bonds had been bought, and by the following Wednesday the quota had been exceeded. Many local business firms made substantial purchases and contributed materially to the early success of the drive. The campaign was pushed to the end of the three-week period. Local sales finally totaled $1,550,873, of which $1,358,250 worth was sold by the Peoples National Bank. For this outstanding achievement in individually exceeding the entire local quota, the bank was given a United States Treasury Department Citation, which corresponded to the Army-Navy “E” award for superior industrial production. Lane High School, which sold $131,000 worth of bonds and stamps, was also given a citation.12 A national campaign, announced early in March, was started to encourage school children to buy bonds and stamps. Any school which sold stamps and bonds in the amount of $900, the price of a jeep, was eligible for a certificate signed by the Secretary of the Treasury, bearing a picture of a jeep in action and the name of the school. The quota for Virginia was 174 jeeps. By a vigorous selling campaign, Lane High School accounted for forty-seven jeeps. Venable School raised funds for three jeeps, and Clark School added another. In the county Scottsville High School, Greenwood High School, and Albemarle Training School for Negroes each sold enough bonds and stamps in this campaign to win a certificate.13 Finding itself unable, because of war conditions, to undertake the usual amount of construction work, the Charlottesville City Council in May bought $100,000 worth of war bonds. This action was generally approved, the citizens feeling that the money would be doubly useful, first in winning the war and later in building their city.14 An analysis of war bonds sales in Virginia for the fiscal year beginning July 1,1942, showed that in Charlottesville and Albemarle County $2,017,263 worth of war bonds and stamps had been distributed within twelve months. This sum represented per capita purchases of $44 and was equivalent to 5.4 per cent of the estimated per capita income. This local record was disappointing when compared with per capita purchases of $59, which were equivalent to 9.2 per cent of estimated per capita income, for the state as a whole.15 Third War Loan On September 9, 1943, the nation's Third War Loan Drive started. Beginning with this drive, all bond selling activities were placed under the Albemarle County-Charlottesville War Finance Committee, an agency of the U. S. Treasury Department which succeeded all previous agencies. Charlottesville and Albemarle County had a quota of $2,877,700, over $1,500,000 more than the quota for the previous drive. Seeking to curb inflation by getting individuals to invest as much as possible of the “easy” money which was coming into their hands, the Federal government placed great emphasis on the sale of E bonds. The local E bond quota for September and October was $701,000 and was a part of the larger quota for the drive. In this drive William S. Hildreth, permanent chairman, was ably assisted by C. T. O'Neill, Vice-President of the National Bank and Trust Company, who served as county chairman, and by Harry Frazier, Jr., Vice-President of the Peoples National Bank, who was in charge of special subscriptions.16 Because “this is the cradle of liberty” and because of Albemarle's “wonderful war bond record,” Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr., chose Charlottesville as the place from which to make his first report on the bond drive to the nation. At the “Freedom Sing” held at the Rotunda of the University of Virginia on Sunday afternoon, September 12, Morgenthau told a crowd of over 3,000 people that “Jefferson's abiding faith informs and inspires the new generation of Americans on the battlefronts thousands of miles away. The noblest appreciation we can pay him is to understand that we must carry Jefferson's good, valiant fight on and on.” After reporting that over two billion dollars had been subscribed in the first three days of the drive, Morgenthau cited the example of the 540 employees of Frank Ix and Sons, Inc., of Charlottesville, who had pledged a week's pay to the purchase of war bonds over and above those purchased by payroll deductions. “If everybody does as well, I can assure you this bond drive will be a great success,” he said. Charlottesville Negro choirs form a V for Victory to open the Third War Loan Drive. The principal address at the “Freedom Sing” was delivered by Judge Armistead M. Dobie. Harry Rogers Pratt arranged the musical program and led the singing. A Negro chorus of more than one hundred voices, under the direction of L. Augustus Page, sang several spirituals, and the University of Virginia Band, directed by James E. Berdahl, played several stirring numbers. In the evening Secretary Morgenthau presided as master of ceremonies on the “We, the People” radio broadcast which originated from Jefferson's study at Monticello. A crowd of nearly 500, seated on the lawn in front of the east portico of Jefferson's home, listened to the nationwide appeal to buy bonds and heard various persons introduced by Morgenthau. Among these were Brigadier General Cornelius Wickersham, head of the School of Military Government at the University of Virginia; Mrs. Lucian K. Truscott, Jr., wife of Major General Truscott; Mrs. Demas T. Craw, widow of the late Colonel “Nick” Craw, who had been the first American to die in the invasion of North Africa; Lieutenant Landon L. Davis, Jr., back from a year's service aboard a submarine in the Pacific; Mrs. Henry Harlow, mother of three sons in the air forces; Mrs. Betty King, local factory worker, who had three brothers and a husband in the service; and Willis Henderson, Negro employee at Monticello, whose family had lived at Monticello since Jefferson's time. Ernie Pyle, beloved war correspondent, who had witnessed the Sicily invasion, told of seeing the use of war materials bought by money invested in war bonds. “I've known enemy artillery that had to retreat because it ran out of ammunition,” he said, “but in Sicily we had such immense stores of ammunition that there was never fear at any time about our having enough to overwhelm the enemy. That's what war bonds can do.”17 Realizing that Secretary Morgenthau's visit had brought responsibility as well as honor with it, Charlottesville and Albemarle began buying bonds in earnest, and by September 21 the half-way mark had been reached. An uphill battle remained, however. E bond sales lagged badly. The “Retailers for Victory” committee of the Chamber of Commerce, in cooperation with the Retail Merchants Association and the local War Finance Committee, planned a Saturday Night War Bond Rally for the benefit of those who were unable to make their purchases in the daytime. On September 25 East Third Street between Main and Water was the scene of this special program. The Lane High School Band, directed by Sharon Hoose, furnished the music, and J. Lawson Stott was master of ceremonies. There were seven booths on the street in charge of young ladies who took orders for bonds, and all three downtown banks were open from 7:15 to 9:30 P. M. to issue E bonds. The success of the evening is measured by the $14,437.50 worth of war bonds sold.18 On October 1 the local quota was topped. The Commonwealth of Virginia had invested $11,500,000 in war bonds and credited to each locality a proportional part. Charlottesville and Albemarle were thereby given a boost of $318,550, enough to put them over the top. On October 1 local sales and credits for the Third War Loan totaled $3,009,427. Later this figure was increased to $3,119,290.19 Fourth War Loan The Fourth War Loan Drive extended from January 18 to February 15, 1944. As in the previous drive, William S. Hildreth, chairman of the local War Finance Committee, was assisted by C. T. O'Neill and Harry Frazier, Jr. Especial emphasis was again placed on sales to individuals, particularly of Series E bonds, which had a quota of $510,000 out of a total local quota of $2,353,000. The retail merchants and their employees, working through the Retailers War Finance Committee with Frank Payne as chairman, undertook to make the campaign a success. On the opening day stores were closed until 10:00 A. M., and all employees attended a mass meeting at the Paramount Theatre. The principal address was made by James S. Easley, the executive director of the War Finance Committee for Virginia and a past president of the Virginia State Chamber of Commerce. Brief talks were also made by Lieutenant J. Elmer Harlow, back from Europe where he had recently taken part in the great Schweinfurt air raid, and by two wounded veterans from the Woodrow Wilson General Hospital near Staunton, Virginia. Each sales person present was asked to sell a minimum of $200 worth of war bonds during the drive.20 Four days later the quarter-milepost was passed, and by the eighth day the halfway mark was reached. E bond sales lagged behind, however, and not until February 2 did they reach the halfway mark. Meanwhile, a letter was received from Lieutenant Billy McCann. U.S.M.C., Sergeant Maurice A. Bibb, A.U.S., Private Johnny Davis, U.S.M.C., and Fire Controlman First Class Kenneth W. Beale, a Seabee, who had spent Christmas day together on an island in the South Pacific. They wrote: “We are on a one-way road that leads straight to Tokyo. There's no turning back and you can be sure we'll get there. We miss good old Charlottesville, so please buy a lot of war bonds and help us get home early.” As if in answer to this request, the general drive went over the top on February 3.21 Every resource was then turned to gaining the E bond quota. Buyers of these bonds who made their purchases at the Paramount Theatre were guests of the theatre at a showing of “Destination Tokyo” on February 16. This was one of many successful “War Bond Premieres.” The Retailers' War Finance Committee, in cooperation with the Lane High School Bond Committee, conducted an auction sale on February 25 at the high school. Valuable items, such as Nylon hose and Virginia hams, were offered to bond buying bidders by G. F. Norcross, the auctioneer. High bids for articles auctioned included a $5,000 bond purchase for an old typewriter, $2,000 for a $25 war bond donated for the auction, and $2,000 for a chair. In all, $32,000 worth of E bonds were purchased. This was enough to top the quota and make the Fourth War Loan a complete success in Charlottesville and Albemarle. The community was warmly congratulated for its success by state officials. Altogether $3,362,178 worth of all types of war bonds were bought, the quota being exceeded by more than a million dollars.22 From Major Charles N. Hulvey, Jr., with the Marines came the warm tribute. “The fighting spirit of the people of Charlottesville and Albemarle, exemplified by their unselfish purchase of war bonds, gives us of the hometown, in the South Pacific, a glowing sense of pride in the community we already regard so highly.”23 Fifth War Loan First to purchase a war bond in the Fifth War Loan Drive which started June 12, 1944, just six days after the Normandy invasion, was Lieutenant General Alexander Archer Vandegrift, Commandant of the United States Marine Corps. The bond was handed to General Vandegrift by Mrs. John R. Frizzell, Jr., who, like the general, hailed from Charlottesville.24 Keenly aware of the titanic struggle in which fathers, sons, husbands, and brothers were engaged on the coast of Europe, citizens as never before bought bonds, feeling that thus they had a share in supplying the Monticello Guard as it fought its way into France. Raymond Hunt, president of the Chamber of Commerce, who served as campaign chairman, reported more E bonds sold on the first day of the drive than in any previous day in the history of the city.25 In Albemarle County, C. T. O'Neill headed the sales organization. Committees were set up; the Scottsville Lions Club canvassed the southern end of the county, while the Crozet Lions and the Greenwood Community League worked in the western section.26 The over-all quota for the community was $2,700,000, but within ten days the first million was secured and sales to individuals had passed one-third of the quota.27 One June 27 the Treasury Department's special war bond trailer, containing an exhibition of captured German and Japanese battle equipment, was parked from 6:00 to 10:00 P. M. in front of the Paramount Theatre, where, on the following evening, “The Eve of St. Mark” was shown as a War Bond Premiere.28 On the thirtieth a bond auction, similar to the one held during the fourth loan, took place at Lane High School, but the attendance was poor. On the Fourth of July the Crispus Attucks Post No. 62 of the American Legion sponsored a parade on Main Street, followed by a war bond rally at Washington Park.29 A feature of the Fifth War Loan Drive was the contest among civic and fraternal organizations and the contest among industrial plants. Each organization or plant had a war bond quota against which it measured its sales. The record sale of 2,302 per cent of quota made by the Kiwanis Club is hard to comprehend, but so are the records of B'nai B'rith, 2,274 per cent, and the Rotary Club, 2,267 per cent. Industrial plant records were also impressive; the leaders were Monticello Dairy, 789 per cent: Virginia Stage Lines, 750 per cent; and Southern Welding and Machine Company, 719 per cent.30 By July 3 the over-all quota was topped, but the E bond quota of $475,000 was less than half subscribed. Continued effort brought results, and by the end of July all quotas had been exceeded. Total sales reached $4,669,053, almost two million dollars over the quota, and the lagging E bond sales at last passed the quota by over $17,000. Ben C. Moomaw, Jr., senior deputy manager for the Treasury Department's War Finance Committee for Virginia, wrote to Hildreth, “While the entire performance of your committee in the Fifth War Loan Campaign is top-flight, your sales of other [than E] bonds to individuals surpass anything that has been done in the State in any of the war loan drives.” These purchases in the county and city were $3,066,721.75, or $1,341,721.75 over the quota of $1,750,000.31 Sixth War Loan The Sixth War Loan brought 1944 to a close. The campaign to raise a quota of $2,610,000 was conducted between November 20 and December 16, but sales of E bonds were pushed throughout all of both months. J. Emmett Gleason, City Commissioner and former Mayor of Charlottesville, was named chairman for the drive. Under the chairmanship of Miss Sylvia P. Horwitz, teacher at Lane High School and a member of the Education Committee of the statewide war bond sales organization, the school children spearheaded the campaign.32 Prizes of war bonds and stamps were offered in the city and county schools to those who made the most individual sales and also to those who sold the largest dollar value of bonds. In some of the smaller schools prizes were offered for the greatest dollar value in bond sales only. The drive was opened by Major Don Gentile, American fighter pilot ace of the European theater, who was credited with destroying over thirty German planes. On November 20 he visited five city schools and then went to McIntire School, where he spoke to a gathering of the county school children. He stressed the fact that war bond sales made possible the purchase of material essential to winning the war.33 The following Saturday a thirty-nine man Infantry combat team staged “Here's Your Infantry” at Scott Stadium. Various items of infantry equipment, including the “Bazooka”, were displayed, and a sham battle was enacted in which a well equipped Jap pillbox was taken by flame throwers.34 At Clark School students achieved the sale of a dollar's worth of war bonds or stamps for each of the 3,633 miles from Pearl Harbor to Tokyo. At McGuffey School $15,000 in war bonds were sold by pupils in order to secure the purchase of an army training plane. On December 7 Lane High School completed a campaign begun in September to purchase a PBY Consolidated Vultee Catalina Patrol Bomber costing $172,000. Actually their bond sales reached $181,793,90. A decalcomania bearing the name and address of the school was forwarded to the Treasury Department to be mounted on the plane. This was the first PBY Catalina Bomber to be purchased by a Virginia school.35 By December 2 half of the over-all quota had been subscribed, and by the twelfth the drive was over the top, but as usual E bond sales lagged. In an effort to meet the E bond quota of $425,000, of which only about sixty per cent had been subscribed, school children in the sixth grade and above, who had actually been working as members of the Sixth War Loan Army in the bond drive, were dismissed from their classes at two o'clock on December 14 to canvass the city, house by house. They took orders for bonds which were later purchased at the regular sources. This helped, but it was Santa Claus who put the E bond drive over. People began to buy large amounts of bonds for Christmas presents, and the quota was quickly passed on December 20. Charlottesville and Albemarle County were among the very first communities in the state of Virginia to surpass all quotas in the Sixth War Loan.36 Sales of all types of bonds in the city-county area for the drive were 248 per cent of quota and totaled $6,471,507, or $3,861,507 more than the quota. After a slow start E bond purchasers boosted sales in that category to $627,530, or $202,530 in excess of the quota. In appreciative recognition of the energetic campaign conducted through the schools, Chairman Gleason said, “With the final report showing the area well ahead in E bond purchases, it is apparent that the children are largely responsible for this success since their work was confined solely to this field. I want to congratulate the youngsters for their remarkable work.”37 The unflagging zeal of Lane High School students resulted in the record sales of $492,326.55 worth of war bonds and stamps during the first semester of the 1944 session. This was the largest amount ever reported by a Virginia school. Sales in the other schools of Charlottesville brought the city total to $686,938.71.38 Seventh War Loan By 1945 almost every worker who was regularly employed had been given an opportunity to buy war bonds through the payroll savings plan. So effective was the campaign that nearly everyone who could was buying bonds by this method. Between drives it was these purchases which accounted for most of the sales. In the month of February, 1945, these interim sales reached their local peak when a quota of $125,000 was exceeded by 143 per cent, sales amounting to $304,564. During each drive a great effort had been made to increase payroll deductions for bonds, but in the Seventh this procedure was varied a little. The campaign for payroll deductions was made in April, and the regular bond selling drive began May 14.39 Having made an outstanding success of the Sixth War Loan Drive, J. Emmett Gleason was drafted to lead the “Mighty Seventh,” which had the largest quota of any drive. Charlottesville and Albemarle County were asked to buy a total of $3,560,000 worth of war bonds. Of this amount, $660,000 was to be E bonds. Since this quota exceeded by over $30,000 the largest amount of E bonds ever sold in the community, it presented an extreme challenge. To meet it, Chairman Gleason again enlisted the aid of the school children. Since schools would close soon after the regular campaign began on May 14, a special drive and contest, with war bonds as prizes, was conducted by the schools from April 30 to May 18, along the same lines as the one during the Sixth War Loan.40 President Franklin D. Roosevelt having died on April 12, Frederick C. Disque of the University of Virginia prepared for the bond committee of Lane High School a scroll to be signed by bond purchasers, who through their financial support of the war effort expressed a reaffirmation of their faith in freedom and democracy. When completed the scroll was sent to the Roosevelt Museum at Hyde Park, New York.41 On May 15 the Charlottesville chapter of the American Association of University Women gave a performance of Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta, “The Mikado.” Tickets for the show were given to each purchaser of an E bond and over 500 persons attended. On the day of the performance one bank sold over $13,000 worth of bonds to persons desiring to attend. June 7 brought the usual War Bond Premiere, but on the day before there was also “Free Movie Day” in observance of the first anniversary of the invasion of France. Bond buyers had the choice of attending either the premiere or of attending any moving picture theater in the city on the sixth, free.42 The school campaign carried the E bond drive more than one-fourth of the way to the quota, but as soon as it ended E bond sales began to lag even though other bond sales moved ahead. By June 13 the over-all quota had been passed, but only 66 per cent of the E bond quota had been sold. A week later Charlottesville and Albemarle County, $1,168,297 over the general quota, were lagging behind most of the state in E bond sales. Over $185,000 worth had to be sold in a hurry. Special stress was laid on getting workers who had made payroll deductions to buy additional bonds during the drive. During the last week of June the Boy Scouts were sent scurrying to secure pledges to put the E bond drive over. The response was disheartening. July 1 found the drive still $100,000 short of the E bond quota. With one week of grace allowed, efforts were redoubled, but when the drive ended, Charlottesville and Albemarle had apparently failed by over $48,000 to reach the E bond quota. Then belated reports began to close the gap. Final figures at last showed the quota topped by $103,599. Purchases of E bonds throughout the world by members of the armed forces from this area and credited to the local community had put the drive across. The greatest drive of the war had been a complete success. Indeed, it was nothing short of remarkable. Against an over-all quota of $3,560,000, a total of $7,780,094 worth of war bonds had been bought in Charlottesville and Albemarle County. Among Virginia communities this one ranked twelfth with a percentage of 218.57.43 Victory Loan The Eighth War Loan Drive, coming after the victory in both Europe and Asia, was designated the “Victory Loan”. Only eleven billion dollars was asked by the Federal government as against fourteen billion asked in the previous drive. Charlottesville and Albemarle consequently had a somewhat smaller combined goal of only $2,600,000. As usual, this was subdivided: $450,000 for E bonds, $1,750,000 for other types of bonds bought by individuals, and $400,000 for purchases by corporations. The drive began October 29 and ended December 8, but E bonds sold up to December 31, 1945, counted toward the quota for the drive. Miss Mary Stamps White, former executive secretary of the local office of Civilian Defense and only recently returned from overseas duty with the American Red Cross in Europe, was chairman for the Victory Loan Drive. She was the first Albemarle County resident to head the joint city-county campaign and the first woman to accept the reins in such an undertaking.44 The drive opened with the announcement that the all-star United States Coast Guard Victory Armada, including a thirty-piece band and a cast of entertainers, would give a performance at the Paramount Theatre on November 8 for purchasers of war bonds. The auditorium was scaled to produce a total of $216,315 in bond sales, with reserved seat sections including accommodations for purchasers of $25, $50, $100, $200, $500, and $1,000 E bonds. As soon as tickets became available, sales became brisk. The $25 and $1,000 seats were sold out almost at once, but those in between moved more slowly. Only seventy-five per cent of the seats had been taken up by the day of the show. Approximately 1,200 Victory bond buyers saw the two hours of entertainment and paid a total of $143,450 into the Treasury for the privilege. This was considerably less than the projected $216,315, but it accounted for the greater part of early E bond sales.45 As usual the city and county schools pushed war bond sales. The prizes of war bonds to those pupils securing purchases of bonds were again offered. At Lane High School the drive was opened by a meeting at which four returned veterans spoke. Lieutenant James Hageman, who had been a bombardier with the Eighth Air Force in Europe, told of the need to finish paying for the war and for rehabilitation. Beginning November 16 a special five-day campaign to secure bond purchases in memory of the forty-five alumni of Lane High School who gave their lives in World War II was held. A goal of $200 for each of their honored dead was set. A total of $519,420 in Victory bonds was sold by Charlottesville school children during the drive; of this amount $400,095 was sold by Lane High School.46 By November 16 the quota of sales of other than E bonds to individuals had been passed, but as usual the sales of E bonds fell behind. Not until the first week in December did the sales of E bonds reach half of the quota. Meanwhile, in an effort to spur sales, special bond displays in the baby departments of stores were arranged, and workers in these departments urged persons buying presents for new-born babies to add to the gift an E bond. The approach of Christmas offered another occasion for the purchases of bonds for gifts.47 When the main drive ended on December 8, the sale of bonds to corporations and the sales of other than E bonds to individuals were both over the top with their quotas trebled, but only 60 per cent of the E bond quota had been subscribed. The next week, however, sales took a sudden spurt, only to bog down again the following week. Purchases of E bonds for Christmas presents and others who rallied to last minute appeals finally put the drive over.48 The purchases of E bonds by city and county servicemen and servicewomen away from home, always credited toward the local quotas, amounted to more than $50,000 per drive. These and late purchases finally ran E bond sales to $601,968 or $151,968 over the quota for the Victory Loan Drive. Bond sales in other than E bonds to individuals amounted to $6,202,270, and purchases by corporations amounted to $2,005,638. An over-all quota of $2,600,000 was surpassed by sales of $8,809,876, the largest amount ever raised locally. “The Victory Loan campaign is in every respect your crowning achievement,” wrote Ben C. Moomaw, Jr., co-executive manager of the War Finance Committee for Virginia, to Hildreth. “No committee in the State has done a better job, and, in some respects, none has done as good a job.”49 With the close of the Victory Loan Drive, great public campaigns for the sale of bonds ceased, but the bonds, renamed United States Savings Bonds, continued on sale. The payroll savings system remained in effect and workers continued to purchase bonds through it. During the year of 1946 a total of $2,213,600.75 worth of savings bonds were bought in Charlottesville and Albemarle County. This amount compares favorably with the sales for the year 1942 and shows that the habit of buying bonds has been in a measure carried over into the years of peace.50 Between 1941 and 1945, inclusive, $42,229,293 worth of war bonds were purchased in Charlottesville and Albemarle County, while the quotas for the same period totaled only $22,181,150. This record placed this community fourth among approximately a hundred War Finance Committee areas in Virginia. Only Campbell County, Henrico County, and Middlesex County had higher sales in relation to their quotas. Never once did Charlottesville and Albemarle County fail to meet the over-all quota for a bond drive, and though E bond sales often lagged, only in the first drive, before the community was well organized to sell E bonds, was the quota not attained. Between drives, the sales record is somewhat spotty. Sometimes the interim quota was exceeded, sometimes not. The gross sales were indeed large and justly a source of great pride to the community. Yet in 1944, the year of three bond drives, when $15,221,395 worth of war bonds were sold locally, the total amount raised was enough to pay the costs of the war for only about one hour and twenty minutes.51 It is a creditable achievement for one small community within a year to underwrite the staggering cost of global war for even so short a time. But the ultimate significance of the generous investment in democracy by the people of Charlottesville and Albemarle County will not become fully assessable until the decade of the 1950's, when their millions or dollars worth of war bonds will mature. Then dollars which have already fought for freedom will return to buy in the local markets many things which will contribute to the happiness of the patriotic investors and to the welfare of the community.

IV Salvaging Scarce Materials Certain articles, usually discarded by a proverbially wasteful American public, assumed a new value when the United States was drawn into the war. The salvage of waste paper, scrap metals, rubber, fats, and cloth, all needed by factories in the war effort, became one of the major activities of the civilian population as sources of supply were cut off or because the manpower which normally produced them was transferred to other war industries and the armed forces. In Charlottesville and Albemarle County the salvage drives were successful not only because of the leadership of public spirited older citizens but also because of the assistance of many of the younger residents of the community. Children were able to hunt and collect waste materials during hours which they spared from sports and other recreational activities of peacetime. Only in the purchase and sale of war bonds and war stamps was the younger generation, working through its schools and clubs, as helpful. Their value in salvage campaigns became apparent before Pearl Harbor in the aluminum drive held in July, 1941, as part of the national defense program. Charlottesville Boy and Girl Scouts collected old aluminum, needed for aircraft production, in a house-to-house canvass directed by an executive committee elected at a Court House meeting. Large heaps were also collected at Scottsville, Crozet, Miller School, and designated stores throughout the county.1 In December, 1941, the Northern Virginia Regional Defense Council called upon all citizens of Charlottesville and Albemarle County to begin immediately saving waste paper, scrap iron, rubber, copper, and rags as well as aluminum. This council had received its direction from Leon Henderson, administrator of the Office of Price Administration, by way of the Virginia Defense Council. Charitable organizations and other clubs were urged to collect scrap and sell direct to dealers for profit. In January, 1942, the War Production Board was created with Donald Nelson as chairman. He improved salvage activities by organizing in the War Production Board a Salvage Division, which cooperated with the Civilian Defense Councils in the states. This Salvage Division issued instructions to the Virginia State Salvage Committee in Richmond. In turn this committee relayed information and inspiration through the medium of its mimeographed Salvage Bulletins, beginning in March, 1942, to the local Civilian Defense Council. A city and a county Salvage Committee had been organized in the early days of that agency. Consequently, the committee members were informed promptly as to the nation's needs. Suggestions were made as to practical methods of salvaging critically scarce materials. Posters and pamphlets were provided to portray the need for particular materials and to explain their importance in the war effort. Having gained in this way an understanding of each shortage, the residents of this city and county gave a full measure of cooperation in most of the salvage campaigns. For the duration City Manager Seth Burnley served as head of the Salvage Committee for Charlottesville. He was assisted by Mrs. Lyttelton Waddell, who served from June, 1942, until January, 1944, and then for some time by Mrs. Randolph Harrison. Larned Randolph served as county chairman until January, 1944, when he was succeeded by Henry McComb Bush.2 Waste Paper Number one on the list of serious shortages was paper. Enormous quantities of waste paper were used to make cartons in which food, clothing, and war goods were shipped to servicemen. As early as December 22, 1941, Leon Henderson, administrator of the Office of Price Administration, wrote Mayor W. D. Haden of Charlottesville urging a renewed and active effort to collect as much waste paper and cardboard as possible. At that time the Salvage Committees for Charlottesville and Albemarle County asked people to send their waste paper to R. E. Hall, Jr., at the City Yards. The local junk dealers, L. E. Coiner, Henry Hill, and Harry Wright, shipped the paper to pulp mills, which paid an average of forty cents per hundred pounds. About thirty tons of waste paper and cardboard were collected by the city for each of the months of January, February, and March, 1942; and from January through May a total of 368 tons was collected in the county and shipped by only two dealers. In August 73,020 pounds were collected by the city and county.3 During the two years 1942 and 1943 city trucks collected only 258 tons of which Charlottesville Boy Scouts contributed two and one-half tons for the year 1943.4 Beginning with 1944, however, much larger quantities of paper were salvaged when city collections were supplemented by increasingly large contributions from the county and the Boy Scouts. A need for containers had become acute, with millions of servicemen on the far sides of the Atlantic and the Pacific being supplied as no other armies had ever been supplied before. The city collected 87,930 pounds in April. In July the City Fire Department became the collection depot when a bin made especially for the purpose was installed in front of the fire house. The firemen, using the baler given them by a patriotic citizen, converted the accumulated paper into 150-pound bales and shipped it to a pulp mill in Richmond. By November 15 they had sent sixty tons. During November 8–22 Charlottesville retail merchants cooperated with local salvage officials by declaring a Paper Holiday. Throughout that period their customers were asked to help conserve wrapping paper by accepting as many packages as possible unwrapped.5 Contributing greatly to the success of paper salvage in 1944 and 1945 were the Boy Scout drives directed by Earl Snyder. In January, 1944, the Scouts set out to “Salvage More in '44” and load two railroad cars in that month. With the help of trucks loaned by sixteen business firms, they filled three freight cars: seventy-five tons, an amount well above their goal, were shipped to the paper mill A drive in April totaled 73,900 pounds, another in July 76,120 pounds. In honor of the Scouts, business men, and truck drivers who had cooperated to make these drives a success, a picnic supper was given at McIntire Park. Troop Number 5 received an award for having the highest percentage of its membership enrolled in the drives.6 The Executive Secretary of the Virginia State Salvage Committee observed in a letter praising the Scouts's accomplishment. “The amount of waste paper collected since the first of the year by your organization, 310,000 pounds has caused the salvaging of paper in Charlottesville to be outstanding in the State of Virginia.”7 A fourth drive in October totaled 65,000 pounds and filled two more railroad cars. Three cars were filled with the 90,000 pounds gathered in the fifth drive of February, 1945; and the April drive topped them all with the imposing figure of 210,000 pounds. At a Boy Scout Court of Honor on June 7, 1945, thirty-two Scouts, each of whom had collected a minimum of 1,000 pounds, were presented the General Eisenhower award by Lieutenant J. L. Bridges of the School of Military Government at the University of Virginia.8 As a part of the annual Clean-Up, Paint-Up Campaign, the county schools launched a special paper drive in April of 1944. A county truck made the rounds of the schools, and additional depots were set up for people far out in the country. In two weeks 20,000 pounds of paper were collected. Quite apart from this amount, as was pointed out by Paul H. Cale, principal of the Greenwood High School, was the exceptionally large collection made by the Boy Scouts of Greenwood and Crozet. It totaled 37,500 pounds: 21,000 from Greenwood, 16,500 from Crozet. Final figures for the county during the month of April were 73,132 pounds. May brought only 6,840 pounds, and June still less, 2,240 pounds, with the close of school.9 The national supply of paper was critically low in the summer of 1944. Each monthly collection had fallen an average of 67,000 tons short of the national quota. The invasion of France had begun. In response to a special plea from Washington salvage activities in the county were intensified. The total collection for July was 33,878 pounds. A Scout drive at Crozet netted 100,000 pounds, another brought in 110,000 pounds, and in addition to these drives, the county salvaged 110,000 pounds between February of 1944 and June of 1945. Proceeds of the sale made by L. E. Coiner were divided between the county schools, which received $534.16, and the Community Fund and Red Cross, which together received $280.00.10 Other groups were also active in the county. The 4-H Club of Earlysville collected 15,900 pounds of paper. With the $40.00 received from its sale the club bought a war bond and paid for certain other club objectives. Home Demonstration and 4-H Club members throughout the county collected 59,600 pounds of paper during 1944, 12,000 in 1945.11 In August of 1945 the State Salvage Committee announced that waste paper, along with tin cans and household fats, would continue to be salvaged even though the war had come to an end.12 Scrap Metals Metal was second on the list of materials which the Federal government desired to recover through salvage. The United States had lived to regret its policy during the 1930's which had encouraged the Japanese to buy American scrap iron for their war machine. In December, 1941, American rearmament necessitated a hunt for scrap metal; but it was in February of 1942, when thirty-nine blast furnaces of the steel industries in the nation were compelled to shut down due to a lack of scrap, that collecting metal became imperative. The knowledge that twenty-five per cent of the metal used in the manufacture of essential steel was scrap iron gave meaning to the Salvage for Victory Program launched in March of 1942.13 Residents of the community were asked to search their garrets for worn out household metals of all kinds, including everything except tin cans and razor blades, the first then being considered non-reclaimable, the second, too hazardous to handle. City junk dealers were to ship the scrap through channels established by the War Production Board to plants where its weight, however depleted in the process of melting, would compensate in some measure for the shortage at the steel mills. Heavy iron sold for fifty cents per hundred pounds, less heavy iron for forty cents, light iron, fifteen cents and upwards, making an average of about thirty-five cents per hundred pounds. Copper and brass sold for from three to five cents per pound. One dealer shipped 186 tons of scrap metals collected through the efforts of the United States Department of Agriculture War Board in Albemarle County and the County Board of Agriculture between January and May, 1942. Their work was independent of that carried out by the county Salvage Committee, which reported having sent to two of the local dealers 646 tons of iron and twelve and a half tons of brass and copper. The city and county collections for June totaled 168 tons.14 In preparation for the local July drive the local Salvage Committees designated four conveniently located places for the reception of scrap, called to public attention by spot announcements over radio station WCHV: the Texaco Service Station at 14th and Main Streets, Whiting Oil Station, East End Parking Lot, and the Gulf Service Station at Farmington Crossing. City refuse trucks offered “curb service,” making their rounds once a week during the month's drive to pick up piles of scrap deposited on the curb in front of people's houses. Over 144 tons of scrap iron and steel were collected in July.15 Old tracks of the Southern Railway Company were torn up at Preston Turning, and the metal was shipped for salvage late in the summer. Henry H. Hill, owner of the Hill Wrecking Company of Charlottesville, received an automobile “graveyard” banner from the War Production Board, the first such award in Virginia. Between June 25 and September 15, 1942, he directed over 600 tons of scrap to the mills for war production. He further accomplished a complete turnover of scrap every sixty days. Total collection for the city during the month of August was 292.5 tons, whereas the county had salvaged 1,800 tons in all from January to September 24, 1942.16 Early in September Donald Nelson called on all newspaper publishers to attend a meeting in Washington at which Army and Navy officials were present. The publishers were informed that a supply of scrap adequate for only two weeks was available, and that unless the collection was greatly increased it would mean that many mills and furnaces would be forced to shut down, thereby seriously reducing the amount of ammunition and equipment needed for the armed forces. The publishers were asked to call the attention of the nation to this alarming state of affairs. Soon after the meeting the Virginia Newspapers' Scrap Campaign, sponsored by the Virginia Press Association, was launched as part of a national drive from September 21 through October 10. Governor Darden extended Junk Rally Week, originally the first week in September, to a three-week period, Junk Rally Weeks, to correspond with this period.17 The Daily Progress opened the drive for Charlottesville with a full-page advertisement titled “Virginia's Scrap Can Lick the Jap.” War bond prizes amounting to $4,000 were offered for the best contributions made by the county, city, agricultural organizations, women's, men's, and children's groups, churches, school organizations, business firms, and individuals in collecting scrap or giving information as to where hidden quantities of metal could be procured. More depots for collection were assigned, including the fire station and Haynes Settle's service station in the Fry's Spring area.18 City activities included the distribution of lists of the names and locations of scrap depots along with gas and water bills, and again the services of the city trucks were enlisted. Old gas fixtures were taken from houses which antedated electric wiring. Some 300 tons of street car rails buried under the asphalt pavement of West Main Street from the University to the Union Station were removed by the Works Progress Administration. The difficult job of disinterment proved to be too expensive in relation to the sale price of the recovered metal at junk yards, so it was discontinued at a point less than half of the distance to the announced goal at the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Station. Another activity was a two-day contest between residents of the two sides of Main Street; the four tons gathered by the South side bested the three tons gathered by the North side. Civic clubs, too, joined in the drive, outstanding among them being the Kiwanians, who contributed forty tons of scrap collected on their lot back of the Whiting Service Station at Fifth and West Main Streets. The proceeds went to the club's crippled children's fund. The Paramount Theatre received five tons of scrap from the special production of “Ride 'em Cowboy” when the price of admission was three pounds of metal. A week's campaign at the University, directed by Frank E. Hartman, Superintendent of Grounds, and joined in by the students netted about ten tons of scrap and 500 pounds of brass. This was piled in a roped-off area in front of the new Naval R. O. T. C. building, Maury Hall.19 Each school in the city took part in the scrap drive. The Lane High School Student Council, whose goal was one hundred tons, was assisted by the Lions Club, which succeeded in obtaining the loan of twenty-five delivery trucks from business firms to haul scrap. This group collected 158 tons and won a $100 war bond in the State Newspaper Contest. The new Jefferson High School brought in twenty tons. Junior Commando scrap collectors of Clark School gathered seven tons, reaching a higher average per capita than that later attained by the city. Venable School gathered three tons. The McGuffey School had a one-day drive to which every child responded; and the “G. B.” Club made up of boys and girls from six to twelve years old, mostly from McGuffey School, raised $9.53 from its sales toward the purchase of a bond.20 By September 30 the firemen had a motley assortment of museum pieces totaling over twelve tons. There were old iron kettles, such as swung from cranes over the open hearth; a French, a German, and an American helmet from World War I; a pre-Civil War tobacco press; an old Plymouth; a discarded Nash; an antique tricycle; the complete equipment of a former Charlottesville business donated by Mrs. A. R. Michtom; and a 600-pound chunk of iron rescued from a creek bed. From the Old Ladies' Home came the entire iron fence which had encircled their property. An unbattered Confederate cannon was the gift of Miss Mary Perley. Though never used in the Civil War, it had been fired on the University Lawn when South Carolina seceded from the Union, April 17, 1861, by its owner, C. C. Wertenbaker, and again later to commemorate Virginia's secession. The American Legion also contributed a cannon, but the Confederate cannon on the lawn of the Court House, eyed by enthusiastic salvagers, did not join the scrap pile. A sign set up by the firemen read: “The Japs Got All They Could Pay For—Now Let's Give Them the Rest.”21 The fascination of the scrap pile led to at least two instances of theft. Three helmets, American, French, and German, were stolen one night from the firemen's collection, and a piece of brass worth $5.00 was taken from the Henry Hill Junk Yard.22 In the county a Scrap Harvest Drive led by Larned Randolph was being conducted at the same time. Fourteen representatives from sections of the county had organized after September 25 and obtained the use of state highway trucks furnished by R. C. Ambler, county resident engineer, for the transportation of scrap to the dealers in Charlottesville. Ed Bain and Linden Shroyer, aided by four teams from the Crozet Fire Department, made a house-to-house canvass, and the proceeds were divided between the final payment for a new aircraft observation post and a gift to the U. S. O. Stephen Kelsey directed the drive for Ivy, Grover Van Devender for Owensville, and John Faris for Red Hill, where school boys helped locate and haul scrap in their local drive.23 The potentialities of industrial salvage were evident when John S. Graves of the Alberene Stone Corporation at Schuyler reported that nine carloads of scrap, aggregating about 450 tons and representing a fifty-year accumulation of worn-out machinery, cars, rails, and other articles of iron, were sent to the nation's scrap heap. Frank Ix and Sons, Inc., gave twenty-four and one half tons and the Southern Welding and Machine Company three and one half tons.24 The 500-ton goal for city and county collections was not only reached but exceeded at the end of the three-week drive. C. D. Searson, county drive statistician, announced on October 17 that the collections since August had been about 801.5 tons. Charlottesville alone had collected 443 tons, representing an average of 45.7 pounds per capita. With a population of 380 people Scottsville had raised over fifty tons, equivalent to a per capita average of 266.6 pounds. This figure compared very favorably with the goal of 100 pounds per capita which had been set for every locality in the state. Moreover, it rivalled the 286.3 pounds per capita recorded in Lynchburg, which led all Virginia communities. The Reverend Oscar E. Northen and E. B. Meredith, together with Homer Thacker, were leaders responsible for Scottsville's remarkable record. The Keswick and Proffit areas were among sections of the community in which heavy rains prevented the completion of the drive within the allotted period. First place for individual entrants was won by F. F. Critzer of Ivy, whose total was 11,146 pounds; S. J. Robinson, Jr., of Charlottesville was second with 7,226 pounds.25 These local results constituted a helpful minority of the nation's total collections of more than 6,000,000 tons of scrap metals which were brought into war production as a result of the three-week campaign led by American newspapers. At the close of 1942, owing to the heavy toll of ships sunk and material abandoned on battlefields in the course of the Pacific campaigns and the North African invasion, the scrap situation remained critical. Industries were asked to pledge themselves to continue the salvage of metal until the war's end. A local Industrial Salvage Committee began functioning in November, 1942. It worked with manufacturers, garages, and other business firms in which larger amounts of scrap metal were usually found. One of the specific duties of this group, of which Frank Ix, Jr., was chairman, was to follow up on the disposal of recurrent scrap and to forward monthly reports on sales of scrap to the War Production Board. At the end of the second quarter after its organization the committee reported 300,000 pounds more scrap than during its first quarter. By April, 1944, it had reported well over a million pounds of various kinds of scrap. “We have found industries in Charlottesville most cooperative, and we are confident that they will continue in their splendid work,” wrote Alex F. Ryland of Richmond, district industrial salvage representative. Over a period of six months the Southern Welding and Machine Company salvaged 721,000 pounds of iron and steel and 64,000 pounds of brass.26 During the first six months of 1943 the national quota was 13,000,000 tons, over fifty per cent of this amount to be supplied by industries and farms. All Charlottesville industries participated throughout 1943. The quota for Virginia's farm scrap was 87,000 tons, to be collected not later than June 30. The Home Demonstration Clubs in Albemarle County collected 39,448 pounds of iron and steel during the first half of the year. The Home Demonstration and 4-H Clubs jointly collected 36,764 pounds of scrap in 1944 and 20,314 pounds in 1945.27 Tin Cans At the beginning of the war it was deemed impracticable to reclaim tin from ordinary tin cans. Not until October, 1942, were housekeepers instructed to prepare tin cans for salvage by placing the cutout ends between the flattened sides. The one per cent coating of tin could be separated at certain mills by a detinning process from the ninety-nine per cent steel of the commercial tin can, and both metals could be salvaged. Even relatively small amounts of tin could be of use when the chief source of the United States supply was cut off by the Japanese seizure of the Malayan Peninsula and the Dutch East Indies. Tin was essential to many types of goods produced in wartime. Most of the food for the armed forces was shipped in tin cans because of the durability of this non-corrosive metal, which can be made to withstand moisture, excessive heat, and severe cold and to be impenetrable to poison gas. It was used in the manufacture of cannon mounts, airplane motors, electrical machinery, and communications equipment. Not only was tin a fighting metal, but it also made the best container for many kinds of medical supplies, such as blood plasma and sulfa-ointments. At the beginning of the tin salvage campaign in Charlottesville the soft drink bottlers collected the used cans. Part of the metal they thus obtained was allocated to them for the manufacture of the caps on their bottles. The local bottlers of Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, and the Nehi products gathered up cans which were forwarded by the firm of Dettor, Edwards, and Morris to detinning concerns. In December arrangements were made for city trucks to collect the cans on their regular routes, together with other salvaged materials, and to carry them to the City Yards. When properly prepared tin cans were sent to a detinning plant, the city received $15.50 per long ton for them. During the first year of tin can salvage the city trucks collected 94,400 pounds, an average of almost 8,000 pounds per month.28 This average rose during the first part of 1944, although it was estimated that in January only half the housewives in Charlottesville consistently saved their tin cans. In April three months' collections aggregating 36,000 pounds, an amount which averaged 12,000 pounds per month, were shipped away. Charlottesville collected 6,000 pounds during that month, and the county salvaged 940 pounds in May and 400 pounds in June. The city and county together turned in 70,200 pounds for July, August, and September. To these accumulations were added 34,200 pounds shipped to the Vulcan Detinning Company, Sewaren, New Jersey, in December.29 No figures covering the quantity of tin cans salvaged in 1945 are available. As late as August 20 collections continued despite the fact that the struggle was drawing to a close. Large shipments of supplies were still being made overseas, and the stockpiles for civilian use could not be reduced.30 Rubber The salvage of rubber started in 1941 along with paper, scrap metals, rags, and aluminum. From January through May, 1942, twenty-two and one half tons were collected by two dealers in Charlottesville and Albemarle. With the loss of the Dutch East Indies, ninety per cent of the nation's crude rubber supply was cut off, and President Roosevelt proposed a nationwide campaign for the salvage of rubber during the last two weeks of June, 1942. The oil industries were called upon by the War Production Board to lend their personnel, offer their service stations as collection depots, and buy all types of reclaimable rubber at a uniform price. People were urged, however, to conserve usable goods such as galoshes and overshoes in order to prevent a rush demand for them when their production became impossible.31 In Charlottesville Mrs. Lyttelton Waddell launched the drive on June 18, and Scouts and school children, all called Commandos for this particular occasion, worked and “raided” until July 10. The local Salvage Committee unofficially predicted a pile of over 400,000 pounds. On July 3 the committee telegraphed Richmond: “Gasoline distributors here want to know what to do with rubber. Haven't enough storage space. Quota exceeded.” More than half a million pounds had been turned in to the oil companies, which served as collecting stations. The local organization having the highest record was the Charlottesville Oil Corporation, which received more than 160,000 pounds. Between August 1 and October 15 a total of 250.5 tons of rubber was collected from the city and county, according to a report from C. D. Searson.32 As the national stockpile of reclaimed natural rubber was well supplied from the 1942 drives and the manufacture of synthetic rubber made headway, systematic salvage of natural rubber products was suspended in June, 1943, until further notice. For this reason the collection of little more than one ton of scrap rubber was reported by the city at the end of 1943.33 Kitchen Fats In addition to other items, the householder was asked to save kitchen fats. Loss of the Philippines, the main source of vegetable fats for the United States before the war, had caused a shortage of this essential component of munitions. It was announced that two pounds of cooking grease would provide enough glycerine to make five pounds of antiaircraft ammunition. The national program for salvaging fats started about July 6, 1942, and quotas were set for all states and communities. Virginia's quota was set at 181,500 pounds per month. In August the Charlottesville Salvage Committee set 68,000 pounds as a goal for the year, based on an estimate of 17,000 people contributing about four pounds of grease per capita, the amount requested by national salvage authorities.34 Cooks were urged to collect waste fats in pound lots and to sell them at three cents per pound to meat dealers. The butchers would then turn them over to processors for the government's use. All but one of the Charlottesville meat merchants agreed to buy fats. Promotional work in connection with the salvaging of kitchen fats in Charlottesville was a responsibility of I. H. Poss of the local branch of Swift and Company, who distributed posters and information to meat dealers.35 The first month's collection of fats netted only 835 pounds, the month of August 863 pounds, and September the meager amount of 700 pounds, when a community the size of Charlottesville should have raised almost 6,000 pounds a month according to its quota. Women of the church auxiliaries joined in the effort to convince the public of the need of cooperating in this phase of the salvage program; Home Demonstration Club members worked similarly in the rural districts. Mrs. Fred L. Watson, fats collection chairman in Charlottesville, urged that housewives adopt Walt Disney's slogan: “Out of the Frying Pan Into the Firing Line.”36 By January, 1943, the collection of fats hit a new high of 1,350 pounds in Charlottesville, an increase of 250 pounds over the December total. During the entire year of 1943 Home Demonstration Clubs in the county collected 411 pounds. In December a special impetus to save fats was given under the new Points-For-Fats Program. In addition to the four cents per pound then being paid, housewives were given two red food ration points for every pound of kitchen fats they delivered to their butchers.37 Mrs. W. E. Hughes of Charlottesville became fats collection chairman in February, 1944. In that month 1,200 pounds of fats were collected. A drive in March sent Girl Scouts, Camp Fire Girls, and members of the Parent-Teacher Association on a house-to-house canvass asking for whatever amount of waste fats was then available in each kitchen. As Virginia lagged far behind in meeting its quota, this method was continued every month. April brought in 1,500 pounds of fat for Charlottesville. Home Demonstration and 4-H Club members collected 4,240 pounds of fat in the rural districts in 1944 and 11,841 pounds in 1945, when salvaging of fats continued along with paper and tin even after V-J Day.38 Other Materials Salvaged During the years 1942 and 1943 rags for cleaning Army and Navy weapons were collected by the city of Charlottesville to the amount of 1,273 pounds, along with other salvaged materials.39 The National Collection of Discarded Clothing, sponsored by the Salvage Division of the War Production Board under the National Used Clothing Program began on November 22, 1943, when the desirability of providing garments for the destitute people of the liberated countries had become obvious. The Defense Supplies Corporation arranged for dry cleaning and shipment overseas. All dry cleaners in Albemarle County and forty-four other counties in western Virginia sent their collections to the Inland Service Corporation warehouse in Charlottesville. The city sent 1,464 pounds by December 18, 1943, and the county 2,090.5 pounds. Another United National Clothing Collection was launched by the same agency in April, 1945. By the end of the month 30,000 pounds of clothing had been donated. Members of civic clubs gave freely of their time in collecting and packing the clothes, and merchants lent their trucks for use in a house-to-house collection. Six deposit stations received them also. Before the drive was brought to a close on May 15 about 34,400 pounds of clothing had been given by the city and county. “The collection brought in excellent clothes that will still be useful,” said Charles Youell, chairman for the drive. “There weren't a dozen garments that could be considered unusable.” Persons having additional used clothing to give away were asked to contact any one of the several charitable organizations in the city.40 Other articles were salvaged on a less intensive scale. Boy Scouts of Charlottesville contributed four truckloads to the 2,643 pounds of aluminum salvaged here during 1942 and 1943. Discarded license plates weighing a total of 1,480 pounds were collected during the same period. In order that small quantities of shellac could be reclaimed, old phonograph records were gathered by 4-H Club members to raise money for the purchase of an ambulance to serve in Red Cross overseas duty; the Paramount Theatre charged records for admission to a movie; the Meriwether Lewis School organized a “flying squadron” for this activity, and the 4-H Club of that locality contributed more than half of the total quantity of records collected. Old silk stockings were forwarded by the J. D. and J. S. Tilman department store to be used in making powder bags and for other similar defense purposes; the Girl Scouts helped raise the 125 pounds for the first shipment in February, 1943. In the fall of 1944, 4-H Club members in the county gathered forty-five bags of milk weed pods, a quantity, according to Henry Brumback, assistant county agent, sufficient to make twenty-two life preservers. Fur for lining certain types of military uniforms was collected by the Shadwell Chapter of the D. A. R.41 The salvage of thousands of tons of materials useful to the war effort by this community during the war was not the only result of the campaigns described. Proceeds from the sale of waste paper and other scrap by the city of Charlottesville went to aid the U. S. O. in its program of providing recreation for men in the armed forces. The amount of $1,898 had been raised by the end of 1943.42 Other organizations which joined in the salvage drives used the money raised for special projects of their own. The people of Charlottesville and Albemarle County attained creditable records in the salvage of waste paper, scrap iron and other metals, rubber, and clothing. It is difficult to conceive that larger results could reasonably be expected from efforts dependent upon the volunteer, part-time services of busy individuals and upon the cooperation of various organizations. Admittedly less successful were the local efforts in collecting fats and tin cans. At least a partial explanation of the fact that the community fell somewhat below the national average in respect to these two items may lie in the tendency of Southern cooks to use more fats for the seasoning of food and the making of gravies than their Northern and Western counterparts and to take from their pantry shelves foods locally preserved in glass rather than commercially processed in tin. Moreover, salvage of these articles required the daily cooperation of individuals who were sometimes unwilling to save what seemed like inconsequential bits. On the other hand, waste paper, scrap iron, rubber, and clothing lent themselves more readily to organized drives in which team spirit and rivalry brought better results. V Living With Less Under O. P. A. When a nation devotes all its resources to winning a war, its economic life is of necessity thrown out of balance. Certain goods once plentiful become scarce. This may be due to increased consumption, decreased production, or inadequate distribution, but the result is the same: the demand exceeds the available supply. When this condition exists, it is necessary to institute some form of control over the disposition of the available supply of scarce goods so that it is equitably divided and used to the best advantage of the community as a whole. In the United States during World War II the rationing of scarce commodities was handled generally by the Office of Price Administration, usually referred to as O. P. A. Its regulations were applied and enforced in Albemarle County and Charlottesville by boards of local citizens. While some hardships inevitably resulted, most scarcities involved little more than inconvenience. Gasoline, Fuel Oil, and Tires Indeed, the first touch of war passed over Charlottesville and Albemarle County so lightly that it was scarcely felt. In the summer of 1941 the loan of a number of tankers to Britain threatened to create a shortage of gasoline on the East Coast. Petroleum Coordinator Harold Ickes in August restricted deliveries to all service stations in the area and limited their operation to a seventy-two-hour week. The only inconvenience resulting, however, was the occasional stranding of a late traveler, and when the return of the tankers made possible the removal of all restrictions on October 24, the shortage was put down as a mere Washington panic.1 Hardly had the laughter at Ickes' scarcity died down before the war was brought home to the motorist with a vengeance. In the middle of the war bulletins which came crackling out of his radio on that Sunday afternoon of December 7, 1941, was the announcement that the sale of all automobile and truck tires had been suspended. The car owner at once realized that he would have to revise his casual peacetime driving habits to make his tires last out the war. By December 21 local grocers had decided to limit deliveries to save rubber, and Randolph H. Perry, secretary of the Charlottesville and Albemarle Chamber of Commerce, urged the public to cooperate in supporting this first conservation measure.2 Soon a program was under way to control the sale of tires. On January 5, 1942, tire ration boards were named for the county and the city. In time these same boards undertook the rationing of other scarce commodities and set up a number of panels to handle their various activities. Originally the Albemarle County War Price and Rationing Board consisted of Edgar L. Bradley of Scottsville, who became chairman, H. A. Haden, James Gordon Smith, Sr., and R. F. Loving. Later, after Smith had resigned, Henry Chiles and Mrs. Randolph Catlin were added. Mrs. Catlin, who worked as a full-time volunteer supervisor in the board office from June, 1942, until it closed, donated in the neighborhood of 6,000 hours of work. In 1945 the county board panels included a mileage panel, fuel oil panel, food panel, automotive price panel, and community service panel. Originally the Charlottesville War Price and Rationing Board consisted of Seth Burnley, who became chairman, W. Towles Dettor, and J. Dean Tilman. Burnley resigned from the board on October 15, 1943. Dettor succeeded him as chairman, and Mason S. Byrd became a member of the board. Tilman also left the board by resignation, and Dr. Thomas H. Daniel and Gus K. Tebell were added as members. In 1945 the city board panels included a tire panel, gasoline panel, food panel, price panel, and fuel oil and stove panel.3 By January 14, 1942, the boards were ready to begin the task of allotting thirty-five passenger and seventy-six truck tires, which constituted their January quota, to certain essential motorists, such as doctors, nurses, and policemen. The first certificates authorizing the purchase of new tires in Charlottesville and Albemarle County were issued to Dr. H. S. Hedges of Charlottesville, allowing him to obtain four obsolete 32 × 4 tires and tubes, and to Silas Barnes, Crozet trucker.4 In February ration boards had to take over the granting of recapping privileges, in order to regulate the rush of motorists to get new rubber put on tread-bare tires. The distribution of new cars to essential users also became a duty of the local boards. All of this, however, was only an introduction to what car owners were to face. On April 9, 1942, the War Production Board ordered gasoline deliveries to service stations on the East Coast cut to two-thirds of the average during the preceding winter months of December, January, and February.5 This measure was made necessary by the transfer of tankers to military duties, which left a gap in civilian supplies too large to be filled by the railroad tank cars which were pressed into service to haul gasoline to the East. Voluntary conservation was already saving gas as well as tires, but not as much as was required by the new order. The Office of Price Administration, therefore, prepared an emergency program for rationing gasoline in the affected areas. On May 12, 13, and 14, city and county school teachers gave up their afternoons to help motorists register and apply for gasoline. The blanks were filled out under the honor system, with each owner asking for as much gas as he thought he needed. His basic allotment was an “A” card, which contained seven squares to be punched, each one good for three gallons of gas. For those who needed more than three gallons a week for essential purposes, there were three grades of “B” cards, permitting the purchase of up to nine gallons a week. Finally, certain essential workers, such as doctors, ministers, and government officials, were given “X” cards authorizing unlimited purchases. No restrictions were placed on commercial vehicles. Of the 3,639 car owners registered in Charlottesville, 328 were granted “X” cards, although some of these were returned when their recipients discovered that they were not entitled to them. More than half the applicants, 2,191, had to be content with “A” cards.6 This system worked fairly well for a time, although service station attendants soon began to grow careless about punching the cards. A new plan was put into effect in July, when the cards were replaced by a book of ration stamps. All motorists again registered at the schools on July 9, 10, and 11 for “A” books, which contained six pages of eight stamps each, each page to be good for two months. Those who needed more than this basic allotment of sixteen gallons per month were required to apply to their ration boards for “B” or “C” books.7 These new books went into use on July 22. Along with these restrictions went other conservation measures designed to make gasoline and tires go farther. The Commonwealth of Virginia lowered the speed limit to forty and later to thirty-five miles per hour, and car pools of share-the-ride wage earners were organized to fill empty seats in commuters' and workers' autos. Exchange of tires among friends grew so common that Chief of Police Maurice F. Greaver found it necessary to remind the Charlottesville public of a city ordinance which required that any person acquiring a tire from any person or agency not regularly authorized to sell it must report on the transfer of ownership to the Police Department within ten days.8 This problem was practically solved in the fall of 1942 by the Idle Tire Purchase Plan, under which every motorist was required to sell to the Federal government all tires he owned in excess of five per car.9 All surplus tires in the community were collected at local offices of the Railway Express Agency, which shipped them into a center where they were resold or scrapped. As part of this program, the car owner was required to register the serial numbers of all the tires he retained and to have them inspected regularly. This plan was put into effect all over the country on December 1 as part of the nationwide rubber conservation program.10 Closely allied to gas rationing was the rationing of fuel oil and kerosene which began October 19, 1942, and continued throughout the war. Because proper blank forms were lacking in Charlottesville and Albemarle County, the registration of fuel oil and kerosene consumers and dealers was postponed until November 5. Even then coupons for kerosene were lacking, and dealers took care of their old customers on a credit basis until the coupons were issued. With fuel oil supplies on the Eastern seaboard inadequate to meet the needs of users, all rations for heating were below the amount needed to maintain room temperatures at the accustomed levels. Instead of keeping his entire home at seventy or above twenty-four hours a day, the fuel oil user began to shut off the heat everywhere at night and in many rooms during the day. His family accustomed themselves to lower temperatures in the rooms that were used. Often this entailed some real discomfort. Fireplaces and other supplemental heating units became the centers around which family life revolved. People accepted the hardships but reserved the right to complain, especially to their ration boards. The system of allotment was often a bone of contention as inequalities were pointed out. Yet most agreed at the end of the first winter that it was to be doubted if any entirely equitable formula could be found and that, even if it could, it would not make insufficient supplies of fuel oil furnish adequate heat. Conversion to coal seemed to furnish the most satisfactory solution to the problem for those who could so convert their furnaces.11 Meanwhile, the Charlottesville motorist had had his “A” allowance cut from sixteen to twelve gallons per month on November 22, along with autoists throughout the rest of the Eastern Seaboard, while the luckier drivers west of the Alleghanies were permitted sixteen gallons. Another shock came on Friday, December 18, when the sale of all gasoline except for emergency purposes was suspended at noon. Advance news of this regulation caused long lines of cars to form at every Charlottesville filling station that morning.12 The sudden move had been made necessary by a large number of counterfeit stamps in circulation, which had permitted dealers to purchase gas in excess of their quotas. Again the situation was met by restricting the deliveries to dealers, regardless of the number of stamps they turned in. The inflation created by the black market stamps was reduced by lowering the value of “B” and “C” coupons from four to three gallons each. By Monday, December 21. The Daily Progress commented, “This morning the gasoline situation returned to normal, or rather to the state of abnormality which has existed for many months.”13 Even this twenty-five per cent deflation was insufficient, however, to make up for the amount of gasoline which was being siphoned off into the black market. In desperation the O. P. A. adopted an emergency measure to prevent the wasting of gasoline on non-essential purposes. On January 7, 1943, a ban was placed on all forms of pleasure driving.14 “If it's fun, it's out,” was the simple rule announced. Compliance was general at first. At the end of a week Police Chief Greaver reported that his men had discovered only three violators after checking every pleasure spot in the city.15 On Saturday night, January 16, eleven cars were found parked near Memorial Gymnasium during a boxing match between the University of Virginia and V. P. I., but investigation disclosed that all but one of the drivers had stopped off on their way home from work, a procedure allowed under O. P. A. regulations.16 The traditional hockey games at Ivy managed to survive when the players learned to take in the contest en route to pick up their laundry from washwomen in the neighborhood. Although local boards continued to find few violators, car owners gradually grew restive under these unwanted restraints, and compliance broke down. On March 17, 1943, therefore, the new O. P. A. Administrator, Prentiss Brown, announced that enforcement of the irksome pleasure driving ban would be abandoned, although he urged everyone to continue to obey the spirit of the regulation. As if to emphasize the need for conservation, the “A” allotment was reduced to one and a half gallons per week.17 Virginians' hopes for more adequate gasoline rations perked up when it was announced on April 9 that the new 180-mile pipe line to Richmond was ready to bring in 30,000 barrels of petroleum products a day.18 On May 20, however, they were startled to learn that, instead of getting more gas, they were to have the pleasure driving ban reinstated.19 A force of O.P.A. agents along with state and local police, promptly took to the highways to question motorists. Another step to meet the situation was taken on June 2, when the values of “B” and “C” stamps were reduced from three to two and one-half gallons, and the system of allotting gasoline to commercial vehicles was revised to stop leaks into the black market. Many Virginians felt that it was unfair to include the state in the northeastern area of the severest gasoline shortage while neighboring North Carolina went relatively unrestricted, especially in view of the opening of the new pipe line to Richmond. Virginia Congressmen Dave E. Satterfield, Jr., and S. Otis Bland conferred with Director of War Mobilization James F. Byrnes in July over the situation, along with representatives of other East Coast states. Satterfield stressed the paradoxical fact that Virginia, at the terminus of a pipe line, had received several million more gallons of gasoline in the first five months of the year than in the same period of the preceding year but nevertheless had been allotted less gasoline than ever before. The Congressman asked in vain that Virginia be placed on the same basis as other Southern states and that motorists be allowed to use their rations as they saw fit.20 Although no change was made in Virginia's status, the East in general was tossed a crumb a few days later with the announcement that each motorist would be permitted one vacation trip if he could obtain his ration board's permission. This concession was made possible in part by the completion of the “Big Inch” pipe line from Texas to the East Coast on July 19. Petroleum Administrator Ickes promised that gasoline rationing would now be equalized throughout the country. Any joy Eastern car owners may have felt at this news was tempered by the simultaneous announcement of a ban on the sale of new tires as spares, a symptom of the tightening rubber shortage.21 The promised equalization was slow in coming, however, as shipments failed to keep up with even the rationed demand. The official abandonment of all attempts to enforce the pleasure driving ban on August 31 did not mean that supplies were better: the ban was revoked only because the enforcement policy had failed to accomplish the hoped-for results.22 In October equalization was begun, but it was accomplished partly by reducing all motorists between the Alleghanies and the Rockies to the East's starvation levels. All “B” and “C” coupons in the area were lowered to two gallons, while the “A” allotment in the East was raised from one and a half to two gallons per week immediately, with the promise that it would be raised to three gallons on November 8, when complete equality with the Midwest would be achieved.23 Slight as this improvment was, it marked the turning point of the gasoline shortage. Never again did the situation get as bad as it had been in 1943. An important factor in increasing legitimate supplies was the O. P. A.'s merciless war on the black market. In June, 1944, ration boards began issuing serially-marked gasoline coupons, which were nearly counterfeit-proof. Every dealer who turned in counterfeit stamps had them charged against his supply, with the result that the gas bootleggers were soon put out of business. In order to continue their evil operations, crooks resorted to theft of legal gasoline coupons. Certain oil companies were victims, and on the night of September 15 the office of the Charlottesville ration board on Fifth Street was broken into and several “A” gasoline ration books were stolen.24 The only liberalization permitted during 1944 came on July 25 with the granting of furlough gas to servicemen at the rate of a gallon a day up to thirty gallons. By February, 1945, the Charlottesville ration board had issued approximately 3,829 “A” books to automobile owners, and had given 389,489 gallons of supplementary gasoline for use in passenger automobiles and 1,663,742 gallons for use in trucks. The arrival of V-E Day was followed by the raising of “A” allotments to six gallons a week on June 11, 1945, and the Japanese offer to surrender brought immediate abolition to all gas rationing restrictions. On the morning of August 15, for the first time in more than three years, Charlottesville and Albemarle County motorists were able to drive into local service stations with the request, “Fill 'er up.” Tire rationing ended on January 1, 1946, although tires were still scarce. By the summer of 1947, however, supplies had become so abundant that dealers were once more offering tires at cut prices, and getting a new car was the only problem left to the local motorist. Foods, Shoes, and Cigarettes While the local motorist was nursing his car through the difficulties of war, the local housewife was having troubles of her own. As early as September, 1939, she found sugar temporarily scarce, when her neighbors with memories of 1918 started carrying hundred-pound bags away from grocery stores. Flour also was gathered up by the hoarders, and both of these commodities temporarily jumped in price.25 In a few days everything was back to normal, and the brief panic was almost forgotten. By 1941, however, the economic pressures of the defense program were slowly forcing the cost of living upward. In September the index of consumer prices stood at 8.1 per cent above the 1935–1939 level.26 More real than percentages to the housewife were the calculations she had to make to stay within the family budget for food. In the two years since the Nazi planes had first roared over Warsaw, butter and eggs on the local market had jumped ten cents a pound, and meat had crept up a few cents. Baking was more expensive, because shortening, flour, and sugar were all higher. Even the week-end specials in September, 1941, seemed costly: ham, 28 cents a pound; chuck roast, 21 cents; frying chickens, dressed, 28 cents; sirloin steak, 40 cents. Butter was advertised at 40 cents a pound, eggs were offered at 41 cents a dozen, and a tall can of evaporated milk was available at 8 cents.27 As her pencil planned the purchases which could be squeezed out of the market money, the housewife would have been startled to learn that she would soon be sighing wistfully for the return of 1941's low prices and ample quantities, which seemed to vanish in the smoke of Pearl Harbor. By the spring of 1942 she discovered that Hitler's U-boats were keeping bananas out of Charlottesville. More serious was the Nazi subs' interference with shipments of sugar, which brought back the buying panic of 1939. Storekeepers restrained the would-be hoarders by selling sugar only in small amounts until the O. P. A. could get its rationing program in operation. Sugar rationing finally arrived in the first week of May, 1942. School teachers and other volunteer assistants gave up their afternoons and evenings from May 4 to May 7 to register the entire population. In Charlottesville registration cards were signed for 22,060 persons, including an unexpectedly large number of University students. To all but the 970 who admitted having more than six pounds of sugar a flimsy little folder called War Ration Book No. 1 was issued.28 Along the bottom edge were two rows of coupons to be used in buying sugar and any other commodities which might be rationed. The basic allotment for each person was half a pound of sugar a week. In most cases this quantity, which varied only slightly throughout the war, proved to be sufficient. The chief effect of the sugar restriction was to reduce the number of cakes and pies baked weekly in Charlottesville and Albemarle County ovens, a result which, local Pollyannas readily confessed, proved beneficial to waistlines. Because bootleggers were unable to get sugar to make liquor and because many of the hot-blooded youngsters were in military service, the Albemarle County jail was empty on May 24, 1942, for the first time in the memory of Sheriff J. Mason Smith, who had served the county as law enforcement officer for forty years. Normally the jail housed twenty or thirty prisoners.29 Having taken its toll of banana and sugar shipments, German submarine warfare soon added another food casualty. By September, 1942, coffee was being doled out carefully at local stores. To spread the supply evenly, the O. P. A. announced that coffee would be placed on the ration list beginning November 28.30 Coupons in War Ration Book No. 1 were made valid for the purchase of coffee at the rate of one pound every five weeks. Statisticians calculated that this would give each person one cup a day, a miserly ration in the opinion of all coffee lovers. Long-despised coffee substitutes promptly disappeared from grocery shelves. About the same time another type of beverage went under sales control when the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board restricted liquor purchases to a quart a day as a preliminary to formal rationing, which went into effect in January, 1943. With the manufacture of beverage alcohol suspended for the duration of the war, meager stocks were called upon to supply an increased demand. In June The Daily Progress reported in an editorial that for three days “the thirsty citizen of Charlottesville with spendable coupons supposedly good for one pint might as well have been on a desert island as far as his ability to buy legal whiskey was concerned. There just wasn't any in pints—or in quarts either, for that matter—and only a very limited selection in 26-ounce bottles, which are definitely a gyp size under our rationing set-up.” By November the editor conceded, “If Virginians get very little liquor, at least what they do get is of known quality and is made available to them at a fair price, whereas if we may believe the reports carried in the public press of other parts honest whiskey has all but disappeared from the markets in many American cities and prices, despite supposed O. P. A. ceilings, have soared to fantastic heights.”31 These shortages of 1942, however, were only a preliminary warning of what was to come. The local housewife had already been reminded of the impending shortage of canned goods every time she flattened a tin can for salvage drives. At the same time the national appetite was growing faster than expanding agricultural production. Young men in uniform required far more food than they had consumed while wearing civilian clothes, and more people than ever were able to afford beefsteaks and butter instead of hamburgers and oleomargarine. During 1942 the nation had been living off its accumulated fat of prewar years, but by 1943 it was necessary to take up a notch in the belt. Two new and comprehensive programs were announced in December, 1942. One covered processed foods, including practically all canned, dried, and frozen fruits, vegetables, soups, and juices. The other included all meats, except poultry and fresh fish, and all fats but olive oil. The news of these programs was accepted in good spirit, The Daily Progress reported. One merchant, who asked customers not to buy more than half a dozen cans at a time, pointed out, “When we explain things to them, most of them don't buy that much. This rationing is going to be hard on delivery stores and will cause more work for us as well as for the housewife, but it is the only fair way to divide what food we have.”32 Once again more than 42,000 city and county residents registered in the school rooms from February 22 to 26, 1943, for War Ration Book No. 2. In order to get this book each family had to fill in a declaration stating how many pounds of coffee and cans of food were on hand at the time rationing began, and Books 1 and 2 were then “tailored” accordingly by removing coupons for excess coffee or cans. One Albemarle County family of three declared 2,167 cans, another family of two, 975. Four out of five, however, stated that they had no excess supplies.33 Sometimes neighbors looked on these declarations with suspicion, which was occasionally justified. One woman, who declared only four pounds of coffee and ten cans of food, was found by the O. P. A. to have had forty-eight pounds of coffee and 510 cans of food in her possession.34 During registration an old man came into the ration board's office to ask how he could buy sugar and coffee. “The storekeeper keeps telling me to get a book,” he said, “but there's no sense me getting a book; I can't read.”35 A ration clerk explained that to enjoy the kind of book he needed required no literary attainment. War Ration Book No. 2 introduced a new problem for the local housewife. Designed for the point system, an innovation in rationing, it contained four pages each of red and blue stamps. twenty-four to a page. Horizontal rows were lettered. “A,” “B.” “C,” etc., while the vertical columns were numbered “8,” “5,” “2,” “1,” indicating the point value of each stamp. To enlighten Charlottesville housewives concerning the use of the new ration book a meeting was scheduled at Lane High School. but when the use of the auditorium was denied to the speaker the meeting was cancelled and housewives were left to solve their problems as best they could. In a letter to the editor of The Daily Progress Henry McComb Bush explained why the meeting had not been held. The speaker, although sanctioned by the O. P. A., was an employee of the Southeastern Chain Store Council. Certain local independent merchants refused to cooperate, expressing the fear that the speaker was trying to put something over on them. The use of the auditorium was denied on the technicality that it could not be used by the representative of any commercial organization. After expressing his admiration for the able and impartial way in which the same speaker on another occasion explained in detail the use of War Ration Book No. 2, Bush concluded by remarking, “This is a startling example of lack of cooperation on the part of some of our local merchants. At a time like this, lack of cooperation should not be allowed to interfere with public benefits.”36 Blue stamps, designed for processed foods, came into use on March 1. They were made valid at the rate of three columns, or forty-eight points, a month. With this quota in March, 1943, the housewife could have purchased one can of peaches (twenty-one points), one can of peas (thirteen points), one can of corn (eight points), and one can of soup (six points). In terms of meals, she could have served canned vegetables at about eight meals a month and canned fruit at approximately six. She therefore had to eke out the family diet with fresh fruit and vegetables, of which, fortunately, there was seldom a shortage. On the other hand, when out of season these were usually two or four times as expensive as canned food, and the prompt action of the O. P. A. in freezing prices merely kept them from going higher. A permanent change in eating habits resulted from the fact that points were usually lower on frozen food than on canned, while the frosted products were cheaper than fresh ones in winter. Thus the people of Charlottesville and Albemarle County learned to make frozen foods a part of their daily diet instead of the occasional luxury which these had been in 1939. Throughout February, 1943, the abattoir department of the Elliott Ice Company was closed down for the first time since it opened in 1912. Millard C. Elliott, president of the company, explained that slaughtering had been suspended because though O. P. A. had set up price ceilings on dressed carcasses, there were no price ceilings on livestock. “As a consequence,” he concluded, “we cannot buy livestock at present prices, since we would lose money on every animal slaughtered.” The plant reopened March 1, but to operate at only about one-fourth of its capacity.37 However, procuring meats and fats caused little trouble for the local housewife before they went under rationing on March 29, 1943. There was a brief scare on March 10, when someone reported hearing over the radio that sales of butter would be frozen. The result was a stampede which nearly emptied the Charlottesville stores of butter that day. The flurry died down promptly and had been largely forgotten by the time the sale of butter actually was frozen on March 22, in order to allow stocks to accumulate during the week preceding rationing. Meat likewise remained plentiful, although the choice of cuts was limited. Not until Saturday, March 27, the very last day of unrestricted purchases, when housewives were packing their refrigerators with meat, was any shortage noticed.38 The initial ration allotment required some reduction in the normal quantities of meat eaten, permitting to each person approximatly a quarter-pound of butter and two pounds of meat a week. Although changing point values later lowered this quota, a family's consumption of rationed beef, pork, and lamb could always be supplemented by ration-free poultry and fish. Adjustment to the new point system proved easy. In a few days housewives had learned to count up purchases in points as well as in cents. Butchers soon observed that shoppers were more concerned over the number of red stamps which they would have to surrender for any cut of meat than over the number of greenbacks required. The O. P. A. also learned to change its point-prices like a shrewd merchandiser; a slow-mover like dried prunes quickly dropped from twenty blue points to none, while a fast-seller like butter jumped from eight red points to sixteen in the first few months. In spite of this increase, the demand for butter continued to outrun the supply, as milk output was diverted to other dairy products. For the same reason, canned milk went on the ration list in June, 1943. On the other hand, the first sign of a turn for the better came when coffee went off the list of rationed foods in July. The summer of 1943 also brought a modification in the canning sugar program. During 1942 allotments of sugar to families for canning fruit had been made at the rate of a pound for every four quarts put up in previous years, with no maximum limit to the amount of sugar to which one could thus become entitled. With commercially canned fruit rationed, however, many new families were expected to join the ranks of the canners-at-home in 1943, and the government wished to encourage this movement. Past practices in preserving fruits were therefore ignored, and families were now granted for use in canning up to twenty-five pounds of sugar per person. Two stamps were validated for five pounds of sugar each. Those who needed more applied to the ration board for their allotments, listing the quantities of fruits and jellies they wished to preserve. This greatly simplified the procedure and eliminated many of the complications and delays which had been experienced in 1942. During 1944 the county ration board issued coupons good for 364,116 pounds of canning sugar, and the city board issued coupons for 281,460 pounds. The county board reported approximately 20,000 applications for sugar during the three year period 1942 to 1944, inclusive. One other development of the summer of 1943 was the expiration of the first shoe stamp. Shoes had been put under rationing in a surprise move on February 7, with Stamp No. 18 in the sugar book being made good for one pair until June 15. As that date approached, many housewives discovered unused shoe stamps in the family's books, and to keep them from “going to waste” they dashed into town to buy shoes, overwhelming stores and clerks. One weary manager advertised the next day: “We wish to express sincere appreciation to you, our customers, for your patience during the recent 'Grand Rush' for shoes. ... Our store will be closed Wednesday and Thursday to give our employees a much-needed rest and to check our stock. J. N. Waddell Shoe Co.”39 This was the only local excitement over shoe rationing, although it continued until October 30, 1945. The individual allotment of two to three pairs a year was more than adequate for the men, but it failed to make concession to feminine fashions. As a result, Father often had to surrender one of his stamps to buy Daughter a pair of party slippers. This type of informal reapportionment within the family served to smooth out any serious inconvenience. Apparently more city than country residents had occupations which were hard on their shoes, for the Charlottesville board issued 525 special shoe stamps in the one year 1944, which was in sharp contrast to the Albemarle County board's experience of issuing only 787 special shoe stamps in three years. Meanwhile, the point system was using up ration books rapidly. By the middle of September, 1943, all the red stamps in War Ration Book No. 2 were gone, and similar brown stamps in Book No. 3 had taken their place. This book, distributed by mail during the summer also contained stamps bearing pictures of guns, tanks, planes, and ships. A few of the airplane stamps were validated for shoes, but the rest were never used. In October Book No. 4 was handed out to 40,549 residents of the city and the county.40 This contained pages of green, blue, and red stamps, similar to those in Book No. 2, except that they were only half as wide, besides two pages of stamps marked “Spare,” “Sugar,” and “Coffee.” The “Coffee” coupons, O. P. A. explained, had been prepared while the beverage was still on the ration list.41 Another simplification came when the red and blue ration tokens went into circulation on February 27, 1944.42 These fiber disks provided change, and made mental arithmetic involved in counting point prices much easier. The value of the stamps was changed to ten points each, with each token being worth one point. During the second week of March, 1944, a survey was made of Charlottesville retail food stores to determine the extent to which O. P. A. regulations were being observed. The twenty-three volunteer inspectors, who worked under the Charlottesville War Price and Rationing Board's price panel, of which the Reverend H. A. Donovan was chairman, visited fifty-five stores. In only sixteen did they find full compliance with all regulations; however, there was general agreement among O. P. A. personnel that willful instances of ceiling price violations were decidedly in the minority. The thirty-nine stores violating regulations were about equally divided between those which failed to post ceiling price lists and those which by carelessness or misunderstanding made charges above ceiling prices. Most overcharges were for canned goods. In Albemarle County a like survey showed that most of the 110 stores were complying. Twenty-seven violations of meat and canned vegetable price ceilings were noted, and a number of stores did not have a proper ceiling price list posted.43 During the first three years of rationing about twenty price checks were made in both the city and county stores. There were a few cases in which merchants were fined and patrons collected triple damages because of overcharges, but the great majority of merchants tried to keep both the letter and the spirit of the regulations. The appearance of the ration tokens seems to have marked a general improvement in the food situation. Point values were cut in March and again in April. Canning sugar was available almost for the asking. In September, as Allied armies rolled back the shattered Nazi forces in France, most meat cuts and all canned vegetables, except tomatoes, were removed from rationing. By mid-December, however, when the supposedly beaten Germans suddenly struck back in the Ardennes Forest, the belt had to be retightened. On Christmas morning the housewife, who had experienced great difficulty in finding a turkey for the holiday, learned that most of the food stamps she had been saving had been cancelled.44 A week later, on New Year's Eve, further demands were made on her reduced stock of points by the return of most foods to the ration list. On January 19, 1945, lard, shortening, oils, and citrus fruit juice were put back under rationing. It was, however, an unrationed commodity for which people shopped most diligently during the winter of 1944–1945. By November cigarettes were difficult to find and throughout the following months the supply fell behind the demand to such an extent that dealers' shelves were customarily bare. A shipment of any brand was sold out almost as soon as it was opened. Smokers would shop from store to store for hours and then stand in line interminably for the privilege of buying a package of any brand. When he literally did not know where his next smoke was coming from, the average citizen felt like lynching the lady who boasted that she had a hoard of seven cartons of a favorite brand cigarette. Indeed a man who appeared in a downtown drug store casually carrying a quantity of leaf tobacco under his arm had the nicotine addicts remarking, “Lucky fellow, he's fixed for smokes.”45 Sooner or later nearly everyone tried rolling his own with varying degrees of success. One lady shopping in a Richmond department store discovered a machine selling for a quarter which did an excellent job of cigarette making. She invested three dollars and on her return to Charlottesville quickly disposed of the extra machines to her grateful friends. Gradually supply caught up with the demand for cigarettes so that by the end of 1945 a smoker was again able to pass his pack around in a crowd. The canning sugar program announced in February, 1945, was much stricter than that for 1944, and ration board allotments were reduced thirty per cent below the previous year. Even V-E Day on May 8 brought no relaxation in the O. P. A.'s grim outlook. On June 1, 1945, the Elliott Ice Company, which was again having trouble with O. P. A. regulations, announced that unless the objectionable provisions were rescinded, it would close its abattoir department on Saturday the ninth. The company objected especially to R. M. P. R. Order 169, which required custom slaughterers to “remit” to dealers who owned the cattle and calves which were dressed an amount sufficient to make the total cost of the carcasses to the dealer come under the O. P. A. ceiling prices for dressed meat. The regulation, which was designed to prevent dealers from paying excessively high prices for livestock, made the slaughterer a policeman whether he wished to be one or not and penalized him heavily if he slaughtered animals bought by dealers at the prevailing high prices. The announcement of the impending closing of the only slaughterhouse in the area caused considerable consternation as the University of Virginia Hospital, the Blue Ridge Sanatorium, and ten retail butcher shops were dependent upon the Elliott abattoir for their meat. One merchant sent a telegram to O. P. A. Administrator Chester Bowles saying. “We have cattle at Elliott's abattoir waiting to be slaughtered purchased fully under MPR 574. Elliott advises OPA restrictions don't permit him to slaughter them. We have our quotas established by your office for June. What good is a quota if you block us at the slaughterhouse? Can't you instruct Elliott to slaughter these cattle? We have been slaughtering at Elliott's abattoir for 34 years.” The O. P. A. district director, J. Fulmer Bright of Richmond, defended the regulation, saying that it should not force any established abattoir to discontinue business, or anyone else for that matter except the dealer who patronized the black market by purchasing cattle at a price above the ceiling, or the dealer who paid excessively high prices within the ceiling. On the eighth a meeting of the Albemarle Farm Bureau discussed the possible effect of the closing upon the farmers of the county. Several representatives from the district O. P. A. office in Richmond who were present stated that a revision of the regulations eliminating the objectionable provision was expected. They pointed out that O. P. A. had never ordered the Elliott Ice Company to close its slaughterhouse and so could not, as some people suggested, instruct them to keep it open. Monday, June 11, the abattoir remained in operation, but no cattle or calves were accepted from dealers for slaughter. Taking advantage of a provision exempting persons and institutions which had animals killed for their own consumption from the operation of the “kick back” provision, the Elliott Ice Company continued to slaughter cattle and calves for both the University Hospital and the Blue Ridge Sanatorium. Hogs and lambs were slaughtered for all comers, but as merchants' quotas for pork were limited to fifty per cent of their sales for the same period the year before, only lamb was available in normal amounts at the local meat markets. Soon the controversial regulation was rescinded, and the abattoir resumed slaughter of cattle and calves for all customers on June 21. There was but little improvement in the local meat supply, however, until after July 1 as most dealers had already used up practically all of their quotas for the period. In July meat dealers were allowed to handle fifty per cent of the amount of pork handled in July, 1944, seventy-six per cent of beef and veal, and 110 per cent of lamb. Most local dealers were able to find meat to fill these quotas.46 Preliminary negotiations preceding Japanese surrender were followed immediately by the end of processed food rationing on August 15, and the meat-fat program was dropped on November 24. This did not mean the return of plenty insofar as meat and butter were concerned. The continuation of price control kept production down, and supplies got scarce. With the return of peace Coordinator of Civilian Defense Seth Burnley wrote each member of the Charlottesville War Price and Rationing Board thanking him for his loyal service. “When I asked each and every one of you to serve this community,” he said, “no one refused although you knew full well that you would be criticized, and the work would require a lot of your valuable time and energy and at times I know it took all of your patriotic zeal and fortitude to continue. ... May our peaceful days now bring you much happiness with the knowledge that you have finished a job 'WELL DONE'.”47 When the O. P. A. controls expired temporarily on June 30, 1946, meat returned in abundance but at high prices. The restoration of price ceilings on September 10 brought Charlottesville the worst meat shortage it had experienced. For a month butcher shops were bare until the price control was finally lifted on October 15, leaving sugar rationing the only important survivor of wartime food controls. When that, too, was ended in June, 1947, the Charlottesville housewife could do her week-end shopping with nothing to remind her of the war—except the new prices, which were sometimes double those of 1939. One Charlottesville shopper, who had been forced to discontinue buying butter, the price of which had climbed out of sight, compared the cost of things which went into the market basket in June, 1946, before the end of O. P. A., with the cost of the same items in October, 1947. The results were startling and discouraging.48 June, 1946 October, 1947 Pork chops, 1 lb. $0.37 $0.65 Eggs, 1 doz. .47 .80 Sausage, 1 lb. .35 .49 Coffee, 1 lb. .24 .41 Bread, 1 loaf .12 .14 Potatoes, 10 lbs. .31 .41 Tomatoes, 1 lb. .15 .13 Cabbage, 3 lbs. .08 .15 Soap, 1 large cake .10 .18 Flour, 10 lbs. .54 1.05 Peas, 1 can .13 .16 Milk, 1 can .10 .12 $2.96 $4.69 Housing and Rent Control In January, 1942, nearly two weeks before President Roosevelt requested all Washingtonians not engaged in essential war work to leave the already crowded capital, Randolph H. Perry, executive secretary of the Charlottesville and Albemarle Chamber of Commerce, wrote Representative Howard W. Smith suggesting that non-essential residents of the District of Columbia move to the uncrowded communities in neighboring states. “I am sure,” he explained, “that many of these small cities are in the same position as we in Charlottesville, where, due to the rapid decrease in University enrollment, many houses and apartments in the University section of town will be vacated. For this reason we could take care of a considerable number of the people from Washington.”49 By May many inquiries regarding housing were being received, particularly from Newport News, Virginia, and Washington. At the same time it was thought that many vacationists who had habitually gone to the now crowded seashore resorts were considering inland recreation, but the difficulties of travel made their coming uncertain. Actually there was a great decrease in the number of tourists. A survey published in December, 1942, indicated that in spite of some gain in population. Charlottesville still had housing facilities available for nearly 1,000 people. The county meanwhile had suffered an actual decrease in population. As relatively adequate housing continued to be available throughout the early war years, rent control was not instituted in Charlottesville and Albemarle County until well after V-J Day. The housing picture, however, was not actually as rosy as it seemed. In 1940 Albemarle County had had 5,942 dwelling units of which only 5,513 were occupied, and Charlottesville had had 5,519 of which only 5,269 were occupied. Together county and city had had 679 vacant dwellings, but many of these were sub-standard. In 1940 the average renter paid $15.28 per month in Albemarle County and $30.46 per month in Charlottesville. As in most other localities, nearly all house construction was suspended during the war years. In 1942, for example, building permits authorizing only $78,515 worth of construction were issued in Charlottesville, as against $1,047,808 in 1939. During the decade ending in 1942 the annual average had exceeded $450,000. An increasingly large deficit in housing accumulated until the return of peace found Charlottesville with a shortage of dwellings.50 The opening of the School of Military Government at the University of Virginia on May 9, 1942, brought a recurring influx of Army officers. These men, who expected soon to go overseas, frequently rented homes and brought their families to Charlottesville. The officers in time finished their courses and departed, but, charmed by the community, their families often remained for the duration. Thus Charlottesville filled up with Army families.51 For various reasons many landlords were unwilling to rent to families with small children. On March 23, 1944, the classified advertisement column of The Daily Progress carried an appeal. “Are children a disgrace in Charlottesville? I am the wife of a Marine in active service, with three children under five years old. I am trying to find a three to five room apartment where I can make a home for them while their father is risking his life daily to protect you and your children, but I am turned from every vacant place I have found on account of the children. I have references from every place I have lived. I am not asking charity, I am asking a home. Is it a sin to have children in Charlottesville and to bring them up as law abiding citizens? Is there a real red blooded patriotic property owner in Charlottesville who will rent me a home?” Mrs. George H. Hawkins, who made the appeal, received many answers and soon was located in a comfortable four-room apartment.52 In the early summer of 1945, at the request of the Office of Price Administration, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U. S. Department of Labor made a survey of rent conditions in Charlottesville. In July reports of excessive rentals being charged by landlords caused Mayor Roscoe S. Adams to make a personal investigation of conditions. He concluded that the rent situation was “going from bad to worse” and that some form of control was needed. The local press meanwhile editorially condemned those landlords who had “taken advantage of wartime conditions to exact unreasonable increases.” After waiting a reasonable time for the announcement of O. P. A. action, Mayor Adams sent telegrams to the deputy O. P. A. administrator for rent, to Senator Harry F. Byrd, and to Representative Smith asking whether or not a ceiling would be placed on rents in the city. On August 8 Representative Smith reported that O. P. A. did not think the situation in Charlottesville justified rent ceilings. The same morning a letter informed the mayor that one large property owner had increased his rents twenty-five per cent as of September 1. Disappointed by the refusal of O.P.A. to take action, Mayor Adams was left without any effective means of checking rising rents. Because conditions had changed a great deal for the worse since the Department of Labor survey and because the city of Charlottesville was literally bulging at its seams so far as living quarters were concerned, he felt another survey was needed.53 In a surprise move on January 3, 1946, J. Fulmer Bright, O. P. A. district director, announced that rent control would be established in Charlottesville and all of Albemarle County starting February 1. On that date all residential rentals were to be rolled back fourteen months to the October 1, 1944, level. Although there was comment that it had been too long delayed, the action was generally hailed with approval. After expressing his delight that the government was taking the situation in hand, Mayor Adams added, “It is a sad commentary, however, on the conduct and business tactics of a small minority of the citizens of Charlottesville that such a step became necessary.” Landlords voiced most of the opposition. F. L. Harris, president of the local Real Estate Board, conceded that the situation was critical and that some rents were too high, but he concluded that the O. P. A. had acted too late. “They have set October 1, 1944, which was the peak of prices, as a base,” he admitted, but he also contended, “It will not work because in justice to property owners each case will have to be based on a fair return.” After reviewing the history of local housing construction, he asserted, “There is only one way to relieve the building shortage in Charlottesville and other cities: for the government to release building materials and controls, so that the independent contractors, builders, and producers can get into the game.”54 One renter, a veteran of World War II, replied to the landlords. “If you have raised the rent on any of your apartments since April, 1941, so much as one dollar without making some structural, ornamental, or furniture change, so as to make it a better place in which to live, then in my estimation your rent isn't exactly fair.” On the same day another renter suggested that the O. P. A. “bring along workers that shall help us fix up our homes, which are badly in need of all kinds of repairs.”55 Before the coming of rent control efforts had been made to increase housing in Charlottesville. Recognizing the acute shortage, on February 1, 1945, the National Housing Agency designated Charlottesville an area in which existing buildings might be converted so as to provide additional housing units, and during the summer construction on most of sixty-five new homes authorized by the National Housing Agency was underway. A special committee of the Chamber of Commerce, headed by Haynes L. Settle, made a survey in December of the housing needs and suggested that a corporation be formed to construct fifty houses to rent for about forty-five or fifty dollars a month. Later the committee made a trip to Lynchburg to inspect the prefabricated houses set up there. However, the most immediate relief to the housing problem came in the form of one hundred expandable trailers installed on Copeley Hill for married students at the University.56 Bernard P. Chamberlain of Charlottesville, who had been serving as rationing executive in the O. P. A. district office in Richmond, was named area rent director for Charlottesville and Albemarle County on January 18, 1946. His office was located in the County Office Building in the space formerly occupied by the Albemarle County War Price and Rationing Board. In announcing the appointment the O. P. A. district director said, “Mr. Chamberlain is splendidly equipped to fill the post through training and experience. As rationing executive he had the responsibility of handling an annual budget in excess of $100,000 and had supervision over about thirty-five employees. He conducted this department in a masterly and efficient manner. As rationing attorney he brought distinction to the district office by developing certain procedural techniques which were adopted by other districts throughout the United States.” When rent control became effective February 1, it was announced that landlords had until March 15 to register their property with the area office, although the new ceilings were effective at once. Special registration periods were held in Charlottesville, Crozet, and Scottsville, during which volunteer workers explained the rent control regulations and assisted property owners in preparing forms.57 Some home owners who otherwise would have rented rooms to war-veteran students at the University of Virginia were unwilling to do so because of their fear of “red tape.” By February 21 reports to this effect had become so numerous that Chamberlain felt it necessary to refute them. After pointing out that anyone who had an extra room could do a conspicuous service by renting it to a veteran who was trying to get an education under the G. I. Bill of Rights, Chamberlain declared that the reports had been based on misconceptions of the rent control regulations. “In the first place,” he said, “there is very little Government red tape involved in leasing rooms. Secondly, undesirable roomers may be evicted promptly. Thirdly, the rent ceilings generally prevailing here in September, 1944, were sufficiently high to insure a reasonable profit to any landlord.” Generally speaking, the people of Charlottesville and Albemarle responded well to the appeal for rooms for veterans, so well in fact that the University was able to enroll more students than it had ever before thought possible. A few property owners, however, remained for a time reluctant to rent houses which they hoped to sell in the near future because they were not sure they would be able to evict a tenant at the time of sale.58 As March 15, 1946, approached there was a rush of landlords to register their properties. By the twelfth approximately 3,150 housing units had been registered, over 300 registrations being received on that day. It was estimated that there remained seven to eight hundred housing units to be registered. About 125 landlords had also filed petitions for upward adjustments of rent. On the other hand, numerous tenants requested downward adjustments. Commenting on conditions found in Charlottesville, Lunsford L. Loving of Roanoke, deputy rent executive for Virginia, who helped set up the local office, said he was shocked by the high rents found in some cases and added that rent control was needed in the city far more than in any other area in which he had worked. The demand for homes was so great that a “House for Rent, ten minutes drive” advertisement in the newspaper brought sixty prompt replies.59 When O. P. A. expired at midnight, June 30, 1946, rent control temporarily ceased to exist in Charlottesville and Albemarle County. Stepping into the breach, the Real Estate Board asked property owners not to raise rents and reminded them that if rents went up Congress would have to reestablish some form of control. The Board also set up a Fair Rent Committee with H. T. Van Nostrand as chairman to review cases of unfair rents and to use “moral pressure” to keep rents at approximately O. P. A. levels. The committee had little chance, however, to show what it could do since rent control was restored without change on July 26. Meanwhile, many landlords had increased rents. In an atmosphere of rising prices this was to be expected. A few of these same landlords had been guilty of exceeding O. P. A. ceilings and had been forced to pay triple damages to their tenants. Now they were anxious to charge all the traffic would bear. A report from the Richmond office of O. P. A. that rents in Charlottesville had increased forty-two per cent in the first week of July was branded as exaggerated, but Chamberlain expressed the opinion that rents had risen thirty per cent, while Leonard H. Peterson, executive secretary of the Charlottesville and Albemarle County Chamber of Commerce, said the rise had been less than ten per cent. Whatever the amount of the increase, tenants welcomed a return to the June 30 level.60 A year later, July 1, 1947, rent control was again extended, but in a somewhat modified form. The average citizen by this time had become accustomed to rent control, and, if he had a home, he accepted the extension thankfully. There were many, however, who had been unable to find living quarters. In October, 1947, more families were living doubled up than ever before. In Charlottesville over 500 households were sharing living accommodations. Recent marriages, the return of additional servicemen, and increased enrollment at the University created a demand for homes which exceeded the supply of new houses, hundreds of which had been constructed during the preceding year.61 During the war public opinion concerning the Office of Price Administration was as various as the individual natures of the millions affected by its regulations. Many felt that it was oppressive. In the early part of the postwar transition era higher prices and a disillusioning continuation of relative scarcities in nearly all types of consumer goods made some citizens reconsider and reverse their adverse judgments. As prices continued their upward spiral during the summer and autumn of 1947, when rental ceilings were the last remaining vestige of the formerly comprehensive program of O. P. A., there was constant talk to the effect that rationing and price control should be revived. At the same time mounting construction costs impeded efforts to solve the housing problem and left many veterans wondering when they would get the home of their own for which they had traveled half way around the world to fight. VI Manufacturing War Goods Months before Pearl Harbor, Charlottesville and Albemarle County were already feeling the defense boom. Local corporations in 1941 had their best year since 1929 with earnings of practically all of them above those reported in 1940. Many were able to declare extra dividends at the end of the year. Expansion projects were completed by Frank Ix and Sons, the Crozet Cold Storage Corporation, the Lee Bakery Company, and O. E. &amp; C. L. Hawkins. The Monticello Dairy, Crozet Cold Storage, and other firms took advantage of prosperity to refund outstanding bonds. All three Charlottesville banks declared larger dividends than those of the preceding year. The Alberene Stone Corporation of Virginia, employing nearly 500 people, turned out more than a hundred carloads of soapstone per month, with sixty per cent of this production going into national defense work.1 Cooperation was the keynote of the Albemarle war effort. In the first months of the war when it was feared that government contracts might pass Charlottesville by, one city organization after another declared in favor of a program for bringing war orders to the county. The Retail Merchants Association, the Young Men's Business Club, and the Business and Professional Women's Club were joined by several of the civic clubs in this move. In order to coordinate these efforts an Advisory Planning Board was organized on August 15, 1942, composed of representatives from these clubs, the Chamber of Commerce, the City Council, the County Board of Supervisors, and other organizations.2 The business organization of the community was further strengthened in October when Leonard H. Peterson was named executive secretary of the Charlottesville and Albemarle County Chamber of Commerce to fill a vacancy of several months' duration.3 As soon as the nation had actually been plunged into war, local businessmen went into high gear. In May, 1943, Peterson described what was happening in Charlottesville: For the past year, and in some cases longer, local manufacturing enterprises, with few exceptions, have been working at full capacity to produce goods for use by the Army, Navy, and Merchant Marine. Both labor and management have been working long hours and at top speed in order to complete large contracts on or before the time specified. Some of these firms have had to make enormous changes in order to convert to production of items entirely foreign to their normal operations and as a result have given employment to hundreds of persons. Industrial employment at present is at the highest point in the city's history. A partial list of the goods now being produced includes such items as mechanical parts for merchant ships, wood, metal and electrical parts for naval vessels, cloth for parachutes and flare chutes, uniform cloth for the Navy, parts for anti-aircraft shells. braids for uniforms, lumber and pre-fabricated buildings and other building materials, mattresses and clothing. Local transportation facilities are moving large numbers of service men and huge quantities of war materials at all hours of the day and night. Local utilities are adequately meeting unprecedented demands in a most efficient manner. It is estimated that approximately 2,000 people are employed locally in work directly related to the war effort and that the monthly payrolls for this group amount to nearly $250,000.4 By the end of 1943 local war production had reached its peak. The fifteen leading manufacturing industries in that year employed an average of 2,400 persons and produced $13,250,000 worth of goods, of which eighty per cent was classifiable as war material.5 The pressure of this increased production was felt in every phase of the community's economic life. Stores, inundated by increased business, struggled in vain to find workers to handle it. Laundries were overwhelmed as their employees disappeared. Sometimes it took three weeks to get a clean shirt. Four times during the war the Home Laundry, for example, had to stop collections until it had worked itself out from under the pile of soiled clothes it had already gathered.6 The Daily Progress, confronted with the newsprint shortage, decreased the number of its pages and on Saturdays shrank to tabloid size, eliminating advertising. In spite of every handicap, these businesses were able to contribute to the war effort. The stores sold war bonds and participated in other campaigns. The newspaper gave its columns generously to all war drives. Radio station WCHV devoted one-third of its time to community war service. An outstanding example of its enterprise came before dawn of D-Day. Knowing the intense interest with which local families were awaiting the news of the opening of the second front, WCHV promised to announce the beginning of the invasion by telephone to all its listeners who would send in their names and telephone numbers to the station. By the night of June 5, 1944, WCHV had accumulated a list of 175 advertisers and public officials and 125 families with sons in the service. About 1:00 A. M., Eastern War Time, on the morning of June 6, 1944, just as the first troops were hitting the Normandy beaches, Charles Barham, Jr., an owner of the station, was aroused by the United Press. Immediately he called his manager, Randolph Bean, and forty-five minutes later WCHV went on the air. By three o'clock, when the authenticity of the news was established, Barham began to send out the promised notifications with the aid of two operators provided by the Virginia Telephone and Telegraph Company. Within an hour and a half 300 telephones were jangling in the ears of sleeping residents of Charlottesville to bring them the exciting news that D-Day had arrived. As the intensity of the war effort increased, it became unnecessary to seek business, since local industry had more than it could handle. With Selective Service draining off more and more of the potential labor supply, it became almost impossible to replace employees departing for military service. As early as 1941, in anticipation of the rapid expansion of defense industries, special free industrial arts classes had been set up in Charlottesville to train men and women in the skills needed in war plants, but the number trained in these classes was only a fraction of those needed. By the spring of 1944, local manufacturers and other business men decided to meet the emergency by mobilizing all available manpower. A group of employers, therefore, launched the Charlottesville Go-To-Work campaign. Setting up headquarters with borrowed furniture in the showroom of Earl H. Vaughan, successor to Burnley Brothers Coal Company, a committee began an enthusiastic five months' campaign on April 10. A large banner stretched across West Main Street, and bold posters in the headquarters windows called the attention of all passers-by to the need for workers. There were frequent appeals on the radio for war production volunteers. All this advertising brought in a total of 411 applicants; even three town derelicts were inspired to enlist. Of this total, 366 persons were referred to available jobs and at least one out of every four was hired. Since this response fell far short of filling the demand, the campaign shifted to a thorough house-to-house canvass undertaken by teachers from the city schools under the direction of Mrs. J. Tevis Michie. All this ringing of door bells disclosed only 208 persons who were willing and able to go to work. Anxious employers sent postcards to these applicants asking them to report for an interview, and in at least two instances the employers were so eager that they went after the applicants in person. In most cases, however, those interviewed showed little interest in the jobs.7 The bottom of the manpower barrel had been scraped as bare as Mother Hubbard's cupboard. This labor shortage was in large measure offset by overtime work. Indeed, there were very few wage earners in war industry who did not work more than the standard forty-hour week. While “time and a half” and even “double time” for overtime and holiday work made a strong appeal to all and played a great part in securing the necessary man-hours, yet most factory employees were also impelled by a high sense of patriotic duty. Willing hands were found to make the millions of dollars worth of important war goods which poured from the factories of Charlottesville and Albemarle County. Textile Mills One of the most important records of achievement was that of the plant of Frank Ix and Sons, Inc. Paradoxically, the Ix war output was devoted primarily to the preservation rather than to the destruction of life. Ix silk looms had switched from luxurious crepes and satins to parachute fabrics long before Pearl Harbor. In fact, in August of 1941 the company completed an extension, at the cost of $128,000 of its own funds, which increased its monthly capacity by 422,400 yards of parachute cloth.8 First silk and later nylon were woven into fabrics designed to save the life of the aviator leaping from his doomed plane. The Ix looms also turned out rayon which was used for parachutes to drop supplies to men in isolated spots or to retard the speed of descending flares. Ix 'chute fabrics served a deadly purpose only on fragmentation bombs. Parachutes were attached to these bombs to delay their descent until the plane dropping them was safely out of range. The local Ix mill, working a 168-hour week, together with the firm's New Holland, Pennsylvania, factory turned out these fabrics so rapidly that one of the trade papers acclaimed them as “the country's largest manufacturer of parachute cloth.”9 In this production the Charlottesville mill outstripped its family rival. Further protection to American airmen was provided by Ix-woven textiles for use in flak suits and flak curtains, which shielded fliers from anti-aircraft fragments. Another use of Ix fabrics was in the manufacture of G-suits, designed to lessen the effect of gravity on pilots in dives and turns. The Charlottesville mill also developed a special “rip-stop” cloth for airplane wings. This was woven in small, seamed squares, which kept bullet holes from turning into dangerous tears. Far from being a war baby, the Ix mill first became known in Virginia industrial circles in 1928, but not until 1945 was a Virginia charter secured for the local plant. Under the direction of Frank Ix, Jr., the plant grew from 50 employees in 1929 to 370 in 1941; the wartime peak of 650 workers was reached in 1945. By this time the $47,000 annual payroll of 1929 had increased more than twenty-fold, and yearly wage payments amounted to over $1,000,000.10 During the war years ten per cent of this payroll went regularly into the purchase of war bonds. National recognition for the Ix contributions to the war effort came first on September 26, 1942, in the form of a Minute Man Flag from the U. S. Treasury Department. This award was authorized when ninety per cent of the employees put ten per cent of their gross earnings into war bonds through payroll allotments. For four years, 1942–1945, the Ix workers participated a hundred per cent in the payroll allotment plan. During the Third War Loan the employees each contributed an entire week's pay to the purchase of bonds in addition to their regular payroll allotment.11 The company's production excellence was recognized on April 17, 1943, with the awarding of the coveted Army-Navy “E”. The official presentation a month later on May 16 was a proud moment in the history of Charlottesville, marking the first time such an award had been given in this area. In fact, at that time only two per cent of the industrial plants of the nation engaged in war work had received this honor. Governor Colgate W. Darden, Jr., spoke at the ceremony, stressing the fact that the Ix plant had become absorbed in the life of the community in which it was located. In accepting the award Frank Ix, Jr., praised the spirit of teamwork and the intense determination for victory manifested by the workers. Stars indicating a renewal of the honor were added to the “E” pennant on February 19, 1944, September 9, 1944, and April 23, 1945.12 The local war industry suffered all the usual trouble of labor shortages, transportation difficulties, and scarcity of raw materials. In December, 1943, the company through an advertisement in The Daily Progress pleaded with “Girls Over 18—Also Boys Over 16” to start to work at wages from $20.80 a week. The draft continued to take more experienced workers; by April, 1945, some 212 former employees were in the service.13 In the face of such losses it was no mean task to live up to the Army-Navy “E”. The training program for new workers was accelerated so rapidly that young women after a short period of training were performing jobs that had once been handled only by men with as much as four years of training. Commuting problems were solved by a well developed share-the-ride program and by a special bus which brought in employees from surrounding communities. At the same time houses were purchased or built as homes for employees brought into the community.14 The character of the Ix workers is indicated by the record they set for safety. The plant on November 1, 1944, started a period of operation without a single accident serious enough to cause an employee to lose time from his work. On July 9, 1945, the mill carried this record of safe operation through 1,250,000 man-hours, entitling it to a Certificate of Merit issued by the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company The Ix mill in Charlottesville receives the first star for its “E” pennant. for conspicuous achievement in accident prevention. By the time the award was made, on August 6, the workers had already added another month to this record and were still going strong.15 Not until December 18, 1946, was there an accident to break the record. By that time 3,251,932 accident-free man-hours of work had been attained. The Certificate of Merit joined the Minute Man Flag and the thrice-starred Army-Navy “E” burgee in the honors garnered by this Charlottesville plant. Also prized is a letter now in an honored spot in the company's scrapbook. It was written by Lieutenant General A. A. Vandegrift, Commandant of the Marine Corps and a native of Charlottesville. The general expressed his appreciation for the “Navy scarfs”—neckties to civilians—sent him as a gift by one of the leading war industries in his home town. Many a Marine, Army, and Navy airman probably felt even more keenly a sense of appreciation for the wartime contribution of the nation's largest producer of parachute cloth. Not only the cloth for parachute canopies but also shroud lines were produced in Charlottesville. The Virginia Braid Company began manufacturing 'chute cords early in 1941, changing over from its peacetime output of furniture cord and dress braid. Absorbed by Virginia Textiles, Inc., November 1, 1944, the plant continued to produce parachute lines, as well as cords for tents, cargo covers, and uniforms.16 Cloth for uniforms came from a veteran producer of military fabrics. Since 1935 the Charlottesville Woolen Mills had been turning out goods for Navy uniforms. Cadets at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, Virginia Military Institute, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute were usually clad in Charlottesville-woven fabrics. The war therefore meant only an acceleration of normal production up to the rate of 15,000 yards a month, or a half-million dollars a year in value. Most of this cloth was taken by the Navy. Three other local textile plants took part in the war effort. Henderson and Ervin, peacetime manufacturer of men's and women's clothing under the “Rockingchair” brand, began producing uniforms for Red Cross nurses in February, 1942, and six months later added hospital uniforms for Army nurses. Shirtwaists for WACs and Red Cross workers were also manufactured. War production leaped from 26,808 units in 1942 to 84,282 in 1944, while employment rose from 88 to 128.17 The plant of the Monticello Shirt Company, taken over by Knothe Brothers, Inc., produced men's shorts for the Army at the rate of 100,000 a year. Construction begun shortly after the end of the war doubled the capacity of this factory.18 The Albemarle Weaving Company attempted to convert its looms, designed for producing upholstery and drapery materials, to war purposes, but was unable to secure the necessary priorities for the equipment. The company therefore had to continue its peacetime products with the result that output dropped from 750,000 yards in 1941 to 350,000 in 1944, while employment shrank from 250 in 1941 to 64 in 1945. A small percentage of this production, however, did find its way into military service.19 Machine Shops Among the heavier industries the Southern Welding and Machine Company provided a rags-to-riches success story in the best Horatio Alger tradition. The firm began in the depression thirties with little capital other than the ingenuity and enterprise of its two partners, R. R. Harmon and J. Tevis Michie. Its first plant was a small, abandoned building, which leaned at a tired angle, and its first order brought in only twenty-five cents. With no regular products of its own, the firm became a custom foundry and machine shop, taking in whatever business it could locate. When orders were slow, Harmon, who was plant manager, worked on his special interest, experimental models of gas purification and combustion equipment, and acquired a number of patents in the process. Whatever profits were made were devoted to the expansion of the shops and the purchase of discarded machinery, which was moved in and put back into condition. By 1939 this careful management had expanded the operation to twenty-five employees and an annual business of $50,000. The next summer brought the company its first defense order, a contract to produce electrical stuffing tubes for the United States Coast Guard. These tubes were used to conduct electrical wiring through bulkheads —“partitions,” in landlubber language. The success of this initial contract soon brought follow-up orders from the Navy, the Maritime Commission, and private shipbuilders. Tens of thousands of these tubes were delivered at prices well below the cost which the Navy had established on the basis of its own production. Another early order came as a result of the Harmon patents. To expand the nation's output of sulphuric acid it was decided to convert the Ducktown, Tennessee, plant of the Tennessee Copper Company from the chamber process to the contact acid process. Gas purification equipment controlled by some of Harmon's patents was selected for use in the new plant, and his firm designed, built, and supervised the installation of the equipment. This was the first time that a wet process for purifying roaster gases for sulphuric acid production had ever been used. The Charlottesville equipment proved much superior to the apparatus it replaced, and its increased yield of sulphuric acid helped to make possible the vast expansion in the nation's output of TNT which followed. Southern Welding's greatest achievement, however, was its contribution to the building of the vast carrier fleet which eventually swept the Japanese Navy off the seas. An essential part of these mobile airfields is a device for halting the planes as they come in for a landing. When the ship's aircraft are in the air, a series of cables are stretched across the flightdeck. A hook in the tail of a landing plane grasps one of these cables, and the resulting drag slows down the aircraft and brings it to a stop. The cable is a part of a complicated assembly called a flight-arresting gear, which must be constructed to have just the right amount of “give.” Too much or too little elasticity may injure both plane and pilot. Southern Welding proved so adept at constructing these delicate mechanisms that the company was given the task of outfitting scores of carriers. At one time in 1943 it was working on flight-arresting gears for forty-five different carriers being built by the Navy and private shipyards. The Charlottesville firm also provided many flat-tops with crash barriers. These were raised at the end of the flight deck to keep a plane from toppling into the sea when the arresting gear failed to halt it, and they had to be strong enough to stop a dive-bomber careening across the deck at sixty miles an hour. Another carrier device produced by Southern Welding was the spotting dolly. This was a four-wheeled mobile jack, which lifted the planes and moved them about, simplifying the problem of parking in the narrow spaces of the carrier hold. One more product for naval aviators was the bridle-catcher assembly used on catapult mechanisms. While the company was going “all out” for the Navy pilots, it somehow managed also to produce for the Army such miscellaneous items as caps, bases, and nose-closing plugs for 90-pound fragmentation or anti-personnel bombs; hydraulic control devices for flying bombs; bomb band trunnions for 500-pound bombs; trail casters for gun carriages; gun platforms for 40-millimeter anti-aircraft guns; and trick wheels for landing craft. Some idea of the changes this production meant for Southern Welding can be gained from the fact that its sales mushroomed from $67,000 in 1940 to more than $1,000,000 in 1943, an increase of about 1,900 per cent since 1939. The plant itself more than tripled in area between Pearl Harbor and the Japanese surrender, growing from 16,000 to 53,000 square feet of floor space. The expanded facilities included a large fabrication shop, a boiler house, and a private railroad siding, all built in large part of salvaged materials. The trusses of the fabricating shop came from the dismantled Sixth Avenue Elevated Railway in New York City, and the only items the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway supplied for the siding were the switch and a signal light. New equipment was brought in at a cost of $72,000, of which $43,000 came from the company's funds. This rapid expansion placed a severe strain on working capital. Money to pay wages and bills for raw materials had to be borrowed from a local bank until payment arrived for completed contracts. Growing with mounting inventories, the loan eventually reached ten per cent of the bank's deposits, the legal maximum for a single loan. Additional funds then had to be secured through the Federal Reserve Bank, with the Navy guaranteeing repayment. Raw materials were often as hard to find as money. While the firm had top priorities, this meant merely the right to buy the material if it could be located. Nevertheless, the company usually managed to get its deliveries through on time and never caused an important delay in production. Southern Welding's biggest problem, however, was recruiting and training its labor force. Employment jumped from 25 in 1939 to a peak of 204 in 1943, but it proved impossible to hold this many workers under wartime conditions. Forty-eight employees left to enter the armed forces. Training the industrial recruits required managerial ingenuity. When the company took on the crash barrier contract, it discovered that its new and unskilled workers could not read the blueprints. The management went to work and produced a set of drawings of a different and more readily understandable type. Delighted with the results of this initiative, the Navy incorporated the drawings into a manual for use aboard all carriers on which this type of crash barrier was installed. While producing vital war materiel, the Southern Welding and Machine Company earned the right to fly the U. S. Treasury Department Minute Man Flag and the Army-Navy “E” burgee with three white stars. When the first award of the Army-Navy “E” was announced in January, 1944, J. Tevis Michie remarked that “all credit must go to our employees for the splendid job they have done on war contracts.” The presentation of the “E” flag was made in the company's fabrication shop on February 26 by Captain Edgar M. Williams, U. S. Navy, the commanding officer of the V - 12 unit at the University of Virginia. At the same time Brigadier General E. R. Warner McCabe, U. S. Army, commanding officer of the School of Military Government, presented award pins to each of the company's employees. Stars signifying continuing outstanding excellence in war production during subsequent six-month periods were added on July 24, 1944, January 29, 1945, and September 1, 1945. The company's problems after V-J Day exceeded anything which had been experienced in the hectic days of the war. When a nationwide strike of steel workers in January, 1946, threatened to shut off the firm's supply of its chief raw material for postwar production of bulldozers, road scrapers, earth movers, food processing equipment, and other custom-built appliances, 88 out of 103 employees joined the two partners of the firm in denouncing federal labor policies which Captain Williams presents to Southern Welding's partners their first “E” flag. permitted such a strike to occur. Their protest and constructive criticism took the form of an open letter to the President of the United States which was published at their own expense in a full-page advertisement in the local newspaper. Copies of it were sent to Virginia delegates in Congress as well as to the President. The threatened shut-down, following an unavoidable slow-down, materialized in February, 1946, and lasted two weeks. Soon after steel could be obtained again, the company had secured sufficient orders to justify increasing the work week from forty hours to fifty-four. With the lifting of the Federal lid on wages, three general wage increases were voluntarily instituted. Although business was well below the wartime peak, it was still more than four times the average of 1939, indicating that this infant industry had grown to maturity.20 Another metal-working firm, N. W. Martin and Brothers, continued its peacetime production of roof and sheet metal through 1942. Its output was used in the construction of Camp Lee, Fort Belvoir, and the Woodrow Wilson General Hospital near Staunton, Virginia. In 1943, however, the firm took an entirely new line, the molding of plastics, when it received a contract to make noses for Black Widows. The nature of this work was a well-guarded secret for several years until military developments permitted the Army to release the story of its deadly night fighter. Making plastic noses for the plane should have presented a problem for sheet-metal workers, but Martin and Brothers earned the commendation of the Air Technical Service Command for the way in which they handled the job. Instead of waiting for the necessary new equipment to arrive, the firm set to work to produce the machinery in its own shops. At the same time employees were trained in the new processes so that equipment and workers were ready to start the job simultaneously. This enterprise enabled the Martins to turn out noses for two thousand Black Widows.21 Quarries Out in the county the Alberene Stone Corporation of Virginia found military uses for its soapstone. Although the company had no direct contracts with the government, it estimated that nearly three million dollars worth of its product went into war purposes. Soapstone from its Albemarle County and Nelson County quarries was manufactured into laboratory and photographic development equipment, such as table-tops, trays, and fume hoods for Army and Navy hospitals, air bases, and even aircraft carriers. Similar products were made for the new industrial plants which multiplied the nation's capacity for aluminum, high octane gasoline, and synthetic rubber. Stone tubs were shipped to the Panama Canal Zone and to San Juan. Puerto Rico, as well as to the Quantico Marine Barracks and the Norfolk Naval Operating Base. The difficulties encountered by the Alberene company were typical of the problems faced by industry in general. Of the nearly 500 employees working in 1941, about 150 entered the armed forces and many others left for higher-paid jobs. Government orders lifting the minimum wage to fifty cents an hour raised operating costs, as did another directive requiring the plant to go on a forty-eight hour week. These increases nibbled away at the profit margin until declining orders finally put the plant into the red in 1944. Not until August of that year, however, did the government permit an increase in ceiling prices and then only ten per cent. President John S. Graves of Charlottesville said of his experience: “Too many agencies —too much red tape—too many conflicting regulations and reports.” To top off the company's troubles, on September 18, 1944, a flash flood resulting from twenty inches of rainfall did over $45,000 worth of damage. Water rose ten and a half feet in the mill and over six feet in the commissary and offices. This was ten feet higher than it had ever before gone. Eight of the largest fills of the Nelson and Albemarle Railroad, a company subsidiary over which it shipped, were washed away, and service was interrupted for over two months. The flood also damaged the tracks of both the Chesapeake and Ohio and the Southern railways, particularly the roadbed of the latter in the southern part of the county.22 Another Albemarle mineral product which enlisted for the duration was slate. The Blue Ridge Slate Corporation was fortunate in being able to continue all its regular peacetime products except roofing slate. New machinery added during the war doubled its capacity and enabled it to shorten the 168-hour week it had operated during 1941. The firm's output of slate roofing granules and flour rose from 14,000 tons in 1939 to 18,000 in 1941 and then gradually declined to 14,500 tons in 1944. The company estimated that eighty per cent of this production went indirectly to the War Department and to Lend-Lease. Miscellaneous A third county business expanded its plant just in time to take a prominent part in the war effort. Founded in 1929, the Crozet Cold Storage Corporation was merely a warehouse for Albemarle-grown fruit until 1941. In that year the company added quick-freezing facilities to process foods. The outbreak of hostilities made this plant even more valuable than had been expected. In the four years, 1941– 1944, it stored 155,000 bushels of Albemarle apples and 35,000 bushels of local peaches. In addition it was pressed into service to process 26,000 bushels of snap beans for the government. To supply so many “snaps” was far beyond the capacity of Albemarle farmers, and beans came from Tennessee and North Carolina to be processed at Crozet. The plant was also called upon to freeze and store five million pounds of poultry. Another function it performed was to serve as a sort of “staging area” for frozen foods. Sometimes refrigerator cars loaded with such foods as meat, eggs, and lard for overseas consignment arrived in the East when no shipping space was available. In such cases the cars had to be routed to a plant like the one at Crozet where food could be stored until shipping was available.23 Another firm with a big part in the war effort was the Barnes Lumber Corporation, which filled government contracts amounting to nearly $2,000,000. It supplied to the Army and Navy its peacetime products, oak flooring and millwork, as well as thousands of feet of special-purpose lumber. This company made crates for antiaircraft guns, boxes for ammunition, and wooden pallets to expedite the handling of goods in warehouses and shipping. Its most curious product was a large quantity of wooden discs, designed to counteract magnetic mines. Suffering from the usual problems, the company saw its workers decline from 360 in 1941 to 220 in 1944, even though it sent out its own trucks to bring the employees to their jobs.24 At least three other city firms turned out war goods. The Charlottesville Lumber Company used its experience in manufacturing window sash and door frames to produce prefabricated barracks and radar buildings as well as crates for one and one-half ton trucks.25 The Essex Corporation turned out thousands of fountain pens, while L. H. Wiebel, Inc., manufactured 22,000,000 wooden insulator pins and brackets for the telephone lines laid by the United States Signal Corps all around the world. Even the blind were able to do their part. The superintendent of the Virginia Workshop for the Blind reported that his sightless workers in five years had produced 118,150 brooms and 108,952 mattresses for the use of the Army and Navy. Government Owned Plant Newest and most modern of all the Albemarle County industries was one which was born only in the late years of the war. In the winter of 1943–1944 the growing demand for heavy-duty tires for trucks and planes made necessary the expansion of rayon tire cord production. On January 12, 1944, the United States Rubber Company decided to locate a new plant somewhere in Central Virginia. Two days later two company officials were in Charlottesville looking for a suitable site. When Scottsville was recommended, the U. S. Rubber men secured the cooperation of town officials in selecting a location just west of the town.26 A hitch developed when one of the landowners demanded a hundred dollars an acre more than the U. S. Defense Plants Corporation, which was to build this government-owned war industrial facility, was willing to pay, but the Scottsville Lions Club agreed to underwrite the difference, which amounted to $3,490. This obligation was later assumed by the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors, along with a debt of $2,623 incurred by the town of Scottsville in extending water and sewer mains to the new plant. Scottsville furnished $6,944 as its share of the cost of enlarging the municipal water plant, while a grant of $5,942 from the Federal Works Agency covered the rest.27 Vigorous local initiative thus secured the construction of the third largest of seven government owned war plants built in Virginia for operation by private firms. Early in April, 1944, ground was broken for the new plant, and on May 24 came a momentous day in the history of Scottsville. Hundreds of people came from miles around to witness the laying of the cornerstone. Governor Colgate W. Darden, Jr., welcomed the plant to the state and called it a significant step towards achieving for Virginia an economy in which agriculture would be balanced with industry. Other speakers included C. T. O'Neill, chairman of the Central Virginia Planning Commission, O. L. Ward, plant-manager-to-be, and H. E. Humphreys, Jr., vice-president of the U. S. Rubber Company.28 While construction was going on, the company, which leased the plant from the government, began training local workers to handle the new machines. The first employees moved into the building on October 2, although installation of the machinery was not completed for another six weeks.29 The building which these new workers entered was something new and different, a near-approach to the pushbutton factory envisioned by industrial designers. The brick and steel structure was a large, one-story building, 444 feet long and 264 feet wide, without a single window except in the managerial offices. Fluorescent lights and an air-conditioning system which changed the air every four to six minutes provided weather-proof working conditions. Humidity and temperature controls kept the worker comfortable and made rayon spinning easier. The floors were designed to be resilient, absorb vibration, and resist moisture. An ultra-modern cafeteria with a noise-absorbing ceiling was among other attractive features. Operation of the machinery was nearly automatic. At the push of a button an overhead conveyor system picked up a huge half-ton beam of rayon filament yarn, brought it to the proper machine, picked up the empty beam, replaced it with the full one, and then rolled the empty beam to the doorway where it could be loaded on a railroad freight car. The filament yarn was pulled off the beam by ply-twisting spindles. The resulting thread was respooled, twisted into high-tenacity cord, and then woven into tire fabric. The conveyor system finally picked up the huge roll of cord fabric and deposited it in the storage area.30 This efficient process was especially valuable in wartime. With the machines handling all the heavy work, women could do nine jobs out of every ten in the manufacturing process and seven out of ten in the plant as a whole. This made it much easier to recruit workers Weaving tire cord fabric in the U. S. Rubber Company plant at Scottsville. in a man-short area. Starting with a skeleton staff, the plant had 136 employees in November, 1944, and by Christmas was over the 200-mark. Employment, expected to reach a maximum of 300 in March, 1945, had actually climbed to 350 by the fall of that year. The workers toiled around the clock on a three-shift basis, six days a week. In fact, during the spring of 1945 they kept the spindles turning for ninety days without a stop at the request of the War Department. Fifteen per cent of the employees received citations for not missing a day during the period.31 Transformed almost overnight from a rural village to an indus trial town, Scottsville created a Town Planning Commission to ease its growing pains. Since the company had imported very few workers, the housing problem was not critical. Local employees, however, came from such great distances that the commission decided to seek low-cost housing facilities to enable them to move nearer their jobs. The tax structure had to be revised to pay for new civic services, including the expanded waterworks and a proposed municipal building.32 Then, six weeks after the Japanese surrender, came an announcement that the Federal government was selling the factory. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation listed the Scottsville plant with 949 other “surplus properties” to be put on the auction block and knocked down to the highest bidder. The R. F. C. description read like a barren obituary: completed in 1944 at a cost of $2,400,000, affording a total floor area of 125,500 square feet, located on approximately sixty-six and three-quarters acres.33 Unlisted in the inventory was the managerial enterprise which had made equipment designed to produce 1,200,000 pounds of cord a month turn out almost 2,000,000 pounds every month.34 Accomplishments like this, however, had demonstrated the value of the Scottsville plant and saved it from the premature death which was the fate of many a war-born industry. No less than four large corporations tried to acquire it, with the U. S. Rubber Company carrying off the prize for $1,837,500.35 Since the new owner was already in charge of the factory, the change-over was made without the loss of a minute's working time. Albemarle's war baby had grown to manhood and was ready to stand on its own feet in the competition of peacetime private enterprise. Local corporations bethought themselves of postwar planning as early as 1944. On September 1 a seven man planning commission was appointed by Charlottesville's mayor, J. Emmett Gleason. The county also named a commission, and on November 3 coordination was achieved by the selection of a three-man steering committee. This was composed of representatives of the city, county, and Central Virginia planning commissions. Over 2,000 questionnaires were sent to local servicemen throughout the world asking their civilian job-preferences and qualifications. Other surveys undertaken in connection with this program reported that seventeen manufacturers in the city and county area were employing 1,936 workers in 1944, as compared with 1,711 in 1940. These manufacturers estimated that they would need 2,233 employees for postwar production. The indicated increase of 300 persons in manufacturing was expected to create from 450 to 600 additional jobs in the service industries and construction trades, promising that the Albemarle area would be busier than ever in the postwar world. Further evidence of a bright business future was found in increased bank clearings. The January-February, 1946, volume of debits for Charlottesville was $48,022,000, which was 332 per cent higher than the 1939 average. Only seven other cities in the United States had as great increases in clearings over prewar days.36 Charlottesville and Albemarle County were primarily non-industrial, having by far the greater part of their citizens engaged in business and professional services and in agriculture. Yet, when called upon to help supply the Army and the Navy, the community responded in a manner which won the appreciation of the nation. Justly proud of the fact that Southern Welding and Frank Ix and Sons were two of the seventeen privately operated Virginia plants which added three or more stars to their Army-Navy “E” burgees, the whole people rejoiced in the knowledge that together employer and employee had kept local industry in uninterrupted production for victory. VII Producing Food and Fiber Food for combatant armies has ever been one of the requisites of war. Famous generals from Alexander the Great to Eisenhower have attested to this fact. During the Second World War production of food proved to be more indispensable than ever before. This circumstance was attributable directly to practices to which Germany and Japan resorted. In Europe, for example, the Germans planned and carried out a scientific system of looting the countries they invaded. Not only did invading German armies appropriate harvested crops and livestock for their own consumption: carloads of agricultural produce and farm animals were also sent into Germany for civilian consumption. Every precaution was taken to divest the farmers in conquered countries of seeds for sowing new crops and to deprive them of grain for feeding what livestock remained. German dieticians calculated meticulously what would constitute a subnormal diet for their conquered neighbors, thereby guaranteeing their ultimate debilitation. Throughout the years of the war these peoples were undernourished, while Germany lived on the fat of their lands. Untouched by enemy incursions, the United States was fortunate in that its land was neither invaded nor plundered. American farmers were left free to pursue the cultivation of their fields unmolested. They became aware of the importance of the task which was to be theirs in the struggle against Germany, Italy, and Japan. Not all but many of them soon recognized that the goals for increased food production set forth by the Federal government were fully justified, though its proposals seemed staggering. Many farmers understood that food must be raised for their sons overseas; that the people at home, active in producing the materials of war, required adequate nourishment; that the allies engaged in fighting off invading armies or air forces were in need of a supplement to their rapidly diminishing food supplies; and that whole populations in conquered countries, people who were most cruelly affected by the lack of food, were in dire need of any relief which could be gotten to them. In fact, the American farmer found it necessary to think in terms not only of his own welfare but also of his community, his country, and the world as a whole. He met the food crisis and produced what was required. Since agricultural interests had been predominant in Albemarle County, the production of food for American consumption and for shipment abroad to allied nations naturally occupied the 15,955 persons who were living on its farms when this country was drawn into the war. Although never disturbed by foreign invasion, the production of food did not progress with uninterrupted smoothness during the war. Shortages of labor and machinery, and price ceilings which were in some instances restrictive, brought problems which challenged patriotic effort as well as understanding of the unprecedented production goals set by the Federal government. Various divisions of the Department of Agriculture, together with additional Federal and state agencies related to agriculture, worked to inform the Albemarle farmer of his responsibilities to himself and to his country. The city dwellers of Charlottesville and residents of the towns of the county were encouraged from the spring of 1942 to join Albemarle County farmers in producing food. Their Victory Gardens brought into this phase of the war effort a large fraction of the total population of the community.1 Food Production Goals National goals for the production of food in 1942, the largest in the history of American agriculture to that time, were nineteen per cent higher than the 1935–1939 average. They provided for greatly increased acreages of soybeans and peanuts to meet the shortage of vegetable oil, which had previously been imported from the Philippines, and they called for expansion in dairy products, livestock, and vegetable crops. Albemarle County farmers were to produce greater quantities of each of these last three types of food and were to grow 270 acres of soybeans besides in 1942.2 Goals for 1943 represented a one per cent increase over 1942. Greater quantities of livestock, cheese, skim milk, and vegetable crops were needed for military consumption and shipment under Lend-Lease; more peanuts and fewer soybeans were asked. Seventy-five per cent of the year's food production was allocated to the civilian population of the United States, thirteen per cent to the armed forces, which numbered 7,000,000 at the beginning of 1943, ten per cent to the allies through Lend-Lease, and two per cent to United States territories. Albemarle County was to produce nine per cent more milk, three and five-tenths per cent more eggs, one per cent more sows to farrow, eighty-five per cent more soybeans (contrary to the national pattern), and nine-tenths of one per cent more Irish potatoes.3 As labor on the farms grew scarcer and still further increases in the production of food were necessary, the national goals for 1944 were directed toward better use of land; a higher production per acre and per animal unit, rather than an increase in acreage, was sought. Feed grains and forage crops were to be planted in greater quantities than before; this meant more plantings of alfalfa, legumes, and corn hybrids. Goals for the last year of the war were similar to those of 1944, with again an added increase.4 The beginning of the war found the majority of Albemarle farmers practicing general farming for the cultivation of grains, hay, and pasture crops for dairy herds and beef cattle, hogs, horses, poultry, and sheep. The fruit growers held orchards which provided a substantial portion of the county's agricultural income. Albemarle led the counties of Virginia in peach production, and its annual average crop of Carmens, Elbertas, and Georgia Belles was 170,000 bushels. Several varieties of apples were grown, including Winesaps, Stark's Delicious, Stayman Winesaps, and Albemarle Pippins. Scattered throughout the county were several breeders of beef cattle raising Herefords and Angus. In addition to the dairy farms in the county, two of the larger dairy industries in the state, the Elliott Ice Company and the Monticello Dairy, Incorporated, were located in Charlottesville. About forty per cent of the county was in woodland, a profitable source of forest products.5 The cooperation of the crop farmers, fruit growers, livestock raisers, and dairymen in attaining the goals fixed for each of the war years constitutes a remarkable record. “Is there any single industry in the nation that increased production with similar restrictions and less labor?”, asked T. O. Scott, county agent for the Extension Service in Albemarle. When the men left for the armed services, women assumed unaccustomed farm duties and were frequently seen driving tractors in the fields of the county. Foreign and migratory labor was employed. Trucks, combines, machinery, and tools were shared generously. And trained agriculturists representing various government agencies contributed their specialized knowledge of methods for increasing production.6 Leadership of the Agricultural Agencies Among the first to have conceived the association of farmers and trained agriculturists was Thomas Jefferson, as Claude R. Wickard, Secretary of Agriculture, pointed out in an address on “Thomas Jefferson, Founder of Modern American Agriculture” at the University of Virginia on Founder's Day, April 13, 1944. Jefferson was an advocate of the family-size farm which remained predominant in the county throughout the war years. He favored abolition of primogeniture and entail and held democratic views regarding the disposition of the public domain. In his practice of soil conservation at Monticello, of contour ploughing, rotation of crops, and preservation of soil fertility, he was a forerunner of modern programs for soil conservation. His work toward the exchange of ideas through the Agricultural Society of Albemarle County promoted agricultural research and led to the later development of the Extension Service. His firm belief in the value of educational institutions and the need of applying science to agriculture influenced the establishment of land grant colleges. Indeed, American agriculture as it is practiced in the twentieth century has evolved from these early conceptions and in accordance with the principles of the great liberal thinker to whom this region of Virginia and the world at large owe so much.7 Several active and cooperative agencies, whose programs were intensified under the pressure of war, furnished scientific information and aid to local farmers. The Thomas Jefferson Soil Conservation District, organized in 1939, included Albemarle, Fluvanna, Goochland, Louisa, and Nelson counties. In taking this name for their district Albemarle farmers were not so much going back to Jefferson as, to quote Henry A. Wallace's apt phrase, “catching up to Jefferson.” Officers and members of the technical staff were all employees of the Department of Agriculture who worked with advisory planning boards composed of sixty county farmers and agricultural agents. John A. Smart was conservationist for the district, Earl H. Brunger was soil scientist, E. L. Bradley of Scottsville was district supervisor for Albemarle, Robert O. Anderson was soil conservationist for Albemarle, and William R. White was conservation aid. Conservation experiments begun in the Ivy Creek watershed in the early thirties came under the supervision of the Department of Agriculture in 1935. This work, in addition to that done more recently by the Thomas Jefferson Soil Conservation District, laid foundations for increased production during the war.8 The Agricultural Adjustment Administration continued its prewar function of assisting farmers to produce the needed commodities in the desired quantities at the right time. Those farmers who complied with acreage allotments and endeavored to conserve their soil received agricultural conservation payments. Production goals, marketing quotas, and acreage allotments were submitted to individual farmers, who were free to declare their intentions to conform or not, as they chose. For each of the eighteen communities into which Albemarle was divided, there were five A. A. A. committeemen elected by their neighbors, and each committee was headed by a chairman. The county A. A. A. chairman became chairman of the United States Department of Agriculture Defense Board for Albemarle County, later known as the County War Board, organized at the beginning of the war. In Albemarle County Larned D. Randolph was chairman in 1942 and 1943, Arthur W. Talcott in 1944, and H. T. Wiley in 1945. H. J. Crenshaw served as secretary during the whole period.9 The Farm Security Administration continued, as before the war, to help small farmers improve their productive ability. Through supervision and aid in farm management this agency sought to enable farmers to be self-sustaining. Loans averaging $500 permitted many farm families with low incomes to buy tools, seed, cows, hogs, and chickens. F. S. A. cooperated with the Emergency Feed and Seed Loan Office in Culpeper, a branch of the Farm Credit Administration. Carlyle Crigler and Ina Glick were F. S. A. supervisors for Albemarle County throughout the war.10 Vocational agriculture teachers of the public school system trained many young boys and girls for farm work. From the session of 1939–1940 through 1945–1946, under the direction of R. Claude Graham, superintendent of Albemarle County schools, 695 white pupils and 523 Negro students were taught various agricultural techniques, including how to repair farm machinery. The United States Department of Agriculture's cooperative Extension Service is the farm and home teaching arm of the Department of Agriculture and land grant colleges. Before the war its role was to spread to rural families information concerning most recently approved agricultural methods and projects recommended by the state agricultural colleges—in Virginia, the Virginia Polytechnic Institute at Blacksburg. During the war its leaders informed rural families on such subjects as Victory Gardens and how to grow them, the nutritive value of various foods, the materials needed for the salvage program, the dangers of inflation, methods of fire protection, the necessity of buying war bonds and stamps, and similar war problems. They also corrected rumors, made local inventories of food and feed, and gathered other information for victory. Albemarle County was among the first counties in Virginia to organize both Home Demonstration and 4-H Clubs, sponsored by the Extension Service. In 1942 Albemarle had seventeen Home Demonstration Clubs with a membership of 800 women; its nineteen 4-H Clubs reached a peak membership in 1943 of 1,134 members.11 Many duties which arose from wartime needs were assumed by the staff of the Extension Service in Albemarle County. It consisted of T. O. Scott, county agent since 1927, Mrs. Bessie Dunn Miller, Home Demonstration agent, 1917–1943, Mrs. Ruth Burruss Huff, assistant Home Demonstration agent, 1919–1943, H. M. Brumback, assistant county agent, Conley G. Greer, local farm agent since 1918, Miss Bessie Jones, secretary since 1927, and Miss Jeanne Fournier, assistant secretary. The quality of the late Mrs. Bessie Dunn Miller's work and her character have been commemorated in the establishment of the Bessie Dunn Miller Center for Cancer Prevention, which was founded in 1945 through the joint efforts of the Albemarle Home Demonstration Committee, headed by the late Mrs. C. Nelson Beck, the University of Virginia Hospital, and the Albemarle County Medical Society. Upon Mrs. Miller's death late in 1943, Mrs. Huff succeeded her as Home Demonstration agent. Under Mrs. Huff's direction hundreds of children were influenced to become interested in making their homes liveable and in fulfilling the duties of citizenship. A notable result of 4-H Club leadership was the fact that during the war juvenile delinquency was not evident among its members. Through Mrs. Huff's initiative the 4-H Club County Camp, the first of its kind in Virginia, was established in 1941 with the aid of the late Dr. L. G. Roberts, chairman of the Board of Supervisors, County Executive Henry A. Haden, and a contribution of $1,000 from the Albemarle Terracing Association. Classes taught in the camp centered around wartime needs and included First Aid, avoidance of food waste, canning, soil conservation, gardening, storage of root crops, and forestry. The assistant Home Demonstration agent in 1944 and 1945 was Miss Isabelle Price. In addition to her regular work as secretary to the Extension staff, Miss Jones's activities during the war included procuring gardening information for rural families, collecting foods for the canning center, distributing information about methods of conserving foods, assisting hundreds of county residents in filling out applications for gasoline and sugar rations, helping to secure labor to harvest crops, and obtaining permits for construction of buildings on farm property.12 Conducting the program of the Extension Service to the individual farm was the County Board of Agriculture, composed of ninety members who included the county agent and his assistant, Home Demonstration agents, the chairman and co-chairman of each of the fifteen communities into which the county was for this purpose divided, and officials of various farm organizations. Women were admitted to the County Board of Agriculture for the first time in 1942 when the Home Demonstration Clubs began to be represented. In connection with Extension Service volunteer leader work, the county was divided into eighty-two neighborhoods of ten to fifteen families each. Supplementing the peacetime machinery of the County Board of Agriculture, the County War Board was created to handle such special problems as rationing of farm machinery, investigations for farm labor deferments, and coordination of the work of the various Federal and state organizations represented in Albemarle. It consisted of representatives from the Soil Conservation Service, Virginia State Forestry Service, Farm Security Administration, Farm Credit Administration, and the Extension Service. Its chairman was the county chairman of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. First known as a Defense Board, it began to function in July, 1941. It was disbanded in 1946 after Selective Service was discontinued.13 Albemarle Orchards and Farm Labor The shortage of labor created by the war was a major problem which beset the farmer. Even in the summer of 1942 it was necessary to take steps for the provision of a sufficient number of workers to harvest the crops. A movement to recruit school children was started, and twenty-eight students from Charlottesville schools enrolled. Chesley A. Haden of Crozet and others hired 500 workers from Georgia and North Carolina to pick fruit. The Farm Security Administration set up a labor camp on the Hunter Ballard property for these laborers. Describing the 350 workers imported from Georgia, Chesley A. Haden said: “Carson, a burly Negro, the leader of the group, had a picturesque method of enforcing discipline. He gathered them all round the dinner table, got out a yard long knife, laid it beside him on the table, gave them orders, and they did not shirk from that time until they left. It is my belief that our native mountain labor is far more satisfactory for our labor camps than any labor that we can get from the deep south, or that we can expect to get through the Employment Service. We have been spoiled about labor, for there is no doubt that the native mountaineer is far better than any labor we can hope to get through the present set-up of the government employment service.” On the whole, this labor camp was considered a success, since it saved thousands of bushels of peaches. Its presence, however, was not unaccompanied by problems. Disease was one. Another was that many more trucks were required to get the workers home than to bring them northward, as they had accumulated a great many possessions while they were here.14 An exodus of men into the armed services or war industries so depleted farm labor by 1943 that a cry of protest went up all over the country. An Albemarle farmer, father of two boys in the Navy, echoed this outcry in The Daily Progress when he commented, “Observing our local conditions and press reports, we are headed undoubtedly for short crops unless draft of farm help ceases immediately.”15 The Extension Service made a study of available labor on Virginia farms and found that there was twenty per cent less than in 1942. Through questionnaires sent to 2,000 Albemarle County farms, H. M. Brumback found that 545 additional workers were needed from January through March, 765 from April through June, 3,590 from July through September, and 1,960 from October through December. A County Farm Labor Committee was appointed by the County War Board to coordinate the effort of local agencies in recruiting and supplying farm labor needed in the county. Working together with it to maintain the labor supply were the Extension Service, the local United States Employment Service office, the Farm Security Administration, the county and city superintendents of schools, the Lions Club farm labor and Kiwanis Club agriculture committees appointed at the request of the Central Virginia Planning Commission, and the Chamber of Commerce. Representatives from these groups recommended to Governor Colgate W. Darden, Jr., that deferred agricultural workers should be presented an emblem in recognition of their status as laborers engaged in essential war production. Late in 1942 a new policy for the guidance of Selective Service Boards in deferring essential farm labor was approved by the Department of Agriculture, the War Manpower Commission, and farm organizations. It provided for the deferment of all agricultural workers who were responsible for sixteen war units of necessary products or, under exceptional circumstances, even fewer units. A war unit represented a measure of these products, for examples, one milch cow, five acres of corn, or one acre of vegetables for canning. The Daily Progress regarded this system as another of the astonishing absurdities which the government sought to put into practice. The unit system did not, in its opinion, seem to be a practical method of evaluating the potentialities of a farm hand. What was needed, it argued, was the kind of farm laborer who could and would give an honest day's work at a wage within which he could live and which his employer could afford to pay. “There seems to be no more reason to test him by these units of production than ... to have him produce those of his public school record.”16 Despite the editor's adverse opinion, the unit system actually proved to be locally an equitable and adaptable system for assuring the deferment of qualified agricultural workers. In an effort to apply it fairly, the minimum number of sixteen war units of farm products was lowered to twelve in reference to registrants who worked on the steeper and less productive farms of the county; but the minimum remained sixteen for the more nearly level farms of the community. In order to relieve the situation of dairy farmers whose labor supply was most seriously depleted, dairy hands were given a preferred claim, exceeding even that of other farm workers, upon deferment under Selective Service. Conscientious objectors were employed on dairy farms by the Albemarle County Dairy Herd Improvement Association, but there was only one of these at a time. Volunteer city workers who could devote full or part time to the harvesting of crops were asked to register in May, 1943, by the Central Virginia Planning Commission in cooperation with the county agent. R. Watson Sadler, chairman of this Commission's Farm Labor Committee, was assisted by subcommittees from the Lions Club and the Young Men's Business Club. Wives of the members of these subcommittees, together with the High School Victory Corps, were acting as registrars. Eugene P. Durrette began work as a farm labor assistant in July of 1943 and placed 683 persons for seasonal work and thirty-seven for the full year. Though all demands for workers were not fully met, early freezes and drought that year somewhat reduced the fruit crops and other harvests, thus permitting a meager labor supply to complete the work of gathering in the available produce. The following year, 1944, when weather conditions were favorable and fruit crops abundant, the demand for labor was even greater. Between 2,000 and 2,300 workers were needed for the peach crop, between 1,200 and 1,500 for the apples. Fruit growers recruited anyone and everyone. On the seventh of August 260 German prisoners arrived in Crozet. Approximately 240 of them picked peaches and apples, filled silos, harvested hay, shucked corn, cut pulpwood, and sawed logs. D. B. Owen, manager of the Crozet Fruit Growers Cooperative, was active in organizing their work, which, he observed, was satisfactory on the whole. Occasional peaches branded with a swastika or the initials PW were taken from the conveyor belts in packing houses. “It's exactly the same thing as a 15-year-old thumbing his nose at you,” said Chesley Haden. “Those Germans are some of the crack troops of the North African campaign—fine physical specimens—and they're a little rebellious at times. We have noted a mixed reaction to their work; some growers say they're all right, and others say they're worthless.” Though not all of their employers were satisfied with their production, the overall statistical record of their work belied any merely prejudiced contention that the German prisoners were worthless as farm laborers. At the end of four months they had picked 29,803 bushels of peaches, 133,858 bushels of apples, stacked 370,962 board feet of lumber, shucked 906 barrels of corn, cut 74,113 board feet of saw logs and 105 cords of pulpwood, pruned 450 peach trees, and done 22,794 hours of general farm work.17 Negroes from the Bahama Islands were hired in accordance with an agreement between the United States and British governments. In August, 1944, 285 Bahamians picked and packed Albemarle County peaches; through October 175 of them harvested apples. H. L. Dunton, D. A. Tucker, and Marvin J. Powell supervised their work, which was judged excellent. The British accent of the Bahamians was noticeable to those who worked with them, and their fondness for bright dress and zoot suits added color to the harvest scene. Without their aid fruit valued at $525,000 would not have been picked. “Importing labor and operating a labor camp is an expensive business,” said County Agent Scott, “but the expense was much less than the loss to the nation of essential fruit which could not have been saved otherwise.”18 The critical labor shortage in that banner year for local orchards was partially alleviated by recruits of yet another picturesque kind. Seventy-five volunteers of the Women's Land Army—college students, teachers, business women, and others—went into the peach orchards and packing sheds. Though comparatively few in number, inexperienced in physical labor, and previously ignorant of the discomfort which peach fuzz can produce, they learned quickly the techniques of picking, grading, and packing the fruit. Soon they had won the respect of their employers. Mrs. Ruth Burruss Huff arranged with the White Hall Home Demonstration Club women, under the leadership of their president, Mrs. L. G. Roberts, to serve as hostesses to the Women's Land Army. They turned out in full strength to greet these women upon their arrival. Refreshments were served. Mrs. T. O. Scott, chairman of the Albemarle Home Demonstration Committee, welcomed them. Ann and Patricia Odend'Hal, who had been active in 4-H Club work for the past ten years, served as dieticians for these peach packers, some of whom were accommodated in private homes and others at the Afton Hotel. “If it came to rating the various peach pickers, I'd put the girls first, the Bahamians second, and the Germans last,” Chesley Haden declared. “Those Germans may be gorgeous hunks of men, but they're not much when it comes to picking peaches.” Agreeing with this rating, T. O. Scott added that the Women's Land Army, which assisted in packing peaches from August 7 to 19, proved more satisfactory than any other special laborers. “Growers who were fortunate enough to secure their help have praised them highly as intelligent, efficient, and willing workers,” he said.19 In addition to the previously mentioned groups, men, women, and children, recruited through Charlottesville civic clubs, radio station WCHV, The Daily Progress, and the Chamber of Commerce, worked during the peach harvest for purely patriotic reasons. Also gathering farm crops and fruit were fifteen prisoners of the Crozet Convict Camp, without whom much corn and hay would in all probability not have been gotten safely into silos.20 Farmers and fruit growers were still in need of labor in 1945. Local Extension Service officials received 911 requests for help, and one or more workers were placed on some 292 farms in the county. The total number of farm labor placements for 1945 was 4,592. In cooperation with the War Food Administration and under the supervision of Hunter Ballard, a camp was again set up near Crozet for 133 Bahamian peach pickers. Percy Abell organized the 200 prisoners of war who harvested fruit, as well as the seventy-five who worked on farms throughout the year. In the fall of 1945 resolutions were adopted by the Albemarle County Farm Bureau and the Crozet Fruit Growers Cooperative asking that the domestic migratory labor, foreign labor, and prisoners of war labor programs be continued through the next year. Funds available from the War Manpower Commission and the War Food Administration were to be exhausted by January 1, 1946, the War Department planned to halt the hiring of prisoners as farm laborers, and discharged servicemen and war workers were in most instances not returning immediately to the fields. So the farm labor shortage was not relieved promptly after firing ceased. Nevertheless, Albemarle County orchardists managed to keep pace with other American farmers in producing larger quantities of “foods for victory” during the war years of generally favorable weather. Never before had they nursed their trees with such care, though at times nothing less than genuine genius was required if scarce but essential insecticides were to be on hand when needed. The number of trees they tended actually declined—slightly in the case of peaches, markedly in the instance of apples—but they had to find more bushel baskets and packing crates, which became nearly as scarce as the proverbial hens' teeth, almost every year. Prophets of doom who were positive that each bumper crop in turn could not be duplicated the next year had to eat crow annually, the single exception of any consequence being that they had the satisfaction of seeing the weather become in 1943 a fruit grower's gremlin with results disastrous to peaches and quite harmful to apples. A hard freeze late in the spring and a severe hailstorm early in the summer of 1945 brought forth a rash of local predictions that production that year would not exceed ten per cent of normal. But someone evidently forgot in that busy year of victory to inform Mother Nature that less was expected of her in Albemarle County. A few months later orchardists' joy over the Japanese surrender was tempered with worry over the question whether the drooping limbs of their trees, laden with another bumper crop of unprecedented or almost unprecedented quantity and quality, could continue to support the weight of the fruit until it could be picked. Official figures compiled by the Department of Agriculture summarize eloquently the epic saga of Albemarle County fruit growers' victory over the multitudinous enemies of greater food production. 1940 1945 Apples Number of farms reporting 1,011 1,168 Number of trees of all ages 356,626 286,555 Number of bushels harvested 583,580 828,952 Value $390,999 $1,616,456 Peaches Number of farms reporting 541 758 Number of trees of all ages 288,403 282,034 Number of bushels harvested 229,026 534,067 Value $240,477 $1,388,574 The volume of apples produced was increased by fifty per cent and their value by 200 per cent; the value of the peach crop was multiplied by six while its bulk was merely doubled. The sharp distinctions between volume and value revealed by these contrasts point to the delusion which was implicit but hidden in the illusion of apparent prosperity. Only if the orchardists faced the fact that every thing and every service they bought cost more, that dollars which came in relatively copious quantities had declined in purchasing power in inverse ratio to the rising dollar value of their product, would they lift the veil of understanding. By so doing they could expose the deceitful disguise of glittering gilt which masked a boom not truly golden. Like the beauty of a face camouflaged with too many cosmetics, such inflationary prosperity was not deep-seated and probably would not prove to be lasting. The significant feature of their wartime experience was, therefore, to be found in the trustworthy fact that they vastly increased the physical bulk of their production of very tangible and very desperately needed foods. Where one apple or one peach had been harvested before, they contrived to pick one and one-half apples or two peaches. When the nation and the world needed more fruit, the farmers of Albemarle County did their share—and more—to make it available.21 Rationing and Price Control Another problem for the farmer was the shortage of farm machinery. When war was declared, producers of food were advised to buy repair parts for their equipment during the first months of 1942, and many farmers followed this wise counsel. When, late in that year, farm machinery began to be rationed, with some seventy-five types of machines being doled out carefully when they were available, members of the local Farm Machinery Rationing Committee and the County War Board applied quotas to insure a just distribution of such items as could be obtained. In 1943, as a matter of national policy, munitions were granted priority over food production equipment. As a result only forty percent as much farm machinery as had been manufactured in the nation in 1940 left the factories three years later. The same conditions, or worse, prevailed in 1944, and there was no improvement in 1945.22 As the production of food increased each war year, the problem of marketing was intensified. The Extension Service assisted the Albemarle Dairymen's Association, the Albemarle Feeder Calf Producers Association, the Albemarle Wool Pool (affiliated with the United Wool Growers Association), the Virginia Angus Breeders Association, and the Albemarle Hereford Association in determining correct grades for their products, the demand for them, and the best methods of marketing them. The total value of supplies bought and farm products marketed by these groups in Albemarle County during 1944 was $449,670. The establishment of a farmers' produce market in Charlottesville was discussed, but no successful action was taken.23 Price ceilings, the capstone of the arch erected by the nation to hold back disastrous inflation, were sometimes restrictive enough to cause temporary bottlenecks in the flow of agricultural produce to market. Seventy-five members of the Albemarle County Farm Bureau, which was formed in June, 1943, to promote farmers' interests, met to discuss the possible effect on farmers of the closing of the Elliott Ice Company's abattoir department, the only slaughterhouse in the community. The Albemarle livestock raisers seized upon this opportunity to air their grievances concerning other Office of Price Administration and War Food Administration regulations, such as the fact that hogs were bringing twenty cents more per hundred pounds in Staunton and Orange, Virginia, than on the Charlottesville market. No explanation was given: O. P. A. officials insisted that they were specialists in other fields or had been with the O. P. A. such a short time that they were prepared to discuss only the abattoir issue.24 A ceiling price of 5.75 cents per pound or $2.76 per forty-eight pound package (slightly less than the normal fifty-pound bushel) on apples at point of shipment was announced in October, 1943. Price advances of approximately eighteen cents each which were to become effective on November 1, December 1, February 1, and April 1 would enable growers to sell their apples in April, 1944, at $3.48 per forty-eight pound package. This encouraged most orchardists to store as many of their apples as possible until the ceilings reached the announced peak. To protect itself, the government reserved the right to buy apples for the armed forces at any time it chose. Retail ceilings for apples ranged from 9.5 to 10.5 cents per pound, varying with the distances they had been shipped from producing areas. These ceilings were also to advance one-half cent per pound on November 1, December 1, February 1, and April 1.25 Government purchases of apples were made in Albemarle County both before and during the war. In 1941 the Surplus Marketing Administration was buying apples in an attempt to improve distribution by preventing a glutted market. A price range of seventy cents to $1.05 per bushel was then offered by this agency for No. 1 grade apples. In October, 1944, the War Food Administration announced plans for the purchase of a large quantity of apples in the four-state Appalachian Area, which included Albemarle County, for Lend-Lease shipment to Great Britain and other European countries. For 2 to 2.25 inch apples the price offered was $6.75 a barrel, $2.25 a box. Growers in this locality were satisfied with the price set by the W. F. A., but the Appalachian Apple Growers, Inc., protested the government offer at a level below the price ceiling of $2.75, arguing that it might break the domestic market. It was understood, however, that the domestic market would have priority if the crop could be absorbed above the prices offered by the W. F. A. The export program would receive only that part of the crop not sold at home to equal or better advantage. Under this W. F. A. program twenty carloads of Albemarle County apples were sold by November 8. Offers were filed with the Winchester, Virginia, office of the W. F. A., which accepted the apples packed in “export tub” bushel baskets.26 In 1943 No. 1 grade peaches brought $8.50 a bushel, the highest price ever offered by Crozet brokers. Twenty-four peach growers of Albemarle and surrounding counties met in February, 1944, when a ceiling price for peaches was under consideration, and approved unanimously the work already done by the two-year-old National Peach Council. They voted to continue to give it their support. The local growers asked first, in dealing with O. P. A., for no ceilings, because the extreme perishability of peaches made marketing controls or delay of any kind hazardous. If it were found that ceilings had to be applied, the growers asked a “consumer” ceiling of 12.5 cents per pound, the same figure requested by apple growers nationally in the fall of 1943. The price ceiling set in July, 1944, for producers was $3.66 per bushel and $1.99 per half bushel, equivalent to about $7.50 a bushel at the consumer level. In the same month the Virginia Peach Council, which was to become a part of the National Peach Council, was organized when two dozen or more leading peach growers of the Middle Piedmont met in Charlottesville. Its object was to develop united action in trying to solve such problems as labor, packaging, relations with government officials in Washington, and the creation of increased consumer demand for their fruit, particularly in future years which might be threatened by a glutted market.27 Soil Conservation and Livestock Production Despite labor shortages, the rationing of farm machinery, marketing difficulties, and complicated price changes, a general upward trend in food production was achieved. This was due in part to changes in agricultural practices. One significant local development was the increase in pasture land acreage during the last year or two of the war. The following figures show that in 1945 acreage for pastures was double that of 1942: Year Acres in Cropland Acres in Orchard Acres in Pasture 1942 85,823.8 12,468.4 43,436.6 1943 87,056.1 12,403.1 44,940.1 1944 90,930.8 11,727.5 47,587.5 1945 103,154.0* * Acres in cropland and orchard combined. 103,154.0* 86,906.628 Not only were there more pastures, but their quality was improved. Greater quantities of lime and superphosphate were used during the first two years of the war than in previous years, and still more in 1944. By 1945 twice as much fertilizer as in preceding years was applied on many farms, resulting in a high yield per acre. Each year extensive plantings of winter legumes, rye grass, and alfalfa were made, permitting longer grazing seasons and shorter barn feeding periods.29 Conservationist John A. Smart estimated that 55,000 acres in Albemarle had been submitted to conservation practices, to which a twenty per cent increase in production might be attributed. Some fifteen per cent of the county was engaged in carrying out terracing and strip cropping in 1944. The soil of two of the farms once owned by Jefferson, “Tufton” and “Shadwell,” was being restored.30 A striking example of these practices is the story of transformations made on H. V. Herold's farm, “Holkham,” near Ivy. Aside from the sheer beauty of the harmonious contours of this farm, here was demonstrated what can be achieved when man respects the soil instead of taking all it can offer while giving it back nothing in return. Ninety of Herold's 220 acres were uncultivated in 1936, the year his practice of soil conservation was begun. Slopes were bare and, in consequence, badly eroded. Rows of corn were planted “up and down.” Lespedeza and peas alone comprised the hay crops; none of the hay was fertilized. Land used for pasture was in great part overrun with saw-briars and broomsedge. Stock could be grazed, therefore, only five months each year, and the owner was compelled annually to buy about $400 worth of hay. His cows required large amounts of grain, which was not raised on his farm, so that he was forced to buy his entire supply of dairy feed grain. When the United States entered the war, he had been practicing scientific farming for six years. Consequently, he was in a position to make heavy demands of his soil, while at the same time he was able to conserve its value. Trees had been planted on his hillsides to prevent the soil from washing away under heavy rains; fields were strip cropped instead of gullied; planting rows followed the natural contours of the land; minimum loss of topsoil was incurred; annual harvests increased amazingly. One acre of corn planted in land thus properly utilized produced as much as four or five acres had previously brought forth. One third of the pastures were fertilized every year. Alfalfa was planted to replace broomsedge on five acres, and the barns were full of hay by June of each of the war years. By 1945 the owner was growing a large part of the grains needed by his herds: he was harvesting some 1,500 bushels of oats from thirty acres and about fifteen tons of corn per acre for silage. Because of these better farming techniques—and also, admittedly, because of a substantial rise in prices—the income received from his milk production quadrupled between 1936 and 1945.31 The touring author of an article on the advantages of soil conservation which was published in a nationally circulated magazine soon after the war ended observed that rural Virginia was having its face lifted by scientific farming practices. In Albemarle County this traveler found an ardent and quotable convert to the new agricultural “Holkham,” the H. V. Herold farm near Ivy, is a model of soil conservation. Richard Overton and his wife, soil conservationists, display a war product. order in the person of S. A. Jessup. Impressed with Jessup's excellent pastures and purebred Guernseys, the visitor was told that Jessup had redeemed lands once so exhausted that one “couldn't even raise a disturbance” on them. The proud livestock grower added, “I'd just as soon raise polecats on my farm as corn or tobacco.”32 A greater quantity and better quality of beef cattle were raised in Albemarle during the years 1942–1943 than previously due to the extension of pasture lands and to the greater care which was given to the breeding of stock and the control of parasites and diseases. In the winter of 1943–1944 a government hay-subsidy program was carried out to compensate for the effects of the 1943 drought. Production of beef cattle was thereby maintained at a high level. In the summer of 1944 another drought brought a decline in hay and pasture production, and heavy rains in the fall also damaged the hay crops along the James River. Nevertheless, the output for the county was higher than during preceding years. T. O. Scott estimated that some farms had as much as four times as many animal units as in previous years. So great an expansion in cattle production had its repercussions. One of these was that marketing facilities, which had been adequate in 1940, were inadequate in 1944.33 Livestock production ranked third in importance as a source of income to Albemarle County farmers by 1943. Auction sales of feeder calves were begun in 1941. Prior to 1939 calves had been raised on a hit or miss basis, but after new methods of feeding were adopted, as suggested by the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and the Albemarle Feeder Calf Producers Association was organized, the business rose in importance. The sale in October, 1941, brought in a total of $14,832.00 for 290 calves; the following year 476 calves sold for $30,000.00.34 Not the least enthusiastic among the livestock raisers of the county were 4-H Club boys, both white and Negro, who carried out livestock projects during each of the war years and competed in contests sponsored by Sears Roebuck and Company. At the Angus sale in the spring of 1944 calves raised by these boys won favorable attention. Some of these schoolboys built up herds of their own: others fattened only one or two animals for the market. While the number of their cattle was only a small part of the total production in the county, the real importance of this work, directed mainly by H. M. Brumback, lay in the training and experience gained by a generation which might become the future cattle, hog, and poultry raisers of the locality.35 A comparison between the cattle raised in Albemarle County and their value in the years 1940 and 1945 shows a marked increase. 1940 1945 Farms reporting 1,974 1,970 Number of cattle and calves 16,779 22,576 Value $633,540 $1,613,04036 Advancing in step with the agronomy program, the dairy industry benefitted from the general improvement and expansion of pasture lands which permitted longer grazing seasons. As methods of breeding dairy cattle were perfected and disease and parasites were controlled, milk production rose during each of the war years until 1945. Shortages of labor, farm machinery, and protein supplements explained the slight decline of that year. A total of 3,119,606 gallons was produced in 1945, however, as compared with 2,593,668 in 1940, and the value of dairy products sold in the county rose from $282,590 in 1940 to $518,925 in 1945.37 An increase of nearly 2,000 hogs in Albemarle County between 1940 and 1945 may not have been surprising. Residents of Sixth Street, S. E., in Charlottesville, who seemed as interested in producing “food for victory” as their fellow citizens of the county, petitioned the City Council for the extension of hog-raising zones so they might fulfil their patriotic obligations. Pig pens on the back side of their lots would not be near their neighbors, they argued. City Health Director T. S. Englar admitted that, although hogs normally do not enhance a city's peace and cleanliness, they might have to be excused during the emergency. “After all,” he said, “there are swine in some sections already and, conditions remaining the same, a pig near Rugby Road is little different from his cousin in Belmont.” As long as rules of decency and everyday sanitation were observed, styes were kept a reasonable distance from kitchen doors, and winds held their proper direction, the doctor supposed that the hog in the yard movement might not be too objectionable. Faced for the third time with the issue, the City Council finally voted that hogs might be kept in the city limits only if their pens were more than 250 feet from the nearest dwelling and if their location was approved by the Chief of Police. The required distance automatically eliminated from conversion to pork production all but a few lots within the city. At the time, in February, 1942, there were sixty-seven hog owners in the city. Their number could hardly be much enlarged under the new ordinance, but city dwellers who dreamed of fat porkers in their back yards would probably have forced an immediate reconsideration of the question if they had foreseen the price advances which were later to make them recall with acute nostalgia that they had been able even after Pearl Harbor to buy a pound of bacon for twenty-six cents and two pounds of fresh spareribs for less than forty cents.38 Although there was only an inconsequentially small increase during the war years in Albemarle County's sheep population, their value rose from $21,362 to $37,365—a pair of figures which provides an eloquent commentary on the wartime price spiral. The increase from 3,568 sheep in 1940 to 3,764 in 1945 might have been greater but for such factors as the difficulties of procuring wire for fencing, the omnipresent labor shortage, and fear of predatory dogs. There was more improvement in the quality than in the quantity of local sheep, largely because of efficient control of internal parasites and vigilant prevention of disease.39 Poultry was still another product of Albemarle County farms which enlisted in the war effort. When all other edible meats except fish were rationed, poultry took on new significance, and eggs were also in unprecedented demand. Home Demonstration agents and 4-H Club leaders gave invaluable help to owners of small flocks as well as to commercial producers of fryers, broilers, eggs, and turkeys. Nearly every farm in the county had its poultry flock. Perfected methods of feeding, housing, and culling were adopted; parasites were effectively controlled. Scott contrasted the heavy losses of diseased fowl which were annually incurred during the earlier part of his eighteen years of experience in Albemarle County with the decreased mortality of the war years. Prevention of disease, in his opinion, contributed in large measure to the increased production of poultry called for in the local market and by the War Food Administration. The Department of Agriculture determined that the 88,360 chickens in the county in 1940 were valued at $50,365, while the 115,411 chickens in 1945 were worth $139,647. In other words, their value was increased by 180 per cent, though their number was increased only thirty per cent—again a significant commentary on what happened to the purchasing power of the American dollar despite price control. Income from all poultry products sold by farms reporting to the department increased from $147,737 to $375, 658 during the same five years. Official statistics of the Department of Agriculture have reported that the total income to Albemarle County farmers from sales of all types of livestock and livestock products rose from $815,087 in 1940 to $1,813,736 in 1945. The total value of all livestock classified by the Department increased during the same period from $1,313,163 to $2,383,810. Because of wartime restrictions upon transportation, the urgency of the nation's need for the marketing of available meat, and a desire to accommodate Charlottesville's “country cousins” of Albemarle County, the City Council had rescinded its prewar ordinance prohibiting the overnight storage of livestock within the city limits. This action had benefitted the Charlottesville Livestock Market and the producers who brought their animals to it for sale by auctions which sometimes extended far into the night. Whether the animals had been sold or not, it was often impossible to remove them from the city before they disturbed would-be sleepers of the vicinity. After V-J Day long-suffering residents of the area demanded a reenactment of the prewar ordinance.40 More than a year elapsed before a generally agreeable solution to the problem was reached. The city purchased the auction site, and the Livestock Market was relocated beyond the city limits. But that is really a postwar story, and its details are not for this volume. Victory Gardening and Food Conservation Vegetables were grown in Charlottesville and Albemarle during the years 1942–1945 on a scale never before remotely approached. The County Board of Agriculture launched the Victory Garden campaign in the first months of 1942. Community and neighborhood leaders and Home Demonstration Clubs promoted the Live at Home program among 2,367 rural families, a large majority of the total number of farm families in the county. Mrs. Bessie Dunn Miller and her staff gave personal instruction to 249 families in 1943, teaching them how to produce sufficient food to meet all the demands of home consumption. Spurred on by the slogans “Food Fights For Freedom” and “You Can Shorten the War with Food,” ninety-six per cent of the rural population was raising its home food supply in 1944. Quite active in this movement were the 4-H Club boys and girls. In the course of 1942 they cultivated 321 acres of land. An average of thirty girls took part in the Sears Roebuck gardening contests every year of the war. Some $700 worth of food was consumed in the homes of these thirty girls in 1943 alone. Louise Morris of Free Union, first prize winner in 1944, produced enough food to feed her family and can 504 quarts. Edith Sullivan, also of Free Union, winner in 1945, produced enough food to can 940 quarts. Though the boys were engaged for the greater part of their time in livestock raising projects, as many as seventy-three of them completed gardening projects in 1943. Maxine Lamb, president of the Albemarle County 4-H Club Council in 1944, won a $25 war bond and entered the 4-H Club National Victory Achievement Contest for her contribution in food production during 1943. On the 379-acre farm of her parents, Mr. and Mrs. John Lamb of Route 2, Charlottesville, she planted her own Victory Garden, which consisted of 150 tomato plants, 200 sweet potato plants, twenty-four pepper plants, twenty-four eggplants, twenty celery plants, plus corn and string beans. She assisted her father with the planting and working of 3,000 tomato plants, 1,500 cabbage plants, and 1,000 sweet potato plants. She fed and cared for 500 baby chickens, raised pigs of her own, helped her oldest brother with the feeding of fourteen calves until they were old enough to graze, and assisted the hired hands in milking 118 cows. She picked twenty gallons of blackberries, prepared thirty-five quarts of them for her pantry shelves and assisted with the canning of ninety-five other quarts, and helped to put up 183 quarts of string beans, fifteen quarts of carrots, twenty-five quarts of squash, and thirty quarts of butter beans. She served ninety meals and planned 150 other menus for her family, remodeled five of her old dresses, helped clean and wash the family clothes weekly, collected old phonograph records, tin cans, scrap metals, and rubber, and helped to sell war stamps through her school and club. Three members of the Albemarle 4-H Clubs, selected for outstanding club work in the county, appeared on the coast-to-coast broadcast of the United States Department of Agriculture's National Farm and Home Hour in the spring of 1944 and told how they were carrying on Jefferson's traditions in agriculture. The trio included Maxine Lamb, Dan Maupin of White Hall, and Anne Carpenter White of Scottsville. Their subject was, “Four-H Builds on Foundations Laid by Jefferson.” Two Albemarle County girls were declared 4-H Club canning champions for Virginia, Bessie Preddy in 1943 and Maxine Lamb in 1944. Members of the Negro 4-H Clubs made a profit of $1,471 from vegetables raised by seventy-three boys in 1942; in the course of the last war year, ninety-nine Negro boys completed 120 gardening projects which netted a profit of $2,100.41 Under the direction of the Charlottesville and Albemarle County Civilian Defense Council, Coordinator Seth Burnley formed a Victory Garden Committee for the city of Charlottesville on March 10, 1942. Louis Chauvenet was chairman; Mrs. Theodore Hough and Mrs. Leroy Snow served as committee members. Among the first steps taken in the Charlottesville campaign were successful efforts made by Mrs. Dudley C. Smith to procure for amateur gardeners who aspired to green thumbs vacant lots and available plows, each of which, of course, had suddenly been exalted to the lofty status of being at a premium. Mrs. Snow encouraged gardeners by supplying plants in return for a share in their produce. Thus were many city gardeners provided with land, tools, and plants. Mrs. Hough, an accomplished horticulturist, provided what amounted to an education for the inexperienced urban vegetable growers. Chairman Chauvenet and Mrs. Hough visited in person every city garden once each week throughout the summer of 1942. Twice a week she broadcast advice on gardening from radio station WCHV. Every Monday afternoon she held a forum at the Court House. Occasionally she addressed the civic clubs in the city and the Parent-Teacher Association. In March, 1943, she began to write a column which was published in The Daily Progress. Through this medium she dispensed pertinent suggestions about how to grow vegetables and how to avoid unproductively torturing one's aching back, for backaches had become the most common ailment all over town. Victory Gardening fever, a symptom which preceded sore knees and spinal columns which could be straightened up only with pain, was quite contagious. One insight into the amazing rapidity with which it infected all areas of the city is afforded by the fact that Charlottesville had a quota of 2,800 vegetable gardens in 1944 and by the impression of Victory Gardening leaders, who never found time to take an actual census of plots cultivated, that the quota was definitely exceeded. Meantime, various other groups in the city promoted the Victory Garden campaign. Among these was a Children's Victory Garden Club, the first of its kind in the state, organized in the spring of 1942 and co-sponsored by the City Recreation Department and the Rivanna Garden Club, the latter of which furnished land, tools, seeds, and prizes. Miss Nan Crow and Mrs. Delos Kidder planned and personally directed gardens near Moore's Creek on the Monticello Road. Boys and girls tilled twenty garden plots there, raising vegetables for their families and for the Children's Home. They gained a valuable experience in the rudiments of gardening and learned surprising things. One of them expected to find his ripened radishes tied in bunches and waving on a bush! Boy Scouts, white and Negro, undertook and completed garden projects. Troop 1 at the University Baptist Church cultivated some seven acres of land on Route 29. The boys of the downtown Troop 1, sponsored by the Charlottesville Presbyterian Church, worked as many as twenty-two gardens of their own. Troop 5, sponsored by the Church of the Holy Comforter, cultivated a large garden in the Fry's Spring area. Negro Scouts' garden projects were carried out on the farm of their leader, Dr. J. A. Jackson.42 The city's first Victory Garden Fair was held at the Old Armory in the autumn of 1943. Vegetable and flower growers who had proudly entered 300 or more specimens of their handiwork inspected the exhibits of vegetables, fruits, canned goods, and flowers with the green eyes of jealousy whenever they spotted the carefully selected and spotlessly clean products of a rival who might provide stiff competition for whatever prize they coveted. Miss R. Belle Burke, district Home Demonstration agent for Northern Virginia, and Miss Ina Glick, who served as judges, had no easy task choosing the most nearly perfect example of each variety, but their decisions were accepted with general good humor. H. M. Brumback demonstrated easy ways of storing foods and root crops for winter use, and Mrs. Huff explained how to preserve foods by dehydration. Again the next year the Albemarle Garden Club, Rivanna Garden Club, and the National Women's Farm and Garden Club held a Victory Garden and Flower Show, to which the First Methodist Church played host. At the same time the Albemarle Garden Club and the City Recreation Department sponsored a similar contest in Washington Park, and more than 200 exhibits of superb produce were displayed by Negro gardeners.43 If home grown foods were to render maximum service in the war effort, a large percentage of the total production of Victory Gardens had to be preserved for consumption after the harvest season, when fresh local produce was unavailable. Aside from other obvious virtues, such preservation could appreciably alleviate demand for the rationed output of commercial canneries and pressures upon the nation's overburdened transportation system. Much emphasis was, therefore, placed upon persuading and teaching gardeners to lay aside for the rainy day of the unproductive winter season a properly preserved part of their summertime plenty. Local Home Demonstration agents and Club leaders instructed in the most modern techniques and equipment for home canning, though some of their pupils couldn't for years find a pressure cooker for sale at any price. The less familiar but, in the instances of some foods, not less useful methods of food conservation, such as drying, brining, and storing, were also taught and demonstrated. The clubs' members set a good example by canning 56,107 quarts of various foods in 1942. The following year, spurred on by their tireless leaders, 129 farm women had become expert canners and put up 45,420 quarts of fruit and vegetables and stored an additional 9,265 bushels. During the year 1944 rural families canned 56,958 quarts of fruit, meats, and vegetables; brined 7,719 gallons; dried 2,468 pounds; cured 8,975 pounds; stored 3,860 bushels; and froze 9,978 pounds. In the last war year 52,776 quarts of fruits were canned; 2,108 pounds dried; 18,540 pounds cured; 38,144 bushels stored; and 31,783 pounds frozen. Girls of the 4-H Clubs put up 28,106 cans of food in 1943, an average of 51 cans apiece. In 1944 thirty-five of their more diligent members put up 5,271 quarts, an average of about 153 tins or jars per capita. On a somewhat smaller scale in 1945 a total of 10,068 quarts were preserved, maintaining approximately the per capital level of fifty per girl which had been established in 1943. When the local rationing board ruled that a person could not buy home canned foods without the surrender of ration coupons, the County War Board passed a resolution in support of some means whereby people could sell their canned home products without having to ask rationing points.44 Plans for a canning center in Charlottesville were formulated in April of 1943 by the Kiwanis Club and the Central Virginia Planning Commission. It was located in the basement of the New Armory. The Nehi Bottling Company loaned two large pressure cookers. Mrs. John A. Smart served as expert supervisor during the month of June, and Mrs. Fay Barrow took charge during July. A charge of five cents per can or jar covered inspection of the fruit and vegetables grown by city and county women and the right to use the pressure cookers. In a month's time eighty-three women had conserved 5,558 cans of food. Mrs. R. L. Allen alone canned 500 quarts of vegetables and meat, the largest amount put up there by one person. The final record for the first year, 1943, was impressive: within seven months 28,000 jars of home-produced foods had been processed. Expenses had been shared by the City School Board and the City Council, but their burdens had been made light by the $500 which had been donated by the Kiwanis Club. In the same year Negro women had put up 1,081 cans of foods at their canning center in the Jefferson School under the supervision of Miss Laura J. Wyatt and Mrs. Evangeline Jones. The canning center in the Armory had been run at capacity in 1943 processing vegetables, but no fruit had been handled. A drought in June and July, 1944, however, seriously curtailed the vegetable crop. Thus the good providers who frequented the center were enabled to turn to the preserving of fruit, a happy circumstance in view of the bumper peach crop of that summer. Approximately 150 women there preserved 3,000 jars of peaches and an unrecorded number of jars of apples. Coupons for canning sugar were issued in enormous quantities even before the harvest season began. County women received authorizations to buy 364,116 pounds of sugar, and city canners were issued coupons for 281,460 pounds. By V-J Day 55,000 cans of food had been processed in the canning center for consumption at home and abroad. The Scottsville canning center was opened on July 14, 1944, in a cinder block building on the edge of the school grounds which had been erected by the county government and equipped through expenditures of Federal funds. Thomas A. Allison, Agriculture teacher at the Scottsville High School, was from the first the chief promoter of the project, but he was able to enlist the support of the Lions Club of Scottsville. Mrs. Inez Moore of Warren, who was in charge of the canning center, was assisted by Rufus Rush. During the first season a charge of three cents each was made to canners for pint tin cans obtained at the center; the charge for quart cans was four cents. After the first summer and autumn the costs of fuel used in the center had to be met by the local community, and tin became more expensive, so these prices for cans were raised to four and six cents, respectively. During 1944 the thrifth housewives of the community prepared 19,854 cans of food at the center. On the busiest day of that year 585 cans were processed. In this period 160 white and 64 Negro families used the canning center. Later years brought increases in these figures. Albemarle County canners from as far away as Crozet converged upon Scottsville, and the center served also many people from neighboring Buckingham and Fluvanna counties. In 1947 a total of 43,930 cans of food were processed in Scottsville by 369 white families and 90 Negro families. When requests from Charlottesville and Albemarle men in the armed forces began to come for chicken, nuts, steak, pork, and fruit cake, the women at the center prepared Christmas packages for mailing before October 15, 1944, in order that local servicemen who were overseas might benefit from home-grown foods and revel in nostalgic feasts especially prepared for them by loved ones at home. Still remembered with particular poignancy is the avid interest and devotion with which the wives and fiancees of some physicians of the 8th Evacuation Hospital could talk of hardly anything else for weeks but what they were canning amid summer heat at the center for their long-absent husbands' and sweethearts' Christmas dinners and how many packages they had already taken to the post office. The United Nations Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Administration asked for a Food Bank in 1945. Mrs. Ruth Burruss Huff called together the heads of all city and county organizations which could give effectual cooperation in gathering and processing food for foreign relief. Choice fruits and vegetables from Victory Gardens all over Charlottesville and Albemarle County were donated by Father and Mother, Son and Daughter. Generous quantities of prized home-grown produce were transported to the canning centers in Charlottesville and Scottsville. Home Demonstration Club women, 4-H Club girls, Red Cross Canteen workers, and other city and county women did the canning. With lumber donated by the Barnes Lumber Company, members of the Young Men's Business Club, of which Harry A. Wright was president, did the packing and crating. A total of 3,000 cans of food was sent to destitute peoples in conquered countries, a gift representing the concerted efforts of the residents of this community.45 Under the direction of the Civilian Defense Office, a local nutrition committee was organized in 1942. At its first meeting a representative from the Farm Security Administration explained the Share-the-Meat program. Home Demonstration women and 4-H Club girls in both county and city studied the nutritive value of foods, how to plan balanced meals, and home methods of baking bread and making cheese. The alarming condition of some children in rural schools who, it was found, often stayed the full school day with no nourishment was improved when seventeen Home Demonstration Clubs cooperated in serving lunches to these children. In two communities 4-H Club girls canned food for the school lunches. By 1945 nutrition problems had diminished, but they still persisted in six of the county schools. Doctors who examined 1,363 school children in Albemarle County in the fall of 1945 found that 1,161 were not in perfect physical condition. When registration for War Ration Book Number 2 began in 1943, Home Demonstration leaders provided information at the registration centers as to the intelligent use of ration points in meal planning and marketing. Typical of rural dietary and economic trends which food rationing had caused or stimulated were these three facts: by the end of the war many families were making their own syrup and raising bees for honey to counteract the sugar shortage; others were making cheese in quantities sufficient for the family food supply; still others were raising and canning more tomatoes to replace citrus fruits.46 Harvesting Forest Fibers Not only the fields but also the forests of Albemarle were made to contribute to winning the war. Sixty farmers cooperated with the Thomas Jefferson Farm Forestry Project operated in conjunction with the Thomas Jefferson Soil Conservation District in Albemarle, Fluvanna, Goochland, Louisa, and Nelson counties. During the year preceding June, 1944, they cut 448,000 cubic feet of pulpwood and 815,000 board feet of sawlogs, all of which went to the war effort. Because they harvested this lumber in accordance with good forestry practices, continued production was assured in the years to come. The same areas would produce the same amount of wood every year. In the fall of 1944 a power-driven, labor saving saw was introduced into the county as a result of the acute labor shortage and the importance of lumber and its derivatives in war industries. Within a given time this new equipment could accomplish the work of about ten men. Farmers were urged in the winter of 1944 to use their spare time until spring for the harvesting of pulpwood on their lands. The condition of the pulpwood industry was critical, and pulp and paper mills were faced with the possibility of closing unless production was increased. In April, 1945, it was estimated that 2,000 cords of pulpwood were being shipped out of the county each month, thirty-five to forty per cent of which were being contributed by individual, non-commercial harvesters. War materials made from wood fiber—besides all varieties of paper and paper containers—included aviators vests, bomb rings, camouflage nets, first-aid kits, gas mask filters, hospital wadding, maps, photographic film, smokeless powder, and supply parachutes. Arrangements were made through Ellis L. Lyon, farm forester of the Virginia Forest Service, in cooperation with the Albemarle County Pulpwood Committee to move wood to market in trucks. The Forest Fire Fighters Service was created by the local Civilian Defense Council to assist the fire control forces of state and Federal forest protection agencies, which were finding it difficult to employ fire fighters. Cooperation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was promised in obtaining evidence for the prosecution of any fire law violations which threatened or damaged war facilities or Federal property. As forest products were critical war materials, forest fires not only sabotaged war production but drew manpower away from farms and essential industries. Federal sabotage laws as well as state fire prevention statutes were invoked against persons responsible for them. It was estimated that $13,861 worth of marketable timber was burned in Albemarle County during the six-year period preceding 1946. Twenty-four boys of the Scottsville High School completed the training course required for membership in the Forest Fire Fighters Service and were entitled to wear the badge showing the outline of a tree in red on a triangular background of white and blue. The boys were organized in fire fighting crews, with leaders and assistant leaders, and were ready to respond to the calls of state forest wardens to fight fires when other manpower was not readily available. Tools and transportation were furnished by the Virginia Forest Service, and the boys were to be paid the same wages as other fire fighters.47 Some Overall Observations A few overall wartime trends in Albemarle County agriculture may be summarized. The number of farms was 2,599 in 1945 and had increased by only eight since 1940. But the total value of all their products harvested had almost trebled, growing from $1,880,619 in 1940 to $5,504,494 in 1945. The average value of their total annual produce, exclusive of that eaten by farm animals, had jumped from about $911 per farm to $1,981. Since the physical volume of products had been expanded by only something like thirty or forty per cent at most, these figures reflect the inflationary price spiral which characterized the nation's economy more than they constitute a true measure of increased production or an accurate index to the prosperity of Albemarle County farmers. The number of full owners of farms increased from 1,987 in 1940 to 2,118 in 1945, and accordingly the number of tenants decreased from 411 to 285 and part owners from 131 to 113. While 838 farms had electricity in 1940, a total of 1,192 enjoyed the privileges of electrification in 1945. Hired laborers numbering 1,776 in 1939 were paid $722,468 in cash wages, but in sharp contrast 711 laborers in 1944 were paid cash wages of $1,148,311. The following table classifies the seven leading types of Albemarle County farms in the order of the total value of their products, exclusive of what was fed to their own livestock or used for seed: Farms Reporting Total Value of Farm Products, 1945 Fruit and nut farms 398 $2,170,942 Livestock farms 390 890,969 Farms producing primarily for own household use 1,438 536,791 Dairy farms 59 501,521 General farms 252 462,986 Poultry farms 96 249,904 Forest product farms 97 133,53548 Desirable farms were in active demand during the war, according to local realtors, who said they found it quite difficult to find farms to sell. Some submarginal farms had been abandoned by owners who were attracted to the higher wages they could earn in war industries. When farms were occasionally auctioned to settle estates, the livestock and farm machinery brought good prices. Several large farms were purchased by buyers from a distance who intended to raise cattle on a highly specialized basis. On the other hand, another citizen contended that nearly every farm on the Lynchburg Road was for sale and that farm owners had been robbed too long. He protested that it was hard for them to get anything like the fair value of their property. Good farm land within two miles of Charlottesville and the University was valuable. A more distant farm on a back road could not be compared with land which was “close in” and in an exclusive residential neighborhood. The average farm rose in price in Albemarle County from $7,333 to $7,501 between 1940 and 1945, the average price per acre from $56.29 to $58.83. So although the prices of farm products climbed rapidly on the inflationary spiral and the cash wages paid labor rose noticeably, the value of farm property lagged far behind and advanced to only an inconsequential degree.49 As was true in most of the other communities in the United States, the people of Albemarle County and Charlottesville cooperated with the Federal Government in its program of food production to meet the gargantuan demands of war. They helped to make it possible for Secretary of Agriculture Clinton P. Anderson to say that the national food output was thirty-eight per cent greater during 1940–1944 than in 1935–1939. And, when they occasionally felt a bit rebellious against apparent food shortages and were willing to kick over the traces with which they pulled their share of the load, they realized dimly or perceived clearly that, as the Secretary and other authorities often reiterated, the national civilian food supply per capita, after deducting allotments to military needs and Lend-Lease shipments, was greater through each of the war years than during 1935– 1939 and during the First World War.50 VIII Working With the Red Cross When hostilities in Europe began in the fall of 1939, the Albemarle County Chapter of the American Red Cross, under the excellent chairmanship for John F. Faris of Red Hill, was engaged in many phases of civilian relief in its educational programs, in Junior Red Cross activities, and, of course, in Home Service, which is a primary responsibility in peace as well as in war. The Chapter maintained a small office in the National Bank Building in Charlottesville. There Miss Pauline Beard, with no paid assistant, executed the double duties of Executive Secretary and Home Service Secretary. Under the Congressional charter granted the American Red Cross on January 5, 1905, this organization was designated as the official agency to aid servicemen, veterans, and their families in times of disability or trouble and “to serve as a medium of communication between the people of the United States and their Army and Navy.” In order to carry out such obligations, it must be prepared to fulfill all requests from the Army and Navy in such matters as obtaining social histories, confidential reports on family conditions, and other information needed in questions of dependency discharges, furloughs, clemency, etc. In 1939, eleven such reports were requested and made. In the same year, twenty years after the close of World War I, forty-eight veterans were assisted in various ways. This Home Service work may not appear arduous, but the lapse of time and, usually, the loss of papers made such matters as assisting veterans in establishing their claims for government benefits long and difficult processes. At that time the Volunteer Special Service Committee may not have been organized strictly in line with Red Cross custom, but it was accomplishing many results. This committee, started in the days of the Great Depression, was composed of about thirty women from the city of Charlottesville and from various parts of Albemarle County, and its duty was to maintain a prompt and efficient group of volunteers for any emergency. These volunteers met regularly and discussed what they felt were local human needs and what they could do to meet them. They worked hard, helping to start the County School Lunch Program, distributing Red Cross garments, and doing deeds of kindness too numerous to mention. Other organizations, also, looked to them for contact in their communities and often called upon them to render various services. Also in the Volunteer Special Service Committee, and more in line wih Red Cross organizational custom, were the following subdivisions: the Braille Corps, a unit very little advertised but one which, under the chairmanship of Miss Mary Harris, transcribed thousands of pages of reading matter for the blind; the Motor Corps, under Miss Mary Stamps White, which consisted at that time only of a chairman and a group of untrained women upon whom she could call to render such services as driving patients to hospitals and clinics; the Staff Assistance Corps, which, under Mrs. Blakeley Carter, had recently been organized to provide secretarial help for the Red Cross office: and the Production Corps, under Mrs. Isaac Walters. It was the Production Corps which received the first war call, and the fact that it had already been organized made it necessary for it only to expand. It did not have to start from the beginning, as had to be done in many other Red Cross chapters. In October, 1939, the Albemarle County Chapter was asked to produce hundreds of garments for victims of war. Within ten days volunteers, mostly enrolled from church groups, were busily engaged in sewing layettes, dresses, and hospital shirts and in knitting sweaters and socks. County authorities helped enormously by lending workrooms in their new office building. By the following May a total of 2,151 garments and an additional 201 layettes had been made and shipped overseas. It has been stated, and there is no reason to doubt it, that the Albemarle County Production Corps was the first in the state of Virginia to get started on a European quota. Certainly it was among the first The next call received from headquarters of the American Red Cross also came in October. The Chapter was requested to send a representative to Washington to attend the first national course for instructors in the production of surgical dressings. About twenty cities sent representatives to take this course, among them Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Richmond, Louisville, Atlanta, and Charlottesville. Mrs. Blakeley Carter, who consented to represent the local Chapter, took the intensive one-week course of instruction and returned home with the alarming news that the local Chapter was expected to make 17,000 dressings by the first of January, 1940. This quota was given to all participating chapters, regardless of size, and to Albemarle at that time it seemed staggering. Four years later, in April, 1944, 179,000 dressings were made in one month! Mrs. Carter, as chairman of the surgical dressings branch of the Production Corps. went valiantly ahead to equip some rooms in the County Office Building and to enroll and train volunteer workers. By January the shipment was ready, and a few weeks later a Red Cross representative from Poland wrote that boxes of surgical dressings made by the Albemarle County Chapter were in use there. It was very gratifying to know that this Chapter was one of the first three in the entire United States to finish the first quota of 17,000 dressings and that it maintained its place in the lead for six months. Albemarle County Chapter members were very proud and a bit incredulous when visitors to New York City related that they had seen signs there reading, “Help New York Beat Charlottesville and Boston—Make Surgical Dressings.” In June, 1940, the first school for instructors in the making of surgical dressings for Virginia and adjoining states was held in Charlottesville, and the local Chapter was proud that Mrs. Carter was selected as instructor. Much later in the war, in July, 1944, the Chapter was thrilled by news that medical supplies produced by local Red Cross workers had been received in Italy by the 8th Evacuation Hospital, the medical unit which had been recruited in the University of Virginia Hospital. “We have just received a shipment of gauze and dressings which we were surprised and delighted to find was prepared by the Albemarle Chapter of the Red Cross,” Lieutenant Colonel E. C. Drash, a local physician who was helping to save the lives of wounded American servicemen, wrote in a letter to the local Chapter chairman. “We have used a vast quantity of gauze, which came from Chapters all over the United States. However, none of the previous shipments gave us the thrill this did. We have concrete proof that the people of Charlottesville and Albemarle County are really working to help bring the war to a successful close. The dressings prepared there are being used in the 8th Evacuation Hospital, now located just 3 miles from the German lines, to bind up the wounds of American boys, some of whom are from Virginia.”1 Throughout the year 1940 and a large part of 1941 most of the Chapter's activities related to war were in the production field. Yet the Chapter was still very active in civilian relief, giving aid of various kinds to the ill and undernourished, supplying garments for the needy, paying for glasses and for tonsillectomies for school children, and providing corrective operations for adults when such operations would enable them to support their families. Gradually, as war responsibilities became greater, these services were taken over by other organizations. In the fall of 1940 Mrs. James Gordon Smith of Greenwood, vice-chairman of the Chapter and chairman of its Volunteer Special Services, was invited by Norman Davis, chairman of the American Red Cross, and by Miss Mabel Boardman, chairman of the National Committee of Volunteer Special Services, to become a member of the National Committee. As this committee included representatives from between thirty and forty of the more than 3,500 Chapters organized throughout the United States, it was a signal honor for the Albemarle County Chapter to be represented among the chosen few. In May, 1941, Mrs. Smith was chosen to succeed John F. Faris, who declined renomination, as chairman of the Albemarle County Chapter and was herself succeeded as director of Volunteer Special Services by Miss Mary Stamps White. By that time the necessity for the continuing expansion of existing corps and the organization of new ones was becoming more apparent every day. Miss White, with various corps chairmen, went immediately to work. The Motor Corps was required to have further training and practice work. Earlier in 1941, under the chairmanship of Mrs. John Maury, Jr., Motor Corps members were trained in simple motor mechanics. Later that year, when Mrs. Maury moved away and Miss Caroline Stuart became chairman, instruction in Standard and Advanced First Aid, air raid precautions, map reading, and fire fighting were added to the training, and members were also required to drill. The idea of military drill was questioned by many and was a cause of great amusement to a few, but it was felt by Chapter officials that the discipline was important. No one knew what this group was facing, and the habit of taking orders promptly might have proved invaluable later. Incidentally, the local Motor Corps was the third in the nation to initiate such drills, which before the end of the war were required in all Red Cross chapters. When blackout drills were held in 1942–1944, the Motor Corps was always on hand, fulfilling difficult assignments with promptness and efficiency. On September 9, 1942, Miss Stuart left Charlottesville for a period of training near Toronto, Canada, with the Canadian Women's Transport. The Staff Assistance Corps was enlarged, and Mrs. Thomas S. Englar became its chairman. More women took the required training, and staff assistants became increasingly valuable as stenographers, typists, clerks, and receptionists in Red Cross offices, in workrooms, and in other civic and welfare organizations. Both branches of Production, namely, Sewing and Knitting and Surgical Dressings, were going full steam ahead. As very large quotas continued to come in, the chief problem in both of these services was to obtain more and more workers. The statistical report at the end of this chapter shows how well this need was met. A Home Service Corps was organized with Mrs. N. T. Hildreth as chairman, in order to relieve Miss Beard of some necessary home visits, thereby giving her more time for other duties. The Canteen Corps, with Mrs. H. B. Mulholland as chairman, was organized and trained. Classes were held under a volunteer domestic science teacher, with special emphasis on mass feedings. This corps soon started to acquire practical experience in many ways which will be described later and which proved invaluable to the Chapter. The Nurse's Aide Corps was also organized and trained. Miss Elizabeth A. Nolting became its chairman. Many other Red Cross Chapters had such units long before the war, but one did not seem to be needed in Charlottesville until it became apparent that war was coming and that the resulting exodus of nurses to the armed forces would be seriously felt by the local hospitals. When it was decided that the time had come to organize this corps, the Chapter hardly knew where to start. The University Hospital was anxious to cooperate in the training, and a nurse was available for teaching, but how aides were to be procured was the question. Would there be women sufficiently interested to give up their leisure time, to face the hard work, sacrifice, and discipline which would be ahead of them? Miss Mary Stamps White, Mrs. Edwin Burton, and Miss Nolting went to work on recruitment, mostly by calling picked people on the telephone. The result was that in November, 1941, the first class went into training, and the day after Pearl Harbor twenty prospective aides, having finished their thirty-five hours of lecture and practice work, were in uniform ready to start their forty-five hours of preliminary work in hospital wards. In January the first class was graduated and started a service which proved invaluable, especially to the badly understaffed hospitals. By September, 1943, eight classes, aggregating approximately 185 workers, had been trained, and 140 active Nurse's Aides, pledged to give 150 hours or more of work per year, were assisting in Charlottesville. Two years later the twelfth Nurse's Aide class was graduated; ten women were then presented with their caps and pins.2 When the Civilian Defense Council first came into the picture, its relationship with the Red Cross was not at all clear. Everything was moving so rapidly, and there were so many adjustments to be made, that many Red Cross workers were bewildered, particularly when faced with instructions which threatened confusing and wasteful duplication. However, through the cooperation of all concerned, the tangle was soon unravelled. Simplification of the problem was promoted because the Red Cross Volunteer Special Services chairman became also the executive secretary of Civilian Defense. After Pearl Harbor enemy air raids were expected on Washington or on the Atlantic Coast, and Charlottesville was designated as an evacuation center. It soon became clear that the Civilian Defense organization was to be in charge of relief operations in case of disaster due to enemy action and was to remain in charge until the Army took over the responsibility. All resources of the Red Cross were to be available. but this organization's specific job would be to provide refugees with food, clothing, and temporary shelter. Dr. Harvey E. Jordan, Dean of the Medical School at the University of Virginia, was appointed chief medical officer of the local Civilian Defense Council, and chairmen of certain Red Cross services were included on his committee. The personnel of the council and of the Red Cross cooperated closely, and elaborate and detailed plans for relief were worked out. Much credit goes to Sterling L. Williamson, chairman of the Disaster Preparedness Committee of the Chapter, for his excellent job in mobilizing Red Cross services for possible emergency. Under the Civilian Defense disaster organization were aligned the following Red Cross services: the Canteen Corps, which stood ready with available equipment to feed as many as 1,500 refugees; the Staff Assistance Corps, fifty-four of whom were specially trained to be in charge of registration and information desks; the Motor Corps, which was prepared to provide a large part of the necessary transportation to and from any eastern city between Norfolk and Baltimore (besides the Red Cross cars, privately owned station wagons, with stretchers and first aid equipment, were to be available to the Motor Corps); the Nurse's Aide Corps, which was prepared to assist trained nurses in emergency assignments; a Clothing Committee composed of dry goods merchants who had surveyed available supplies and were ready to furnish adequate clothing on short notice; and a Shelter Committee, which had arranged to house 700 people. It was understood that while the above committees were to be available to the Civilian Defense Council in case of enemy action, they would work under the Red Cross in case of sabotage or natural disaster, as would also members of the Civilian Defense medical squads. Perhaps the greatest expansion of any of the Chapter committees at that time was in the Committee on Safety Services. This committee had been functioning for many years and was responsible for giving instructions in first aid and in water safety. Under the leadership of Arthur V. Englert, chairman from 1939 to 1941, Charlottesville police, firemen, and hundreds of private citizens were instructed in first aid, and large numbers of people received certificates in water safety. When Englert moved away to live elsewhere and was succeeded by Walter S. Crenshaw, there was a greater demand for first aid instruction than ever before in Red Cross history. The local Civilian Defense Council required it for all air raid wardens, the Red Cross required it in certain services, and there was a clamor among the general public for such training. Crenshaw and a large group of instructors gave their time freely and generously, thereby making an enormous contribution, not only to people individually but also to all agencies cooperating in the protection of the home front. The scarcity of doctors and nurses was being felt more and more in the community, and the congestion in hospitals was very great. In order to give a small measure of relief in this problem, the Red Cross Home Nursing Committee, with Mrs. Mason S. Byrd as chairman, and the Joint Health Department organized and provided instruction for many classes in home nursing, hoping that thereby women would learn to care more intelligently for the sick in their own homes. Some of these classes, both white and Negro, were taught by Mrs. Robert V. Funsten, Mrs. Fletcher Woodward, Mrs. John G. Yancey, Mrs. Grace White, and Mrs. Annie White, who very generously gave their time.3 Later other volunteer trained nurses also undertook the task of instruction. All rendered to the community a service the magnitude of which cannot be measured. Certificates were awarded to more than 656 graduates of this course. With the many increased demands upon the Red Cross, the question of working space was becoming very serious. Many suitable rooms had been provided in the county for both branches of Production and for First Aid and Home Nursing classes, but in Charlottesville workrooms were becoming crowded and inadequate. Activities in the city were scattered in thirteen different rooms, which had been loaned by various organizations, and operations had become very difficult. They would have necessarily been continued on a much restricted basis had it not been for the Charlottesville City Council, which, shortly after Pearl Harbor, voted to let the organization have the use of the old Midway School building for the duration of the war. Early in January, 1942, the Red Cross moved in, and a new era in Chapter history began. Thereafter the local Chapter was never hampered by lack of space, and that fact undoubtedly played a great part in the record of achievement of the Albemarle County Chapter. In December, 1941, Dr. Carlisle S. Lentz, Superintendent of the University of Virginia Hospital, requested and obtained $1,000 from the Red Cross, and later the same amounts from both Charlottesville and Albemarle County, for the purchase of medical supplies to be held in readiness for victims of air raids. The greater part of this money was to be used for the establishment of a bank for liquid blood plasma which, as it required refrigeration, could be used only locally or in nearby places. This bank was to be operated by the hospital staff but to belong to the Red Cross and to the county and city governments. The Civilian Defense Council assumed the responsibility of obtaining donors and had general supervision over the project, but Red Cross volunteers, particularly Staff Assistants, gave many hours of work to help in assuring its success. This blood bank should not be confused with the Red Cross Blood Donor Service, mobile units of which visited this community during 1943–1945 to obtain donations of blood to be converted into dried plasma for the United States armed forces. Details of the cooperative Civilian Defense blood bank have been discussed in the chapter on Civilian Defense. Shortly before moving into Midway School, the Albemarle County Chapter lost Miss Pauline Beard, who for six years had run the office, attended to Home Service, promoted all activities in the Chapter, and, incidentally, picked up all loose ends. Her departure to accept a responsible position at Red Cross National Headquarters left the local Chapter feeling very much “on its own.” However, her sister, Miss Anne Beard, who replaced her, fitted very well into the position of executive secretary, and Miss Helen Wilson proved very valuable as her assistant. After the Chapter had been functioning for several months in its new quarters, demands for surgical dressings for our own armed forces became greater and greater. Mrs. Carter and her cohorts began to look with distress on their workers as they removed their uniforms and departed every day at about half-past twelve. It occurred to them that, if lunch were served in the building, the departing workers might stay and give at least an hour's more time and perhaps two. They appealed to the Canteen Corps, whose members not only responded but also equipped and furnished a kitchen and dining room in the basement. These rooms were transferred from spots of depressing gloom into really cheerful gathering places. Lunches were served five days each week to all Red Cross workers who wanted to stay. These meals were uniformly good, showed originality and imagination, and usually cost only twenty-five cents. While, theoretically, the Canteen Corps was not supposed to make money, they made it in spite of themselves and were able to make many notable contributions with their profits. These luncheons will be remembered with pleasure by many Red Cross workers. Not only did they serve their original purpose of enticing many of the Surgical Dressing ladies to remain a little longer, but they also proved to be excellent times for meetings, were a great convenience to all workers at Midway, and undoubtedly served a great purpose in promoting all Chapter services. In the summer of 1942 some members of the Canteen Corps, under the leadership of Mrs. Charlotte Gildersleeve, began to serve light refreshments to traveling servicemen at the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway station. This was not a Red Cross project at the time, but a private enterprise of these ladies. Although they wanted it to come officially under the Red Cross, the undertaking was not then smiled upon by either the C. &amp; O. Railway or the Red Cross Eastern Area office, and it had to be discontinued for a while. However, these women had demonstrated its worth, and the local Chapter became very anxious to establish an official station canteen, since an enormous number of servicemen en route to and from military or naval stations along the Atlantic coast traveled on the C. &amp; O., wartime railway dining car facilities were inadequate, there were sometimes long waits between trains, and, also, because the men who had been served by Mrs. Gildersleeve's group had been very appreciative. Finally, after much correspondence and many meetings, all difficulties were cleared. The C. &amp; O. Railway, managers of nearby restaurants, and the U. S. O., which under national policy had priority in all proposals for the establishment of station canteens, gave their unanimous approval. This resulted in the consent of the Eastern Area of the American Red Cross. The railroad not only approved, under certain proper conditions, but also loaned for this use its former ticket office. This room opened onto the platform and was ideal for the purpose. Mrs. Gildersleeve was anxious to help but not to assume the responsibility, so Mrs. Mulholland appointed Miss May Langhorne to direct the station canteen. From a small beginning in October, 1942, this canteen grew into an efficiently managed organization which met all trains day and night, seven days a week, and dispensed to men and women in military or naval uniform free coffee, cigarettes, doughnuts, and cheer. The crowds of service personnel who eagerly gathered around the canteen windows and the many letters of appreciation received convinced the few doubters that this enterprise was a morale builder of the first order. While the station canteen was in operation, 156 women gave time totaling more than 13,442 hours and served light refreshments to 307,592 service personnel. It was closed on February 15, 1946.4 Late in 1942 and early in 1943 the local Chapter suffered an alarming epidemic of losses. Miss Anne Beard, who had become Mrs. Johnson Dennis, resigned as executive secretary and was replaced by Miss Marjorie Shepherd, and a large number of Albemarle volunteers were seized with the very natural desire to go into the armed forces or Red Cross service overseas. Miss Mary Stamps White and Miss Elizabeth Nolting were among those who went abroad with the Red Cross, and Miss Caroline Stuart left with the same intention, although later developments prevented her from going. It hardly seemed possible that such excellent replacements as Mrs. Alfred Chanutin, Mrs. John McGavock, and Mrs. Charles Merriman should have been obtained as chairmen respectively of Volunteer Special Services, the Motor Corps, and the Nurse's Aide Corps. They kept up the excellent work of their predecessors, and all activities continued to expand. Early in 1943 the Army and Navy designated the Red Cross as their official agent for the enrollment of nurses. Miss Virginia Walker, Superintendent of Nurses at the University of Virginia Hospital, became chairman of the local Nurse Recruitment Committee. It had a rather large field, as the Albemarle County Chapter became the nurse recruitment center of fifteen surrounding counties. Miss Walker had been experiencing the difficulties which resulted from the shortage of nurses at home, but she went gallantly to work, knowing that Army needs were more serious. (The Navy's quotas were not as large as the Army's and not so difficult to fill.) As a result of Miss Walker's endeavors, seventy-three nurses were enrolled for the armed forces. Fifty-nine of them served overseas. In June, 1943, a mobile unit from the Red Cross Blood Donor Service in Washington, D. C., made its first visit to Charlottesville, and at last people of the community had the opportunity to give their blood for conversion into dried plasma for shipment overseas. Ruth Risher and Disney murals entertain soldiers in a snack bar in Egypt. Months earlier, the Albemarle County Chapter had asked to be included in the itinerary of this service but had been assured that Charlottesville was too far distant. The local Chapter was not happy about the situation, and this feeling was intensified by General Vandegrift's visit. Early that year, Robert E. Taylor, chairman of the local 1943 Red Cross War Fund Campaign, invited Major General A. A. Vandegrift of the United States Marine Corps, a native of Charlottesville, to come and open the local drive, and the community was greatly thrilled and honored when he accepted. The General had just returned from active duty in the South Pacific, and what he said about the important part blood plasma was playing in saving the lives of wounded men made many people here more than ever eager to give their blood. As it happened, the community did not have to wait very long. No doubt the critical status of the battlefront at that time and the urgent need for plasma caused the directors of this Washington service to relent. In May they sent a representative to help the local Red Cross Chapter to organize a blood donor center in Charlottesville. Mrs. Staige D. Blackford became chairman and formed an organization which developed great efficiency. The University Baptist Church provided adequate space. Donors were obtained through the newspapers, by radio, and by personal solicitation. When the Mobile Blood Donor Service unit arrived, necessary equipment and volunteer workers were on hand, and the local quota of 160 pints of blood a day for three days was met. The unit and its skillful and cooperative personnel came back to Charlottesville approximately every other month for four-day periods through June, 1945. The visit scheduled for August of that year was cancelled because the Japanese had begun their peace overtures. In the winter of 1944 the location was changed to the Methodist Church, which was more convenient to most donors, and twice that year the unit made trips to Scottsville also. In order to protect the donors, physical requirements were very rigid, and even with good preliminary work the committee had always to count on a number of rejections of persons who were willing but not able to spare some of their blood. Substitutes stood by, however, and usually the maximum daily quota was met. Residents of Charlottesville and Albemarle County, together with occasional delegations from other counties and students of the University of Virginia, proved to be generous blood donors. In recognition of their first pint of blood, donors received bronze buttons, which were to be exchanged for silver buttons after their third donation and for gold buttons after their fourth donation. An example of their faithfulness is to be found in the fact that in January, 1945, 514 out of 582 persons offering blood were previous donors.5 Fifteen employees of the Charlottesville post office volunteered to give blood, as did more than 200 students, including the entire membership of the local chapter of the Sigma Chi Fraternity. All told, 6,404 pints of blood were collected in Charlottesville from volunteer donors, seventy of whom became members of the Gallon Club, having contributed one gallon or more of blood. Two Charlottesville mothers, Mrs, W. L. Lacey and Mrs. W. H. Smick, Sr., celebrated their sons' birthdays in February, 1944, by gifts of blood. Mrs. Lauris Norstad, wife of one of the younger generals of the Army Air Corps serving in Italy, Mrs. J. E. Bell, and Nat R. Martin became charter members of the local Gallon Club. Staff Sergeant Robert V. Smith of Charlottesville, who had assisted the previous January in the first plasma transfusion ever attempted aboard a B-25 bomber, made a donation on October 13, 1944. The mobile unit of the Blood Donor Service happened to be in Charlottesville on D-Day, June 6, 1944. When the news of landings on the beachheads of Normandy came, a large number of people without appointments appeared and offered to give blood. Many of these had to be turned away, as there was not sufficient equipment to accommodate all of the would-be donors.6 Early in 1945 Mrs. William H. Laird became co-chairman of the committee in charge of this service locally, and she, Mrs. Blackford, and their committee did an outstandingly good job. They were ably assisted by local volunteer nurses, as well as members of the Nurse's Aide, Canteen, Staff Assistance, and Motor Corps. Without all these, according to Mrs. Blackford, “we could never have succeeded.” In October, 1943, the Camp and Hospital Committee was organized. This committee was composed of about forty people, representatives of practically all civic and patriotic organizations in the community. Its purpose was to serve as a channel through which interested groups and individuals could contribute to the comfort and pleasure of the armed forces, particularly to that of the patients of the Woodrow Wilson General Hospital near Staunton, Virginia. This was in keeping with the general policy of the Army and Navy that such services should be channeled through the Red Cross. The Motor Corps made weekly trips to the hospital from the time it was opened in June, 1943, through March, 1946, carrying workers of this committee, personnel of other Red Cross services, and groups of entertainers from other community organizations. Many gifts were made and uncounted entertainments arranged for the men at the Woodrow Wilson Hospital, and a much appreciated garden project was sponsored and beautifully carried out there by Mrs. Theodore Hough. This committee also arranged for the entertainment in Charlottesville of groups of men from Camp Pickett and from the Woodrow Wilson Hospital. Luncheon was served to these visiting servicemen by the Canteen Corps, sometimes in the Midway School dining room and sometimes on the grounds of Monticello. The committee also furnished eight sun rooms and gave 1,006 stockings or other containers filled with Christmas presents to soldiers at the Woodrow Wilson Hospital. In addition, it provided recreational and other equipment for the use of American guards at the White Hall Prison Camp. Robert E. Taylor, Miss Jennette Rustin, and Miss Nan Crow served successively as chairmen of the group.7 Throughout the war the Disaster Preparedness Committee was ready and waiting to go into action, but its services were needed in only one major instance. Then it responded so quickly and efficiently that the Chapter received a letter of commendation from the Eastern Area office of the Red Cross. On Sunday morning, September 26, 1943, a trainload of German prisoners was wrecked near Shadwell. The engineer and the fireman were both killed. Fifteen others, including both prisoners and their guards, were injured. The Red Cross ambulance with first aid equipment reached the scene promptly. Red Cross stretchers proved particularly useful, because the wheeled stretchers of commercial ambulances could not be used on the steep hillside. The Motor Corps helped with the transportation of the wounded. Although it was Sunday morning, Mrs. Mulholland and members of the Canteen Corps were able to comply with the request of the commanding officer for lunch. In about an hour they were on the scene with 1,200 sandwiches, coffee, fruit, and water, which they dispensed from behind a fence, as they were not allowed to approach the prisoners.8 By 1944 calls for Home Service were increasing to such an extent that they tended to overshadow everything else in the executive office of the local Chapter. To fulfill these calls is a charter responsibility of the Red Cross, and, of course, must be done. Mrs. N. T. Hildreth had moved away, and Mrs. Mason Byrd had assumed the chairmanship of the Home Service Corps. Under her leadership a group of eight specially selected women was given a fifty-hour training course by Miss Marjorie Shepherd, and they were certified as Home Service volunteers. Most of these and nine others subsequently trained remained in the corps and proved invaluable throughout the strenuous days ahead. At Miss Shepherd's request a Home Service Advisory Committee was organized with the Reverend Dudley A. Boogher, rector of St. Paul's Episcopal Church at Ivy, as its chairman. It met regularly, and the advice and suggestions of its members were of great benefit to the executive office. In the summer of 1944 Miss Shepherd, on the advice of her physician, resigned. For several months the Chapter was without an Executive Secretary. However, Miss Helen Wilson, who had served as assistant to both Miss Shepherd and her predecessor, Mrs. Fenner Baker, the office secretary, the Home Service Corps, and the Staff Assistants Corps stood manfully by, and before long the Chapter obtained in the executive secretaryship the services of Mrs. Albert Wright, who held this position throughout the remainder of the war. By 1944 it was obvious that the Executive Secretary and the chairman of the Home Service Committee should be distinct, and after Mrs. Wright assumed her duties the separation took place, with Miss Wilson installed in quarters across the hall as Home Service Secretary. The result was much less confusion and more time for the Executive Secretary to give to other services. However, even then, but for the assistance of the Home Service volunteers in making visits, in taking office calls, and in proving themselves generally useful, twenty-four hours a day would have been insufficient to permit the staff to attend to its large volume of work. As more and more of our men were made prisoners of war, it was thought advisable to have in the Home Service office someone who specialized in that subject. Mrs. Page Nelson, a recent addition to the staff, became the Chapter's specialist on information about prisoners of war. The fact that her own son was a prisoner in Germany made her interest in the subject particularly vital; and her understanding of what information and service a family in similar circumstances might want was very keen. Local Red Cross workers realized that they could not maintain the right kind of Home Service department if they became cut and dried and too efficiently scheduled. Of course requests from the Army and Navy and other legitimate calls for aid had to be handled with dispatch, even when they involved long drives over almost impassable roads or long walks if the roads were impassable; and workers knew very well that Home Service had to be available night and day, including Sundays. But the workers also understood that human kindness is more important than schedules. Through the war years relatives of servicemen of all walks of life, representing all degrees of intelligence, were constantly in the office, wanting help, information, and encouragement. No one ever begrudged the time they took. Sometimes requests were made which could not be granted, but even then the aim was to give time and thought to helping each person with his problem and to have him leave happier and more satisfied than when he arrived.9 In 1945 Dr. David C. Wilson, head of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Virginia Hospital, told the other members of the Home Service Advisory Committee that many veterans who had been discharged from the armed forces were in a bewildered state of mind and needed a little help to enable them to face life. These men were not sick enough to be committed to mental hospitals, but they were on the borderline and might become so. He offered to hold a clinic at some place other than the hospital and said that he and members of his staff would volunteer their services, but he added that he would like to have a part-time secretary, a case worker, and a place in which the clinics could be held. All of these were provided by the Red Cross. At first, Mrs. Lewis K. Underhill, one of the Home Service volunteers, served as case worker, and afterwards Miss Helen Neve, who had recently joined the staff, worked in that capacity. A total of 206 patients were seen at the clinic. As Dr. Wilson said when this work had been completed, “The Red Cross performed a social service here of no small proportion. Undoubtedly a large number of these men would have become chronic invalids if not handled immediately.” This clinic was operated from March, 1945, until August, 1946, at which time the work was so well covered by the Veterans Administration that Dr. Wilson's clinic ceased to be necessary. The Albemarle County Chapter of the Red Cross was very grateful to have been able to help, but to Dr. Wilson himself must go the credit for meeting what he termed “this community emergency.”10 In 1945 the Chapter organized for the first time a Hospital and Recreation Corps, commonly called “Gray Ladies” on account of their uniforms. This corps was formed in response to a request for that service from military authorities at the Woodrow Wilson General Hospital, and it was trained there. Under the chairmanship of Mrs. Charles Barham, Jr., fifteen “Gray Ladies” helped social and recreational workers, manned the information desk in the Red Cross Building, helped with the interior decoration of sun rooms, and generally spread good cheer in that institution dedicated to the repair and healing of wounded or sick soldiers. They served there until the hospital closed in 1946, and none of them seemed to mind the seventy miles which they traveled frequently to render this service.11 The Public Relations Committee performed an important service in reporting Red Cross activities to the nine or ten thousand members of the Chapter and to the public at large. In addition, it thereby did much to maintain the excellent relationship which always existed between the Chapter and the community. This was made possible by the unfailing cooperation of the local newspapers, radio station, and theatres. In 1942 a mimeographed news report was distributed to workers every month. Publication of an interesting quarterly magazine, the Albemarle County Chapter News, was begun in 1944 but was discontinued after the Japanese surrender the next year, when wartime demands upon the chapter began to become less pressing.12 Mrs. Atcheson L. Hench, Mrs. Alfred Chanutin, and Mrs. Stuart Clement served as successive chairmen of this committee during the war years. The Red Cross Roll Call and War Fund Committees raised vast sums of money which, of course, played an essential part in Red Cross work with the armed forces, in relief at home and abroad, and in local Chapter activities. Obtaining the requested quota was never an easy undertaking, but the quotas were always oversubscribed because the drive chairmen and their unfaltering solicitors organized and prosecuted the campaigns efficiently. In their efforts they enjoyed the influential cooperation of the radio station, newspapers, business firms, and civic organizations, and they received generous responses from public spirited citizens.13 Particularly noteworthy was the speech with which Major General Alexander Archer Vandegrift opened the War Fund drive in 1943. At a time when battlefront conditions were still fresh in the memory of this commander of the victorious Marines on Guadalcanal, he assured an admiring audience which filled the Lane High School auditorium that the “Red Cross performed wonderful service for my men in the Solomons. It is worthy of all the support you can give it.”14 During these years the Junior Red Cross was doing much to live up to its pledge, “We believe in service to others, for our country, our community, and our school, in health of mind and body to fit us for greater service and for better human relationships throughout the world. We have joined the American Junior Red Cross to help achieve its aims by working together with its members everywhere in our own and other lands.” Mrs. John Gilmore and Mrs. Charles Henderson were successively the local Junior Red Cross chairmen during the war years. Under their leadership the Junior Red Cross grew and developed until almost the whole school population of Charlottesville and Albemarle County were members, either through contributions of money, however small, or by performance of some service. The Juniors made, or otherwise provided, thousands of useful gifts for children in this country and abroad, nor did they overlook the needs of servicemen in hospitals. They gave regularly to the National Children's Fund, which has been maintained since 1919 through voluntary subscriptions of Junior members for the purpose of helping to meet emergency needs of boys and girls throughout the world. They also assisted in war bond sales, in Red Cross drives, in the enlistment of pledges for the Blood Donor Service, and in many other useful activities.15 Throughout the war the American Red Cross put great emphasis on the necessity of classes in nutrition. Food supplies were restricted, and no one knew how much more limited they would become. Consequently, teaching women to feed their families to better advantage on more abundant foods was another timely Red Cross service. Under the leadership of the local Nutrition Committee many women learned culinary fundamentals and wartime adaptations of basic menus. Certificates were issued to 572 graduates of nutrition classes during the two years of 1942–1944 in which Mrs. L. B. Snoddy was chairman of this committee. Under the chairmanship of her successors, Mrs. L. P. Edwards and Mrs. Frank Burnley, the special emphasis of the Nutrition Committee was on the lunch program for undernourished children in the county schools, the funds for which had for several years been appropriated by the Child Welfare Association and administered by the executive office and the Staff Assistance Corps of the Red Cross. In 1944 the Nutrition Committee took over the management of this program. It gave special attention to planning menus which were both balanced and feasible under conditions existing in the county schools. Most of the committees and corps of the local Red Cross can report tangible results in their own respective projects, but from this viewpoint the Staff Assistance Corps is unique. It had no exclusive function of its own, but it contributed immeasurably to the success of all other subdivisions of the Chapter. Each of these recognizes its own distinctive debt of gratitude to members of the corps and to Mrs. Thomas S. Englar, Mrs. Harry L. Smith, and Mrs. Raymond Hunt, its wartime chairmen.16 It would not be fitting to close this review of wartime services which were, in the aggregate, truly amazing, without a tribute to the salaried staff and the volunteer workers of the local Red Cross organization. The Albemarle County Chapter in wartime was a big organization. Its staff never exceeded five, but it enlisted more than 3,000 volunteers. Within seven years after the outbreak of the war in Europe over half a million recorded hours of service were given by members of the Volunteer Special Service Corps, and this figure may tell only half the story. It excludes many tens of thousands of hours of Volunteer Special Service work—hours which were freely given but which went unrecorded because people were more concerned about getting their jobs done than they were about getting all possible credit. Nor does this figure include the vast expenditures of time donated to Red Cross activities by Chapter officers, members of permanent committees, the Junior Red Cross, instructors, and Roll Call or War Fund solicitors. The Chapter has every reason to be proud of the wonderful spirit with which everyone worked together. The few little human frictions which arose were so small and so easily adjusted as not to be noteworthy. The prevailing harmony in a large and cooperative membership was characterized by the unselfish devotion of the workers of the Albemarle County Chapter, their usual desire to do more than their part, and their large measure of understanding of the Red Cross ideals of service to humanity without regard for race, color, or creed.

During the Second World War this proved true with many people in Charlottesville and Albemarle County. Though they were living under greater pressures upon their time, energy, and money than ever before, their hearts went out sympathetically and their pocket-books were opened generously to other victims of the war whose lives were more seriously dislocated than their own. Their resultant services and charitable contributions can be divided into two fairly distinct types. One of these pertained chiefly to the fighters of the war—men who were uprooted from their homes, often lonesome, bored, and friendless. It took the form of giving them a cordial welcome whenever they were in the community, of affording them homelike comforts and atmosphere, and of making available to them wholesome and diverting kinds of entertainment. These functions became in time chiefly the responsibility of the local U. S. O. Club, a community-operated facility which emerged gradually in response to local initiative and continued in cooperation with an international organization. The other type of local war charity responded especially to the needs of civilians who had been oppressed by the war both at home and abroad. It found expression through many relief agencies. In several particulars the activities of the American Red Cross straddle this line of demarcation, and the wartime services of the Albemarle County Chapter of the Red Cross are recounted elsewhere in this volume. Recreation The United Service Organizations, Inc., was an interdenominational union of six social service agencies, the Young Men's Christian Association, the Young Women's Christian Association, the Salvation Army, the National Travelers Aid Association, the National Catholic Community Service, and the National Jewish Welfare Board. Since they were all interested in meeting needs of the men and women of the United States armed forces which could best be filled by agencies other than the Federal government, they created the U. S. O. in February, 1941, as a means of coordinating their efforts.1 One of the widely publicized services of the U. S. O. was its provision of groups of touring entertainers for the enjoyment of servicemen and servicewomen wherever throughout the world they found opportunities to relax awhile. At least two men and one young woman from Charlottesville were contributing to the success of U. S. O. Camp Shows in the European Theater of Operations as the war approached its end. Richard Via, son of the Reverend and Mrs. Bernard S. Via, toured France, Belgium, Holland, and Germany for eight months as a member of the company of the play “Junior Miss.” Edgar Mason, a native of Charlottesville who had gone into the worlds of the stage and radio, arrived in Paris in 1945 with the “Kiss and Tell” company. Each of these men was cited for his services to the U. S. O. program overseas.2 Miss Marjorie Mitchell of Charlottesville, an accomplished pianist, was another artist who entertained servicemen under auspices of the U. S. O. During the winter of 1944–1945 she made long visits to military stations in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. Later she began an extended tour of the European continent with a U. S. O. Camp Show unit.3 Residents of Charlottesville and Albemarle County were not able to participate directly in the work of the U. S. O. until long after the United States entered the war. Only one of the six constituent U. S. O. agencies, the Salvation Army, was operating a local unit at that time, and the absence of any large cantonment of uniformed personnel in the vicinity meant that no U. S. O. Club was required. A national campaign for gifts to the U. S. O. in the autumn of 1941 had not been locally a howling success; a “concerted drive” for funds throughout a week had produced only $413.50 in cash from the city and county, which had been assigned a quota of $3,400, but there had been a lingering hope that several large contributions would transform these disappointing receipts into a respectable sum in four figures.4 Probably many people of the community first became really acquainted with the U. S. O. in the spring of 1942 when it launched a War Fund campaign having greater popular appeal. Governor Colgate W. Darden, Jr., the honorary chairman of the drive for Virginia, and John Stewart Bryan of Richmond, state chairman, spoke to local solicitors. State Senator John S. Battle of Charlottesville was one of Virginia's regional chairmen. Fred L. Watson served as chairman for the city, and W. A. Rinehart headed the county organization. In support of this appeal The Daily Progress printed information about the nature and program of the U. S. O.5 But already something akin to the U. S. O.'s interest in the welfare of servicemen had begun to emerge in the community, and eventually it developed through an easy transition into an official U. S. O. Club. Under the leadership of Miss Nan Crow, chairman of the Recreation Committee of the local Civilian Defense Council, entertainment was afforded to transient servicemen and to local selectees who were awaiting induction into the armed forces. Soon after Pearl Harbor this committee, consisting of sixteen interested volunteers in addition to its chairman, announced that Christmas cards had been mailed to 158 draftees who could not return to their homes for the holidays and reported that each departing selectee was to receive an individual gift.6 Charlottesville's City Council, apparently in appreciative response to this start, promptly appropriated $25 to supplement the committee's initial funds from other sources.7 By mid-summer of 1942 Miss Crow could report that a few hundred dollars had been spent for the entertainment of troops travelling in convoy, that meal tickets had been distributed to them, that cots and mattresses had been collected in the New Armory for their overnight use, that they had attended two dances, and that the possibility of establishing a recreation and lounging room for transient men in uniform had been discussed. Moreover, the temporary needs of of local selectees, who might be at loose ends while awaiting induction, had not been overlooked. In February and again in May, 1942, large groups of selectees were dinner guests of local civic clubs.8 The Charlottesville Presbyterian Church offered facilities in its Annex building at the corner of First and Market Streets for an afternoon recreation room for selectees. Staffed by volunteer hostesses, under the supervision of Miss Crow, this resort became a kind of miniature U. S. O. lounge. To 7,000 white and Negro men who had time on their hands it made available during the last six months of 1942 magazines, newspapers, postal cards, soft drinks, cigarettes, candy, and popsicles.9 During the last weeks of the summer and through part of the autumn of 1942 a revival of the armed forces' policy of granting two weeks of immediate leave to every new inductee made possible a renewal and enlargement of the shortlived plan for dinners in honor of departing servicemen which had been begun earlier in the year. The Recreation Committee of the Civilian Defense Council made arrangements for meals, several of which were held in the First Methodist Church of Charlottesville, the civic clubs took turns providing dinner programs, and these evenings were made complete when the groups attended movies at the Paramount Theatre. Two such parties were planned each month, about two weeks apart, for each of the two races, white and Negro. The first dinner for Negro inductees was served in their First Baptist Church; eight selectees, three soldiers who were at home on furlough, and nine other persons enjoyed fried chicken and other delicacies before the usual movie that evening. When it was found that gasoline rationing and other transportation difficulties prevented many selectees in the county from accepting these invitations, they received instead farewell gift packages at the time of their departure. Some other complimentary services rendered by the Recreation Committee before changing conditions caused a discontinuance of this program included the gift of a free newspaper subscription for three months to seventy-two draftees. Student officers of the School of Military Government at the University of Virginia were also entertained upon at least four occasions during 1942–1943.10 At just about the same time that it became impracticable to fête on such a grand scale servicemen who were leaving the community, opportunities began to present themselves for the entertainment of other servicemen who were visitors to Charlottesville and Albemarle County. Ships of the British Navy which had met the enemy on the high seas and had not emerged unscathed from these encounters sometimes docked at Hampton Roads, Virginia, for repairs. Their battle-weary sailors were often under these circumstances granted leaves of a week or longer. Direct railroad service between their temporary ports and Charlottesville meant that these British “tars” could practicably travel inland to pass some of their time of waiting and to seek a refreshing change in the foothills of the Blue Ridge. Homes in both the county and the city were opened to them and to small contingents of sailors of other nations throughout two and one-half years or longer. Local arrangements for this gesture of international good will were directed successively by the Recreation Committee of the Civilian Defense Council and by the U. S. O. The first two British sailors who made such visits to Charlottesville arrived early in October, 1942. They were billeted in the New Armory and enjoyed themselves so much that they later wrote enthusiastic expressions of appreciation.11 The third, a young veteran of seven years in the Royal Navy who had not been home for three years, remarked that the “country around Charlottesville reminds me very much of England.” Being here, he said, was “next to visiting England. And the people here,” he asserted gratefully, “are the very soul of hospitality.”12 The society page of The Daily Progress listed one day in November, 1942, the names of twenty-one other British sailors and of their hosts and hostesses in eleven private homes of the city and of the county. Most of these visited Monticello and Ash Lawn, enjoyed a square dance, and were given movie tickets and bowling passes.13 Some two weeks later the local newspaper published a feature story based upon an interview with three Royal Navy guests who told harrowing tales of bombings and sinkings at sea. They all promised to return if they got another furlough within travelling distance of the community and assured the reporter that their shipmates had told them before they had left their ships, “If you want a grand leave, go to Charlottesville.”14 More than twenty of the British sailors spent the Christmas season of 1942 in the homes of city and county residents, were entertained two evenings by Christ Episcopal Church, and enjoyed other special parties. Plans for some of their shipmates who had been expected to arrive in time for New Year's Day were cancelled by a telegram from their port.15 The chaplain of the damaged vessel to which many of these sailors were attached wrote, in part, “I have been tremendously touched by the wonderful welcome you have given our boys. I wish you could hear something of the enthusiasm with which they describe what they have seen and done during their leave. As you have discovered,” he explained, “many of our boys have not had leave for around two years and this fact has heightened their appreciation at being made to feel so much at home again.” The kindness of local hosts, he continued, “has done a great deal more than give your guests a good time. The insight gained in such a way can alone produce a really genuine understanding between our two peoples. As a friend and admirer of the United States I have felt pleased that you have allowed our sailors to get a fairer perspective of American life than would otherwise have been possible.”16 These British seamen were not the only visitors to Charlottesville who mailed complimentary letters when they had returned to eastern ports. An enlisted man of the United States Navy who spent a week-end in Charlottesville proclaimed it the finest of many leaves which he and another serviceman had enjoyed during the eight months in which they had been stationed at Norfolk, Virginia, far from their homes. “We found your people to be very friendly and courteous,” he wrote. “We were comfortably quartered in a hotel and ate excellent meals at about two-thirds the price that we have been used to paying.” An employee of the hotel made a particularly favor able impression. “When a hotel clerk says 'God bless you' as you leave the hotel, we have the feeling that humanity is still pretty good after all.” The grateful sailor thought Charlottesville “charming enough in itself even if the University weren't there.” With a candor characteristic of servicemen rather than because of any desire to make invidious comparisons, he concluded, “It is refreshing to be able to visit a city like Charlottesville which is so different from what we experience daily here. I think we both appreciated the Sunday quiet and noticed the absence of hubbub. Your quaint old buildings are inspiring and your churches are particularly beautiful. We like your city and do not hesitate to say so. We will go on record as champions of Virginia in contrast to so many service men who judge the state unfairly, having seen only the Hampton Roads area.”17 A full year elapsed after Pearl Harbor before the U. S. O. name and insignia could be correctly used in connection with local recreational facilities or activities for servicemen. The last issue of The Daily Progress published in 1942 announced a cooperative new service for military and civilian transients at the Union Station in Charlottesville. Appended inconspicuously to this article was a report that plans for a servicemen's lounge were under consideration and that the U. S. O. had granted permission to use the U. S. O. insignia in developing it. It was explained, however, that no U. S. O. funds were then available to Charlottesville and that all financial requirements would consequently have to be raised locally.18 Two weeks later it was revealed that the Old Armory, which served as the city's Recreation Center, was to undergo extensive renovations by way of making it an attractive and comfortable place of entertainment for servicemen. The City Council promptly appropriated $1,200 for this purpose, and The Daily Progress editorially approved this outlay.19 The opening of the redecorated Old Armory in its new capacity on Saturday, February 20, 1943, was a gala occasion dignified by the presence of city officials and their wives. Aside from the attraction of an opportunity to inspect its facilities, the evening included a dance to which 300 Naval Flight Preparatory School cadets at the University and more than 200 young women of the community had been especially invited. Upholstered chairs, bookcases, rugs, and other furnishings had been donated by numerous individuals. Serving as interior decorator, Miss Eleanor Hosey had stressed bright, masculine colors, predominantly blues and reds, and members of the Albemarle Art League had loaned some of their paintings to decorate the walls. In its new role of service the building afforded a comfortably furnished main reading and lounging room, a snack room in which tea could be served, and a pretty, spacious dance hall. All residents of the community who missed the first festive evening in the newly refurnished quarters were specially invited to see them during eight “open house” hours of the following afternoon and evening. Indeed, Miss Nan Crow, who had been the chief leader in creating this new facility for recreation and in securing the blessings of the U. S. O. upon it, announced that it was not intended exclusively for servicemen and extended a welcome to civilians also. This was natural, considering her dual interest in uniformed personnel as chairman of the Recreation Committee of the local Civilian Defense Council and in civilians as director of the Recreation Department of the city government. And in view of the fact that the U. S. O. had loaned its name but not yet invested any of its funds, the dual character of the revamped building's new community services was entirely proper.20 Soon after the excitement of the opening dance Miss Crow announced a program of regular U. S. O. activities which had been agreed upon by the group of a dozen or more community leaders who had served as an advisory committee or policy-making board of directors. Women of various churches served in rotation as senior hostesses in the building, which was open every morning, afternoon, and evening except Sunday mornings. Junior hostesses assisted them at especially busy times such as Saturday and Sunday afternoons. The chief feature of the program was a dance every Saturday night. These dances were directed and chaperoned by various men's and women's clubs in turn. Men of the Army School of Meteorology at the University of Virginia were the only servicemen invited to the second dance, February 27, 1943, but thereafter all dances were open to all men in uniform. Parents were given assurance that their daughters who served as junior hostesses and dancing partners could do so only under the protective proprieties stipulated nationally by U. S. O. policy—for example, they were not to leave the building unless they were chaperoned. Transportation to their homes was provided by the clubs which supervised each dance, a detail for which the local War Price and Rationing Board specifically condoned the use of privately owned automobiles, the current ban on “pleasure driving” to the contrary notwithstanding.21 As the community Recreation Center the Old Armory continued, however, to maintain all of its regular civilian entertainment program. And in May and June, 1943, for example, after its facade had been repainted in white and blue colors in accordance with a design conceived by Frederick C. Disque, it played host contemporaneously and in rapid succession to the annual spring exhibit of the Albemarle Art League, a special exhibit of water colors, a dramatic production and dance for Greek relief, hillbilly dance open to the general public, and a dance for employees of Frank Ix and Sons, Inc., in celebration of their first Army-Navy “E” award.22 A widening understanding of the value of the U. S. O. program is indicated by the fact that in June, 1943, the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors appropriated $50 to the organization as a gift.23 Financial support of a more regular kind and formal affiliation with the national U. S. O. were gained at the end of the summer. Allotments in the annual U. S. O. budget and a definite status as a community-operated U. S. O. Club meant twin advantages for the organization and program which had been growing and changing as local needs developed during the first twenty months of American participation in the war. During these twenty months 1,432 packages had been given to local servicemen. Hosts had been found for a hundred British sailors and additional other visitors on leave. Free movie tickets had been issued to 508 transient and other servicemen, meal tickets to 246, and bowling tickets to 100. Sightseeing trips had been arranged for more than 100 men, and 415 servicemen travelling through the city in six military convoys had been entertained. During the six months since the Old Armory had been transformed into a U. S. O. Club 3,281 servicemen had attended its dances, and Sunday afternoon recreation had been provided for 1,057. Though the Recreation Department of the city government yielded to the cooperating U. S. O. Club many of its services to the men of the armed forces, it continued to maintain two of them. Reports in Miss Crow's office reveal that by January, 1946, a complimentary three months subscription to the local newspaper had been given to 1,128 white and 223 Negro servicemen as they left the city and the county. Each unit of local government financed this gift to its own personnel. The number of free meal tickets had mounted to 1,162, and 1,300 free movie tickets had been distributed. In the reorganization which accompanied the transition into direct affiliation with the U. S. O., Louis Chauvenet became chairman of the local board of directors. He was supported by subordinate officers, including Mrs. M. C. Stewart, secretary, and Fred L. Watson, treasurer, and by committees for the supervision of various divisions of the U. S. O. program.24 In November, 1943, a U. S. O. official came to Charlottesville to make a formal presentation of an official flag of the organization.25 Though she had in a sense relinquished the reins to other hands, however, Miss Crow's continuing interest and help are attested by the fact that she attended a conference of U. S. O. personnel in Richmond, Virginia, in the spring of 1944 and brought back recommendations for an expanded program. And in its behalf she spoke to local audiences.26 In November, 1944, Mrs. Robert V. Funsten succeeded Chauvenet as the head of the U. S. O. policy-making body, which was again reorganized, and Miss Louise O. Beall assumed the duties of executive secretary and treasurer, becoming in a different way as much the central figure in later days as Miss Crow had been in earlier ones.27 About a year later Captain Floyd Terry of the local Salvation Army succeeded Mrs. Funsten as chairman.28 Closer ties with the national U. S. O. did not mean the elimination of local financial support. Collections and sales of waste paper and other salvageable materials by city trucks had brought into the treasury of the U. S. O. Club and its predecessor recreation agencies a total of $1,898.26 by December, 1943, and the public was urged to continue its cooperation in the city's salvage efforts as an indirect means of giving more money to the U. S. O.29 By 1944 marked increases were noted in the number of transient servicemen who availed themselves of the club's facilities. Beds, showers, and washbasins had been installed to increase its usefulness. Within a few months the number of overnight guests leaped from approximately 90 to about 250 per month, and some statistician began to record such details as how many of them shaved in the building. The Saturday night dances usually attracted a hundred or more men and about half as many junior hostesses, and square dances were added to the club's program. More than 200 junior hostesses had been qualified: more than sixty senior hostesses and other volunteers were actively engaged in the work. Thirteen of the junior hostesses were presented the U. S. O. award of a pin and identification card at a formal dance in June, 1944, in recognition of fifty or more hours of service which they had given to the club.30 Full recompense for all the effort involved in successful management of an effective program was found in the form of appreciation frequently expressed by those for whom the recreation was planned. For example, two Seabees from northern states who were stationed at Camp Peary near Williamsburg, Virginia, wrote, “The way we were treated by everyone in Charlottesville, particularly the lady on duty at the U. S. O. at 8 P. M., Saturday evening, did a whole lot to restore our faith in what we had read about the South and its people. Your U. S. O. stands way over those in other cities in Virginia we have visited, and your U. S. O. dance on Saturday night was real enjoyment to a couple of lonesome and homesick 'Seabees.' ”31 Superimposed upon the U. S. O.'s regular entertainment program were various special demands to which it invariably responded. One of these was its continuation of the policy of welcoming to the community men of the navies of allies of the United States. In this service the U. S. O. had the cooperation of the Recreation Department of Charlottesville's city government and of many people of the city and of the county. The groups of British sailors who had begun in October, 1942, to spend in the community their week or thereabouts of leave from ships which were under repair continued to flow into the city during the first several weeks of 1943 while the Old Armory was undergoing its transformation into a U. S. O. Club. In this period of the throes of the inauguration of the U. S. O. in Charlottesville the Recreation Department was finding temporary homes for about fourteen new men of the Royal Navy who arrived every third day.32 The society page of The Daily Progress announced one afternoon in January, 1943, the names of twenty-six English sailors who had come from Norfolk, Virginia, to be during the past week honored guests in fourteen homes of the city and of the county.33 The next month's visitors included five British sailors who came from a vessel docked in the Philadelphia Navy Yard.34 Again in the fall and winter of 1944–45 householders of the community were asked to open their homes to English “tars” who were expected to arrive daily in groups of eight for placement in pairs in private homes. Characteristic of the Britishers were their liking for tea brewed very strong, their “attractive accents,” and their preference in American music for “Bing [Crosby] to Frankie [Sinatra].” One of them referred to the U. S. O. as “The Ask and Ye Shall Receive.” All were grateful for the U. S. O.'s share in promoting Anglo-American good will, but they were usually “more anxious for quiet home life than for parties and entertainment.”35 One local hostess, Mrs. Roy Howard of Simeon, was so pleased over her experience in entertaining two of the Englishmen that she was inspired to broadcast her reactions to it through the medium of a signed letter to the editor of The Daily Progress. “The U. S. O. in Charlottesville had asked for homes to be opened for British seamen and we were in doubt whether to take any or not,” she confessed, “since we are busy farmers. We were anxious to help and had been told they were little trouble so we took two on short leave. We were so pleased with them that we telephoned for more. We were sent two seamen that had been in a hospital and were given several days leave. They were so much pleasure to us that we hated to see the time come for them to leave. They told us so much of their homes in the British Isles and of different countries they had seen. One of the boys gained so much weight and his color improved so [much] that he hardly looked like the same person. It was gratifying to know that for our small trouble we had really helped our allies. The boys did not require any waiting on and were so helpful in every way, in fact they were a pleasure and not a bother. Our kind neighbors were so anxious to help and offered their eggs, cream, and anything that we did not have enough of ... Try taking some of these boys,” she advised all who might read her letter, enumerating three reasons for such hospitality, “the U. S. O. will appreciate it, the boys will enjoy it, and you will be more than thankful you could help.”36 Mrs. Howard's assertion that she had asked the U. S. O. to send her more of the British sailors is substantiated by the fact that she was among fourteen hostesses who responded overnight to a new appeal issued by the U. S. O. a couple of months later.37 Nor were Britishers the only nationality which found that furloughs in and near Charlottesville could be pleasant. Upon at least two occasions French sailors were entertained in the community. Through the U. S. O. arrangements for a visit in Charlottesville were made for one pair of them who evidently thought local hospitality was famous enough to justify their writing to the city's mayor a request that they be invited into the home of “a family who would receive us for a few days.” In their imperfect English they closed their wistful appeal, “If possible we like somebody who speak French.”38 To another pair, who were spending their leave in an unidentified home at Greenwood, the language barrier seems to have been less of a handicap. Indeed, when they were interviewed at lunch with a Charlottesville girl, their compliments for all they observed hereabouts were quite as fluent as they were flattering. “It is a very nice country,” they asserted, “pretty much the same as southern France. And the girls, they are very pretty. Thanks to them, we are having a very good time. In fact, we like all Americans, because of their ideologies. After our ship is repaired, we will sail again to fight the Japs and the Germans. Vive L'Amerique! Vive La France!”39 Various groups of servicemen and servicewomen of the United States were occasionally special guests of the local U. S. O. Club. Approximately a hundred convalescent soldiers from the Woodrow Wilson General Hospital near Staunton, Virginia, were invited by the U. S. O. one Saturday evening to see a production of the Gay Nineties melodrama, “Ten Nights in a Bar Room,” and to enjoy its usual dance. The University of Virginia cooperated by giving them complimentary tickets to an intercollegiate football game at Scott Stadium that afternoon.40 When a smaller group of convalescents from the Army hospital at Camp Pickett near Blackstone, Virginia, arrived for a sightseeing tour, the U. S. O. added afternoon tea to the picnic lunch which had been served to them at Monticello by the local Red Cross.41 More than fifty young ladies who came from an Army office in Washington, D. C., for a week-end of sightseeing were special guests at the Saturday night dance of that week, and upon another occasion the local U. S. O. arranged a Sunday tour of local points of interest for thirty-six Navy women from the nation's capital.42 The one contingent of nearby service personnel, soldiers whose duty was confining and prevented their being entertained as a group, was not overlooked. Since they could not come to it, the club took at least a part of the U. S. O. to the guards of the German prisoner of war camp at White Hall by donating to them a radio, porch furniture, reading matter, and other comforts. In cooperation with the local Red Cross and other agencies the U. S. O. Club saw to it that they had a homelike Christmas complete with decorations, lights for their tree, and a gift for each guard.43 When the end of the war came, the U. S. O. was meeting still another need by serving as an information bureau through which service personnel and some civilians who were in the city for sightseeing or for other reasons could be directed to what had by then become one of the scarcest things in town, a room for rent.44 On May 20, 1945, twelve days after the surrender of Germany, the U. S. O. sponsored the first of numerous memorial services in honor of the war dead of Charlottesville and Albemarle County who would not return from their varying duties in the Second World War. Practically all white and Negro organizations, clubs, and groups of every kind were represented in this tribute, and citizens from every section of the community also attended the ceremony, which was held in the auditorium of Lane High School. All participated in appropriate exercises and saw the names of 110 servicemen and servicewomen then known to have died emblazoned on a large gold star before the flags of the United Nations.45 During several months after firing ceased on distant battlefronts use of the local U. S. O. facilities continued at a high level, but in the spring of 1946 there was observed a great decrease in the number of servicemen who availed themselves of its services. The end of its role was obviously approaching. As it retreated from the center of the stage toward the wings, it made two final bows. Early in February, 1946, it entertained the general public and honored some of the volunteers who had contributed to its success by giving a Sunday afternoon birthday party in celebration of the fifth anniversary of the organization of the national U. S. O.46 The final Saturday evening dance was held on May 25, 1946, and constituted a well attended and fitting public finale to three and one-half years of service since local use of the U. S. O. name and insignia had been authorized. In a ceremony which preceded the dance Miss Louise O. Beall, who had been throughout approximately half of this period the mainstay of the organization, was presented with a corsage from the junior hostesses and a bracelet from the senior hostesses in appreciation of her leadership. Service pins were awarded to eight junior hostesses, fourteen senior hostesses, and six men who had contributed to the success of the organization many volunteer hours of willing work. Among these men were Captain Floyd Terry, the club's last chairman, and William Jackson, who had been its counsellor and committee chairman from the beginning in all matters relating to Negro servicemen.47 Mrs. Robert V. Funsten and Mr. and Mrs. James F. Minor had previously received pins in recognition of the more than 500 hours of service which each had donated.48 Those present at the final dance also heard a reading of a letter of praise and appreciation which had been received from Captain S. H. Hurt, commanding officer of the Navy V-12 unit of students at the University of Virginia, writing in behalf of servicemen who had regularly enjoyed the dances and other features of the U. S. O. program. Referring to the “unselfish efforts” of the volunteers who had constantly welcomed the men of his command, Captain Hurt's letter concluded. “Now that these services no longer are required, I wish to say thank you and to add the Navy's traditional phrase, 'Well done.' ”49 Following this swan song dance, the club remained open for the accommodation of a few transients during the next two and one-half weeks. On June 15, 1946, it was closed, and five days later its board of directors assembled for their final session.50 The building reverted to the use of the Recreation Department of the city government. An incomplete but indicative conception of the extent of the local U. S. O. Club's services can be gained by pondering the meaning of the following eloquent statistics covering October 1, 1943-April 30, 1946. It had played host to a recorded total of 10,832 transient servicemen, of whom 2,624 had been overnight guests and 3,845 had been accommodated for showers and shaves. Approximately 1,000 had been taken on sightseeing trips, and rental accommodations had been found for 275 or more. Servicemen who attended dances and parties had numbered 19,508. The dances had been planned and supervised by as many as 395 persons, and dancers had been entertained by a total of 311 junior hostesses, who had served 21,092 recorded hours. There had been 655 senior hostesses and other volunteers whose reported hours of service totaled 12,350. And, within this period of less than 1,000 days, a total of 39,788 servicemen, volunteer workers, and visitors had entered the building and had found the cheer and relaxation which had become synonymous throughout the world with the magical initials U. S. O.51 Relief Bundles for Britain was the first war relief organization to strike a responsive chord in the hearts of the people of Charlottesville and Albemarle County after the German “blitzkrieg” against France and near-capture of the British army at Dunkirk. The agency had been founded in the United States in December, 1939, for the purpose of sending necessities and comforts to the people of the embattled islands which soon were so near to—and yet so far from—the western limit of Nazi conquest. About the first of July, 1940, when it was beginning to become clear that in the near future the Germans could leap the English Channel only in the comparatively small numbers permitted by aerial transportation, the Charlottesville Branch of Bundles for Britain was organized to bolster British morale against the destructive air raids which were to follow the debacle in France. Mrs. Paul White came from the central office in New York City to assist in the organization of Bundles for Britain's local branch. She was welcomed by a group of women of the city and county in the home of Miss Ruth Risher (Mrs. John W. Wheeler-Bennett) on Oakhurst Circle in Charlottesville. A Britisher born and bred, Mrs. Arthur Frank Macconochie of Farmington, was their undisputed choice to serve as president of the local branch. Other officers elected included Mrs. William H. White, Jr., vice president: Miss Risher, secretary; Mrs. Edwin P. Lehman, corresponding secretary; and Harry Frazier, Jr., treasurer. These selections remained unchanged throughout all or most of the war: Miss Risher retained her position even while serving with the American Red Cross in the Middle East.52 The basic and most constant service of the enthusiastic women of the Charlottesville Branch was the knitting of warm woolen clothing for use across the Atlantic. Its members set up shop in the J. D. and J. S. Tilman department store. There knitting needles, wool, and knitting bags were distributed, and articles bearing the British coat of arms were sold. After about a year they moved their headquarters into a Corner shop which had been secured rent free. Sweaters, socks, sea boots, scarves, and headgear were produced by as many as several hundred women at an average rate of about twenty-five per week throughout the war years. Some of these garments were given directly to British sailors when they visited in the community while their vessels were undergoing repairs. In a letter of thanks to Charlottesville and Albemarle workers of Bundles for Britain one of these men of the Royal Navy expressed his appreciation not only for the organization's gift but also for the attitude of local residents toward the visiting Englishmen. “The thing that has touched us ... who are so far away from our homes is the great kindness and friendliness shown to us ...; and when we get back to England you can rest assured that we [will] take back an excellent report of the American people.”53 Other locally knitted garments furnished emergency relief to British civilians who had been bombed out of their homes. The greater part of them, however, helped to clothe with comfortable accessories the men of Great Britain's armed forces scattered over widespread battlefronts, especially those stationed in cold and frigid areas. Supplementing daily work on the production of clothing for the British, the Charlottesville Branch of Bundles for Britain occasionally found opportunities to raise substantial sums of money for other specific needs of the English. A benefit reception was held at the Farmington Country Club on August 2, 1940, in honor of the movie star Madeleine Carroll, a native of England who was then in the community for the filming of the technicolor motion picture “Virginia.” Among other Britishers present were Lady Russell, author of Elizabeth and Her German Garden, and John W. WheelerBennett, thorough student of the modern world. Through this reception the fledgling local Bundles for Britain group raised about $700. To meet what was then England's most crying need, this sum was devoted to the purchase of surgical instruments and medical supplies. In the summer of 1940 the British-American Ambulance Corps, working through the national Bundles for Britain organization, began to solicit gifts for the purchase in the United States of sorely needed ambulances, which cost approximately $1,350 each. Mrs. William Hall Goodwin became chairman of the local ambulance drive and was photographed, together with other Bundles for Britain leaders, on East Main Street while standing in front of a specially labelled automobile used in the promotion of donations for this appealing cause.54 Before the end of the war the local group had collected enough money for the shipment to England of four of these vehicles of mercy. Pummeled with destructive explosives from the air, Great Britain was also in urgent need of mobile canteens during the second half of the year 1940. These kitchens on wheels were used to carry hot food to stricken people in bombed cities. One of Albemarle County's most famous twentieth century daughters, Nancy Langhorne of “Mirador” near Greenwood, who had crossed the Atlantic to become Lady Astor and a member of the British Parliament, transmitted through her niece, Mrs. Ronald Tree of “Mirador,” and Mrs. Chiswell Perkins a request that several mobile canteens be supplied by gifts from her native community. In support of this appeal Mrs. Macconochie delivered a stirring address over the local radio station, WCHV, on September 9, 1940. She reminded her listeners, “We ... can lay our heads on our pillows at night secure in the knowledge that our roofs will still be over us when we awake,” and confidently expressed her conviction “that we want to continue to help the valiant people in Britain over whom the wrath of modern warfare has burst in all its fury.” Referring to the “direct request” from England for rolling kitchens, she pledged that “all future donations to Bundles for Britain” received by the Charlottesville Branch would be allocated to the mobile kitchen fund “until we have reached our goal.” The people of the community forthwith provided adequate funds to make possible prompt shipment of five of these canteens. In a special dispatch to the Charlottesville Daily Progress a British novelist, Elspeth Huxley, who had been a prewar visitor in the city, traced the result of another handshake across the sea. “It's a long way from Charlottesville, Virginia, to Malmesbury, Wiltshire, England,” she wrote, “yet there's a link connecting the two. Some time back the Charlottesville chapter of Bundles for Britain made a very handsome gesture. They sent over the money to buy a mobile tea kitchen to serve lonely outposts of British soldiers and airmen. In due course the tea kitchen was built and equipped and became Mobile Tea Kitchen No. 833, attached to the Y. M. C. A.'s fleet. And it was put on the road in the Malmesbury area of Wiltshire where I live. So I've seen it on duty, and now I've been privileged to drive it on its rounds. ...”55 A variety of special events followed the Madeleine Carroll reception on the local Bundles for Britain calendar. John W. WheelerBennett described “The Battle of Britain” to an impressed audience in Cabell Hall at the University of Virginia. His observations of the aerial peril to which England was exposed were of the graphic sort which only a recently returned eyewitness could have been capable of revealing. A Christmas Fair was held at the Farmington Country Club to raise money. The Keswick Hunt Club gave a benefit horse show at “Beau Val.” And in June, 1941, an auction of prized possessions donated by generous friends of the cause was held at Farmington. Antique furniture, boxwood, and thoroughbred puppies were among the items which went on the auction block and produced a revenue of about $750. But there was also offered an exciting royal antique of a more surprising kind. The “Chips About Charlottesville” column of the local newspaper enthused over a detailed description of a genuine Irish linen undergarment—a chemise or slip—which had belonged to Queen Victoria and on which one could see the imperial crown done in fine red stitches. “We have heard of movie stars being mobbed by fans” and losing parts of their clothing, the awed columnist commented, “but think of being able to boast that you own the Queen's slip.”56 When Lord Halifax, England's ambassador to the United States, and Lady Halifax visited “Mirador” in 1941, Mrs. Macconochie pinned a Bundles for Britain button on him. It was then revealed that several young English refugees, including a niece and a nephew of Queen Elizabeth, had been evacuated to “Mirador” and had resided there for some time.57 An announcement made by the Charlottesville Branch of Bundles for Britain at the end of its first year reported that the people of the community had contributed to it a total of $15,587.80. In addition to previously mentioned gifts which had been sent across the Atlantic, this sum had helped to provide three large payments to the Queen's Hospital for Children in London, two lots of new blankets, two consignments of new clothes, and twenty air raid shelter cots.58 Among many grateful letters of acknowledgment from England came one which was especially pleasing. On July 2, 1941, Mrs. Winston Churchill wrote from 10 Downing Street to Mrs. Macconochie: “I have been told that the Chapter of [Bundles for Britain in] Charlottesville, Virginia, of which you are President, has sent a substantial sum of money to the Queen's Hospital for Children, and as Honorary Sponsor for Bundles for Britain, I write to tell you how much we over here appreciate this and all your organization is doing. We thank you for your generosity and for your thought and care for our people.” After Pearl Harbor many Americans felt that efforts previously directed toward aid for England should be diverted to services for the armed forces of the United States. Indeed, a local unit of the new Bundles for America organization was established in Charlottesville with Mrs. Edward Gamble as president, assisted by Mrs. Robert Kent Gooch. Sharing the quarters of Bundles for Britain, it dispensed wool for the knitting of garments for American servicemen. But Bundles for America did not supersede Bundles for Britain. Though she observed a decline in the number of her knitters, Mrs. Macconochie and her cohorts continued to maintain an active group until July, 1945.59 By then victory had been won in Europe, and there were no longer such desperate needs in the battered but unbowed British Isles. In the period before American entry into the war there had also been in Charlottesville another British war relief organization independent of Bundles for Britain. Its original and special concern was Queen Charlotte's Hospital in London. This hospital had been founded long ago by the Queen Charlotte for whom the small and centrally located eighteenth century town in Albemarle County, Virginia, was named. Some years before Hitler launched the German armies on their fateful rampage this institution had given a benefit ball with a colonial Charlottesville decor inspired by sketches which Mrs. James Keith Symmers of Charlottesville had drawn and sent to London for the occasion. When the hospital began to suffer German bomb damage, Mrs. Symmers received an appeal for aid. She enlisted the interest of others and soon had built a small but effective organization. Judge A. D. Dabney served as its president, Bernard P. Chamberlain as vice president, and Dr. W. D. Haden as treasurer. State Senator John S. Battle, University President John Lloyd Newcomb, and other prominent citizens were members of its board or gave it their support. The chief achievement of this group was the raising of a substantial sum promptly donated to the hospital. One of its beds was thereby endowed and was named Charlottesville. Such transitory impulses of generosity are easily forgotten, and so events proved in this instance. Almost a year after England had last been bombed Mayor Roscoe S. Adams of Charlottesville received a letter of gratitude from a mother whose “bonny baby” had recently been born in Queen Charlotte's Hospital. As “one of the many mothers who have occupied the Charlottesville bed,” she wanted to thank him “or whoever is responsible for the upkeep of the bed.” His Honor the mayor and a local newspaper columnist could not recall or ascertain who should receive the appreciative mother's thanks.60 Evidently spurred by its initial success, the group which had endowed the hospital bed was transformed during the autumn of 1941 into an agency for more general British war relief. Jesse B. Wilson became president, and other officers retained their positions. Articles procured from British War Relief headquarters in New York City were sold for Britons' benefit, first in the O. E. and C. L. Hawkins store downtown and then in the building which later became the University Cafeteria. Admittedly, the proceeds of the operation of this shop did not rival the income of the local branch of Bundles for Britain, but this relief work was supplemented by the mailing of garden seeds and children's toys to hungry and tired victims of Nazi destruction in England. In good time the members of this group pooled their efforts with those of the Charlottesville Branch of Bundles for Britain in connection with a clothing collection campaign and willingly lost their separate identity.61 Early in the war, at the time of the Italian invasion of Greece, efforts were made in the United States through the Greek War Relief Association in New York City to alleviate suffering in that nation before the total occupation by German and Italian troops could be completed and all ports of entry closed. In this campaign the local organization was headed by Gus Gianakos as president. William Pappas was vice president and Nicholas Velle treasurer. The sum of $3,900 was raised. After a drive for the collection of used clothing in 1944 the American-Greek people of Charlottesville shipped a ton of usable garments.62 Nor did residents of the locality overlook the distress of the downtrodden Chinese, who had been fighting against a ruthless invader in an almost hopeless warfare longer than any of the world's embattled peoples. Upon request of United China Relief, Inc., the gift of $2,000 was asked of the community in 1942. The Business and Professional Women's Club, of which Mrs. Elizabeth Beard was then president, accepted the responsibility of equalling or excelling this amount. Almost as soon as the club made it known that money was needed for this cause, checks poured in without special solicitation, and the quota was promptly oversubscribed by ten per cent. Wendell Willkie, honorary president of United China Relief, congratulated the club by telegram upon its immediate success. Mrs. Beard also received an Award of Recognition issued by the democratic administration in China in appreciation of the community's assistance to its hard-pressed republican faction. Signed by Mayling Soong Chiang (Madame Chiang Kai Shek), this certificate of gratitude was brought in 1943 to the United States in person by the wife of China's chief executive. There were uncounted numbers of organized and individual efforts to send clothing and food to various destinations where normal living had been disrupted by the iron hand of war. In the spring of 1944, for example, local Parent-Teacher Associations collected in the New Armory discarded garments donated in the “Share Your Clothes With Russia” campaign. Though the Anglo-American second front assault against northern Europe had not at that time been initiated and the Soviets had borne the chief brunt of the costly task of reversing Germany's early successes, a day or two before the close of this drive receipts were described as being “very light.” The Charlottesville Ministerial Association endorsed six months later a clothing collection in the city's churches for refugees who had been freed from the Nazi yoke. The appeal this time had emanated from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. That new agency was also to distribute the 3,000 cans of vegetables and fruits from the city and the county which were requested at the height of the vegetable garden season in 1945. The Charlottesville and Scottsville Canning Centers cooperated in preparing this contribution to foreign relief.63 The interdenominational group of white and Negro women in the Charlottesville branch of the United Council of Church Women did much after V-J Day to help families overseas whose destitute condition, which was then revealed for the first time in something approaching representatively stark perspective, shocked the world. News that many small babies utterly lacked proper clothing gave rise to a drive by American church women to ship a million diapers across the oceans. The women of Charlottesville sent 2,347 of them. Within the year 1946, in a room assigned to them in Christ Episcopal Church, these women also gathered 2,740 pounds of clothing, counted up 2,115 pounds of tinned foods, assembled more than thirty kits each of which contained two dozen articles of clothing for small children, and collected $772.80 for the purchase of food in bulk. Mrs. W. Roy Mason was the leader in this work. Whenever and wherever the status of international mail delivery would permit the sending of individual packages to relatives or friends abroad, people in the locality would dispatch carefully selected and painstakingly wrapped parcels. About two years after firing ceased in Europe at least five packages were sent by unknown donors to a total stranger in vanquished Germany. Mrs. Margarete Meissner of Hessen had written to Charlottesville asking for any special gifts available. Her appeal was broadcast with excellent results. The story of her success in making charity prevail over enmity was deemed worthy of publication in a local newspaper column. Her acknowledgment read: “My English is not sufficient to express my and my five little ones' thanks for your wonderful parcels containing so many delicious things! We should have desired you could have seen our joy. May God bless you!”64 A more personal and rewarding method of trying to counterbalance the deprivations of war in Europe was discovered by some local people. Through an international social service organization they assumed financial responsibilities for French and Belgian children who had been orphaned and were being brought up in institutional homes across the Atlantic. Episcopalian women of Greenwood and Crozet thus adopted a three-year old Belgian boy, contributing $15 per month for his support and showering him with presents. Four named women of the city and county took war orphans under their individual wings. The foster parent of a ten year old French girl was pleased to receive letters from her protege. By way of explaining why she had undertaken something which might easily be a burden as well as a joy, this citizen of Charlottesville said, “I feel we all ought to open our hearts to the world's suffering in some way, and I hit upon this method.”65 And a good one it was, at that. In another and somewhat different type of charitable war relief Charlottesville provided Virginia's leadership in a nationwide effort. The American Library Association, the American Red Cross, and the United Service Organizations, Inc., launched on January 12, 1942, a Victory Book Campaign to supplement the government's already existing library facilities for servicemen. Army camps, Navy bases, ships sailing the seven seas, U. S. O. clubs, and other places where men in uniform congregated were in need, it was estimated, of 10,000,000 books to provide their personnel with adequate reading matter of both technical and recreational sorts. Miss Mary Louise Dinwiddie, assistant librarian of the Alderman Library of the University of Virginia, served as director of the campaign in Virginia during the first war year. Within two weeks after Pearl Harbor, in advance of the opening of the drive, she had begun to make her plans. Under her leadership a total of 36,956 volumes were collected and forwarded through proper channels to servicemen, who were ever hungry for something to read. Almost ten per cent of these—3,169 books—were gathered at the Alderman Library alone.66 The Alderman Library also served the nation in an unpublicized capacity which remained highly secret until enemy air raids were no longer feared and which has not even yet been broadcast in full and rich detail among the “now it can be told” stories of the war. In panicky days of shock which followed Pearl Harbor irreplaceable treasures of the Library of Congress were evacuated under the watchful eyes of formidable guard details to five locations which were thought to be safer from the possibility of enemy attack. More than two and one half years later, when they were brought back to the District of Columbia, the Librarian of Congress found himself fairly bursting to break the news of a secret which a hundred or more Charlottesville and University people had helped him to keep. So eager was he to put on record his appreciation for indispensable cooperation that he introduced the whole subject into his Annual Report for the past fiscal year, which had not at the time gone to press, rather than let it await its proper place in the Annual Report which he should write later for the fiscal year then current. His account of this evacuation omits mention of the multiple conferences, telephone calls, and letters between members of his staff, on the one hand, and Librarian Harry Clemons, University President John Lloyd Newcomb, and other University officials, on the other. Nor did he Miss Dinwiddie and an assistant sort Victory Book Campaign volumes in the Alderman Library. in a formal report indulge in what might have been colorful descriptions of the vicissitudes of travel between Washington, D. C., and Charlottesville, the midnight arrivals of guarded trucks which were almost furtively unloaded before dawn at the library, and the special provisions and adjustments which were made locally to permit the storage of unopened packing cases, to accommodate workmen when they needed to catch a few winks of sleep in the library building, or to arrange scores of incidentals—some of them as humorous as they were covert—which developed in the course of a very friendly and mutually pleasing cooperation. Nor does he reveal that the enormous manuscript collections entrusted to the University for dead storage were supplemented by the working collection of millions of cards which constitute the Union Catalog of the Library of Congress, the most valuable single research tool in the nation, which, together with its staff, was moved to new quarters in the Alderman Library and continued to grow more priceless throughout the period of its evacuation. But what the Librarian of Congress did say within the restrictions of his formality reveals by implication something of the atmosphere which surrounded all stages of this wartime removal and which permeated the thinking of local people who were “in the know” about the University's role as protector of an incalculable portion of the nation's recorded heritage. What he wrote on this subject is of sufficient local interest to warrant republication: “The most important single fact about the recent history of the collections of the Library of Congress is a fact which belongs properly in the Annual Report to be written a year from now. Our principal holdings, evacuated to five depositories in the interior of the continent immediately after Pearl Harbor, were returned to Washington in August and September of 1944, two to three months after the landing on the Normandy coast. To wait for a year to signalize this event would sacrifice historical interest to the dictatorship of the calendar. Furthermore, those responsible for the transportation over the Blue Ridge and over the Alleghanies of 4,789 cases of books and manuscripts valued in uncountable millions of dollars should not be obliged to wait until spring of the year 1946 to read in the official report of the Librarian that their work was well done. “The Keeper of the Collections, Alvin W. Kremer, his assistant, Richard M. LaRoche, and their colleagues on the staff of the Library and on its guard force, carried throughout this period a responsibility as heavy, at least insofar as posterity is concerned, as that carried by military and governmental officials in any field. It may well be debated, now that the materials have been safely returned, whether or not they should ever have been sent. As to that, it can only be said that any man can be wise in retrospect and that problems of this character have a very different look to those responsible and to those not responsible for their solution. In any case, the original move was made on the advice of the military authorities and with the counsel of a committee of the responsible custodial officers of the United States Government appointed for the 'Conservation of Cultural Resources' belonging to the Government. The materials were held at depositories approved by the military authorities, and it was not until an opinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had been obtained that the return to Washington of our greatest treasures was finally ordered. “The Library of Congress, and through the Library the people of the United States, are lastingly indebted to the institutions which freely and generously offered the use of storage space, which they could have employed to advantage themselves, for the safeguarding of our evacuated materials. During the period of evacuation reference to the names and locations of these depositories was forbidden under the code of voluntary censorship and by military regulation. It is now possible to announce that they were: the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, which permitted us to use valuable and highly protected space in its Alderman Library, including the Treasure Room of that Library, its Law Library and its School of Engineering; Washington and Lee University at Lexington, which permitted us to use not only stack areas, but rooms as well in its McCormick Library; Virginia Military Institute, also at Lexington, which provided large areas in its Preston Library; Denison University at Granville, Ohio, which made available space in its Library, in its Science and Life Building, and in its Chapel; and the United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox, where the Constitution of the United States, the Declaration of Independence, the Magna Carta, the Gutenberg Bible, the Articles of Confederation, the manuscripts of the Gettysburg Address and the manuscript of Lincoln's Second Inaugural were guarded day and night throughout the entire period of their absence from Washington. “No mere acknowledgment of indebtedness, and no mere words of gratitude, can begin to express our sense of obligation to the officers of these various institutions and to the librarians and custodians in immediate charge of the occupied space. Their patient and uncomplaining acceptance of the inevitable annoyances resulting from the presence of our 24-hour guards in their buildings and our piled up cases in their halls and stacks, speaks eloquently of their generosity, their devotion, and—for no other word is wholly expressive—their patriotism.' ”67 Prompted by the multiplicity of wartime appeals for foreign relief and the wartime necessity of the most efficient possible type of organization and operation in all local welfare work, the community achieved midway through the struggle a unification of the formerly numerous requests for charitable contributions. The Charlottesville and Albemarle Community and War Fund was organized in the summer of 1943. In its single annual solicitation for about a dozen local health and welfare agencies and for the local share of all nationally approved war relief services, as opposed to a score or more of separate annual money raising campaigns, there was implicit an obvious economy of time, energy, and money. Moreover, programs of the local social service offices could be more closely coordinated, and a broader understanding of community integration evolved. And, in respect to the War Fund division of the new organization, the uneven results of sporadic peaks of enthusiasm and of special temporary efforts in behalf of one wartime charity or another were eliminated by a carefully considered national apportionment of all War Fund receipts among the U. S. O. and many foreign relief organizations.68 In a Virginia War Fund meeting in Richmond on June 8, 1943, State Senator John S. Battle, Dr. W. D. Haden, and Jack Rinehart represented Charlottesville.69 The War Fund was allotted $32,800 of the $73,685 goal of the first local Community and War Fund campaign, which was oversubscribed by $6,164 in the autumn of 1943. Approximately $32,500 was given to the War Fund in each of the next three years, which saw successive objectives of $73,369, $80,369, and $76,375 exceeded by an average of about twenty-five per cent.70 When these generous annual contributions are added to the many indeterminable dollars which the people of Charlottesville and Albemarle County had already donated to an incalculable number of war relief projects of every possible nature and scope, one can be pardoned for surprise that they did not themselves become objects of the charity of others. An inherent humanitarianism, readily touched by the plight of the world's unfortunates, seems to be the only satisfactory explanation for purse strings loosened so freely in an era of unprecedentedly high taxes and despite other inescapable financial pressures. X Guarding the Home Front When the peacetime protector of the Commonwealth, the Virginia National Guard, was called into Federal service supposedly for twelve months, it became necessary to organize a stop-gap unit to function pending the return of the Guardsmen. Therefore the Virginia Protective Force was organized on February 3, 1941, to operate at the call of the Governor to quell domestic disturbances throughout the state. When it became evident that the Virginia National Guard was destined to be in the Army for the “duration” rather than to return after one year to its native state, the Protective Force assumed a more permanent cast and took on the additional function of protecting the Commonwealth from sabotage and possible attacks by enemy troops. Another defense organization, the Civil Air Patrol, sprang into being after Pearl Harbor and became the aerial guardian of the home front. Happily, these two organizations were never called on to be defenders of Charlottesville and Albemarle County. The fact that their very existence served as a deterring influence upon potential fifth column activities justified their creation and continuance; moreover, their numerous contributions to the cause of home front mobilization, in roles other than that of protector, demanded their perpetuation until the war's end. To the Virginia Protective Force was added the Virginia Reserve Militia, an organization founded on May 20, 1942, designed to protect the cities and counties in which the units were formed. Together the V.P.F. and the V.R.M. reached a strength of over 11,000 men, the largest armed force ever commanded by a governor of Virginia. These two complementary groups drilled faithfully for the variety of tasks which could confront the voluntary defenders of the Commonwealth. The members gave unstintingly of their time and energy, performing vital guard missions until Army units or civilian agencies were prepared to take over, assisting in practice blackouts, and lending a martial air to patriotic gatherings and parades.1 Virginia State Guard Plans for the organization of the Charlottesville unit of the Virginia Protective Force, Company 103, were in the making before the departure of the Monticello Guard. At the banquet for the Guard, just prior to its being called into Federal service, Captain Edward V. Walker, who had been designated to command the Charlottesville company of the new organization, told the Guardsmen that their places would be filled by the Virginia Protective Force during their absence. Walker announced a seven-man committee to enlist recruits for the new company, to be composed of a maximum of sixty. The popular zeal for the Protective Force became evident at an organizational meeting, on February 10, 1941, when eighty applications for membership were received. A week later at a meeting at the Court House, forty men, the minimum number for a company, took the oath of enlistment administered by Captain Walker. The commanding officer stated that he had submitted recommendations for James Philip Grove and Sterling L. Williamson to be first and second lieutenants, respectively. On the night of March 3, 1941, Company 103, Virginia Protective Force (the title was changed to Virginia State Guard in February, 1944), with fifty-three members, was mustered into the service. Governor James H. Price, making an unexpected visit to the New Armory, praised Captain Walker and his company on the enthusiasm demonstrated in the organization of the unit.2 The newly-created militia was not a “home guard” but rather was subject to duty throughout the state, just as had been true in the case of the National Guard. Also like the Guard, the arms for the Force were furnished by the War Department. The men received no pay for their service but were required to meet two hours each week for drill and instruction. Company 103 of the V.P.F. was outfitted originally with a blue-gray uniform consisting of shirt, trousers, and mackinaw purchased with funds provided by the city and the county. In April, 1942, the state allotted $18,000 for the purchase of summer uniforms of khaki. The distinguishing insignia was a shoulder patch, on which appeared the Virginia state seal circled by the words “Protective Force.” Later the words “Virginia State Guard” were substituted thereon.3 As the organization of the state militia was rounded out, Charlottesville was designated as battalion headquarters for the 10th Battalion. Captain Walker was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel to command this newly-created unit, which was composed of companies in Charlottesville, Fredericksburg, Harrisonburg, and Staunton. Colonel Walker announced that Walter E. Fowler, Jr., who had formerly been a lieutenant in the Monticello Guard, had been made a captain in the V.P.F. and battalion adjutant. Louis J. Matacia, one of the organizers of Company 103, became battalion sergeant major.4 The men trained with a great deal of ardor, and after the first quarterly inspection Colonel Walker commented that “the company is in excellent condition, considering the fact that it has had four months training at one drill per week, and is now ready to fulfill any obligation that may be imposed upon it.”5 When Frank Ix, Jr., of Charlottesville presented the men with locally-manufactured neckties to be worn with their blue-gray uniforms, he stated that units of the type of Company 103 should cancel fear “from without or from within.”6 Throughout the summer of 1941 the training of the company continued with parades, schools, and maneuvers. Four representatives from Company 103 and the 10th Battalion attended a two-day school at Virginia Military Institute during early July.7 The Fourth found the company participating in the Independence Day parade. The Monticello Guard returned from Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, for the event, which turned out to be a wet affair, as a sudden downpour caught the paraders.8 Company 103 also received its share of promotions during the summer, for when Grove was raised to the rank of captain, Williamson was promoted to first lieutenant, and Charles L. Wingfield became the junior officer in the unit.9 The summer's activities culminated in week-end maneuvers at Camp Albemarle, near Free Union. Regular Army discipline was maintained with a schedule which included more than a little close order drill. Captain Grove took a platoon of his company to Free Union for a demonstration of problems in riot duty. Meanwhile a detachment under Lieutenant Wingfield captured the camp and the forces therein without arousing the camp guard under Sergeant Harry Craven. Some members of the company commented that they got more out of the maneuvers “than a month's training at the Armory.”10 During the fall and winter there was no letdown from the activities of the summer. The organization of the 10th Battalion was rounded out by the formation of a medical section. Captain John F. McGavock, battalion surgeon, was assisted in his duties by seven enlisted men.11 The first assembly of the 10th Battalion was held at Scott Stadium during the morning of the annual University of Virginia-Virginia Military Institute football game, which was attended that afternoon by the battalion as guests of the University of Virginia. The Adjutant General and other officials of Virginia were present that morning for the battalion's review and parade. Company 103 received its first call to active military duty when two men were detailed to guard the Armory each night as a precautionary measure. Privates Jack Early and William C. Chamberlain, 10th Battalion Staff, Virginia State Guard, poses for a portrait in March, 1945. Jr., first performed this duty on the night of December 10, 1941.12 This assignment, coming close on the heels of Pearl Harbor, was shortly followed by a call for a nine-man, twenty-four hour guard of the University's Rouss Physical Laboratory. The detail came as a Christmas present to Company 103, for the duty was initiated on December 25 and continued for approximately ten days until a federal agency assumed the responsibility.13 Local curiosity as to the purpose of the guard was not relieved by the authorities, nor has it been to date. It is now known, however, that “important work on a high-speed centrifuge was done by J. W. Beams and others at the University of Virginia” in connection with the research in progress throughout the country on atomic energy.14 It is also known that fifty-seven University scientists received government certificates of commendation for wartime research.15 It is ironic to note how close some laymen came to guessing the nature and importance of the research, without realizing it, as is illustrated by an article in The Daily Progress. After commenting on the “Beams ultra high speed rotor,” the article concluded, “Lest some get the impression that this amazing apparatus is responsible for the sentries it should be explained that it is not an instrument of destruction, but was built to aid medical researchers.”16 Beginning December 13, 1941, and continuing through many months of 1942 three members of Company 103 served with men from the other companies of the 10th Battalion in maintaining a twenty-four hour guard over the strategic highway bridge spanning the Rappahannock between Fredericksburg and Falmouth. The men who volunteered for this critically important mission to protect the flow of arterial traffic of military convoys and war goods over U. S. Route One were John M. Henshaw, Charles L. Ryalls, and Junius T. Sutton. They remember long and cold nights of lonely service. The same year found the company maintaining its efficiency while performing rather routine duty. During a March blackout forty-eight members of the company were assigned the duty of guarding the roads leading into the city and regulating traffic on them. The only untoward incident occurred when an unidentified and elusive car sped through both the V.P.F. and state police cordons at seventy miles per hour. City Manager Seth Burnley stated that all participants in the blackout “knew their duties and carried them out efficiently and thoroughly.”17 The Protective Force received another commendation after the Federal inspection in April. Major W. J. Sutton, of Third Corps Area Headquarters, stated that he was pleased with the personnel of both Company 103 and the 10th Battalion.18 Summer was synonymous with training for the volunteers, as June found ten men attending an intensive four-day training school at Virginia Military Institute. Shortly thereafter fourteen men departed for the Third Corps Area State Guard School at Garrett Park, Maryland.19 On July 21 it was announced in the Charlottesville newspaper that the well-trained Protective Force, the organization designed to prevent subversive activity, had returned its 1917 Enfield rifles to the Army but that the unit was “expecting” shotguns. No sabotage occurred before August 6, when The Daily Progress announced that Company 103 was armed with fifty-seven shotguns and three submachineguns.20 On August 7 the company was called on to guard the wreckage of an Army bomber which crashed in the Keswick area of the county. Aiding the police, the guard mingled with the numerous spectators who broke through the pathless forest to glimpse the wreckage. The duty of the Protective Force became that of preventing souvenir hunters from disturbing parts of the plane, which had been scattered over a wide area.21 While the Marines, under General Alexander Archer Vandegrift, were struggling to maintain their toe hold in the Solomons, the Protective Force was bolstered by the organization of the Virginia Reserve Militia. Popularly known as the Minute Men, the members of the reserve unit were required to furnish their own arms and uniforms, but in this outlay they had some financial aid from the city and the county. They were not liable for service outside the county. Edwin V. Copenhaver was the prime mover in organizing the Albemarle County unit, which was designated Company 2. The new company, made up of seventy men who were mustered in on October 21, 1942, by Colonel Walker, was commanded by Captain Hunter Perry. Concurrently with the organization of the reserve unit in Albemarle, Randolph H. Perry was made a captain in the V. P. F. and assigned to the 10th Battalion as Minute Man coordinator, responsible for organizing and training fourteen companies of the Virginia Reserve Militia in the battalion area.22 Drill, organizational problems, and commendations for a job well done made up the local Protective Force pattern during the remainder of the fall and winter. After a quarterly inspection of the company in November, Colonel Walker witnessed a field problem in which the unit was dispersed to repulse a mythical landing of enemy troops. The limelight fell on the 10th Battalion when Brigadier General Edward E. Goodwyn, commander of the Virginia Protective Force, commended the unit for being the only such organization in the state which was at full strength during October. Changes in the personnel of the battalion included the promotion of Louis J. Matacia to captain with an assignment as adjutant when Walter E. Fowler was inducted into Federal service. John Albert Payne, of Company 103, became battalion sergeant major.23 Officers and non-commissioned officers from all units in the 10th Battalion area gathered in Charlottesville in mid-February. In introducing Governor Colgate W. Darden, Jr., to the group, Brigadier General S. Gardner Waller, Adjutant General of Virginia, pointed out that, as commander of the Virginia Protective Force and the Virginia Reserve Militia, the executive had under his control more troops than any previous Virginia governor. In his address the Governor stated that, while an attack from abroad was still possible, the principal responsibility of the militia was to deal with untoward incidents in the Commonwealth. General Goodwyn described the 10th Battalion as the outstanding battalion in the Protective Force, and he commended Company 103 on the attainment of a “superior” rating in a recent inspection. After the meeting the state officials observed a drill by Company 103, with the governor praising the members “for the devotion to duty indicated by the perfection of their drill.” The Daily Progress commented editorially, “Company 103's demonstration gave ample evidence that Virginia is prepared with a trained and disciplined force of a sort whose very existence should go far toward making its actual use unnecessary.” The drill was all the more remarkable in the light of the fact that there had been a turnover of almost one hundred per cent in the personnel of the company since its inception.24 On February 19, 1943, a second company of Minute Men, representing the city of Charlottesville, was mustered into the service by Colonel Walker as Company 404. Forty-seven men were present at the muster, in addition to three officers headed by Captain Gilbert S. Campbell. Both Companies 2 and 404 of the Virginia Reserve Militia were divided, by platoons and squads, into a geographical breakdown, in order that small units could assemble in their respective localities on short notice. The older of the two reserve organizations, Company 2, celebrated its first anniversary with the awarding of one-year service stripes to seventy-seven of its 138 members.25 Meanwhile Company 103 of the Virginia Protective Force continued its record of successful inspections, when a Third Service Command officer gave the unit a rating of “excellent,” stating that he doubted if he would find a better company on his tour of inspection.26 When the name Protective Force was changed to the more accurately descriptive designation Virginia State Guard on February 15, 1944, the organization continued to function as before, with the summer witnessing both training camps and competitive drills for the members. In May, when five reserve companies gathered at the Municipal Airport near Gordonsville, Company 404 came away with second honors in the drill competition. In an August assembly of the State Guard at the South River Picnic Grounds in the Shenandoah National Park, Company 104 of Fredericksburg bested Company 103.27 Earlier, three members of the local company had attended a Third Service Command school at Fort Eustis, Virginia.28 The climax to the summer's activities came in September, when thirteen of the twenty-three Guard and Reserve units in the 10th Battalion area assembled in Charlottesville's McIntire Park. Company 24 of Culpeper topped the other reserve units in the competitive drill. The chief feature of the day's program was the solving of a military problem by Company 103. The Virginia Guardsman described the maneuver in vivid detail. “The problem was to bring in, dead or alive, a dozen desperadoes hidden in the brush at the lower end of the Lane High School football field, scene of the mobilization. Proceeding North along the railroad track on the West side of the field, one squad of Guardsmen, under the command of Sgt. Jesse B. Wilson, reached the border of the undergrowth in which the outlaws lay hidden. Simultaneously another squad commanded by Sgt Sam [Sanford] Bradbury moved stealthily along the Eastern side of the field, hidden by the orchard across the road from the field. Shots, fired at unexpected intervals, from strategic points, threw the criminals off guard so that when a smoke screen was laid by Sgt. Wilson's detail from the windward side of the field, the two riot squads were able to converge unobserved by their quarry, whose bitter opposition was soon quelled by the superior tactics of the well-drilled members of Company 103. Those few rioters who succeeded in breaking through the cordon of Guardsmen, were quickly cut down by expert gunfire and were brought in by the ambulance of the Tenth Battalion Medical Unit, under the command of Lt. Harry L. Smith, Jr., with Sgt. Walter [S.] Crenshaw as Executive Officer and Sgt. Francis [V.] Riddick at the wheel. So deceptive was the execution of this entire operation, that no one, not even the umpires, could tell how it was done. In fact, an entirely different version might be forthcoming from those members of Company 103 who acted the part of the desperadoes, if Sgt. Bill [William B.] Trevillian were to be asked, thus proving the advantage—or disadvantage, as the case may be—of a smoke screen.”29 Near the close of the year organizational changes again affected the personnel of the 10th Battalion. On November 15 it was announced that Henry B. Goodloe, who had served as battalion executive officer with the rank of major, had been promoted to lieutenant colonel. He was transferred from the battalion soon thereafter to the staff of General Goodwyn. Captain Grove was promoted to the rank of major and became Colonel Walker's new executive officer. Charles L. Wingfield replaced Grove as the commander of Company 103. After four years only eighteen of the original members of the company remained in the State Guard. Of these only Sergeant Aubrey S. Hughes had a perfect drill-attendance record. Nevertheless, the Charlottesville company always ranked high among Guard units in attendance at drill.30 What was destined to be the last notable public gathering of the local companies occurred on April 22, 1945, when the reserve units participated in a statewide muster to commemorate the mustering of the Virginia militia in pre-Revolutionary times. Nearly 8,000 officers and men gathered at various points throughout the state.31 At the 1945 annual meeting of the officers and non-commissioned officers in the battalion area, which consisted of fourteen counties and the cities therein, comprehending eighteen Virginia Reserve Militia companies with a strength of over 2,000 officers and men and four Virginia State Guard companies with a strength of about 250 officers and men, Governor Darden stated that he was exceedingly grateful for the service the organization had rendered. Addressing the assembled group in Charlottesville, the governor said, “Although it has not been a spectacular type of service, it means more when it is realized that I didn't have a living soul I could have called on in the event of an attack or public disorder except the two organizations. Governor Price did a good thing when he organized the Virginia Protective Force.”32 An expansion of the local units occurred in 1945 when a headquarters company for the 10th Battalion with a strength of approximately sixty men was authorized. This company was commanded by Captain Gilbert S. Campbell. It was mustered in on November 2, 1945.33 The same year saw a more realistic step when, on September 26, quite soon after V-J Day, Company 404 of the Virginia Reserve Militia was demobilized. The men voted to keep the war baby alive in spirit by a yearly gathering.34 Interest in both the Reserve Militia and State Guard organizations had long tended to dwindle with each victory of the United States armed forces. With the victorious conclusion of the war, the necessity for the organization diminished. Early in 1946, it was announced that all members of the Virginia State Guard who did not desire to become members of the National Guard would be relieved of duty June 30, 1946.35 The State Guard had one last fling during the period when a possibility of a strike by the employees of the Virginia Electric and Power Company alarmed the state. In order to avert the strike, scheduled for April 1, 1946, Governor William M. Tuck issued an order drafting the company's employees into the unorganized state militia. Draft notices were served on the “VEPCO” workers in Charlottesville by a special detail from Company 103. Colonel Walker reported that only one worker made any apparent display of displeasure on receipt of the notice. When it was announced that company and union officials had reached an agreement on their differences, Governor Tuck rescinded his draft order.36 The original decision to disband the State Guard as of June 30, 1946, was changed, but the Guard reverted to a semi-active status and many of the officers and men parted company with the organization. Colonel Walker was succeeded by Colonel Goodloe as 10th Battalion commander on that date.37 On April 3, 1947, the reorganized Monticello Guard, with Captain Charles L. Mahanes commanding and First Lieutenant Edward V. Walker, Jr., as executive officer, was inspected for Federal recognition at the New Armory, and it was announced that it was likely that the unit soon would be taken into the National Guard.38 With its role as wartime protector of the State fulfilled, the State Guard was demobilized April 15, 1947. Thus it was that these home front defenders, who performed a job of which no one could have said anything but praise, turned back to the hands of the Monticello Guard the duty of protecting the community. When called on to perform a task, no matter how small or inconsequential, the members of the Virginia State Guard and Virginia Reserve Militia had done well. The members derived an even greater sense of satisfaction from the knowledge that their long hours of drill and their high state of preparedness afforded the state a sure source of protection during trying times. Civil Air Patrol Meantime the “eyes of Albemarle” had been far from idle during the war years. While the younger generation thrilled to the drone of P-40's and dreamed of becoming “hot pilots,” the flying fathers, a group which had known the age of the aerial flivver, made up the home guard of the air for the community. These part-time aviators played an inconspicuous but important role in the drama of home defense, standing ready to fly doctors and nurses to disaster scenes, to locate downed aircraft, to train youngsters as future soldiers of the blue, and to perform various other missions in the common cause. The Charlottesville and Albemarle Civil Air Patrol Squadron was activated on May 24, 1942, under the guidance of W. R. Franke, a professional aviator with over 2,000 hours of flying time to his credit.39 In addition to Squadron Commander Franke, the officers appointed at the initial meeting included W. P. Kilgore, executive officer, Loyd W. Charlie, adjutant, Miss Marjorie Carver, assistant adjutant and public relations chairman, Frank Kaulback, intelligence officer, Dr. Arthur Eidelman, supply officer, and C. B. Lewis, communications officer.40 Membership in the Civil Air Patrol was not limited to aviators but included also persons interested in aviation. The national organization had grown out of a desire on the part of private flyers to make some contribution to the war effort. Thus it was not the purpose of the organization to train pilots, but rather to enhance the knowledge of those who had pilots' licenses and to stimulate non-pilots' interest in aviation. The ground instruction offered by the C.A.P. included courses in close order drill, first aid, meteorology, navigation, communications, formation flying, and theoretical observation.41 The equipment at the University Airport42 adjacent to the Rivanna near Milton, home of the squadron, included eight privately-owned planes, in addition to ten light planes used in the Civilian Pilot Training Program, which were available for emergency use.43 Besides Albemarle, ten other mid-Virginia counties came under the jurisdiction of the Squadron. Flights at Harrisonburg, Staunton, and Waynesboro, received their orders from the University Airport until October 21, 1943, when the Harrisonburg Flight was designated a detached unit.44 Less than two weeks after its initial meeting the local Squadron scored a notable national first. In a mock air raid on the city of Charlottesville, the first civilian raid in the United States in which missiles were actually used, planes piloted by four C.A.P. members dropped weighted streamers carrying messages which informed the city's defenders of the damage each “bomb” had done. Forty of the streamers fell from planes at various points over the city. After the raid Civilian Defense Coordinator Seth Burnley stated that much useful information had been gained from the practice. A rather sad sequel came four days later when Civilian Defense headquarters issued a plea that the forty streamers be returned by forgetful or souvenir-hungry citizens.45 The flying activities of the Squadron continued throughout the summer and fall of 1942. In mid-July spectators craned their necks as Civil Air Patrol planes flew over the National Heroes' Day Parade, lending a dash of air power to the local scene. The first real test of the effectiveness of the unit in search and rescue work came when an Army B-26 bomber exploded in mid-air above the farm of Mrs. Kate Dabney in the Keswick area of the county. A Patrol plane took off from the airport, located the wreckage, and directed Commander Franke to the scene in his car. Both occupants of the Army plane had been killed in the explosion, but the Squadron proved its ability in locating the downed aircraft.46 Another important phase of the activity of the Squadron consisted of observing local blackouts. Commenting on the blackout of August 18, 1942, Commander Franke stated that the traffic signals were especially prominent during the alert period of the blackout.47 Always vigilant during times of threatened trouble, the Patrol stood by for any possible duty in connection with the flood of October, 1942, until flying became impossible because the local airfield was covered by water.48 For the remainder of the year the flying of the Patrol was limited, for the most part, to training flights and occasional search missions. One of the few members of the local Squadron to volunteer for active duty with the Civil Air Patrol elsewhere was Lieutenant William P. Kilgore, who served for one month with the First Patrol Task Force, flying the anti-submarine patrol from Atlantic City, New Jersey. Later he again volunteered for duty with a Tow Target Squadron at Langley Field, Virginia.49 By no means all of the work of the Civil Air Patrol was in the “wild blue yonder,” for the ground school classes early attracted the attention and interest of the flying civilians. First aid classes started in June, 1942, and by October fourteen of the members had received certificates from F. W. Early, instructor.50 In July close order drill was initiated under James B. Ord, a United States Marine Corps Reserve officer. When Ord was called to active duty, he was replaced as drill master by Chief Specialist Bob Austin, United States Navy, who was attached to the Naval R.O.T.C. unit at the University. Classes in navigation, map reading, and communications were conducted by Squadron officers.51 Plans for disaster relief also occupied the attention of the Squadron officers. The unit completed arrangements early in August, 1942, to cooperate with the University Hospital in flying doctors, nurses, and medical supplies to the scenes of accidents. Another aspect of the program of cooperation with the medical authorities involved the development of a package in which blood plasma could be dropped from a plane. It was felt that such a device would be of use in mountainous areas.52 Almost a year was required to develop a suitable method, but on July 25, 1943, plasma bottles filled with water were successfully dropped from planes with the aid of a paper parachute.53 In the fall of 1942 a new phase of the Civil Air Patrol program was initiated which was to occupy more and more of the attention of local members. It was announced that each senior member of the C.A.P. was to sponsor a Cadet, a junior or senior in high school, with the idea of nurturing his or her interest in aviation. On December 11, 1942, ten Lane High School students, the nucleus of the Cadet Corps, met with the Squadron.54 The membership increased throughout the winter, and a number of Cadets were on hand at the University Airport on February 21, 1943, during a practice mission when three planes searched the county for two targets outlined on open fields in lime.55 The Cadet program assumed a new meaning when the Civil Air Patrol was transferred from the jurisdiction of the Office of Civilian Defense to the Army Air Forces in April, 1943. More emphasis was placed on the program in order to provide pre-Aviation Cadet training for future Army and Navy flyers. During the summer of 1944 approximately forty-five boys and eight girls enlisted in the C.A.P. Cadet program. Lieutenant William I. Nickles, instructor at Lane High School and Squadron Training Officer, was largely responsible for organizing and instructing the Cadets. Some of the training paralleled that given in the Army, and future flyers were permitted to omit certain phases of the Army training on the passage of examinations during their military careers. Twenty C.A.P. Cadets from Charlottesville thus became exempt from the service course in International Morse Code.56 The value of the training offered was attested to by Seaman Second Class Ralph Britton, a former member, who wrote Miss Marjorie Carver that no one would know the real value of the experience until in the service. “I know the C.A.P. did a lot for me,” Britton continued. “Everything I learned there has been a help.”57 Cadet interest was stimulated by an offer of two hours of free flight instruction to the students with the highest grades in their Cadet courses. After the completion of the first of four fifty-hour periods of instruction, it was announced in November, 1944, that Bill Austin and Bobby Kirby had topped their classes.58 Meanwhile the membership of the Squadron was far from stable. Some members were drafted, and others moved from the city. On the death of C. B. (“Pat”) Lewis early in 1943, the unit voted to designate itself the Lewis Squadron in his memory.59 When Lieutenant Franke moved from Charlottesville in January, 1944, his place as commanding officer was taken by Lieutenant Loyd W. Charlie, manager of the University Airport.60 Among other changes in officer personnel was the replacing of Dr. Eidelman as supply officer by Henry C. Miller. When Lieutenant Kaulback went into the service, his place as Intelligence and Personnel officer was taken by Clinton N. Wood.61 After Lieutenant Charlie took command of the Squadron, attention was directed almost exclusively to the Cadet program. The training of the high school students during 1944 was the last major contribution of the Lewis Squadron. With the tide of battle turning in favor of the Allies, this aerial group, like many another home defense organization, had answered its purpose. Lieutenant Nickles took over as commander of the Squadron on March 19, 1945, merely to officiate at the last meeting of the organization less than three months later.62 Lieutenant Colonel Allan C. Perkinson, Wing Commander for the State, visited Charlottesville on June 5, 1945, to stimulate interest in the C.A.P.63 It was evident, however, that the demand which had created the enthusiastic response to the program for more than three years was now lacking. The Lewis Squadron officers met at Lane High School on June 7, and the decision was reached that the Charlottesville C.A.P. unit should become inactive.64 Thus were folded the wings of an organization which had been as active within its realm as any in the city or county in preparing for home front emergencies. Fortunately, as in the happy instances of the local companies of the Virginia State Guard and Virginia Reserve Militia, such contingencies had never arisen, but effective war services had been rendered nevertheless. XI Mobilizing under Selective Service The first peacetime conscription law enacted in the United States was signed by President Roosevelt on September 16, 1940. It required those men selected to serve for one year in the Army in order that the nation might have sufficient trained defenders in event of an emergency. The same day the President issued a proclamation directing all men between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-five, inclusive, to register for Selective Service on October 16. Local opinion was well expressed by Dr. George T. Starnes of the University of Virginia in an address to the Business and Professional Women's Club of Charlottesville the same evening. Said he, “We have got to prepare for war against all possibilities. Everything has come so easy for Hitler so far that it is quite possible that he has ambition to conquer the whole world. The United States must carry on to completion its plan for defense, for it is a fight for our very existence.”1 A great deal of valuable preliminary work had been done in anticipation of the passage of the law, and plans for registration in Virginia took form quickly. Immediately upon the issuance of a proclamation by Governor James H. Price, the Secretary of the Commonwealth, Raymond L. Jackson of Charlottesville, moved to put the election machinery of the state into operation to assist the State Director of Selective Service, Lieutenant Colonel Mills F. Neal. The electoral boards in Albemarle County and Charlottesville were responsible for conducting the registration in their respective areas. Percy G. Dunn, secretary of the county board, E. Clinton Wingfield, secretary of the city board, and F. Roy Early attended a “school” in Richmond at which Governor Price and other officials explained the terms of the Selective Service Act. Later, at the New County Office Building and the City Court House, similar meetings were held of the local volunteer workers who were to be registrars. On registration day brief, appropriate patriotic exercises were held in the schools, and then the children were dismissed. As a rule the registration took place at schoolhouses and other regular election polling places, which were open from seven in the morning to nine at night. Generally the usual election officials were in charge, and teachers, together with other citizens who had volunteered, served as assistant registrars. Special registrars visited those in hospitals and others unable to attend at the places of registration. The young men flocked to the polls, most of them coming early. On cards the registrars recorded the preliminary information the government needed for the first peacetime draft. When this had been done, each man was given a card to be carried at all times as evidence that he had registered. Oddly enough, excluding University students, exactly the same number, 2,845, registered in the county as in the city. At the Rotunda there were registered 1,172 University of Virginia students from forty states, the District of Columbia, and five foreign countries.2 By coincidence, on this day when approximately one-fifth of the male population of the community began to prepare for the fight to protect our liberty, the last payment was made on Monticello, and the home of Thomas Jefferson, the Apostle of Freedom, became a debt-free shrine.3 Meanwhile, on the recommendation of Judge Lemuel F. Smith, members of the local Selective Service boards had been appointed by Governor Price. The Albemarle County Board originally consisted of R. O. Hall, Keswick, chairman: Hugh Clark, Moorman's River, and Richard H. Miller, Free Union. Dr. J. O. Mundy was the physician and Edward V. Walker, appeal agent. The Charlottesville board originally consisted of R. A. Watson, chairman; Strother F. Hamm, and C. E. Moran. Dr. R. T. Ergenbright was the physician and Lyttelton Waddell, appeal agent. The draft board was the most important cog in the entire machinery of Selective Service. Its members were chosen on the basis of residence and character, rather than because of their professions or callings, and without regard to political, religious, or other affiliations. Like all other local Selective Service personnel except clerical assistants, they served without compensation. It was their duty to determine the status of each of their fellow citizens subject to military service. Applying complex national policies, they decided who should go into service and who should be deferred and remain at home. Their decision was based largely on the answers to a questionnaire filled in by each registrant and took into consideration both his fitness for military service and the importance of his work as a civilian in the local community. It was the duty of the examining physician to determine the physical condition of the registrants, while the appeal agent acted when necessary to protect the interests of the registrant or of the government. Appointed at the same time was the district advisory board for registrants in Albemarle, Greene, and Madison counties and the city of Charlottesville. Associated with Judge Lemuel F. Smith of the Circuit Court, who was chairman, were Bernard F. Chamberlain for Albemarle County, Judge A. D. Dabney for Charlottesville, John Morris for Greene County, and Norman G. Payne for Madison County. The principal job of the advisory board was to give advice and aid to registrants in properly preparing their questionnaires for the draft board. In order to do this the advisory board appointed associate members in the various local communities. Every attorney within the district volunteered his services, and to these were added some of the leading citizens in localities where attorneys were not resident.4 Charlottesville had also the medical advisory board for the counties of Albemarle, Buckingham, Fluvanna, Greene, Nelson, and the city of Charlottesville. It was made up of physicians with specialized knowledge who were able to give expert advice on the physical condition of registrants whom local examiners considered doubtful or borderline cases. This board was originally composed of Dr. H. S. Hedges, chairman; Dr. David C. Wilson, Dr. William E. Brown, Dr. A. D. Hart, Dr. V. W. Archer, and Dr. D. C. Smith.5 The local draft boards began at once to assign serial numbers, in anticipation of the national lottery on October 29 which would determine the order in which the registrants would become subject to call for a year's training with the Army. Soon lists giving serial numbers were posted at the New County Office Building and the New City Armory. Later they were printed in the newspapers. Among the names were a large number of “Woodrow Wilsons” and “Pershings”, the war babies of the first World War. Also included were “Goldenlocks” and “John the Baptist.”6 When the lottery was held in Washington serial number 158 was drawn first. In Albemarle County it had been assigned to Marion Jerome Wood, and in Charlottesville to Wilson Warner Cropp. These, unless deferred, stood first in order for compulsory induction into military service, but those eager to volunteer for their year of service were the first to go. Laurie K. Sandridge, Jr., of Crozet, who was to fight through the Normandy campaign as a lieutenant, was the first Selective Service volunteer in the county: but as he had recently injured his hand, he was deferred for several weeks, and William Cornelius Knipscher of North Garden was actually the first inductee from Albemarle. Henry Cecil Childress was the first inductee from Charlottesville. On November 28 Childress and Knipscher were given a send-off when they departed by train via Richmond for Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. Members of the city and county draft boards, the American Legion, and the Monticello Guard were among those who turned out with family and friends to wish them well. The first Negroes inducted locally, Frank Sampson from the city and Rayfield Willer Taylor from the county, were also volunteers.7 The departure of the young men aroused some misgivings in parents and civic leaders. While it was expected that the military training would be wholesome, it was feared that other influences associated with camps would be evil. Paradoxically, the soldiers would at once be under military discipline and yet have more freedom than ever before in their young lives. Editorially The Daily Progress pointed out that the manner in which the individual Selective Service soldier would use this freedom would determine whether the end of the year would find him a better and more valuable citizen or whether he would return to his community with lowered character and ideals. It concluded, “A young man who has been taught to seek a high standard in civilian life will seek the same standard in army life, no matter what freedom he has and temptations he is offered.”8 Some had misgivings from another quarter. At a meeting of the Lions Clubs of Charlottesville, Albemarle, and neighboring counties at the Monticello Hotel the speaker of the evening said, “I am in favor of assisting the Allies in every possible material and financial way but not with the young men of this nation. ... We have the wonderful Gulf Stream that flows Northeastward from Florida to England. May it warm England with our sympathy but not with the blood of our fine American youth.” Another side of the question was presented a few days later by an English refugee, Miss Sue Curry, who was visiting her uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. Arthur W. Talcott at Keswick. “We feel,” she said, “that England is America's 'front line' and that we are in reality fighting your war.” People generally agreed with the first spokesman, and only after some time did they realize that the United States could not escape active participation in the war.9 In February, 1941, a committee of the Parent-Teacher Association of Lane High School reported that it found military training inadvisable in the high school because the “present physical education program would be handicapped; it would be difficult to secure help from the military authorities due to the present emergency; the citizens cannot assume the burden; military training will be compulsory eventually.” A motion favoring adoption of military training at Lane High School failed to receive a second at the meeting. Nearly two years later military training was adopted at the Miller School.10 While the young men were being mobilized for training, all aliens in the United States were required to register. This did not include native born children of foreign parentage. When an English mother registered at the Charlottesville Post Office, she was much confused to find that her eldest child, born in this country, was not required to register, while her youngest, born in South America, was. In all, 174 persons were registered locally between August 27 and December 26, 1940. By far the greatest number of them came from Great Britain. Greece ranked second. The remainder included natives of many countries throughout the world, with no one country contributing a large number.11 While Selective Service was beginning to mobilize individuals for a year's service with the Army, the Virginia National Guard was also preparing for induction into Federal service for a year's training. The Monticello Guard, which had a long and honorable history reaching back to “The Gentleman Volunteers of Albemarle” organized in 1745,12 was among the units alerted early in October, 1940. Originally it had been planned that the Virginia National Guard would be concentrated in Richmond about the middle of December before proceeding to Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, but after some uncertainty, which was occasioned particularly by construction delays at Fort Meade, the Monticello Guard was finally inducted into Federal service on February 3, 1941, at its own armory, where it remained until its departure for Fort Meade two weeks later.13 Captain Marshall P. Fletcher commanded the local company, but during November and December he was attending the Infantry Staff Officers School at Fort Benning, Georgia, and the responsibility for preparing the unit for induction devolved upon First Lieutenant John A. Martin. Though Captain Fletcher returned to the company before it went to Fort Meade, he did not long remain with it as he was shortly transferred to the staff of the 29th Division. Lieutenant Martin, who was subsequently promoted to captain, succeeded to the command of the company. The other officers of the Monticello Guard when it entered Federal service were Second Lieutenants Nathaniel T. Hildreth, Herbert A. Moore, Cecil E. Runkle, and George G. Weston. John P. Davis was the first sergeant. When first alerted in October, 1940, the company had an enrollment of seventy-eight men. A drive was begun to enlist additional men in order that the entire personnel might come from the local community rather than that its ranks should be filled by men transferred to it after the unit was inducted into Federal service. An office was opened in the Armory where Sergeant Davis enrolled selected recruits, but, on the other hand, the Guard suffered a number of losses due to discharges for various reasons. By January 22 there were ninety-eight enlisted men enrolled, but sixteen vacancies remained to be filled in order to bring the company to its maximum strength.14 On January 31 a farewell banquet for the Monticello Guard was held in the New City Armory, where plates were reserved for approximately three hundred people. Randolph H. Perry, Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce and former Guardsman, was toastmaster and presided over the elaborate program. Among the principal speakers were Judge Lemuel F. Smith, who spoke on behalf of the county and city governments, and Judge A. D. Dabney, who spoke on behalf of the civic organizations. Giving expression to the prevailing sentiment, Judge Dabney said, “You are not going forth to war. This move is an effort against war. If this same patriotic effort continues, there will be no war, because no one will dare attack us. We seldom stop to think how fortunate we are in this country with all its opportunities as compared with the slavery and devastation in Europe.” Pointing with justifiable pride to the caliber of the company's personnel, he continued, “You have a great heritage to live up to. Never in my experience in courts has a member of the Monticello Guard been before me for any delinquency. So long as Monticello stands as a sentinel for freedom, just so long will there be a Guard ready to defend that heritage of freedom.” A gala military ball with many additional guests followed the banquet. To music “sweet” and “hot” the Guardsmen, their partners, and their friends celebrated joyfully the beginning of a patriotic adventure.15 At nine o'clock in the morning of February 3, 1941, seven officers and ninety-two enlisted men of the Monticello Guard reported to the New City Armory and were inducted into Federal service as Company K, 116th Infantry, 29th Division. Thereafter they led the life of a soldier. Reveille was at 5:30, breakfast at 6:15, drill at 7:00, dinner at 12:00, recall at 4:30, supper at 5:50, and taps at 10:00. They slept in the Armory and had their meals there. The daily training program included physical exercise, close order drill, and instruction in various other military subjects. Weather permitting, drills were held outdoors on the nearby East End Parking Lot, and spectators gathered on the Chesapeake and Ohio viaduct to watch. During these first days much of the time was taken up with physical examinations and other matters incidental to the entrance into Federal service. Some losses were sustained when members failed to pass the “physical.” At last word came that a hundred-bed cantonment type hospital had been completed at Fort Meade and that the camp was now ready to receive the 29th Division. On February 19 at eleven o'clock in the morning the Reverend Dwight M. Chalmers, pastor of the Charlottesville Presbyterian Church, made a farewell address to the men, and the next morning the company entrained at the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway station for Fort Meade. Three officers and eighty-eight men, commanded by Lieutenant Martin, left that day. Captain Fletcher. with two lieutenants and two enlisted men, was already at Fort Meade.16 In the departing group that morning some may have anticipated that their training was a prelude to battle, but none could foresee the bloody trials of Omaha Beach and the long road from there into Germany. All were to find that their Monticello Guard Oath really meant something. Each had sworn: I pledge myself to serve my country and my community so long as I remain a member of this organization, and in token of my sincerity I have enlisted in a duly authorized Military Unit in the community. I furthermore pledge myself to protect the lives and property of my fellow citizens in this community, and in token of my fidelity I now declare that I will give my life if need be in the performance of this duty. Lastly, I pledge myself, to each of my fellow members, to render to each of them all of the assistance, civil as well as military, that is within my power, and in token of my honesty I now subscribe my name as a member of the Monticello Guard. Eleven of the departing group were to give their lives in battle. By selfless devotion to duty one of these was to win the nation's highest award for valor before he fell preparing the way for the advance of others.17 After the first excitement of getting the system into operation during the fall of 1940, Selective Service settled down to a more or less routine existence. First calls had been for only a very few men, but gradually the number receiving “Greetings from the President” increased until men left literally by the hundred. While a number volunteered for duty before they would normally have been summoned, the great majority awaited their turn and then went without comment. Some few objected to their classifications, and their appeals were heard by the Virginia Selective Service Board of Appeals No. 3. One of four in the state of Virginia, it consisted originally of John R. Morris, chairman: John L. Livers, and Dr. Staige D. Blackford, all of Charlottesville: E. C. Davidson, Alexandria; and T. Russell Cather, Winchester. In 1942 Dr. Henry B. Mulholland of Charlottesville replaced Dr. Blackford, and in 1944 F. Roy Early of Charlottesville was added. Other changes did not involve local men. By June, 1941, it had heard 203 appeals arising in the twenty-seven counties of northern Virginia.18 The second Selective Service registration was held July 1, 1941. In the city 179 men and in the county 131, who had become twenty-one years old since the first registration, were enrolled by the board members, who did most of the work in this and subsequent registrations. The increasing tempo of the war in Europe had some effect upon American thinking. In his Fourth of July address at Lane High School, Justice J. Callan Brooks of the Civil and Police Court reminded the citizens of Charlottesville that the “people of this nation cannot expect to remain free if they cease to be vigilant.”19 Before the end of the year the Japanese had struck at Pearl Harbor, taking advantage of the nation's want of vigilance. An all-out war effort superseded everything else, and mobilization was stepped up. In January, 1942, great activity on the two floors above the Metropolitan Restaurant at 101 East Main Street, Charlottesville, was observed by the local citizenry, but in a great cloud of military secrecy questions went unanswered. It was only after the third selectee-loaded bus arrived that the Army officially announced what was already generally known, that a regional center for conducting the physical examination of Selective Service registrants from northwestern Virginia had been opened. Staffed by thirty or more officers, clerks, doctors, and nurses, it was capable of processing approximately one hundred registrants a day. Its establishment eliminated many of the hardships which selectees suffered in the long jaunts to the Roanoke and Richmond induction centers. Formerly, knowing that once inducted he would have no time to settle his personal affairs, a man on being notified to report for induction might give up his job, sell his car, and dispose of his home only to be told a few hours after reporting that he had been rejected for physical disabilities of which he had no previous knowledge. Under the new system all men in the area were given a screening examination in their home communities. After the expiration of their appeal time they were brought to the army examination center in Charlottesville for a final check, and then returned home to await orders from their local boards to report for induction. In March, 1943, the center in Charlottesville was closed, and its functions were taken over by the center in Richmond.20 On February 16, 1942, the third registration enrolled all men aged twenty to forty-four not previously registered. There were 1,950 from the county and 1,302 from the city. In the fourth registration two months later gray hair and bald heads predominated as the Albemarle County Board registered 2,203 men and the City Board 1,624 men between forty-five and sixty-five years old. It was not anticipated that this group would be called to military service, but rather that they should man the factories and farms of the nation. So it turned out, though no formal induction took place.21 It was a young man's war, and the fifth registration on June 30 enrolled the youths of eighteen and nineteen. There were 421 from the city and 797 from the county. Among those from the county were about 400 who registered from the University and 27 from the C.C.C. Camp. Finally, in December, 1942, there was initiated a system by which each man would register upon reaching his eighteenth birthday. Thereafter the registration was a continuous process.22 The University of Virginia Medical School on March 2, 1942, was authorized to form the 8th Evacuation Hospital. Applications for commissions were submitted at once, and in time thirty-five doctors were accepted for the unit. Of these, twenty-six were graduates of the University of Virginia Medical School, while others had served on the staff of the Medical School or Hospital. Their average age was low, only thirty-one years. Dr. Staige D. Blackford, Associate Professor of Internal Medicine, commissioned a lieutenant colonel, became unit director and was in charge of the medical staff. Dr. Everett Cato Drash, Associate Professor of Clinical Surgery, also commissioned a lieutenant colonel, was in charge of the surgical staff. The Reverend William H. Laird, Rector of St. Paul's Episcopal Church, became chaplain of the group. Twenty-two of the nurses were recruited locally, but only Miss Helen Berkeley and Miss Dorothy D. Sandridge were natives of the local community. There was much ado over buying uniforms and otherwise preparing for departure. On June 24 orders were received directing personnel to report on July 1 at Pageland, South Carolina, where they were to undergo a six weeks training period with the 3rd Evacuation Hospital during the Carolina Maneuvers. At the end of the maneuvers the 8th Evacuation Hospital was formally activated and moved to Fort Benning, Georgia. Additional personnel, including doctors, nurses, and enlisted men necessary to bring the unit up to its authorized strength of 417, were assigned. Three weeks later the 8th Evacuation Hospital entered a staging area at Camp Kilmer. New Jersey. The train which carried the personnel north passed through Charlottesville without stopping. As the movement was secret, members of the unit were forbidden to communicate with friends and relatives. Nevertheless, a nurse surreptitiously dropped a note out of the window. It was picked up and delivered to the addressee, but only a limited number of people were let in on the secret. A few wives of staff members left hurriedly for New York, but the newspaper reporters who got wind of the story did not print it until December. After six weeks of speculation, rumors, restrictions, alerts, goodbyes, and “last trips to New York” the 8th Evacuation Hospital sailed from Staten Island in November, 1942, with the first support convoy for troops invading North Africa.23 A fund of $4,035.42 had been raised by 122 friends of the hospital to be used for the benefit of the officers and nurses of the unit. Out of it were bought additional items of hospital equipment not furnished by the government, and from it were made loans to personnel when Uncle Sam was slow coming across with the uniform allowance. About half of the fund had been expended by the time the unit sailed. Later, when the Liberty ship on which all of the hospital's equipment had been loaded was sunk at Salerno during the invasion of Italy, the remainder of the fund was spent replacing those things which had been lost. An S O S was sent out to the friends of the hospital, and under the chairmanship of John R. Morris an additional $5,349.00 was raised during January, 1944. When the hospital was deactivated, enough money remained to publish the unit history.24 In peacetime Charlottesville had had a recruiting office, and with the advent of Selective Service it had become a recruiting and induction center. Early in the war the Navy and Marine Corps had depended entirely upon voluntary enlistments, but by 1943, with the demand for men everywhere increasing, voluntary enlistment of men had been abolished except for seventeen-year-olds. On the other hand, beginning in 1942 recruiting drives for WAAC's, WAVE's, SPAR's, and Women Marines had been pushed. The first WAAC from Charlottesville, Miss Virginia Pond of Monticello Road, left for Des Moines, Iowa, on September 12, 1942. In September, 1943, Mrs. Mary Marshall Wood, descendant of Chief Justice John Marshall, and her seventeen-year-old son, Claude, volunteered on the same day. Mrs. Wood became a WAC officer candidate and her son a Naval Aviation cadet.25 The increasing calls for men at last necessitated induction of pre-Pearl Harbor fathers in September, 1943. At this time it was announced that 154,000 Virginians were serving in the armed forces of the nation. Of these 1,269 whites and 360 Negroes were from Charlottesville, and 1,044 whites and 289 Negroes were from Albemarle County. By March 1, 1947, three and a half years later, the two local Selective Service boards had sent 2,181 white and 592 Negro registrants from Charlottesville and 1,760 white and 540 Negro registrants from Albemarle County into military or naval service. These figures do not include servicewomen and many men who served but who were never registrants. No figures are available for this group. Charlottesville with a population of 19,400 in 1940 furnished 2,773 men through Selective Service, while Albemarle County with a population of 24,652 furnished only 2,300. This discrepancy was probably due to the fact that, while few industrial workers were deferred, a relatively large number of farm workers were deferred.26 Though most men went willingly, the local community had its small share of draft dodgers, deserters, and A.W.O.L. 's from military service. From time to time these were picked up by the local police. In August, 1943, a soldier was given a ticket to a dance at the Armory and in a drawing won the grand prize, his choice of a horse and buggy or $200 in cash. He chose the money and went merrily on his way. His luck changed next morning, however, when the police heard the name of the prize winner. They recalled that they had orders to pick up a deserter by that name. Apprehended and returned to Drew Field, the soldier still had in his possession the $200—or most of it.27 A more tragic case was that of an eighteen-year-old Virginia swain. Alerted for shipment to a combat area, a Marine overstayed his leave from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, in order to marry his sweetheart in Charlottesville. A few hours before the wedding the long arm of the law reached out and grabbed him. That night instead of honeymooning he languished in the city jail. The next morning the authorities relented long enough to allow the wedding to take place before the Marine was hauled back to his base. On departing he declared that he was “all the more for getting this war over with in a hurry and then I'll come back home and go on my honeymoon.” Six months later, fighting to make his dreams come true, he was fatally wounded in the attack on the Palau Islands.28 In January of 1945 about eighty Albemarle white registrants who had previously been deferred as necessary farm laborers were called for induction. They made the trip from Charlottesville to the induction center in Richmond in buses. Soon a scandal was being whispered about. It was reported that thirty-seven aspirin boxes or bottles were found in a bus when it returned to Charlottesville. Conceivably an artificial heart condition could have been produced if a large number of aspirin tablets had been taken. An investigation followed which established that “a large aspirin bottle had been found in one of the buses.” Three or four men who evinced rapid heart action when examined were directed to report for reexamination. Other subterfuges, such as pepper in the eyes, were also used by a despicable few.29 With the surrender of Germany and Japan inductions under Selective Service began immediately to taper off, and on October 16 were halted, though the draft boards continued to register and classify men until March 31, 1947, when the Charlottesville and the Albemarle County Selective Service boards finally went out of existence. However, for two months the board members continued to serve under the new United States Office of Selective Service Records. Beginning late in 1945 the Albemarle County and Charlottesville Selective Service Boards increasingly turned their attention to assisting the returning veterans. As veterans' information centers they assisted returning servicemen in obtaining all rights and benefits to which they were entitled. Staff Sergeant John W. Taylor of Covesville was the first veteran released under the Army's point system to secure employment through the United States Employment Office in Charlottesville. A member of the Monticello Guard, he had landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day. Two days later he won a Silver Star when he and a buddy knocked out two Nazi machineguns with a bazooka. Discharged on May 14, 1945, Taylor applied for employment a week later expressing a preference for a job as auto mechanic, a position for which he had been trained while in in the Army. He was at once employed by MacGregor Motors, Inc., in Charlottesville. He immediately made good and remained permanently in their employ. The month after V-J Day, October, 1945, brought the reopening of Army recruiting offices. A district headquarters for seventeen counties was established in the Charlottesville Post Office Building, and a campaign began to enlist soldiers for the peacetime army of occupation. On December 7 the Navy opened its recruiting station.30 The men from Charlottesville and Albemarle County in the armed forces were from the first a source of great local pride. Practically every group in the community, civic or business, had its service flag or plaque. One of the most interesting service flags was that of the Charlottesville Presbyterian Church, which had the unusual history of having been used for both World Wars. On behalf of the church Miss Mary Louise Dinwiddie prepared during the First World War a silk flag, eleven by seven feet, and, unable to secure ready-made stars of appropriate quality, she embroidered on the flag ninety-four blue stars, of which five were later overlaid with gold in honor of those who died. When World War II again brought the need for a service flag, Miss Dinwiddie got out the old flag, together with the embroidery silk, the pattern for the stars, and the needle used during the first war. The gold stars were covered with appliqued blue silk, and new stars were added to bring the number up to 179. As deaths were reported the appliqued stars were removed until, as in World War I, there were five gold stars. There would have been a greater number of stars, but between the two wars the Westminster Presbyterian Church had been established near the University. Of its members fifty-three served in the Second World War. Two of these died while in uniform. A large minority of homes had members in the armed forces. Something of a record was set by the 500 block of Ridge Street which by November, 1942, had already furnished eighteen youths to various branches of the service. All of these except one, who had resided in a boarding house, had lived in detached, individual homes. Many families which had only one or two men of military age sent into service all members who were eligible and in so doing made an outstanding contribution in defense of liberty and democracy. Worthy of especial mention are several homes which had five or more stars on their service flags. Unfortunately, some such families may have escaped attention. Mrs. Eula Gleason of Charlottesville, Mr. and Mrs. Frank E. Hartman of Charlottesville, Mr. and Mrs. G. F. The Charlottesville Presbyterian Church uses the same service flag for two wars. Nimmo of Charlottesville, Mr. and Mrs. J. E. Pollard of Scottsville, and Mr. and Mrs. J. L. Shaver of Proffit each had five sons in service. Mr. and Mrs. William H. Stoneburner of Charlottesville had six children in service—a daughter in the Marine Corps, a son in the Army, and four sons in the Navy. Mrs. Thomas M. Estes of the county had six sons in service, as also did Mr. and Mrs. O. A. Trice of Howardsville. The most remarkable of all was a Negro mother, Mrs. Fanny Estes of Proffit, the widow of Richard Estes. Her nine sons in service constitute a record having few parallels anywhere in the United States. The eldest of the sons, Richard J. Estes, served for seven years as steward on the cruiser USS San Francisco. Horace O. Estes was a first lieutenant of Co. M, 25th Infantry. Other brothers in the Army were Staff Sergeant William C. Estes, Corporal Elmer J. Estes, Private First Class Benjamin W. Estes, Private First Class Henry H. Estes, Private Nathaniel Estes and Private Joseph W. Estes. Paul S. Estes, the youngest of the group, served in the Navy.31 When seventeen-year-old Henry Eugene Craddock of Charlottesville joined the Navy on January 12, 1943, his mother, Mrs. Alice May Craddock, who was thirty-two years old on the previous Christmas Day, became the youngest war mother in the United States. The Navy officially certified the fact in announcing Mrs. Craddock's distinction. Before he entered the service “Gene” Craddock, who was to win four battle stars in the Pacific, worked with his father, Henry Wise Craddock, at the Charlottesville Woolen Mills where Navy uniforms were being manufactured. When he left for Bainbridge Naval Training Station, Maryland, he took with him a blue jacket which he had helped to make.32 Many families displayed on their service flags a gold star symboliz ing a member who had died in the service, a sacrifice on the altar of freedom. Altogether 199 did not return. Of these 116 were from Charlottesville and 83 from Albemarle County. A few families had two such gold stars. Mr. and Mrs. Robert H. Batten of Charlottesville lost two sons. Private First Class George Rexford Batten with the 36th Division was killed in the crossing of the Rhine River, and First Lieutenant Donald Sherwood Batten with the 86th Bomber Group in Italy was killed by a land mine while he was searching for a friend who had been shot down. Two sons of Mr. and Mrs. Richard T. Brown of Charlottesville also died in Europe. Private Harry Elmer Brown with the 9th Division in France was killed in action on August 4, 1944, and Private First Class Richard Marton Brown with the 29th Division died of injuries sustained in a vehicular accident at Louvain, Belgium, March 10, 1945. Mr. and Mrs. Floyd F. Davis also of Charlottesville lost two sons, Staff Sergeant Calvin Edgar Davis, who was shot down over France on May 28, 1944, and Private First Class Raymond Earl Davis, who died on February 14, 1946, at McGuire General Hospital in Richmond of wounds sustained in Germany. Half-brothers, the sons of John W. Gibson of Red Hill, died in service. Technician Fifth Class Clarence Cecil Gibson was killed in an airplane accident in North Africa, February 12, 1943, and Private Coleman Tafty Gibson died on February 7, 1944, while on furlough in Charlottesville.33 There were many who asked the perpetual question, “Why should young men just through college or just married who have everything to live for, take upon themselves all of this war against life itself?” “I feel I'm capable of answering that,” Lieutenant James E. Harlow of Charlottesville, an aviator in England, wrote his wife, “for I was one of these thousands who felt that, though we had everything to gain by remaining out of the Army, this war was destroying everything that could and should exist. We could be happy, yes, but for how long? Even now, instead of being here in combat, I could be home with my wife and thousands of others could be home also. However, it's harder to see something beautiful you've built de-stroyed than to destroy its possible enemy in the beginning.”34 So it seemed to many others.

      <field name="fulltext">Part 2 On the Battle Fronts XII Introduction Let us suppose, for an instant, that such things as radios, motion pictures, and newspapers had not yet been invented when the Second World War was raging on its hundreds of distant battlefronts. Had this been so, the people of the United States would have known nothing about the greatest conflict in all history save what their sons, brothers, or husbands were able to tell them. How complete would be a chronicle in which the experiences of each Charlottesville and Albemarle serviceman were recorded? It is certain that most of the campaigns and battles would be included, for more than five thousand men and women from this community went into the armed forces and were scattered over the entire earth. High school boys and university students, farm hands and mill workers, doctors and professors, merchants and bankers, white and colored, rich and poor, all served their country. Such a story as they together could tell would provide the community with a panorama of the great common action, each scene of which would depict the vital part played by a soldier, a sailor, or a flyer from this section of Virginia. Unfortunately a complete history of Charlottesville and Albemarle servicemen can never be written. All knowledge of the deeds of many brave men died with them on the field of battle, and most veterans are reluctant to discuss their experiences. In the following pages are told fragments of their story. The limitations of space and the lack of accurate and complete information have made it necessary to exclude accounts of many brave deeds and important accomplishments from this book, but the experiences of a representative few are set down, as being typical of many others. They are permitted, so far as has been found practicable, to tell their story in their own words. Thus one is enabled to view in miniature the melodrama of life at the battlefronts as it appeared to those who knew its hazards, drudgery, and achievements. XIII Liberating Mediterranean Shores Long before Pearl Harbor some Americans were involved in the fighting. Besides those who joined the armed services of the Allied nations, there were American merchant seamen who carried war supplies to England and her allies. Larry D. Holland of Charlottesville was a member of the crew of the Charles Pratt. When the neutrality law forbade United States ships to carry war supplies, this Americanowned tanker, flying the Panamanian flag, cruised in submarine infested waters. On the afternoon of December 21, 1940, off the coast of West Africa, it was struck by two torpedoes and went down in flames. Four members of the crew were lost, but Holland and thirty-seven others escaped in lifeboats. For six days before arriving at Freetown, South Africa, they were without food and water.1 On March 20, 1941, the Egyptian steamer Zamzam left New York bound for Alexandria. Among her passengers was Thomas Olney Greenough of Proffit, one of a group of twenty-four ambulance drivers recruited by the British-American Ambulance Corps and bound for service with the “Free French” in North Africa. On April 9 the vessel left Recife, Brazil, expecting to call at Capetown, Union of South Africa, two weeks later. About 6:00 A. M. on April 17 the German raider Tamesis overtook the Zamzam and shelled her for about ten minutes, though the defenseless victim had raised the signal of surrender. The members of the ambulance corps with self-sacrificing devotion cared for the wounded while the ship, which had been hit eight or nine times, was in imminent danger of sinking. At first taken aboard the raider, the survivors were later transferred to a freighter, the Dresden. While aboard ship the prisoners were, to use a German term, treated “correctly” but without humanity. After a long zigzag voyage through the British blockade the Dresden on May 20 discharged Greenough and the other prisoners at St. Jean-de-Luz on the German-occupied west coast of France. Two days before, the Alexandria Navigation Company had reported the long overdue Zamzam as sunk. Greenough, with the other Americans, was confined by the Germans at the Hotel Beau Sejour at Biarritz. On May 31 all Americans except twenty-one ambulance drivers were released, but the Germans seemed unable to make up their minds as to whether Greenough and the other drivers were military personnel or not. Put aboard a prison train bound for an undisclosed destination on June 28 and warned that the guards had orders to shoot to kill if any attempted to escape, the ambulance drivers suspected they were headed for a German concentration camp. In a conversation with the guards Greenough learned that the group was on its way to Mulhouse and then on to the Black Forest. Piqued when the German guards ridiculed the possibility of escape, and wanting another opportunity for active service, Greenough and his friend James Stewart leaped through the window at about one-thirty in the morning while the train was stopped at Poitiers. After a chase they eluded their guards. “They almost caught us in the railroad yards when I caught my foot in a switch,” Greenough said, “but we managed to jerk it free before the guards could reach us.” For three and a half days they hid during the day and traveled at night. Their supplies included three loaves of German sour bread, two cans of sardines, a can of bully beef, and water, but lack of a can opener forced them to subsist on bread. On the fourth day, worn out by their trek which had taken them about forty miles southeast as the crow flies, but much farther than that when detours were included, they concluded they had reached unoccupied France. “The first person we met was an old peasant woman,” Greenough recalled, “and when we asked if we were in Free France, she replied sadly, 'None of France is free.' ” In unoccupied France the police gave them passage to Marseille. There the American consul arranged for them to travel across Spain to Portugal, where passage home was secured. Meanwhile, the Germans had announced the release of the remaining American ambulance drivers. When he arrived in New York on July 28, Greenough at once volunteered for a new ambulance unit which was forming. So well did he serve as a member of the American Field Service that he was twice awarded the Croix de Guerre by the French Government.2 After the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the United States was officially in the shooting war. American ships put out to sea and ran the gauntlet of enemy submarines. Gordon Witt Black of Crozet was a member of the forward damage control party of the USS Laramie, which was torpedoed off the coast of Newfoundland by the Germans on August 28, 1942. A torpedo cut a hole in one of the big oil tanks of the Laramie, which caused the ship to list, but within nine minutes Black had the pumps going and the ship soon righted itself.3 In November, 1942, an American army landed in North Africa and began the march which was to end in the heart of Germany. Rugged Major General Lucian King Truscott, Jr., who had adopted Charlottesville—the girlhood home of his wife—as his residence, commanded a special task force of the 9th Division which had the difficult mission of capturing Port Lyautey in French Morocco.4 With Truscott as commanding officer of the air section of the task force was Colonel Demas Thurlow Craw, a native of Traverse City, Michigan, who had made Charlottesville his home. One of the very young enlisted men who volunteered during the First World War, he later attended West Point and was commissioned in 1924. Four years later he transferred from the Infantry to the Air Corps. During the early days of the war in Europe he was an Army air observer with the British Middle East Command and served as military attaché first in Athens and then in Ankara. Lieutenant General Delos Emmons called him “our most valuable foreign observer.” Craw, who was one of the first Americans to take a definite stand as an enemy of Nazi Germany, did not wait for Pearl Harbor to get into the fight. With the British he took part in twenty-one bombing raids over Axis-held territory and was under fire a total of 136 times. All this before the United States declared war! In many ways Craw fought a personal war with the Axis. While he was in Greece before the United States entered the war, his car accidently sideswiped an Italian major's car. During the ensuing altercation, the Itailan ordered the two armed privates accompanying him to hold Craw, who was in civilian clothes, and then slapped his face. Breaking away, Craw knocked the major down, while the Greek crowd cheered. A German colonel pushed through the crowd, intervened in the unequal battle, and inquired what the trouble was. Craw told him and added that he would be happy to give the Italian satisfaction at any time, any place: but the major had had enough. Then Craw asked the German colonel to say for him. “I consider you, major, an insult to the profession of an officer, an insult to the soldiery as a whole and even an insult to the Italian Army, which I believe to be the worst on earth.” The Italian winced. The next day the Italian major, wearing a black eye, made a formal diplomatic apology. After that Craw was the toast of the Greeks during the rest of his stay in Athens.5 “Nick,” as Craw was known to his friends, was a favorite with the English soldiers, and it befell his lot to interpret them to the people of the United States. Because he lived with the British in the field, he could deny with authority the Axis-inspired reports that American-made tanks and other material were being abused or wasted by the English. He saw the excellent care which was actually taken of weapons and raised his voice to combat Axis propaganda. After the United States entered the war he was able to say of English cooperation with the Americans: “I once had part of the responsibility for setting up an airdrome near Cairo for one of the first contingents of American planes to get into action in the Middle East. The British had picked what they considered a choice spot and had turned it into a surprisingly competent airport. Concrete aprons had been laid out where the planes could warm up without drawing sand into their innards, and sandbag protection for planes had been provided at dispersal points around the field. Comfortable quarters were erected for the men. Efforts were made to permit both officers and men to join the common English social activities, and perhaps most important of all, American officers were given honest access to all background information the British possessed. “Then, for strategic reasons, I had to reject the airdrome. I picked another site, and hundreds of workmen were turned loose to make it as good a field as the first. Then I discovered I could move into still a third location I had thought was closed to me, so I shifted again and once more the British pitched in with every facility they could muster to make it a workable base. During three switches, I did not get one complaint from the British; only cooperation which could scarcely have been more complete.”6 In 1942 Craw returned to the United States, where he shared his first-hand knowledge of modern warfare with troops in training and with the officers who were planning the invasion of North Africa. Twice for a few golden days he was at home with his wife and young son, Nicholas, at “Dunlora” on the outskirts of Charlottesville. Some hours were spent in the Colonnade Club at the University sitting for his portrait, which was painted by F. Graham Cootes. Then in October he said his final goodbye and sailed from Norfolk for North Africa. Craw's part in the invasion is best told in the words of Major General Truscott. “I had known Nick for years. In fact, I had something to do with his courtship. I was delighted when he was placed in command of the air section of our task force. All the way over the ocean, while I worked on a plan for the delivery of a letter to the French commandant here, outlining in President Roosevelt's words our reasons for landing and hoping to avoid bloodshed, Nick begged to be allowed to deliver the letter. “I refused. I told him it was a highly risky proposition and he was too valuable a man to take a chance with, as he was in charge of all my air support. But he pleaded so hard, I finally relented. I had already decided to send Major (now Colonel) Pierpont Morgan Hamilton, who knew the French people and language well. But I figured Craw was such a knowledgable and likable fellow that together they would make a perfect team. Craw told his two subordinates the order to succeeding in command should he not come back. “At dawn of November 8 they embarked on a landing craft bearing a jeep. Guns were already flashing from ship and shore. The last time I heard Nick was over the radio, swearing: 'Damn it, we're being shelled by both you fellows and the French.' Then they started up the beach. “Despite all the shells, they made their way as far as a French outpost in a jeep bearing both French and American flags. They asked a French N. C. O. for an escort to deliver the letter. The N. C. O. said he had no man to spare, so they started up the road again. Just at the edge of Port Lyautey there was a burst of machinegun fire. Craw slumped, dead. Hamilton, who was sitting right behind him, ordered the driver to halt and they were surrounded by French soldiers and officers. “Well, that's about all. Hamilton was taken to headquarters and allowed to deliver the message. There was no reply. I refused to negotiate surrender terms at the end of a three-day battle until I had heard from Hamilton by radio. Things came through fairly well, although the French had strong forces. Craw's fighters did the job beautifully along the plans he had conceived and under the command he had arranged. “Nick knew he was taking a big chance, but he wanted to. He liked sticking out his neck. I guess he figured he was pretty nearly indestructible. I rather think we all who knew him thought so. The French were very apologetic. They said he was a gallant gentleman.”7 On March 19, 1943, in his study at the White House President Roosevelt presented the Medal of Honor posthumously awarded Colonel Craw to his widow, Mrs. Mary Wesson Craw, while his son Nicholas watched. The citation signed by the President read: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action above and beyond the call of duty. On November 8, 1942, near Port Lyautey, French Morocco, Colonel Craw volunteered to accompany the leading wave of assault boats to the shore and pass through the enemy lines to locate the French commander with a view to suspending hostilities. This request was first refused as being too dangerous but upon the officer's insistence that he was qualified to undertake and accomplish the mission he was allowed to go. Encountering heavy fire while in the landing boat and unable to dock in the river because of shell fire from shore batteries, Colonel Craw accompanied by one officer and one soldier succeeded in landing on the beach at Mehdia Plage under constant low level strafing from three enemy Gallant “Nick” Craw “knew he was taking a big chance, but he wanted to.” planes. Riding in a bantam truck toward French headquarters, progress of the party was hindered by fire from our own Naval guns. Nearing Port Lyautey, Colonel Craw was instantly killed by a sustained burst of machine gun fire at point blank range from a concealed position near the road. The great air base at Port Lyautey was fittingly named Craw Field in his honor, and not far away, near twin poles bearing French and American flags, he rests in the military cemetery. Atop his grave the numeral “1” reminds all who pass by that he was the first American to fall in the liberation of North Africa. To Craw and those who followed him the local inhabitants paid tribute with a wreath bearing the simple words, “A nos camarades, les Americans.”8 While General Truscott was pushing his army ashore, another task force was taking Casablanca and nearby Fedhala, fifty miles to the southwest of Port Lyautey. Shipfitter First Class Brown Lewis Craig of Charlottesville, a veteran of four years in the Navy and four years in the Merchant Marine, was in the Fedhala Roads aboard the USS Edward Rutledge, a transport which had formerly been the liner Exeter. On Thursday, November 12, 1942, the German submarine U-130 slipped into Fedhala Roads and at six o'clock in the evening made a highly successful torpedo attack. The transports, USS Edward Rutledge, USS Tasker H. Bliss, and USS Hugh L. Scott, each struck twice, burst into flames. Among the transports anchored nearby the USS Thomas Jefferson, the former President Garfield, was not attacked. The U-boat escaped to the north. The Edward Rutledge, which had already discharged its troops, had aboard, beside the crew, thirty-one sick patients and some survivors from the USS Joseph Hewes, which had been torpedoed the night before. The Rutledge was abandoned in perfect order and only fifteen men were lost. However, some of the crew had to swim, among them Craig, who was counted among the missing until the next morning. Because the sea was calm, he was able to cover the three and a half miles to the beach in about three hours. For two days and nights he lived in a Catholic church where survivors were cared for by the French people. “The following Saturday, we were moved by French railroad in the old 40-and-8 box cars to the town of Casablanca,” Craig recalled. “Since our clothes were all on board ship and we'd stripped in the water, we were forced to wear blankets for two weeks.” His dress resembled that of the Arabs, many of whom were operating as enemy snipers in the early days, Craig said. “But you don't blame them—they don't really know who they're fighting for,” he added. “You give them a pack of cigarettes, and they kill for you. Your enemy gives them a pack, they kill for him. Why, I even had one Arab who dug a fox hole for me on the beach, and when enemy planes flew over, he'd shove me down in the fox hole and stand up and watch the planes fly over himself!”9 The 8th Evacuation Hospital arrived at Casablanca on November 19, 1942, aboard the former Grace liner Santa Paula in the first support convoy. “We sighted land this morning about 8:30,” wrote an officer, “but it wasn't until about 10:30 that we were really sure it was land. It has been an essentially uneventful trip, no real trouble. Byrd [Stuart Leavell] slept in his clothes all the way over and we felt that as long as he did that, our luck would hold, and so it has. As we came in toward shore the destroyers, subchasers and planes herded us along. It reminded me of a bunch of collies driving sheep through a gate.” “I never realized before how thoroughly the Germans had looted Africa,” an officer wrote a few days later. “No gasoline is available for civilians and all the cars have been fixed to burn charcoal. There is no butter, no coffee, no cream, no potatoes, no real bread (all of it is made from soya beans), no sugar, nothing to eat except eggs, eggs and eggs. The Boche have taken everything that the natives raise, either for use in France or Germany, probably the latter. Already more food is becoming available to the natives since the German robbery has stopped. The natives claim that in two or three months things really would have been bad, but I don't see how they could have become much worse than at present. With all the money in the world you can't get a real meal in the best local restaurant. I got a piece of 'beefsteak' yesterday that was so tough I couldn't make any headway with it whatever. I don't think it belonged to the cow family. I am sticking to my 'C' and 'K' field rations for the time being.”10 Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Lincoln F. Putnam the hospital was set up in the Italian Consulate and School on the rue Mangin and rue Jacques Bainville in Casablanca. It was the first American hospital to function in French Morocco, and from November 26, 1942, to March 10, 1943, operated as a Provisional General Hospital. During this period 4,192 patients were received; however, only sixty-one of these were battle casualties.11 The fifty-three nurses assigned to the unit had been left at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, and later sent to Halloran General Hospital in New York. Enlisted men were substituted for them. The Army was unwilling to risk women in the landing and refused to consider the earnest pleading of the nurses to be allowed to accompany the men. As soon as the 8th Evacuation Hospital was ashore a request to have the nurses join the group was sent through channels, but it took considerable work on the part of Lieutenant Ruth Beery, the chief nurse, to get the necessary orders issued. Not until March did the nurses reach Casablanca. Although the men had done a fine job, everyone was delighted when the nurses arrived and began to render those services which only a trained nurse knows how to give. The feminine touch was responsible for many improvements. In March, shortly before the arrival of the nurses, the “8th Evac” was moved into tents on Anfa Hill outside Casablanca and became a Convalescent Hospital. On May 2 Lieutenant Colonel Staige Davis Blackford wrote: “I would guess that we have handled as many patients as any similar outfit in the Army in the same time, and I am proud to say that I think we have handled them well, although you might get different reports from the military authorities, because patients to us are still more important than having all the cots in a nice little row.”12 In July the unit went by train to Algiers, the trip taking four days. Six weeks were spent at Cap Matifou near Algiers, where volleyball and swimming in the Mediterranean occupied most of the time. Then the 8th Evac was ordered into a staging area near Oran to await the imminent attack on Italy.13 Captain Robert B. Ritchie of Charlottesville landed on the Mediterranean coast of North Africa east of Oran at Arzeu. A member of the 32nd Field Artillery Battalion of the First Division, he went ashore at 1:00 A. M. on November 8, 1942. “We fought the French for three days and finally took Oran,” he wrote. “The French put up a very good fight and the experience we gained proved to be invaluable in the battles we later fought.” Christmas Eve and Christmas Day he fought a battle in the vicinity of Medjez-el-Bab, Tunisia, and then continued defensive warfare in the area for the next seven weeks. “The Germans sent several strong patrols into our positions which were twice driven off with heavy losses,” he recalled. “There were a few dive-bombing attacks by the German Stukas, but the main activity was artillery which dominated the front.” Later he took part in the campaign which drove the Germans from North Africa with great losses. “On Good Friday, we were in very heavy battle,” he remembered, “and I was slightly wounded in the right side by a small shell fragment from a German artillery shell. The wound, however, was slight, and I was able to continue the battle, and it soon healed completely.”14 A member of the crew of a 30-ton tank, Private Raymond Lee Davis of Charlottesville was in the thick of the fighting in North Africa. “On the desert we would cook in the daytime and freeze at night,” he recalled. “The Italians gave up. They didn't want to fight. The only way the enemy could hold ground was when they would back up onto a hill, and we were out in the open. Otherwise, when we were both in the open, well. ...” On April 23, 1943, a few days before German resistance in North Africa collapsed, his tank was hit by an 88-mm. shell and set on fire. Davis was severely burned on the hands and arms. Seven hours later he was in a North African hospital, and on May 21 he landed in the United States for further treatment.15 The bitterness felt by the men on North African battlefields against striking coal miners back in the United States found expression in letters written by Lieutenant Philip G. Walker of Charlottesville. They also reflected the confident, determined spirit of American soldiers. “The fighting is bloody, constant, and bitter ...,” he wrote. “We are driving them back, hill by hill, and even field by field. At every advance we pass more German dead. Heaven help them. The fewer prisoners we take the better I like it. I am not asking for any compromises and the Jerrys sure won't get any. ...”16 On May 9, 1943, the German commanders in North Africa surrendered. Two months later, on July 10, the invasion of Sicily began. Lieutenant Benjamin F. D. Runk of the Coast Guard, who in civilian life taught biology at the University of Virginia, enjoyed a ringside seat and described the landing. “As far as you could see there were ships—battleships and cruisers, large transports, destroyers, freighters, tankers, patrol boats, tank barges, troop barges, sub-chasers and submarines—all in perfect order, formation and units. It was a sight never to be forgotten. The greatest single fighting unit of all times. ... “The time passed quickly and about midnight on Friday, [July 9,] the planes were heard going overhead with paratroopers, soon to come over again on their way back to their bases after dropping their troops. It was then that things began to happen. Flares began dropping to light up the land, ten miles or so off, and big flares were back of the shore, which had been started by the paratroopers. They lit up the sky and gave us a good silhouette of the shore. Searchlights began to go on and off on the shore and we expected all hell to break loose. “I stood on the sun deck and watched it all. You could make out in the darkness the other ships and all were heading in to their assigned places. About 1:30 A. M. we lowered our boats for the first wave ashore and they were off. As they got close in ... shore, batteries began to fire, with machine guns and rifles popping. The searchlights kept going off and on, but when one stayed on too long, one of our destroyers or cruisers would open up, and you could watch the ball of fire from the gun to the target. This would mean one less light to bother us. “It was a wonderful picture of unity and cooperation. Our troops got off in good shape, plus their mobile equipment, and by noon I think all those who were to go ashore from our ship had been landed. All this time, we were also unloading ammunition, guns, trucks, food, and everything you can think of. On the return trips to our ship the boats would come to their assigned places to take on a jeep, truck, or load of ammunition. “With daylight came our fighter planes to protect us and all the day was peaceful, considering all, except for the shooting ashore and the constant shelling of the enemy by our battleships. They did a marvelous job and helped no end in establishing our beachhead. They shelled the roads and approaches and were marvelous in their accuracy. “When darkness came Saturday you could watch the shells travel right to their targets. Saturday night was quiet except for the constant shelling, but at dawn on Sunday I was at my post when I heard the scream of the bombs as they came down and missed us— thank God!—by a matter of a few feet. The concussion and shock were severe and made all quite jumpy for a spell. The work of unloading continued as soon as the flight of planes had passed, and soon we were back to normalcy, only to be again bombed by a flight of 25 or 30 Focke-Wulfs in the afternoon. Their bombs came much too close for comfort and being the biggest ship at the end of a unit, we got more than our share.”17 At Point Calava on Sicily the coastal highway passes through a great rock ridge. The Americans expected the enemy to blow up the tunnel, sealing the entrance, but the Germans had a better idea. Just beyond the tunnel they blew a hole 150 feet long in the road, where it ran along a rock shelf a couple of hundred feet above the sea. The gap had to be bridged in a hurry by the engineers, who at once set about the difficult job. The beloved Ernie Pyle tells the dramatic story. “Around 10:30 [P. M.] Major General Lucian Truscott, commanding the Third Division, came up to see how the work was coming along. Bridging that hole was his main interest in life right then. He couldn't help any, of course, but somehow he couldn't bear to leave. He stood around and talked to officers, and after a while he went off a few feet to one side and sat down on the ground and lit a cigarette. “A moment later, a passing soldier saw the glow and leaned over and said, 'Hey, gimme a light, will you?' The general did and the soldier never knew he had been ordering the general around. “General Truscott, like many men of great action, had the ability to refresh himself by tiny catnaps of five or ten minutes. So instead of going back to his command post and going to bed, he stretched out there against some rocks and dozed off. One of the working engineers came past, dragging some air hose. It got tangled up in the general's feet. The tired soldier was annoyed, and he said crossly to the dark, anonymous figure on the ground, 'If you're not working, get the hell out of the way.' “The general got up and moved farther back without saying a word. ... “Around 11 A. M. jeeps had begun to line up at the far end of the tunnel. They carried reconnaissance platoons, machine gunners and boxes of ammunition. They'd been given No. 1 priority to cross the bridge. Major General Truscott arrived again and sat on a log talking with the engineering officers, waiting patiently. Around dusk of the day before, the engineers had told me they'd have jeeps across the crater by noon of the next day. It didn't seem possible at the time, but they knew whereof they spoke. But even they would have to admit it was pure coincidence that the first jeep rolled cautiously across the bridge at high noon, to the very second. “In that first jeep were General Truscott and his driver, facing a 200-foot tumble into the sea if the bridge gave way. The engineers had insisted they send a test jeep across. But when he saw it was ready, the general just got in and went. It wasn't done dramatically but it was a dramatic thing. It showed that the Old Man had complete faith in his engineers. I heard soldiers speak of it appreciatively for an hour.”18 Sicily was taken in thirty-nine days, and the Allies pushed on into Italy. By October 1, 1943, the islands of Sardinia and Corsica had been occupied. Air bases were set up from which Germany was bombed. Miss Lucy Shields, a teacher at St. Anne's School, and her friend, Miss Marion Hamilton, were assigned to an airfield on Sardinia as American Red Cross workers. Early in 1944 Miss Shields wrote: “I never knew what it was to be busy until I came to Sardinia. Marion and I manage fairly easily to meet all the missions and to distribute doughnuts all over the island, but it's the parties and other things which keep us running. We are expected to and like to go to officers' parties, and in addition try to put on one or two a week for enlisted men. We are very lucky if we get one night off a week to rest or just have a date. I've been having fun recently trying to furnish the various squadron clubs. It's a terrific job to find any kind of furniture and we come out with very odd mixtures. ... “Recently I took the day off and went boar hunting. It was certainly an experience I wouldn't have missed. We went way back in the mountains and then got on horses to climb up to the lodge. It was strictly a native affair. We had about ten dogs, about thirty beaters, four Italian officers, five American officers, me, and all the rest local Sardinians. The meals were only meat roasted over a fire in the middle of the room, no knives, forks or anything. Along with the meat they passed around a jug of wine which everyone drank out of. Afterward we walked for about an hour and took our stands while the dogs and beaters drove the boar in. We did kill one, at least somebody did, and the next night had a delicious boar dinner.”19 As the 34th Division pushed north in Italy it suffered the usual casualties of combat. On November 6, 1943, Private Charles T. Norcross of Charlottesville was wounded and then taken prisoner. The Germans gave him no medical care but shipped him off to East Prussia, where he was confined with other Americans. During the summer Norcross worked sixteen hours a day on a farm, driving horses. He was paid seventy pfennigs or about eight cents a day, but as there was no post exchange, he had little use for the money. The daily food allowance consisted of black bread and a soup made of one pound of horse meat per thirty-five men. It was the Red Cross which kept the American prisoners of war alive with packages of food, clothes, games, and musical instruments. When the Russians advanced into East Prussia, the Germans marched Norcross and the other American prisoners, underfed and poorly clothed, 450 miles in fifty-one days to Cella in the heart of Germany. When he was at last liberated in April, 1945, he wrote to his parents, “I feel like the happiest boy in the world.”20 With the 36th Division, which had landed at Salerno, was Private First Class Robert E. Watson of Charlottesville. On December 8, 1943, his infantry company attacked the Germans east of the small town of San Pietro on the southern slope of Mount Sammucro. When Watson was fifty yards from the enemy position, he stepped on a German S-mine. His right foot was blown off, his left leg broken, and his hands burned. First aid men rushed to him, put tourniquets on both his legs, and bandaged both his hands. They could not evacuate him until later because of the very heavy enemy fire falling in the area. Watson carried the company's portable radio, which was smashed when he was wounded. Realizing that this radio was his company commander's only means of communication, Watson, in spite of great pain, shock, and loss of blood, endeavored to repair it, working diligently for a long time. He was unable to make it work, but his fortitude and devotion to duty won for him the first Distinguished Service Cross awarded to a soldier from Charlottesville in the Second World War.21 The 8th Evacuation Hospital landed at Salerno, Italy, on September 21, 1943, twelve days after D-Day. The nurses were among the first American women to set foot on the liberated soil of Europe. After a most unpleasant crossing in a British boat, on which practically all were made ill by food prepared in a dirty galley, they went ashore to live in an open field without tents. On the morning following debarkation, news came that the Liberty ship on which all the hospital's equipment was loaded had been sunk just outside Salerno harbor. Then followed some anxious days during which it was feared the unit might be broken up and its personnel scattered, but the group was kept together and for a while assisted other hospitals. Meanwhile a tornado swept through the Salerno area, blowing down everyone's tent and casting all remaining possessions into the mud. The 8th Evacuation Hospital was completely re-equipped, and on December 19 began to function independently at Teano on the highway from Naples to Cassino. The work here was hard. The mud was often ankle deep in the wards, making it difficult to stay upright. Nevertheless there was some of the joy of living also. A nurse, Lieutenant Mamie E. Kidd, who formerly lived in Scottsville, wrote: “I had the nicest Christmas I can imagine away from home. Three of our friends came in about 4 A. M. Christmas morning. Mary Ellen [Gibson] and I are on night duty, so we stayed up all day to see them. They brought up a tree, oranges, apples, nuts, a trailer of wood, five gallons of kerosene and a wooden platform for the front of our beds (so nice not to have to put our feet down on wet earth). We decorated the tree with strings of Life-Savers, tinfoil and shiny red paper. We had it on a table covered with a white sheet and red tissue paper. Our candles and packages filled it up. Our cards we strung and hung around the sides of our tent. Quite a Christmasy affair! “I filled some socks for my patients. The Red Cross had gifts for them all. You should have seen their faces. One boy of 19 years, who looked about 15, was a joy to behold, he looked so thrilled.”22 New Year's Eve brought another tornado which blew down the tents of other hospitals in the area, but much back-breaking work by the enlisted men held the 8th Evac's tents in place throughout the storm. Therefore, patients from other hospitals as well as fresh battle casualties were sent to the 8th Evac for care. Between March 23 and 27 the hospital moved a few miles to the west and set up at Carinola. During May, while the drive on Rome was in progress, George Tucker, a war correspondent who was recovering from a jeep accident, wrote of the 8th Evac: “For days I have been lying here watching the passionless routine of a hospital getting ready for a battle—the clearing of wards, evacuation of patients who could be transferred safely to the rear, bringing the blood bank to a maximum, and countless other steps that always precede an attack. “When it came, I stood under the stars in the front ward tent and watched the whole perimeter of the horizon leap into light as hundreds of guns all the way from Cassino to the sea simultaneously went into action. “ 'We will begin to get our first casualties in a couple of hours,' said the officers in the receiving tent. But it was almost 3 A. M. when the first ambulance turned into the drive. ... “I spent almost all the rest of the night in the operating room where four surgical teams worked simultaneously, and in the shock wards where the incoming casualties were prepared for operation.”23 “All through the day and night litter bearers have come in from the environs around Santa Maria Infante which our infantry retook yesterday after the Germans had kicked us out,” he wrote later. “The litter bearers place the wounded on saw horses, like carpenters use, and when every inch of space is crowded they spill over into adjoining wards. “When a man is hit he goes 'in shock.' His blood pressure falls and his pulse-beat increases. Unless he can be brought out of the shock he can't survive an operation, and that is where plasma comes in. You walk down the lengthening rows of white faces and wonder how they can pull through. Plasma does it. I saw a man from Ohio take ten units of plasma and come back from the fluttery edges of death. Color flooded back into his face and his pulse fell almost to normal. Recovery now is almost certain. “It is startling the way infantrymen can bear in silence almost anything the battlefield can throw at them. It humbles you to stand amid hundreds of men whose bodies have been shattered and not hear one single word of complaint. They just lie there, waiting their turn to be taken into the operating room. ... “Sometimes a heart-breaking choice must be made between a man who has no chance and another whom surgery might save. A lieutenant seemed perfectly calm and looked up with wide, clear eyes, but his spinal cord had been severed and nothing human hands could do would make him whole again. Next to him was a man who had been hit hard through the chest. But he still had a chance, and so they took him.”24 A day or two later the routine of the hospital was broken when a rather unusual casualty was brought in. “My God, it's a girl!”, the ward attendant cried. Indeed it was a girl, a French WAC who had been shot as she drove into the battle zone. “I guess I got on the wrong road,” she explained to the nurses in French.25 When the great drive through Rome carried the fighting rapidly to the north, the hospital was set up for brief periods at Cellole, Le Ferriere, and Grosseto as it followed the Army up the west coast of Italy. During 1944 the 8th Evacuation Hospital made seven moves aggregating 425 miles, but lost only eleven days of operation, a record of which to be proud.26 From July 3 to August 29 the hospital was at Cecina, just south of Leghorn. It then moved inland to Galluzzo, a suburb of Florence, where it remained until October 12. Two days later it was set up at Pietramala, 3,400 feet above sea level. During the short, cold days the fog hung low, shutting out the sun. Rain turned the area into one great mud hole, which swallowed 1,600 truck loads of rock before passable roads were obtained. In December, when it was evident that the American offensive was stalled, efforts were made to “winterize” the hospital. Work had hardly begun when a storm wrecked the tents. Lumber was blown about like match sticks. By Christmas there was a foot of snow, but meanwhile the tents had been floored and walled and some prefabricated buildings set up. The completion of the winterizing was celebrated by a Christmas party at which egg nog, a compound of powdered eggs and cognac, was served. The pièce de resistance at Christmas dinner was potatoes, real potatoes, not dehydrated potatoes. These had been peeled by the nurses because the enlisted men were too busy completing the construction to undertake the necessary K. P. During the next two months the ground was covered with six to eighteen inches of snow. The weather was clear but cold. Adequate heating was impossible. Wood for the stoves was scarce, but even scarcer were hatchets for splitting kindling. A nurse commented that someone should make friends with the quartermasters and get a hatchet. “What's wrong with the Engineers?”, demanded Brigadier General Frank O. Bowman of Charlottesville, who was a patient. “We have fine hatchets.” Making good on a promise, he shortly afterward delivered a hatchet for each nurses' tent. With the return of spring, the Americans resumed their advance. On April 30, 1945, the hospital began operation at Buttapietra, six miles south of Verona. With the capitulation of the Germans a few days later, battle casualties suddenly dropped off. The 8th Evacuation Hospital was at Rivoltella, on the south shore of Lake Garda, when it was officially dissolved on September 29, 1945, and most of the personnel were started back to the United States. Lieutenant Colonel Everett Cato Drash of Charlottesville was the last commanding officer. Many individuals with the 8th Evac were decorated for the outstanding services they had rendered. Recognition came to the group as a whole with the award of the Fifth Army Plaque for meritorious service during the month of January, 1944, and the award of the Meritorious Service Unit Plaque on September 10, 1945.27 While overseas the 8th Evacuation Hospital admitted 46,585 patients, of whom 10,419 were suffering from battle wounds. A total of 11,398 patients were operated upon, but there were only 129 post-operative deaths. Only nine of its patients died from disease. Beside those admitted, 24,483 persons were treated as outpatients. Of the 650,000 battle wounded of the United States Army and Navy from Pearl Harbor to V-J Day, 1.6 per cent were attended by the 8th Evacuation Hospital, an outstanding accomplishment.28 In order to disrupt communications in the German rear and perhaps turn their flank, an American and British force was landed at Anzio, twenty-five miles south of Rome, on January 22, 1944. The Germans quickly met the threat and bitter fighting ensued. Among the troops holding the beachhead were the joint American-Canadian First Special Service Force, which had first seen service at Kiska, Alaska. Around Cassino, Italy, where they had become known to the Germans as the “Black Devils” because of the disguising grease which they smeared on their faces when they went on night patrols, they had borne the brunt of much of the fighting. Lieutenant Graham McElhenny Heilman of Charlottesville, whom his friends called “Gus,” led the company which on February 2 took a pretty little Italian village near Anzio. Soon the town was known as “Gusville” in honor of its liberator. The force fought for ninety-nine days on the German side of the Mussolini Canal without relief.29 Also with the “Black Devils” at Anzio was Sergeant Nelson B. Fox of Proffit. He kept six hens in his fox hole to provide eggs. When enemy shelling began, the hens, like their owner would make a dive for the protection of the fox hole. The “Devils” specialized in sending out small groups to clean out houses of Jerries at night. Every gun they knocked out or enemy they killed was marked by a red arrow sticker, the force's emblem, on which was “USA-Canada” and the colloquial German expression “Das dicke ende kommt noch,” meaning “Your number's coming up next.”30 With a 45th Division tank destroyer crew at Anzio, Private Luther D. Bunch of Route 1, Charlottesville, was in the thick of the fighting. “We saw a tank column heading along a nearby ravine,” he said. “They stopped advancing as soon as we opened fire. Then, as our shells dropped closer, they swung around and quickly retreated. They were scooting along pretty fast and we didn't score any direct hits on that tank column.” Of another occasion, however, he said, “We sighted the Tiger tank clattering toward us during a German attack on our outpost. We opened fire and disabled the Tiger tank with three rounds of armor-piercing ammunition. A few minutes later we shelled German troops and knocked out a German troop-carrying truck along a beachhead road.” During periods of relaxation Bunch played poker with the other crew men inside the tank destroyer. Much time was spent keeping it shipshape. As Bunch expressed it, “It's my home for the duration.”31 While the Infantry struggled to move north in Italy, the Army Air Forces were pounding the German lines of communication. On April 1, 1944, Second Lieutenant Richard G. Miller, Jr., of Charlottesville, one of a flight of A-26 Invaders, destroyed a railroad bridge near Attaliane on the Rome-Florence railroad. The pilots had begun their dives on the bridge when an ammunition train was observed moving onto the bridge. The locomotive and several cars received direct bomb hits. Violent explosions followed. Coming out of their dives the flyers had to dodge the flying debris.32 On August 6, 1944, while flying an escort mission for a group of bombers bound for Budapest, Second Lieutenant Carl E. Johnson of Charlottesville shot down a Messerschmitt 109 interceptor. Describing the flight in a letter to his mother, Lieutenant Johnson said he shot the enemy plane down and immediately dived at about 450 miles per hour and got back to his base before the other planes could catch up. Subsequently he raised his record to two enemy aircraft and one probable. Johnson, who had been the top honor man of his cadet class, was a member of the famous 99th Fighter Group, the first all-Negro flying unit in the Army. The group by its sterling performance won the respect of all who flew under its protection.33 Describing bombing raids over Axis territory, Lieutenant Francis Bradley Peyton, III, of Charlottesville said, “We take off on practically a split second, after having been given minute directions as to the route we are to take both ways, and the opposition we are likely to encounter. An escort accompanies us on part of the mission. On our mission we are instructed as to the proper procedure we are to follow in getting back to our base. We are provided with escape kits, with a map of the territory over which we go, first aid kits, and about $40 in money. ... “Our daylight missions are always in formation. Each of us follows a squadron leader. If one bomber encounters trouble and drops out, another takes his place.” A B-24 bomber pilot, Lieutenant Peyton participated in fifty-one missions over the Balkans, Italy, France, and Germany.34 When escorting heavy bombers in an assault on the oil installations at Brux, Germany, on October 16, 1944, Second Lieutenant Royal S. Swing of Charlottesville, a Mustang pilot with the 15th Air Force, sighted a large group of enemy fighters. “I saw one start after my flight leader, so I gave chase,” said Lieutenant Swing later. “My leader turned after three other ME 109's and the Jerry and I became separated from them. I kept on his tail until, after a few bursts, I hit his fuselage on the right and he rolled over and down a couple of hundred feet where he bailed out. After that I looked for my formation but only saw ME 109's, plenty of them all around me, so I got out of there fast!”35 Near Futu Pass, Italy, on September 23, 1944, a platoon of the 91st Division was advancing through heavy fire when the platoon leader and two non-commissioned officers were cut down, leaving the group leaderless. Staff Sergeant Andrew J. Dawson of Schuyler, realizing that the force was in a serious position, immediately took command. Under intense mortar and machinegun fire he moved about, reorganizing the platoon. He made his way to each of his squads and gave them instructions and encouragement. To each he assigned its proper mission and indicated a route of advance. Sergeant Dawson then led the platoon through the enemy's fierce fire in an assault which captured a strongly fortified hill. The Silver Star was awarded to him.36 On March 14, 1945, First Lieutenant Joseph G. Pace of Charlottesville, a P-51 Mustang fighter pilot with the 325th Fighter Group, while escorting a group of heavy bombers attacking the Nove Zamke railroad yards in Hungary, won his first aerial victory. On the return trip his oxygen pressure failed, and he was forced to drop out of the high altitude escort and come down to about 10,000 feet. Here he ran into a group of four German Focke-Wulf 190 fighters with five others nearby. “As I radioed to the rest of the squadron I made a pass at the four-plane formation,” Lieutenant Pace recounted on returning to his base. “When my burst hit the fuselage of a FW-190 the plane made a lazy-S dive and crashed in flames.” The squadron found approximately thirty-four German fighters in the area. The largest air battle of the year for the 15th Air Force ensued, during which seventeen German planes were shot down and the remainder driven off.37 On May 11, 1944, the 85th Division was making an all out advance on Rome, and the southwestern end of the Gustav line north of Naples had to be breached. Sergeant George William Davis with Company G, 339th Infantry, took part in the attack on Hill 79. He was wounded at Trimonsuoli as the drive started, but he entered Rome with his outfit. Subsequently he was commissioned a second lieutenant but was later killed in an automobile accident at Pistoria, Italy. On August 9, 1944, Sergeant Davis sent his parents a poem he had written which, like an unpolished folk ballad, told simply the story of the battle for “Hill 79.” I'd like to tell you my experience on line The night that we took hill seventy-nine. May the eleventh at eleven P. M. Was the time set for the attack to begin. This hill was part of the Gustav line. The English had broke it but fell back each time. Now it was time for the Yanks to try, And each man was ready and willing to die. At eleven o'clock we laid a barrage That will go down in history— None ever so large. Facing machine gun and artillery bursts. Through Trimonsuoli we had to move fast, For it has the name of Purple Heart Pass. To get in position our chances looked slim, For most of them Jerry had all zeroed in. On the side of the hill we had to dig in With mortar shells singing a hell song of sin. Seventy-two hours on that hill we stayed, And many a brave man went to his grave. Each man prayed out loud and looked toward the sky, But the shells kept on coming—brave men had to die. We accomplished our mission and broke that strong line, And Jerry pulled out, leaving wounded behind. After they started running, it wasn't so bad; The 339th gave them all that we had. We knew our objective, it was to take Rome, And we knew that each step was nearer home. We marched through Rome on June the fifth, Dirty and sore, tired and stiff. The only regret we had on our mind Was our buddies we left back on hill seventy-nine.38 XIV Assaulting Fortress Europe While the United States was gathering men, supplies, and boats in England for the attack on Normandy in June of 1944, the Army Air Forces waged from England a continuous and aggressive warfare, which slowly but surely crippled Germany. Between August 17, 1942, when the Eighth Air Force made its first heavy bomber attack, and V-E Day more than 1,550,000 tons of bombs were dropped on western European targets. Stationed in Great Britain, American airmen learned to know and admire the people. From “a pretty spot in England,” Major Wilmer H. Paine of Charlottesville, who was flight surgeon for a group of thirty-six B-24's, wrote to his wife in September, 1942, praising the British. “My hat goes off to them. In spite of the war they continue to live their daily lives as though the Germans were 5,000 miles away. They say little or nothing about the war. ... Except for searchlights and anti-aircraft guns and distant sound of motors at night I wouldn't believe that we were here to fight a war.” As a means of keeping physically fit, Major Paine spent an afternoon working with a threshing crew, harvesting the barley. “All England is either a grain field at the height of its greatest harvest or a lovely green pasture filled with fat cattle,” he wrote. “I've flown over quite a slice of it and I've never seen so much grain, sugar beets, cabbage, Irish potatoes, and beef cattle in my life.”1 “You will notice a clipping of the Liberator raid on St. Nazaire,” he wrote Mrs. Paine in December. “Your spouse was on that raid with the boys. It was great fun, but not as exciting as I had expected. I have been on two raids with the boys and I tell you this, not to cause you any alarm, but merely to give you my word that I will not be going on any more unless it is strictly my duty to do so. I felt, however, that it was my duty to go on a couple to prove to myself and the men who depend on me that I had the guts to go. It is easy for someone to tell a man he hasn't the guts to fly into enemy territory and face the fighters and the flak (anti-aircraft shells) when he is seated safely behind a desk two hundred miles away. “On the other hand, one wonders if he isn't a little cracked to go barging off on a bombing mission across France with a good chance of getting a few hunks of steel through his lungs when he doesn't have to. Oh well, it was a wonderful experience and I wouldn't take something pretty for it. When you are flying four miles high you make rather difficult duck shooting even for those crack Hun gunmen. In addition to the altitude we were squirming like a worm and going over 200 miles an hour. After we opened the bomb bay doors and dropped six tons of exploding eggs we did a little job called getting the hell out of there. This involved peeling off toward the sea and going down to the top of the waves quicker than it takes to tell it.”2 Daily bombers went out to attack German installations. Staff Sergeant Mason E. Houchens of Charlottesville, who was qualified both as a radio operator and rear gunner of a B-17 Flying Fortress, was shot down over Europe on June 13, 1943. On July 28 his family was informed that he was a prisoner of war. For nearly two years he was in a German prison camp until he was liberated in the spring of 1945.3 On the return of the Flying Fortress, “Standby,” from its target in occupied France, the bombardier, Lieutenant James Elmer Harlow, one of the three flying Harlows of Charlottesville, was really mad. A German 20-millimeter cannon shell had obliterated the name “Dorothy” which he had painted on the nose. Slowly he explained, “I don't like being crossed up. I meant my wife's name to remain on the ship. When that fighter got Dorothy's name, naturally I got him.” Harlow took part on October 14, 1943, in the famous raid on the Schweinfurt ball bearing manufacturing plant, a foray from which sixty American bombers did not return. His roughest mission, however, was one to Kassel, Germany, during which his plane had one engine and all but four guns knocked out. Once he successfully bombed a German destroyer from 17,000 feet over the North Sea without a bombsight. On another occasion, returning from Stuttgart, his plane ran out of gasoline and was forced to ditch in the English Channel. Harlow was picked up by two Englishmen in a rowboat after being in the water an hour, clinging to a partially inflated rubber dinghy.4 The American Red Cross played an important part in the life of a soldier in Europe. “The Red Cross really helps a guy over here,” wrote Corporal Warren T. Birckhead of Charlottesville after a visit to London. “We got a bed (with two clean sheets) for a shilling and sixpence (30¢) a night and our meals only cost one shilling (20¢) each. If it wasn't for them we wouldn't be able to spend a single night away from camp.”5 Katherine Lea Marshall of Charlottesville, who landed in England in late November, 1943, was a member of a crew of three Red Cross workers who operated a clubmobile. They travelled from camp to camp dispensing doughnuts and coffee. After the soldiers were filled the girls promoted games and other recreation.6 The Red Cross also ministered to the needs of those soldiers who became prisoners of war. “The Red Cross was our salvation— I can't say enough for them,” Sergeant Harvey Hamilton Fleming declared. The sergeant had been forced to bail out of his B-17 over Brunswick, Germany, on February 10, 1944. At first he was imprisoned at Stalag Luft 6, in East Prussia, but later was held at Stalag Luft 4 in Pomerania after the Russians advanced to Memel. Fleming charged that the Germans had been “eating Red Cross boxes for years” but added that the Red Cross “sent such a volume of supplies that some just had to get through.” At first American prisoners got a box a week, but later when transportation broke down they got only a half a box a week. When the Russians overran eastern Germany in 1945, Fleming and other prisoners were marched westward. They found many German civilians were moving in the direction of the American front to get away from the Russians. A German woman, whose husband was receiving good treatment as a prisoner of war in Arizona, told Fleming, “I will greet the Americans with arms of flowers.” Hearing that the Russians were near, Fleming escaped and hid until they arrived. He then accompanied the Russian soldiers, and was present at the historic meeting of the Russians and the Americans April 27, 1945, on the Elbe River near Torgau. Fleming described the meeting as highly hilarious. “Everybody was drunk, running around, firing into the air.”7 For every plane which winged its way over occupied Europe there was a ground crew which kept the plane fit to fly. A crew chief of a B-26 Marauder, Technical Sergeant Lewis Mahanes of Cismont, won a Bronze Star, which was awarded in recognition of his “technical proficiency and tireless energy” in the performance of his vital but not glamorous duty. Wrote a friend of Mahanes, “Lewis” ship has been in the newspapers a time or two, and his pilot thinks he is the best crew chief in the group. He is probably the best mechanic in the whole group, and has done a splendid job working long hours. Even working on his day off when he thought it necessary.”8 Over the great enemy airfield at St. Omer, France, First Lieutenant C. Forman Dirickson, the pilot of a B-26 Marauder, had a rough time. “The flak that day,” he recalled, “was by far the worst I have ever seen.” It burst all around the bomber, fragments pounded against the fuselage like hail, and the smell of cordite filled the air. A shell burst immediately above the pilot's compartment, filling the area with flying glass. Then a piece of flak struck Dirickson's helmet, knocking him out momentarily. The co-pilot pushed him away from the controls and took over. As Dirickson recovered consciousness, his one thought was to gain control of the plane. For several confused seconds he fought with the co-pilot before his mind cleared. One of the two engines had been damaged and after spitting and sputtering a few minutes died. Nevertheless the plane limped back to Britain on the single engine.9 Lieutenant Colonel George L. Wertenbaker, Jr., of Charlottesville, a deputy-commander of a P-47 Fighter Group with the Ninth Air Force in England, made twenty-two bomber escort missions in his Thunderbolt, “Betty L.” He was a pre-Pearl Harbor airman, his determination to fly having been reached while he was still a boy. He first soloed on January 1, 1935, and in August, 1939, he won his wings and commission at Kelly Field.10 Lieutenant Colonel Beirne Lay, Jr., whose parents live in Charlottesville, was a four-engine bomber pilot who commanded the 487th Bomb Group of the Eighth Air Force in England and took part in a number of missions over Germany. On May 11, 1944, he had to abandon his mortally wounded B-24 over German-occupied France. “It was a month before D-day,” he recalled. “My time had come. I pressed the microphone button on the wheel. The words stalled for a moment, where the throat mike resting snug against my Adam's apple would carry the message over the interphone to the ten other members of the crew. “'Abandon ship,' I called. But the interphone was dead. I turned to the navigator, who was standing between the pilot's seat and mine. He had come up a few minutes before to tell me that a hunk of flak had broken the bombardier's thigh bone. “'Bail out,' I said to him. 'Pass the word to the rest of the crew.' “It was what he'd been waiting to hear. Lieutenant Frank Vratny, the pilot, pressed the alarm button—a long ring and a series of short rings. In a matter of seconds, escape-hatch doors were sailing out into the slip stream behind us and bodies were dropping out of the mortally wounded Liberator. From the copilot's seat, where I had been sitting as leader of the wing of seventy-two Liberators with which we had taken off from England, I watched Vratny struggle with the wheel, rudder pedals and throttles to maintain level flight until the boys were out. He had his hands full of airplane. ... “I shed my flak vest, reached behind my seat for my chest chute and buckled it on. Vratny watched me apprehensively out of the corner of his eye. I think he must have wondered whether I'd forgotten that the commander is the last man out. I turned to him and give him a jerk of my thumb, then grabbed the wheel and throttles. He reached for his chute pack and was out of the cockpit like a shot. Then for a few seconds the B-24 flew fairly straight and level above enemy-occupied France. “Maybe the co-pilot is still back in the tail turret, I thought. I'll stay with it until she goes out of control. There's plenty of altitude. I can bail out of the bomb bay in four seconds. A half minute passed. Abruptly the nose came up in a climb. We stood on a wing tip. I found myself looking sideways through the window at the neat French fields barely visible through the noon haze. “The plane's nose came down with a whoosh. There was no response from the elevator controls. I pulled back the remaining two good throttles. It was time to leave. “I grabbed the emergency bomb bay door and bomb-salvo release handle, installed in the floor. It came up a few inches and jammed. Looking back, I saw that the bomb bay doors were still closed. I was out of the seat now, with both feet planted on the floor and with both hands on the emergency release, but I couldn't budge it farther. Flak had shot up the system. The B-24 was already in a steep spiraling dive and the wind was tearing past the top-turret dome in a rising scream. “The only means of quick exit was gone. You can't get out the windows of a B-24. In a flash, the terrible tension in me dissolved, giving way to a feeling of helplessness. This was too much. The sand had run out. “By the time I got back to the bomb bay and turned to crawl forward underneath the floor of the cockpit toward the nose hatch, the B-24 seemed to be heading straight down. It felt like crawling from the ceiling to the floor of an elevator that is falling faster than you can drop. I struggled forward through my gloomy tunnel toward the nose wheel, but in the cramped space I didn't seem to be making very good time toward that beckoning gap of light up ahead where the nose hatch was. The hum of the slip stream over the ship's metal skin indicated a hell of a dive, and I judged we were making close to 400 miles an hour. As I squeezed past the nose wheel, my parachute harness caught. I fought clumsily to free myself, fearful of releasing the rip cord, and all hope went out of me. I was trapped. It seemed as though I had been crawling for five minutes and that we should have hit the ground long ago. I would never get to that patch of light in time now. “I broke free, but a further sense of relief had already come. It was out of my hands now. The next fraction of a second would bring instant oblivion without my even feeling it—final release from panic and fear and striving. Clearly I saw the white board front and green shutters of my house in Washington, and my wife's face. I'm sorry, Luddy. “Panting hard, I wormed closer to the daylight showing through the hatch. And then a giant suction whisked me through the opening like a cigarette out the window slit of a speeding car, and I yanked the rip cord hard as I went. The ground looked as close as the floor to a man rolling off a bed. The chute opened with a jerk that brought the chest buckle up against my chin like a left hook. Abruptly I was anchored in the air and I saw that I had a 1000-foot margin. ...”11 For almost three months Lieutenant Colonel Lay and the co-pilot lived in occupied France, hidden and helped by the French at the risk of their lives. Meanwhile the Americans landed in Normandy. At last General Patton's troops fought their way into the area, and Lieutenant Colonel Lay was able to begin his journey home.12 The story of his adventures, “Down in Flames, Out By Underground,” which he wrote for The Saturday Evening Post, is one of the most interesting narratives to come out of the war. After a year and a half of training in the United States, Company K, 116th Infantry (the Monticello Guard) sailed from New York, September 26, 1942, on the Queen Mary. There had been many changes in personnel since the company left Charlottesville, but it still enrolled many of its original members. John P. Davis of Charlottesville, who had left to go to O.C.S., had been succeeded as first sergeant by Clay S. Purvis of Charlottesville, and Captain John A. Martin of Charlottesville had been succeeded as company commander by Captain Asbury H. Jackson of Winchester, Virginia. As the Queen Mary neared the coast of Ireland on October 2, she was picked up by the British light cruiser, Curaçoa, which began to act most strangely, appearing to put on a show for the American soldiers. Actually she was engaged in a skirmish with a submarine. Finally the Curaçoa crossed the Queen Mary's path. There was a crash as the giant liner sheared the Curaçoa in two, amidships. The Queen Mary continued on her way but that afternoon slowed down to repair her damaged bow. The next day she docked safely at Greenock, Scotland.13 Company K was stationed at Tidworth Barracks in southern England for the next ten months. Shortly before Christmas First Sergeant Purvis wrote of life there: “Every once in a while a German plane takes a shot at one or another town right close by and we grab our rifles and take off. The R.A.F. and our boys are doing a fine job. I think Hitler's gang is slowly losing out all around. ... We are all well and getting along fine, and there is nothing to worry about. The men are getting trips to London once in a while. We have gotten used to the weather, money, and ways of the British in general.”14 The regulation ten-minute halt in an all-day training march through drenching winter rain and intermittent drizzle found Company K near an ivy-covered brick wall enclosing an English country churchyard. Thomas R. Henry, Staff Correspondent for the Washington Star, described the scene: “These men were gathered in the mossy gateway of a lovely manor house to which the church at one time had been an adjunct. The house was set in a lovely park of oaks and yews. It reminded them a lot, they said, of some of the fine country places around Charlottesville. They adjusted themselves to the atmosphere of the British countryside more easily than most American troops because of this similarity. “'It came pretty easy to me,' remarked Corporal H. L. Baptist of Ivy, Virginia, a former University of Virginia student, 'because, you see, Ivy is a typical British settlement. There must be 50 English families around there, some of whom have kept up the ways of life of the old country, and I was brought up among them.' “With Corporal Baptist was Sergeant William T. Chewning, who used to be a member of the university football squad. The whole group, in fact, is imbued with the football tradition of Charlottesville. They have just walked away with the championship of the regiment to which they are attached. ... “Since they have been here they have taken up English football and, Sergeant Chewning said, they have found it a tougher game than the American brand. “ 'I had thought it was tame,' he added, 'but there's a lot more chance to get your neck broken. At home, you see, you run with the ball, or kick it, or pass it, but you don't try to do all three things at once and a fellow is tackled only when he is running. Here the idea is to get the ball ahead any way and everybody can pile on you once you are down.' ”15 In May of 1943 Sergeant Purvis wrote requesting some cigarettes. “We can't buy American cigarettes here, and these aren't worth smoking.”16 Lady Astor, the former Nancy Langhorne of “Mirador,” Albemarle County, took an active interest in the 116th Infantry from her native state. Sickness in her family caused a delay in her plans to do something for “those dear Virginia boys,” but in time she was entertaining her Virginia cousins. There was a pre-Fourth of July reception and dance on Saturday as the Fourth fell on Sunday in 1943. The following December Lady Astor attended a special performance of the 29th Division's musical show “Get Crackin'.” Major General Leonard T. Gerow of Petersburg, Virginia, the division commander, introduced Lady Astor to the audience, remarking that she had a special talent for telling Cornish dialect stories and that she had often expressed a desire to obtain some real Virginia ham. “Lady Astor,” said the general, “I once made a wager. If you will tell three stories for my outfit here tonight, you can have your pig.” Thereupon a squirming, be-ribboned porker was dragged to the platform. Never to be outdone, Lady Astor gamely marched to the microphone and in her inimitable manner won the pig. A general favorite with the division, Lady Astor at first was made an honorary private first class but later received a “battlefield promotion” to second lieutenant.17 By July, 1943, Company K was attracting the attention of the “brass.” For the past fifteen months the company had had no men AWOL and no cases of venereal disease. The Medical Corps in the European Theatre of Operations, which was working hard to keep down the rise of venereal cases, wanted to know how Company K was able to make such an outstanding record. It was universally concluded that the company had men of higher caliber than the average unit. In the history of the company, with its highly selective peacetime recruiting policy and its strong esprit de corps built up over a long period, were to be found the reasons for the high standards of conduct.18 Recognized as an outstanding unit, Company K was ordered to Liverpool for two months of guard duty. While it was there the 116th Infantry moved. When the Company rejoined the regiment, it was stationed at Crown Hill Barracks near Plymouth. While there the men spent long hours in rigorous amphibious training preparing for the coming invasion. During the maneuvers in the Channel they often saw the mysterious shores of France which awaited the day of liberation. Many of the men also went to Scotland for extensive ranger training. As the second winter in England passed and the days lengthened, everyone became increasingly anxious to begin the real fighting. After two years of planning and preparation, the invasion of France was launched on June 6, 1944. For the landing two strips of the Normandy coast on either side of the Vire Estuary were selected. The beach to the northwest was designated Utah Beach and that to the east Omaha Beach. On the latter the 29th Division landed. On its left to the east was the First Division. Still farther to the east the British forces landed. In his book Invasion!, Charles Christian Wertenbaker of Charlottesville, a newspaper correspondent who accompanied the troops, told vividly the story of the landings and of the struggle for a firm beachhead. The transport USS Thomas Jefferson, which carried the early waves of the 116th Infantry assault troops, was able to unload all its landing craft in sixty-six minutes. The craft left the rendezvous area at 4:30 A. M. and headed for the beach. A storm, which had occasioned a twenty-four hour delay in launching the invasion, made the sea very rough, and many men became seasick in the small craft.19 In a letter to his mother Captain Charles C. Cole of Charlottesville, commander of Battery B, 110th Field Artillery with the 29th Division, described the action on Omaha Beach. “I hit the beach D-Day and as long as I live I shall never forget the infantry that day or the days since. They are still the backbone of any army and deserve all the medals and praise that man can give them. We couldn't have done without the Air Corps and Navy shelling, but Jerry was dug in the cliffs in huge tunnels which the Air Corps and Navy couldn't and didn't dent. We didn't know this, though, until we hit the beach and then all hell broke loose. “Some of these tunnels ran for miles inland and even three or four days afterwards the beach was being sniped upon, and at the other end we were digging them out of houses and chateaus. They had lived in these tunnels for years and were well stocked with every human need. But the doughboys—and how your heart bleeds for them—kept going forward. “That first week was a little ticklish. As much of everything was trying to get ashore that could, and we in front were being shoved forward whether we wanted to or not—and I must say I didn't always want to. At one time there we came close to putting bayonets on our guns, so close were we to Jerry and with no infantry in front of us. “For three days we were doing two things—trying to fight and trying to collect everybody together again. Between trying to land on a place about as big as a bath tub and being shelled by the Jerry 88's, we were pretty well disorganized and separated. But gradually things have settled down, so that now we are using some of the stuff we have been taught all these past months.”20 A veteran of the Mediterranean campaigns, Major William R. Washington of Crozet landed with the First Division on Omaha Beach. Out of thirty-eight officers and enlisted men in an assault boat, he was one of twelve who lived to reach the beach. When intense enemy fire pinned down the leading waves of the 16th Infantry, Major Washington fearlessly exposed himself to the raking fire along the shore in order to get the halted men to move inland. Through barbed wire entanglements and uncharted mine fields, the men led by Major Washington scrambled up the heavily fortified cliffs and destroyed several enemy strong points. After the troops were established on the high ground, Major Washington, though badly wounded by sniper fire, moved forward to a vital crossroad near Colleville-sur-Mer and set up an observation post which he manned for twenty-four hours, giving valuable directions to the advancing troops. In recognition of Major Washington's incomparable fighting spirit and magnificent valor, the Distinguished Service Cross was awarded to him. While recovering from his wounds Major Washington remarked: “How I got through I'll never know unless it was by the grace of God and the fact that my wife was praying for me.”21 Company K, 116th Infantry, landed shortly after 7:00 A. M. on the beach to the east of les Moulins, which was about a mile east of where they were supposed to land. The craft of Company K came in well bunched on the right flank of the 3rd Battalion. Enemy small arms fire was light, and no losses were sustained in crossing the tidal flat to the shingle. Nevertheless the men tended to become immobilized as they reached cover, and reorganization was made difficult because a number of other units had also landed in the area. Once started, the men had trouble getting to the top of the cliffs. Sporadic machinegun fire hit a few men on the beach, and mines caused difficulty on the slope of the bluff. Guides had to be placed to mark routes of ascent. Company K lost fifteen or twenty men before the top was reached shortly after nine o'clock. The men then moved a couple of hundred yards inland before they were pinned down in open fields by scattered machinegun fire and some shelling. One boat team under the leadership of Technical Sergeant Carl D. Proffitt, Jr., of Charlottesville was able to push inland to Vierville-sur-Mer. After they were forced by the Germans to withdraw, Proffitt twice led the men back. That night they were used for headquarters security. During the night efforts were made to reorganize the company.22 On D?1 the 270th Port Company was landed at Omaha Beach. It began to bring order to the handling of supplies there, an absolutely essential function if the drive into Northern France was to succeed. The men of the company included Corporal Robert L. Wicks, Route 2, Charlottesville: Private First Class Thomas D. Gardner, Cobham: Private First Class John N. Zellars, Crozet: and Private First Class John B. White, Esmont.23 Company K of the 116th Infantry spent this day mopping up remnants of enemy resistance along the bluffs and then joined in the perimeter defense of Vierville that night. At Pointe du Hoe, to the west of Omaha Beach, a force of Rangers who had landed D-Day were isolated. Early on June 8 the 3rd Battalion of the 116th Infantry joined other units moving along the coast road to Pointe du Hoe. Company K took part in the “How I got through I'll never know.” Billy Washington of Crozet receives the DSC attack which relieved the Rangers and cleared the enemy from the area by noon. The Americans then pressed on to Grandcamp-les-Bains, a beach resort town, a little over two miles farther west. After the 5th Ranger Battalion had attacked and failed to take the town, the 3rd Battalion of the 116th Infantry moved into position late in the afternoon. Tanks led the way across a bridge over a flooded area just east of the town, and then Companies K and L crossed and attacked abreast on either side of the highway. Company K on the north side found the enemy strongly entrenched on a rise. Repeated assaults were turned back by machinegun and rifle fire. The company commander, Captain William Geoff Pingley, Jr., of Winchester, Virginia, was killed as he moved forward. An officer who was nearby tells how, after two hours of fighting. Technical Sergeant Frank Dabnev Peregory of Charlottesville took the situation in hand and won a Medal of Honor. “Realizing that it was necessary to go in after the Germans, [he] crawled into the withering fire that covered the hillside and worked his way to the crest. He carried only his rifle and bayonet and some hand grenades. Near the crest he discovered a trench that led toward the main fortification and dropped into it. He found himself among a squad of enemy riflemen and immediately engaged them. ... He killed eight of these and captured three others and then, with his prisoners, advanced on the main position along the shelter of the trench. This was a deeply entrenched machinegun position and using the hand grenades he destroyed the position and forced the surrender of 32 other German riflemen.”24 During this action which broke the German resistance First Sergeant Purvis exposed himself in order to bring fire upon the enemy emplacement, and at the risk of his life he materially aided the advance. The Silver Star was awarded to him for his heroic action.25 Grandcamp was occupied before dark, but Company K withdrew to spend the night in a field to the south of town. The next few days were spent in mopping up the area. The company then moved south across the Arne River and became a part of the 29th Division reserve. Here the men relaxed briefly. On June 12 Staff Sergeant Jacob Lee Lively of Charlottesville wrote to his wife, “I guess by now you already know that I am somewhere in France. They had a nice reception waiting for us, but we in turn had a nice one all cooked up for them. We hit them a blow that was heard all the way across the Channel. ... “I guess Mom is pretty well shocked but tell her not to worry— I will keep my head down and go like h - - -. We can't lose; we have too much stuff for them and are all Americans. Being Americans means a lot. We are superior and will definitely prove it all the way to the Heinie. How long we will last is undetermined, but I personally think we will come out O. K. I have put an extra emphasis on my prayers.” Published in The Daily Progress on June 24, this letter was the first word of the Monticello Guard to reach Charlottesville from France. On June 12 Sergeant Peregory also wrote a V-mail letter to his wife, modestly remarking “news is scarce.” The next day Company K advanced to the south, crossed the Elle River, and pushed on to the village of Couvains. The following day the company was ordered to take a patch of woods on high ground to the south of the town. Three determined attacks were made, but each was repulsed with heavy losses. The division took the high ground three miles north of St. Lô on June 17. While leading his platoon through a gate during the second attack on June 14 Peregory was killed. Wrote Technical Sergeant Ellwyn C. Walsh of Charlottesville, who was wounded in the cheek that day, “They finally got Frank today but he didn't miss a one of the Jerries until they did get him.”26 Peregory was born in Albemarle County, April 10, 1915. His parents, Mr. and Mrs. James Ervin Peregory of Esmont, died when he was still a boy. After attending school at Esmont, Peregory came to Charlottesville where he worked from the time he was twelve years old. For four years prior to entering the service, he was employed by the Barnes Lumber Company. He first enlisted in the Monticello Guard on July 5, 1931, when only sixteen years old. As a private first class he was mustered into Federal service on February 3, 1941. When the Guard visited Charlottesville five months later to take part in the Fourth of July parade and celebration. Peregory remained for the weekend, and on Saturday, July 5, he married Bessie Geneva Kirby. Shortly after Pearl Harbor while Company K was engaged for two months in patrolling the coast around New Bern, North Carolina, Peregory became the first hero of the 29th Division. Early Sunday morning, January 11, 1942, a weapons carrier in which a patrol of Company K was riding skidded on the icy road and plunged into a canal near Hobucken, North Carolina. Most of the men extricated themselves from the submerged vehicle, but when Corporal Massie N. Tomlin of Charlottesville called the roll, it was discovered that Private Stanley P. Major was missing. Peregory, realizing that Major was still in the truck, immediately dived into the icy water to rescue him. Descending through a hole which had been cut in the tarpaulin top of the truck, Peregory located the unconscious soldier and thrust his body up through the opening where Tomlin and others could grasp the apparently lifeless form. While awaiting assistance for which Corporal Earl F. Wilkerson of Charlottesville had been dispatched, Privates John Chris Kardos Frank Peregory of the Monticello Guard “didn't miss a one of the Jerries.” of Charlottesville and Willard C. Dyer worked diligently for half an hour to restore Major to consciousness. It was some hours later, however, after the group had returned to camp that Major was revived. For his heroic and unselfish deed Peregory was awarded the Soldier's Medal, and various other members of the patrol were commended. The Soldier's Medal, America's highest award for non-combat gallantry, was presented to Peregory (then a corporal) by Major General Leonard T. Gerow at the A. P. Hill Military Reservation on June 17, 1942. Members of the 116th Regimental Combat Team, commanded by Colonel E. Walton Opie, marched by the reviewing stand where General Gerow and Corporal Peregory received the salute of the troops as they passed. After the parade the modest hero quietly slipped away and later was to be found doing his routine duties.27 Peregory of course never knew that he had won the Medal of Honor, for he had been killed only six days after his singlehanded exploit at Grandcamp in Normandy, long before the award could be made. A posthumous presentation of the medal was made to his wife, on June 4, 1945, at the Charlottesville City Armory, where Peregory had drilled with the National Guard. Present besides close friends and relatives were Mayor Roscoe S. Adams, the local units of the Virginia State Guard, and some returned members of the Monticello Guard. In presenting the medal Brigadier General E. R. Warner McCabe of Charlottesville, commandant of the School of Military Government at the University of Virginia, assured the hero's widow, “You will have the comfort and consolation and satisfaction of knowing that your heroic husband's memory will live forever in the heart of his country and his valiant deeds will live in the hearts of his fellow citizens.” The citation for the Medal of Honor reads: On June 8, 1944, the 3rd Battalion of the 116th Infantry was advancing on the strongly held German defenses at Grandcamp, France, when the leading elements were suddenly halted by decimating machinegun fire from a firmly entrenched enemy force on the high ground overlooking the town. After numerous attempts to neutralize the enemy position by supporting artillery and tank fire had proved ineffective, Sergeant Peregory, on his own initiative, advanced up the hill under withering fire and worked his way to the crest where he discovered an entrenchment leading to the main fortification 200 yards away. Without hesitating he leaped into the trench and moved toward the emplacement. Encountering a squad of enemy riflemen, he fearlessly attacked them with hand grenades and bayonet, killed eight and forced three to surrender. Continuing along the trench, he single-handedly forced the surrender of thirty-two more riflemen, captured the machinegunners, and opened the way for the leading elements of the battalion to advance and secure its objective. The extraordinary gallantry and aggressiveness displayed by Sergeant Peregory are exemplary of the highest traditions of the Armed Forces.28 The members of Company K were learning the grim lessons of war at first hand. Wrote Staff Sergeant Clayborne W. Dudley of Charlottesville, “I guess you know by now that our outfit was one of the first to land in France on D-Day and as far as I know they are still in there fighting. I waited two years to get over there and then didn't stay but nine days. However, I learned more in those nine days than I did in the two years I was here in England. I never really knew what war was until after I was in there fighting, and believe me it's hell. ... Day and night the shells and bullets are hitting close to you and one can never tell just when you will get the next one. Some of the boys are glad when they are hit so they can get out of it for awhile. The piece that hit me felt as if it were as big as a house, and I had to look the second time to see if my arm was still on my body. Altogether, I got hit six times, but all of them are healed except the one on my wrist. I guess it won't be long before I'll be back over there so if my letters are few you'll understand.”29 In times of stress some soldiers found in religion a source of comfort and strength. Private Roy Daniel Carver of Crozet, a member of the Methodist Church, wrote his wife, “I was reading a chapter in my testament the other night, as I do each day that I get a chance, and a Spanish boy came up and asked me to read out loud to him. But, as you know, I do not like to read to anyone, so I called one of my buddies to come over and read to us out of my testament. Another boy passed and hearing what was going on, he stopped and joined us. It certainly made me feel good to know that I had helped someone out that wanted to hear the word of God during these trying times. None of the three boys has a testament so they now borrow mine to read. I carry mine with me at all times so that others, as well as I, may read from it.”30 During the early days of the invasion some soldiers came into contact with many second rate German troops who surrendered when the going got tough. “These d- - - Germans don't quite seem to be the supermen you read about,” wrote Private Peter G. Fekas of Charlottesville, with Company C. 12th Infantry. “When we make things a little too hot for them, they come out and surrender. All it takes to make them come out of their holes is a little machinegun fire and a little artillery.”31 Farther inland around St. Lô the Americans found the Germans fighting with dogged determination. By June 17 the 116th Infantry was within three miles of that city, but it required over a month of the most gruelling combat to break through the German defenses. On July 15 the regiment was attacking southwest along a ridge east of St. Lô, when the second battalion made an important advance and reached the edge of la Madeleine, a village only a mile from the city. Well in front of the rest of the 29th Division, the battalion was isolated. At 4:30 A. M. on July 17, the third battalion under Major Thomas D. Howie of Staunton, Virginia, attacked with the mission of re-enforcing the second battalion so that the two battalions could continue the attack on St. Lô. This was the first silent night attack the Americans had made since landing. Only two men in each platoon were authorized to fire even in emergency; the rest were to rely on bayonet and hand grenades. Above all else they were to get through. Technical Sergeant Marshall L. Tomlin of Charlottesville, a platoon leader of Company K, remarked, “If we'd tried this earlier, we'd never have got the men to hold their fire. It takes a lot of experience not to shoot back when you are shot at.” The attack moved fast. Sergeant Tomlin personally killed at least three Germans. “I bayoneted my first one,” he said, “just as he was coming out of his hole with his machine pistol in his hand. I was on top of a hedgerow and I was pretty scared, I guess, because I lunged at him so hard I could hardly get the bayonet out. It went in high up on his chest, hitting the heart. He let out a little noise and that was the end of it. “There was another fellow coming for me in the mist and I hit him with the butt and knocked him cold. Then I stuck him to make sure. They were beginning to wake up at this time and I threw a grenade at two machine gunners who were just setting up [their gun]. It knocked them both out.” He bayoneted his third man later.32 By 7:30 that morning the third battalion had reached its objective and reorganized. When asked by phone if the battalion would lead the advance on St. Lô, Major Howie replied, “Will do.” He then ordered Company K to spearhead the attack. Hardly had the company officers left, after receiving their orders, when German mortar fire hit the command post, killing Major Howie. Soon enemy artillery fire was covering the entire area, and the attack had to be abandoned. Late the next day a 29th Division task force fought its way into the city. With it went the body of Major Howie, which was placed on the rubble before the ruined cathedral. He had promised to meet his men in St. Lô, and they wanted to keep the rendezvous. After forty-five days of the most savage fighting the 29th Division was relieved. Those men who had served throughout the campaign were presented certificates by the Division Commander, Major General Charles H. Gerhardt, commending their service from D-Day to St. Lô. The 116th Infantry on September 6, 1944, was awarded a Presidential Citation “for extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance of duty in action in the initial assault on the northern coast of Normandy.” Its personnel thus became entitled to wear the Distinguished Unit Badge. Later the 29th Division was awarded the French Croix de Guerre. Decorations too numerous to catalogue were awarded to individuals. By July, 1945, after the fighting was over but before all awards had been made, the men of Company K, 116th Infantry, had already won one Medal of Honor, two Distinguished Service Crosses, forty-three Silver Stars, eighty-eight Bronze Stars, and 492 Purple Hearts, besides one Distinguished Conduct Medal (British) and one Croix de Guerre (French).33 On D?38, even before the fall of St. Lô, the first detachment of WACs arrived in France to do clerical work in the Forward Echelon, Communications Zone Headquarters. They carried shovels for digging foxholes but no guns. First down the gangplank of the cruiser was First Sergeant Nancy Elizabeth Carter of Charlottesville. While the French villagers cheered, the American GIs whistled a welcome to “the morale builders.” A few miles south of Cherbourg in an apple orchard just outside of Valongnes the girls set up housekeeping in the most approved GI manner. They dug ditches around the tents to carry off the water which gathered during eight straight days of rain. On the other hand, they also learned how to make one helmet full of water provide first a bath, then a shampoo, and finally clean clothes. They supplemented C and K rations with fresh apple sauce and even apple pie. There were also a few other feminine extras, such as flowers in canteen cups and teddy bears propped up on bunks. As first sergeant. Nancy Carter had the responsibility of preparing for the housing of additional WACs as they arrived. This was an arduous undertaking, but by working from dawn until dark in the long northern European summer days she got the job done in such a manner as to win a Bronze Star. With the liberation of Paris, Sergeant Carter and other WACs of her detachment packed their gear and on September 6, 1944, moved to the French capital with the Communications Zone Headquarters.34 The liberation of Paris was perhaps the most colorful campaign of the whole war. To the armies the city had great strategic value, but to the French people it was the sacred symbol of the whole nation. When the shackles of German occupation were broken, the French were carried away with a great delirium of joy. Captain Henry R. Macy of Charlottesville with the Office of Strategic Services was among the first Americans to enter the liberated city. In a jeep driven by Colonel Donald Q. Coster, Captain Macy and a young French lieutenant followed General Charles de Gaulle, when he paraded from the Arc de Triomphe to the Cathedral de Notre Dame on August 26, 1944. “I saw the President of the Provisional Government of the French Republic,” Macy wrote his wife, “that tall, gloomy, controversial character who has from the month of June, 1940, symbolized the French Resistance, the courage and the hope and the pride of Frenchmen all over the world. He had a very serious expression on his face and made odd little gestures with his hands which he did not raise above his waist—small encouraging movements to the crowd— very restrained. He got into his car and then a wild procession down the Rue de Rivoli. The Colonel shoved tanks and armored cars aside in his determination to get close to the “Grand Charlie.” Eventually we got into the square in front of the Hôtel de Ville where the General was to speak from a platform. Here the crowd was thicker than ever, and I noticed a jeep full of correspondents and photographers, writing and snapping madly away. ... We started across the Pont Notre Dame in the wake of de Gaulle, on our way to the Cathedral when the ominous sound of firing began. Of course. one has no way of knowing where they come from, or against whom they are directed. The crowd hit the pavement like lightning, and the colonel turned the jeep around and we tore back across the Place de L'Hôtel de Ville, careened around the corner into the Rue de Rivoli (I was convinced that we would run over a dozen people— but as an ambulance driver in 1940 I guess D. Q. C. has learned to maneuver) and down the street. He was calling out “Soyez tranquilles, ce n'est rien,” I was smoking a cigarette and making the V sign for lack of anything else to do and feeling rather foolish, and the French officer had his pistol out and I think was looking for a target. We must have presented a rather frantic appearance, driving like mad down the street with sounds of shots all around, apparently in desperate flight from danger, and calling on the people to be calm and that there was nothing. As we approached the Louvre where there is a wide space, I noticed that the people were lying on the streets, and plead with the colonel to turn off the street and get out of the car. So we swerved into a side street almost running down the crowd and stopped the car, got out and dashed into a building. By now there was shooting everywhere. Apparently it was rather heavy in the Place de la Concorde. (The Square of Peace!) People were still in the street, police and F. F. I. were firing at windows up and down and I must say it was the most exciting moment of my life. It went on for about an hour I should think, but it was now a week old for the Parisians, and they were unbelievably calm on the whole, although some were evidently terrified, and others were cursing the Germans, and apologized to us—were horrified that this should happen when the Americans had arrived. They seemed to think it involved a breach of hospitality on their part.”35 Meanwhile, back in England the German robot buzz bombs were taking a heavy toll. “One fell about 25 yards from a building that I was in,” wrote Corporal Melvin R. Bishop, Jr., of Charlottesville. “I really hit the floor fast, but plaster walls and glass and all kinds of furniture hit the floor first—and believe it or not I only got a few small scratches. I was lucky to get out alive. That's the closest I've been to one but I have had about ten within two blocks of me. I'm ruining all my uniforms hitting the ground.”36 Lieutenant James Cranwell of Ivy, who had been on more than thirty missions over Europe as navigator in his B-24 bomber, “Little Hutch,” remarked: “Those buzz bombs are bad. I went into London once, but I got out right away. It was too risky. I figured there was no sense in risking my life twice a day.”37 Somewhat later, Private First Class Charles T. Lupton of Charlottesville had a narrow escape in a London station. While he was buying a ticket to return to his company of combat engineers, a rocket bomb exploded nearby. The concussion was terrific. He was much impressed by what he saw during his two-day pass. “London at night was a new experience,” he remembered. “There were large crowds on the Square, but few autos were seen on the streets. The city is partially blacked out. No one seemed to mind the alert signals or the buzz-bombs. When the signals sounded, there was no scurrying for shelter.”38 While the Army pushed forward on the ground, the air force was also carrying the war to the Germans. Second Lieutenant Robert S. Gleason of Charlottesville downed his first enemy plane over Axis-held Europe. In the “Vicious Virgin,” one of a P-47 Thunderbolt Group providing protection for heavy bombers during a raid over Germany, he became involved in a fight with twenty-eight Jerry fighters, twenty-six of which were shot down. “I looked around and saw an ME-109 chasing two P-47s,” said the Charlottesville flier. “They crossed right in front of me. I opened fire at 450 yards and closed to 200, firing my .50 caliber wing guns all the way. Suddenly I felt my plane being hit and found myself in a violent turn to the right. When I had completed 180 degrees of my turn I looked back and saw the ME-109 that I had fired at exploding. I saw no parachute.” When Gleason added up the damage to his own plane, he found that one 20 mm. shell had shattered his canopy and sprinkled the cockpit with shrapnel. Another had landed in one of the wing ammunition boxes, exploding the last of the ammunition. A third had smashed his tail surface, and a fourth had damaged his right rudder. After landing he counted seventy-seven holes in the riddled plane.39 “I was shot down in flames over Holland during the big airborne operations you've been reading about,” Second Lieutenant Allen N. White, Jr., of Ivy, pilot of a B-24 Liberator bomber, told his parents. “Before I go any further, I'd better say that by some miracle I escaped without a scratch, not even so much as a bruise. In fact, only one member of the crew was injured—the radio operator got some minor burns on his face and hands, but nothing serious, thank God. ... “We decided to risk a crash landing rather than bail out, which later proved to be a smart idea, as we would have been landed right on top of a bunch of Jerries. “As it was, we put her down smoothly in a field of scrub not more than 200 yards from a Heinie heavy machinegun. The minute she stopped rolling we really got the hell out—but fast! Luckily there was a shallow ditch close by which we dove into headlong and crawled along in it on our bellies for about 50 yards. “We paused a while for breath and looked back to watch the Old Lady burn. God, what a fire! And were we thankful to be alive, even though our future was a little uncertain.” However, a British armored patrol soon dashed to the scene, he said. “They hauled us aboard their Bren gun carrier and plied us with beer and cognac, which revived us enough so that we could tell them our story coherently.” He added that the patrol was “Hunhunting,” but rushed the airmen back to brigade headquarters before continuing on their party. “So that's how the colonel had a few unexpected visitors for tea. I must say he rose to the occasion admirably. 'Bit of a hot show, wasn't it, chaps?', he greeted us. 'Well, nice to have you here—just in time for tea, too. Bloody punctual, you Yanks.' ”40 Lieutenant Joseph D. Moore of Charlottesville, also in the September airborne operations in Holland, wrote his parents. “I was in the first wave of parachutists to jump. Gee, you should have seen the show. There seemed to be millions of different colored chutes in the air at once. Too, the sky was covered with transports, fighters and bombers. Seemed as if the whole Air Corps turned out to give us a helping hand which we needed very much. “While crossing the English Channel, there appeared to be thousands of transports on the rear of the column I was riding in. I only saw one plane go down in all that mess. Each time the Jerries opened up on us with anti-aircraft fire, about four fighters would dive down to end their career. That was truly a greater air show than invasion day on France. I certainly hope they made some newsreels of it so all of us can see them after it's over.”41 After ninety-four gruelling days at the front, where he was twice wounded by shrapnel and finally knocked out for eight hours in a barrage on the Siegfried Line on September 8, Sergeant Frank Cullen Hartman of the 4th Infantry Division was evacuated to a hospital in England. Here, as he recuperated he was haunted by what he had seen of the barbarities inflicted by the enemy. “I've often wondered what the people back home feel about punishing the Germans after the war is over,” he wrote. “If they want to be lenient, I have something I'd sure like to tell them. I know they'd change their minds. ... “It was done by the SS troops, those fanatical Hitlerats that seem to think the only way to win a war is by cruelty. This scene took place in a little town in France near the Belgian border. We had stopped at one town near dark the Jerries had just vacated, and prepared to dig in for the night. Then word came the Jerries were in this other town about five miles away. “Well, we left to go to this town and drive the Heinies out. .... We were going to move up three miles and bivouac for the night, then early next morning we were going the rest of the way and attack the Jerries. In a few minutes it was dark and cloudy with no moon. The blackness could be cut with a knife it seemed. “As we marched along we could see a fire in the distance. As we drew closer and closer on the winding mountain road, the tenseness and nervousness of us all mounted in anticipation of the battle ahead. We all go through that before a battle, and it's something that can't be explained. “Anyway, instead of stopping for the night, we advanced right into the city. The whole eastern half of the town was in flames, set by the Germans. The first sight I saw as I entered into the city, besides the burning buildings, was an old man and woman, and a little girl of five or six who was bandaged from head to foot. The old man was crying, trying to run into the flaming building behind him (it was his home) while the old woman was trying to keep him out. The little girl had been slashed by the Jerries, and the Recon units who preceded us had bandaged the girl. The FFI had opposed the Germans, so they killed quite a few of them, ran their tanks through the streets before the people could leave their homes and shelled them. “Then they took all the old people and children between five and seven, and cut their throats. Some, they ripped their bellies open, stuffed gasoline soaked wadding in it, lit a match to it, and locked them in houses. Many persons were locked in and burned alive. They cut the throats of the dogs they found. “No, we never caught the Jerries, but the FFI made one pay.” Six months later from Germany Sergeant Hartman wrote: “A German woman came running over and put her hand on my arm, looked into my eyes pleadingly and said, 'Ve haf five little sheldren ofer here who are hungry. Haf you some chocalate for them?' Maybe God and Dick [a brother who had been killed in battle] will forgive me ... but I couldn't resist that look. I said nothing, stepped into my truck and got a can of lima beans and a large box of cocoa and gave them to her. She cried excitedly, 'Danke schoen,' that is 'thank you' in German ... I can't help it, I can't be hard even as much as I hate them.”42 The advance into Germany received a sharp setback in December, 1944, when Hitler lashed out with the Ardennes counteroffensive. The Battle of the Bulge delayed the Allied advance about six weeks, during which time some of the bitterest fighting of the war took place. The Americans were, however, only checked, not stalled. During the defense of Bastogne, Belgium, Private First Class Elton L. Knight of Charlottesville served with the 502nd Parachute Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division. Armed only with a light machinegun, he silenced a German strong point in a single-handed assault. His company had been assigned the mission of securing a high ground and establishing defensive positions. As soon as the company crossed its line of departure it was pinned down by automatic weapons fire and heavy concentrations of enemy artillery. In disregard of the fire Knight, operating his machinegun from his hip, rushed upon the well-entrenched enemy, who were armed with two machineguns and five machine pistols, and captured the area. His daring won for him the Silver Star.43 On January 6, 1945, Private First Class Herbert C. Bethel of Charlottesville went on a night raid across the swift, icy Roer River into well-defended German territory on the east bank. His platoon had instructions to capture a prisoner for interrogation. “Before the entire platoon had crossed the Roer, their presence was discovered and a hail of small arms and machinegun fire raked their area. Not a man faltered. Despite the ease of escape which was still available and despite the knowledge of the obstacles which lay in wait, the platoon plowed through the withering fire. With a spirit of defiance, each man plunged through the water and a successful river crossing was effected. That platoon continued to work its way through the difficult marshy terrain. The intense enemy small arms and automatic fire was now augmented by a profuse number of well-aimed hand grenades. Undaunted, the platoon continued forward under perfect control until it encountered the enemy protective wire. Like a well-rehearsed play, each man sprang to his feet to execute his assigned task. The wire was immediately blown with bangalore torpedoes, and with calm but decisive manner the men rushed through the gap to their prearranged positions. Twenty-two minutes after H-Hour, a prisoner was captured and the platoon proceeded back in quick, orderly manner. Despite continuous enemy fire, the entire patrol returned with its captive and with but one man wounded.”44 Shortly before the Germans surrendered, Second Lieutenant James A. Hageman of Charlottesville with the Eighth Air Force delivered food by parachute to starving Dutch people. Relating his experiences on one of several such flights, Lieutenant Hageman said: “We made our coast in point, exactly on the money, and shortly after that we turned left at the initial point on our bomb run, flying from there to our target near Rotterdam at an unusually slow speed. Our entrance was made into the then still occupied Dutch territory under a truce agreement, but none of us expected the Germans to hold their fire. ... “We were in the lead element of the lead squadron of the lead group of the first wing: in other words, we were there first. From my front seat I could get a good look at the reactions of the people, and from 500 feet I could see, at least I thought I did, the famed wooden shoes upon the feet of those who came out to greet us. “And they were there all right. At first the people just looked at us curiously, wondering what we were up to, since the operation was unknown to those not in the actual dropping area. It wasn't long before they were waving at us with flags and everything handy—caps, scarfs, handkerchiefs, towels, anything at all. They came out in pairs, in bunches, in mobs, but they were there and they were happy. By this time, though, we were quite jittery. Would the Jerries shoot, or wouldn't they? Could we trust them? Why should we? Well, maybe they wouldn't. Maybe, pray, brother, pray. ... “They didn't shoot a round at us. We flew in, found the target, inspected the area to see if the authorities had cleared away the people, radioed our okay to the trailing squadron, and made a big circle to the right to get behind the bomber stream. The general and the colonel and us wanted to see the results. So we took a 45-minute tour of Holland to kill time. Everywhere we looked we could see people waving at us, looking up at us as we sailed past, paying their respects to us and waving a salute to what we were doing. There they were, starved, beaten, conquered slaves, looking up to us for help. They were dying by the thousands every day, but they were happy this day.”45 “This day has been a day of awakening to horror and the absolute depth of baseness of the Nazi mind,” wrote Technical Sergeant Henry J. Euler, Jr., of Red Hill after visiting a Nazi slave labor camp on April 13, 1945, where he witnessed the work of exhuming hastily interred bodies of an estimated six thousand people. “I have seen scenes that you, I and millions like us have seen portrayed on the screens of our theatres,” he continued. “Over here we cannot shrug it off and forget it in the quiet atmosphere of our after-theatre beer joints or soda parlors. The stink of death is still in my nostrils. ... “When we arrived,” Sergeant Euler wrote, “we saw civilians with litters of wood and baskets carrying things out of a ruined building. These somethings turned out to be bodies and pieces of bodies. Some were misshapen blobs of charred flesh. ... Others were so emaciated and wasted that they were bones held together by bluish skin. Bruises were plentiful. Each a grim tale of perverted minds and hideous agony. Each a blot against the name of Germany. “The people know it. As they pulled the rotting corpses from the holes and buried the dead these people could not look an American in the face. I wonder if the civilians knew the extent of the slaughter that took place. ... Whether they did or not, I hold them equally responsible.”46 But gruesome scenes were not necessary to remind people of the miseries occasioned by Nazi conquests. From Germany Staff Sergeant Raymond Lang of Charlottesville wrote to his wife: “You should see the view from my window. The country stretches for miles across a valley with a few scattered hills in the distance, and is dotted with apple and cherry trees in full bloom. While working we could glance out of the windows and see wagon loads of civilians returning to their homes. I guess by now they realize the misery their own conquest caused other people.”47 On May 7, 1945, the thoroughly beaten German nation surrendered, but the suffering occasioned by the holocaust continued. XV Island-Hopping Across the Pacific Because of their imperialistic dreams and the imperative needs of their then embarrased Axis partner Germany, the Japanese struck at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The devastation wrought there included ten ships sunk, six damaged, most of the Army and Navy planes destroyed, 2,117 men killed, 1,272 wounded, and 960 missing. Among those killed were Staff Sergeant James Merritt Barksdale of Crozet, Corporal Emmett Edlee Morris of Charlottesville, and Chief Petty Officer Alwyn Berry Norvelle of Covesville. Barksdale, who had served in the Army Air Corps since 1936, lost his life when Wheeler Field was bombed. Morris, who had been in the Army six years, died at Hickam Field. Norvelle, who had been in the Navy thirteen years, was attached to the USS Nevada.1 After the last wave of bombers from the Land of the Rising Sun flew over Pearl Harbor, American Army and Navy officers dispatched fliers to seek out the enemy carriers and attack them. Among those fliers was Phillip Hansen, son of the sculptor Oskar Hansen of “Pantops.” Hansen discovered units of the Japanese fleet, though no mention was ever made of it in the communiques. The planes flew low and dropped their bombs, but Japanese antiaircraft knocked out one of Hansen's motors and the plane crashed. Together with four of the crew Hansen managed to climb aboard one of the damaged wings which, thanks to an empty fuel tank, sustained their weight. For nine interminable days they floated in the water until a Navy patrol plane picked them up and took them to Pago Pago. They arrived there during a Japanese attack but landed safely in spite of the fact that their plane was hit. When it was found impossible to make necessary repairs at the place where the plane landed, her crew taxied on the surface of the ocean to another port. Hansen's father, who had seen service with the French Foreign Legion as well as action in World War I, observed, “That is really living life. That is the way I have lived and now the boy is surpassing his dad.”2 Ensign E. H. Parrot. a former Charlottesville boy, was aboard a torpedo boat at Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked. Then a Machinist's Mate, his first assignment in the war was to pursue a two-man submarine which had stolen into the harbor.3 In salvage operations at Pearl Harbor Gunner's Mate Third Class Richard L. Haley of Charlottesville made numerous dives inside and alongside damaged and submerged vessels under difficult and hazardous conditions. For his courage and skill he was commended by Rear Admiral William R. Furlong.4 On the other side of the Pacific the Japanese attacked the Philippines, where General Douglas MacArthur's small force was from the beginning doomed to fight a losing battle. Prior to the war Commander Joseph L. Yon of the Naval Medical Corps had been stationed at the Naval Hospital at Cavite. His wife, a daughter of Dr. W. Dan Haden of Charlottesville, and his children were evacuated from the Philippines in 1940. When war broke out Commander Yon, then a lieutenant, was attached to the tanker Pecos. She was bombed continuously as she left burning Manila and headed for Java. In Java, already under attack from the Japanese, Lieutenant Yon assisted the famous Dr. Corydon M. Wassell in caring for injured from the cruisers USS Marblehead and USS Houston. Some of these injured were evacuated from the besieged island and taken aboard the Pecos, which again set out to sea. It was not long before the survivors of the old USS Langley were sighted and taken aboard. Some miles south of Java these ill-fated men again met with disaster. The Pecos was torpedoed and sunk. Those who were able kept afloat for eight hours until the arrival of a destroyer gave them new hope. Trailed by enemy submarines, she was unable to stop to pick up the survivors, but landing nets were hung from her sides and the men of the Pecos were told to grasp the nets and try to save themselves as best they could. Only a few succeeded in taking advantage of this difficult means of escape. Lieutenant Yon was fortunate enough to be one of them. There was no doctor aboard the destroyer, so Lieutenant Yon assumed entire responsibility of caring for the wounded. With untiring perseverence he ministered to them until the destroyer reached Australia.5 When MacArthur departed from the Philippines, Major General Jonathan M. Wainwright assumed command. Then came the last desperate defense of Corregidor, which withstood the combined fire from land, sea, and air until May 6, 1942. With the final surrender large numbers of Americans became prisoners of the Japanese, among them Lieutenant Arthur L. Derby, Jr., of Eastham, who had served with the Philippine Scouts in the defense of Luzon. Lieutenant Derby survived the Death March from Bataan to San Fernando and imprisonment at Bilabid. He perished on December 31, 1944, when the Japanese prison ship on which he was being evacuated from the Philippines was sunk north of Formosa by American planes, which had bombed it twice before. Major Carter Berkeley Simpson of Charlottesville was also lost aboard the same ship. As a junior officer with the Fourth Marines, Major Simpson had fought throughout the entire Philippines campaign. In the defense of Longoswayan Point he had isolated and destroyed an enemy force. For his gallantry and “outstanding qualities of leadership” on Bataan he was awarded the Navy Cross.6 Bombed on December 8, 1941, for the first time, Singapore, the great island fortress of the British in the Far East, was dangerously exposed by the sinking of the battleship Prince of Wales and the cruiser Repulse on December 10. Protection by sea was no longer adequate, and because of its dependence on drinking water from the mainland, Singapore had always been vulnerable to a land attack. On January 3 this dreaded attack began, the Japs thronging into the Malay States. By the end of the month the British had withdrawn from the mainland to the island. In February the reservoirs were captured and the city surrendered. The American Consul General at Singapore was Kenneth S. Patton, brother of Mrs. J. Callan Brooks of Charlottesville. Patton and members of his staff escaped in a “sheep” boat on February 12. As they left, the city was in flames. After ten days the little boat reached an Australian port. Meanwhile Patton's wife had been evacuated to Batavia. She and her husband finally met aboard a ship somewhere in the area of the Dutch East Indies and sailed back to the United States. The following July Patton was appointed Consul General at Calcutta, the great port of India, through which supplies to China were to flow during the war.7 In handling these supplies the United States Army required a sizable establishment in India. Sergeant Merril Carter of Scottsville was stationed at a hospital there. In October, 1942, he wrote friends: “I am OK and feeling fine, but am afraid this extremely hot weather (Oct. 12) is going to get me down. It has been awful the last ten days. If it wasn't for the cool nights I don't know what we would do. “The trip across was quite an experience but was glad when it was over with. I just want to take one more boat ride—and that is the one back. Think that will do me for quite a while. Made four stops and was allowed shore leave at two of them. “Our living quarters here are not so bad. We have barracks something like the ones back in the states, and most of them have electric lights and fans. They do not have running water but a place with showers and a place to shave, etc. “The food is very good considering most of it comes out of cans, although we do get some fresh fruit and vegetables. We also get fresh beef, fish, shrimps &amp; chicken. ... “We have free outdoor moving pictures here at the hospital every Sunday night and several times a week at the main post exchange. There is a theatre on the post and several in town. They all show American pictures but they are quite old when they get here. Busses for U. S. troops run between here and town every afternoon. A certain per cent are allowed passes after five o'clock every day, so we get to go quite often if we want to.”8 During the early part of the sea war in the Pacific, the Virginiabuilt 19,900-ton aircraft carrier USS Yorktown played a leading role. The ship was commanded by Captain Elliott Buckmaster, son of Dr. Augustus H. Buckmaster, formerly a member of the medical faculty of the University of Virginia. Captain Buckmaster had spent his childhood in Charlottesville, which he always considered his home. Vice-Admiral William F. Halsey, an alumnus of the University of Virginia, was busily engaged in strafing the Gilbert and Marshall Islands in January of 1942, and the Yorktown's first battle action of the war took place on January 31 when her planes bombed Makin. The next attack was on March 10 when her planes raided Salamaua and Lae, after which followed a tedious period of cruising for sixty-three days in tropical seas guarding the United States' life line to Australia. On May 4 Japanese ships in the harbor of Tulagi were sunk by her planes, and the next day she joined forces with the carrier USS Lexington in the Battle of the Coral Sea. A month later, when the Japanese fleet was on its way to Hawaii to crush the United States Navy once and for all, our knowledge of their code made it possible for Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance to assemble every ship, plane, and submarine available to intercept the attack at Midway. Planes together with submarines did all the work, for, like the Battle of the Coral Sea, this engagement was a twentieth century affair in which surface ships' fire played no part. The Yorktown's planes were in the fight at Midway even after their ship had received three serious hits in the first attack of dive bombers. A second time the Japanese came on the Yorktown with torpedo bombers. Now she was hit forward to port; now amidships: at last she listed and water rolled over her decks. After a conference it was decided that nothing could be done, and the crew climbed down ropes into the water, while the wounded were let down in wire stretchers. But the Yorktown did not sink. Efforts were made to salvage her. Men from the destroyer USS Hamman were making good progress and had reduced her list about four degrees when suddenly the Japanese struck again: two torpedoes from submarines hit the Hamman and it went down, its depth charges killing the men who had abandoned ship. The following day at dawn Captain Buckmaster gazed at the ghostly hulk of the Yorktown still afloat. “Her flight deck was in the water. Her battle flags were still flying. We hadn't taken them down,” the captain said. At 7 A. M. on June 7, as taps sounded across the water from nearby destroyers, the Yorktown sank, six months to the hour after Pearl Harbor.9 Also at Midway was the submarine of Commander Howard W. Gilmore on which Lieutenant Landon L. Davis, Jr., of Charlottesville, was diving officer. As Davis puts it, while “we were in a hot enough spot, nothing came our way.” Soon, however, better hunting was ahead. The Japs had occupied the islands of Kiska and Attuin the Aleutians. On July 4, under cover of fog, the submarine crept into the harbor of Kiska and discovered three Jap destroyers riding at anchor. Torpedoes were fired against all three before they could get under way. Almost immediately two went down and the third, when last seen, was a fiercely burning wreck. Before the submarine could get away, it was subjected to an aerial bombing attack but escaped with minor damage. Early in 1943 Commander Gilmore, who hailed from Selma, Alabama, led his submarine, already credited with sinking 26,000 tons of Jap shipping, in an attack against some Japanese ships. While on the surface, he was spotted by a gunboat which attempted to ram the submarine. Avoiding the attack. Gilmore then maneuvered so as to ram the gunboat. As the submarine separated from the gunboat, machinegun fire swept the deck where Gilmore stood. Mortally wounded and unwilling to subject his crew to further danger, he sealed his own fate by ordering Lieutenant Davis to “take her down.” Obeying, Davis dived and brought the submarine safely out of the engagement. Commander Gilmore was awarded the Medal of Honor and Lieutenant Davis the Silver Star for this exploit.10 From the very beginning of the war Captain H. Maynard (“Bull”) Harlow was in the thick of the fight in the Pacific. In the spring of 1942 as co-pilot he made a bombing raid on Rabaul, New Britain. Fleeing from Japanese fighter planes, his plane ran out of gas and made a crash landing in the New Guinea jungle. What appeared to be a grassy field was chosen for the landing, but it proved to be a swamp. In order to get out, the nine crew members had to cut the thick grass every inch of the way. For four nights and three days they wandered in the jungle before they came upon some natives who took them in a canoe to Buna, which was then still in the hands of the Australians. Five weeks later they reached the Allied base at Port Moresby. In November malaria, which all the crew members had contracted while in the jungle, forced Captain Harlow to return to the United States.11 The invasion of the Solomons in August, 1942, was the first American offensive of the war. It was, however, primarily designed to protect the supply line to Australia, for, from their air base on Guadalcanal, the Japanese were in excellent position to attack the New Hebrides and New Caledonia area, thus endangering American ships in the Coral Sea. In the words of Major General Alexander Archer Vandegrift who led the campaign, “The planning for the Tulagi-Guadalcanal operation was hurried. When the enemy was discovered building airfields in the lower Solomons, the decision to undertake a land offensive came much earlier than those who were to carry it out had anticipated. Our preparations were made with what we had, not what we had expected to get. Marine aerial reconnaissance consisted of one flight over the theatre of operations by two officers in a B-17. Above Guadalcanal they were attacked by three Zeros, but escaped. There was no appreciable softening up of the objective prior to D-Day.”12 Vandegrift was born in Charlottesville on March 13, 1887, the son of Sarah Archer and William Thomas Vandegrift, one of the leading architects and contractors of Virginia. His grandfather, R. Carson Vandegrift, fought as a captain under Longstreet in the Confederate Army, took part in Pickett's charge at Gettysburg, and was at Appomattox when Lee surrendered. He communicated his admiration for the fighting-Christian qualities of “Stonewall” Jackson to his grandson, for General Vandegrift at Guadalcanal took Jackson as his model when he himself was “to do so much with so little.” Vandegrift graduated from the Charlottesville High School and attended the University of Virginia from 1906 to 1908. At the age of twenty-two he was appointed to the Marine Corps as a second lieutenant. The following year, he married Mildred Strode of Lynchburg, the mother of his only son, Archer, Jr., who became a lieutenant colonel in the Fourth Marine Division which fought so magnificently in the Pacific campaigns. At Parris Island, South Carolina, Vandegrift “learned his trade.” Soon afterward he saw action in the Caribbean—1912 in Nicaragua. 1914 at Vera Cruz, and 1915 in Haiti with General Smedley D. Butler, the famed soldier-orator who nicknamed Vandegrift “Sunny Jim.” From 1916 to 1918 and later, from 1919 to 1923, he served with the Haitian gendarmerie. In 1927 began his first period of service in the Orient. For two years in China he was Butler's operations and training officer, first in Shanghai and later at Tientsin. In the course of these years spent in the East, the more he saw of the Japanese, the better he liked the Chinese. Repeated spying of the Japanese on fleet maneuvers off the China coast near Shanghai in 1927 gave Vandegrift his first taste of Japanese arrogance and hypocrisy. His first adverse impression was confirmed and strengthened by later experience. Back in the United States for a five-year interlude, he was assigned to the Budget Bureau in Washington and afterwards served as assistant chief of staff of the Fleet Marine Force at Quantico, Virginia. Then in 1935 he was again sent to China, this time as executive officer of the Marine detachment assigned to the American Embassy in Peiping. When Vandegrift and his wife returned to the United States in April of 1937, they traveled via the Soviet Union. He had long been curious about Russia; the similarity of our geographical and military problems was striking to him, and he was one of the few American officers to predict so early that Russia would be our ally in World War II. From June of 1937 to November of 1941 Vandegrift was on duty at Marine Corps Headquarters, first as secretary to the commandant, Major General Thomas Holcomb, and then as General Holcomb's assistant, with the rank of brigadier general. The First Marine Division was training at New River, North Carolina, in the spring of 1942, and Major General Philip H. Torrey, its commandant, asked for Vandegrift as assistant division commander. By March he had fallen heir to the command of the division with the rank of major general.13 Long years in foreign lands had little affected qualities in Vandegrift's character inherited from his Virginia family or acquired during his childhood in the city of Charlottesville, so rich in traditions. It would seem evident that the fighting-Christian faith of Carson Vandegrift was reborn, though in a somewhat different form, in his grandson. During the struggle for Guadalcanal he displayed a remarkable confidence which he was able to communicate to his men. John Hersey wrote of him after a visit to Guadalcanal in October, 1942, “General Vandegrift, who can be seen in the evenings stretched out meditatively in a canvas deck chair in front of his heavily fly-sprayed cabin, has been cool, soft-spoken, crafty, hard and wonderfully cheerful.”14 In numerous instances he showed the respect he felt for each individual Marine serving under his command. Once, during the November fighting, he discussed the type of warfare that was going on. “We could do this a lot faster if we wanted to lose the men, but I don't intend to do it. Whenever it is possible we will not attack without artillery preparation, no matter what element of surprise we lose, and we will storm no enemy strong point that possibly can be leveled or softened up by shells.”15 A series of letters written by Vandegrift during the Guadalcanal campaign and later published in Life magazine constitutes one of the most valuable revelations of American war history. Without violating security regulations, he gave his wife a vivid picture of those aspects of the campaign he chose to describe. On August 6 he wrote, “Tomorrow morning at dawn we land in the first major offensive of this war. Our plans have been made and God grant that our judgment has been sound. We have rehearsed the plans. The officers and men are keen and ready to go. Way before you read this you will have heard of it. Whatever happens you will know that I did my best. Let us hope that best will be enough.” After a three-hour bombardment by a surface task force and Army and Navy planes, Vandegrift made landings with the First Marine Division and part of the Second on Guadalcanal, August 7, 1942. “The show opened before dawn and we got in without their knowing it,” he wrote the next day. “At first it was exciting but then came the anxious hours of waiting to hear how things turned out on all sides. It went as planned. I deeply regret the men lost and the wounded, but we had to expect that and it was less than expected.” In one day the air strip, later known as Henderson Field, was captured. Then began a series of Japanese attacks to dislodge the Marines from their positions. With the air strip bereft of planes, no coastal artillery, and few supplies during the first days, the task of defending the foothold on the island was not an easy one. The Marines held a three-by-eight mile stretch of jungle with a patch of meadow and a coconut grove. The Japanese prowled and lurked in the jungle, practicing every conceivable form of deceptive cunning in their fighting. On occasion they would attack in mass, screaming wildly. The Marines held on and gained ground. In a letter dated August 17, Vandegrift made the modest claim: “We had a little ceremony when we raised the flag over this place.”16 A shack on top of a hill was Vandegrift's quarters. When the Japanese warships shelled the island, this shack served as a convenient target. Finally his men built another bungalow somewhat protected by the conformation of the land, and persuaded the general to move. “The very next day,” in the words of Admiral John S. McCain, “three fourteen-inch shells carried the old shack away.”17 Concerning the attack of August 20 when a Japanese battalion tried to force the Tenaru River. Vandegrift wrote, “The Japs made a grievous error the other night. ... They tried to take this place by raid with about 800 men and they were practically annihilated. The radio said 670 killed, but since then about 120 have washed ashore. We lost 28 men and all of their 800 were not worth one of them. These young men, or really boys,” he continued, “are restless when there is nothing going on but when there is a job to do. they fight like young demons. They are doing it in the best Marine tradition and I could add nothing to it.” Enormously admiring his men, he continually referred to their bravery in such terms as, “The Marines were wonderful. I'm awfully proud.” “There is a lull in the work so I'll drop you a note. We are now all right and you must not worry. This afternoon Roy (Colonel Hunt) brought up six large bass which Bill Whaling (Colonel) caught in the river and we will have them for supper. The flies “They are doing it in the best Marine tradition,” Vandegrift wrote, “and I could add nothing to it.” around here are pests and they bite like the devil. Some of the men are so dark they look like natives. Our days are a good deal alike. Tell Archer, Jr., to keep himself in good physical condition if he's coming this way for the jungle is the toughest thing in these parts.” “The Resident Commissioner of the Solomons came in last night to set up the civil government again,” Vandegrift observed in his letter of September 3. “We are having more visitors, so the darn place must be getting safer. We have just heard over the radio that one of the bases to the north from which we have been receiving 'visitors' has been completely knocked out by bombers. I hope so. The Resident Commissioner has been living out in the jungle since May and is literally coming out of the seat of his pants. Seems an awfully nice person and enjoys being with white people again.” A Naval communique of September 3 announced that “eighteen Japanese bombers escorted by fighters, attacked our installations at Guadalcanal.” These were the “visitors” to which Vandegrift referred.18 A member of the Keswick Hunt Club and well known throughout Albemarle County, Corporal Thomas A. Watson of “Logan Farm” near Gordonsville had enlisted in March, 1942, as a private in the Marine Corps. On the night of September 13, as a forward observer at Lunga Hill, key to the defense of Henderson Field, Corporal Watson with courage “directed artillery fire while exposed to enemy rifle, machinegun, grenade, and mortar fire.” For his coolness and efficiency he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the field. “I've never been more proud in all my life,” said Admiral Halsey sometime later to Watson and twelve other men lined up beneath rain-sodden trees to receive Navy Crosses. “You are very courageous, splendid men.” In November Lieutenant Watson also won the Silver Star. Disregarding their own safety, he and another officer formed a forward observer liaison team for a battalion and maintained observation and communication under almost constant fire.19 Efforts by the Japanese to reinforce their troops on Guadalcanal brought on sharp naval engagements. In October the carrier USS Hornet was torpedoed in the Battle of Santa Cruz Islands and subsequently lost. Chief Boatswain's Mate Robert H. Trice of Howardsville spent several hours in the water before he was rescued. Two years later he was again a survivor when the carrier USS Princeton was sunk in the Second Battle of the Philippine Sea.20 On the destroyer USS Grayson Lieutenant Rosser Jackson Eastham of Charlottesville spent sixty-five successive days ranging up and down the South Pacific. His ship dodged Jap torpedoes and repelled fifteen air attacks in the Solomons area between August and October, 1942. Though men were shot down all around him Lieutenant Eastham kept his guns in action. On one occasion he was kept at his battle station for forty-eight hours straight with only half an hour's sleep. While the Grayson was in the Sealark Channel off Guadalcanal, Lieutenant Eastham had to take a Marine officer ashore. Before he could return, the red signal went up, notice of a Jap air raid. As thirty-odd Japanese bombers appeared, the Grayson weighed anchor and steamed away. Trapped on the beach Lieutenant Eastham and his companion dived into a nearby fox hole from which they watched the two-hour dog fight in which eighteen Japanese planes were shot down at a cost of only two American planes. Later the Grayson returned to pick up Lieutenant Eastham.21 In the Solomon Islands naval operations Lieutenant George S. Hamm of Charlottesville aboard the destroyer USS Monssen played a gallant part. “We were sunk,” wrote he, “in the big night battle off Guadalcanal on November 13th, [1942]. We ran into a large missing Jap force and [engaged] in a point blank battle which was so close that we were shooting at a Jap battleship with machineguns. We were caught between several Jap ships and received a terrific pounding, which left us completely demolished and burning.” With the fire-fighting system ruptured and only hand extinguishers available for combating the flames, Lieutenant Hamm directed fire-fighting and damage control parties. Refusing to go over the side when ordered to abandon ship, he sought out the wounded and administered first aid. He then directed the evacuation of survivors on rafts. Not until warned that the ship's magazines would soon explode did he leave. “Only a small number of our crew got off alive,” wrote Lieutenant Hamm. “Ensign Little and I were the only two uninjured officers and as the senior survivor to the Captain I was the last off the Monssen before she went down. After about six hours in the water we were picked up by the Marines and taken to Guadalcanal, where we remained for thirteen days until we could get started on the first lap of the journey back to the States.” For his heroic conduct Lieutenant Hamm was awarded the Silver Star, and in November he was assigned to command the new destroyer USS Monssen, then under construction.22 In December the Army under command of Major General Alexander M. Patch of Staunton took over operations on Guadalcanal from the Marines. General Vandegrift's last order to his troops, dated December 7, 1942, was titled a “Letter of Appreciation for Loyal Service.” In it he said: “In relinquishing command in the Guadalcanal area I hope that in some small measure I can convey to you my feelings of pride in your magnificent achievement and my thanks for the unbounded loyalty, limitless self-sacrifice and high courage which have made these accomplishments possible. “To the soldiers and marines who have faced the enemy in the fierceness of night combat; to the pilots, Army, Navy, and Marine, whose unbelievable achievements have made the name 'Guadalcanal' a synonym for death and disaster in the language of the enemy; to those who have labored and sweated within the lines at all manner of prodigious and vital tasks; to the men of the torpedo boat squadrons slashing at the enemy in night sorties; to our small band of devoted Allies who have contributed so vastly in proportion to their numbers; to the surface forces of the Navy associated with us in signal triumphs of their own; I say that at all times you have faced without flinching the worst the enemy could do to us and have thrown back the best that he could send against us. “It may well be that this modest operation, begun four months ago today has, through your efforts, been successful in thwarting the larger aims of our enemy in the Pacific. The fight for the Solomons is not yet won but 'tide what you may' I know that you, as brave men and men of good-will, will hold your heads high and prevail in the future as you have in the past.”23 For his services in the South Pacific, General Vandegrift was awarded the Medal of Honor, which was presented to him personally by President Roosevelt at the White House on February 4, 1943, with the following citation: For outstanding and heroic accomplishment above and beyond the call of duty as Commanding Officer of the First Marine Division in operations against enemy Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands during the period August 7, 1942, to December 9, 1942. With the adverse factors of weather, terrain and disease making his task a difficult and hazardous undertaking, and with his command eventually including sea, land and air forces of the Army, Navy and Marine Corps, Major General Vandegrift achieved marked success in commanding the initial landings of the United States Forces in the Solomon Islands and in their subsequent occupation. His tenacity, courage and resourcefulness prevailed against a strong, determined and experienced enemy, and the gallant fighting spirit of the men under his inspiring leadership enabled them to withstand aerial, land and sea bombardment, to surmount all obstacles and leave a disorganized and ravaged enemy. This dangerous but vital mission, accomplished at the constant risk of his life, resulted in securing a valuable base for further operations of our forces against the enemy, and its successful completion reflects great credit upon Major General Vandegrift, his command and the United States Naval Service.24 On July 30, 1943, it was announced that Vandegrift, who had been Commanding General of the First Marine Amphibious Corps, was promoted to lieutenant general. The command of the Amphibious Corps passed to Major General Charles D. Barrett, when President Roosevelt appointed Vandegrift commandant of the entire Marine Corps, to succeed Lieutenant General Thomas Holcomb, who was retiring because of age. On his way to the States to accept the appointment, Vandegrift received news in Honolulu of the sudden death of General Barrett. Ordered back to the Solomons to resume command, Vandegrift led the Marines in the invasion of Bougainville on November 1. After this new beachhead had been consolidated, he relinquished command and returned to the United States to become on January 1, 1944, the eighteenth Commandant of the Marine Corps. In recognition of his outstanding service and ability Vandegrift was made in the spring of 1945 the first full general in the history of the Corps.25 Captain John G. Hundley of Charlottesville was stationed on one of the islands in the Pacific during the first year of the war. Christmas day, 1942, a letter from General George C. Marshall was posted on the bulletin board. In part it read as follows: “Our men in lonely watch towers of the Himalayas, on small island bases in the Pacific and the fog bound Aleutians, on bases in the Caribbean and South America, have been denied the thrill and glory of the battlefield. Yet their role is no less important to the tremendous task which we are facing.” A year later Captain Hundley repeated these words by heart in an interview with a reporter of The Daily Progress. He told of his experiences and explained how important General Marshall's words were to him and others like him. “You see, I got into the war early. I graduated from Lane High in 1936, went to V.M.I., and in June, 1940, was commissioned a second lieutenant in Field Artillery. Soon I was assigned to a field artillery battery and I learned a lot about men and mules. ... “In January, 1942, just a month after Pearl Harbor, I got a chance to go overseas with a pack artillery battery, minus the mules. We didn't know where we were going, only that it was tropical service, and we had an idea it was to be landing operations. We got to an island that's been written up a bit. ... Our task, we found, was to turn the island into a Naval fuel base. That was all, just hard work on an island in the Pacific, a piece of land five miles long and two wide, with a lot of good natured Polynesian natives and not a sign of a Jap. “There we stayed for seventeen months. We loaded ships. We built roads. Labor details dragged out big rocks by hand, with ropes, for at first we had almost no machinery. We built water tanks and mains. We built a dock. We did everything but fight, and all the while the men on Guadalcanal and with MacArthur in New Guinea were holding back the enemy. We would have been a front line position if those others hadn't held, but they did the job.” Then, reverting to the drudgery and seeming futility of the assigned duty, he added, “But Marshall's letter fixed a lot of that for me, for all of us.”26 In 1943 the Australians and Americans on New Guinea continued to attack. On March 4 as a crew member of a bomber, Staff Sergeant Charles Hunter Maupin of Crozet participated in a coordinated attack against a Japanese convoy of twenty-two ships in Huon Gulf, east of Salamaua. Despite heavy antiaircraft fire, the plane attacked an enemy transport and scored two direct hits on the ship, which was left in a sinking condition. On the same day the crew also scored a direct hit on a destroyer.27 Meanwhile the Allied forces in the Pacific area were everywhere being strengthened. Lieutenant Charles William Smith of Charlottesville wrote home during the summer, “I can tell you folks now that when we first arrived in the South Pacific we were stationed in the Fiji Islands. We were the first large group of American forces there and did a great part of the work of setting up the U. S. Ground Force base there.” It was a nice place to be. The camp site was good and the Fiji Islanders were fine, friendly fellows. Luckier than some in the early days, each man in Smith's company got a real egg for breakfast from time to time.28 Lieutenant William G. Schauffler, III, Army Air Corps, whose mother and wife lived in Charlottesville, exhibited great courage and untiring energy while participating in sustained combat operational missions in June and July, 1943. On July 20 he sighted near the Solomon Islands a large enemy cruiser and attacked immediately at masthead level. “Despite a terrific barrage of automatic weapons fire from at least 30 battle stations aboard the ship, he dropped three 500-pound bombs. The first was short, but the second was a direct hit causing a huge explosion followed by billows of black smoke.” Within two minutes the cruiser sank, few if any of the crew escaping. The attack was executed with disregard of personal safety, and his B-25 bomber crashed. Enlisted personnel of Lieutenant Schauffler's crew were thrown clear and ultimately rescued, but they were unable to throw any light upon his fate. He was first listed as missing and then later officially declared to have been killed in action. For his gallant action he was awarded the Silver Star posthumously.29 Water Tender Second Class Manuel E. Perry of Charlottesville with the Seabees in the New Hebrides Islands ran across a few cannibal tribes. “They were very sullen and ugly,” he wrote. “They haven't bothered any white people for about eight or ten years, but still cook up a native tribal enemy when they fight.” In July, 1943, he wrote, “We are now working day and night to bring the enemy down to his knees. The work is hard but we try to do it with a smile... I would like to trade my place here for those back home who are beefing about the rationing, sitting on front porches, while we get Spam and powdered eggs. Our food is good as far it goes but you don't get the green things that you have back home.” Later Perry moved on to the Admiralty Islands and then to the Philippines.30 On the night of August 1, 1943, accompanied by other torpedo boats, Ensign William C. (“Bill”) Battle, son of Senator and Mrs. John S. Battle of Charlottesville, in charge of a motor torpedo boat, engaged five enemy destroyers in Vella Gulf in the Solomon Islands. Five or six probable hits were scored. Soon promoted to lieutenant junior grade, in the following months he participated in numerous engagements with enemy landing craft, ships, and shore installations. He saw action at Bougainville and in New Britain and New Ireland. He took part in the torpedo boat raid into the harbor of Rabaul. For his leadership, tactical ability, and loyal devotion he was awarded the Silver Star by Admiral Halsey.31 Second Lieutenant Daniel B. Owen, Jr., of Crozet was shot down following a raid on the enemy airdrome at Boram, near Wewak, New Guinea, on August 29, 1943. He was flying a B-24, part of a formation of six planes, and had begun a bombing run when three Zeros concentrated their fire on his plane, shooting out one engine and setting the plane afire, but all bombs were dropped on the target. In the running fight which ensued, the crew destroyed one Zero and possibly two. A short distance beyond the target the bomber burst into flames. Lieutenant Owen remained with his aircraft, keeping it in level flight so that as many of the crew as possible could escape. His Distinguished Flying Cross was posthumously presented to his parents.32 Following a “mix-up with a grenade” at Salamaua which cost him his left hand, Captain William Ray Woodard of Charlottesville was flown from New Guinea to Brisbane, Australia, where he was put aboard a ship bound for San Francisco. “Had a helluva trip back,” he wrote. “Got into a fight with a Jap raider. Being a bed patient I couldn't help much. The excitement and the following lack of attention just about cooked my goose. I have had so many transfusions that I don't believe I have any of my own blood left.” The Silver Star was awarded Captain Woodard “for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action against the Japanese forces.”33 In order to secure an advanced naval base and airfields within fighter range of enemy concentrations at Rabaul, New Britain, the First Marine Amphibious Corps under Lieutenant General Alexander Archer Vandegrift landed on November 1, 1943, at Empress Augusta Bay in western Bougainville. A beachhead was secured, and on the next day, while the Marines were still battling the Japs, Chief Machinist's Mate Elmer Irving Carruthers, Jr., of Charlottesville landed with the Seabees to begin construction of the base. In many instances during the next three weeks the Seabees actually led the Marines through the swamps and jungles. On November 20 a trail was under construction five hundred yards beyond the front lines and only a few hundred yards from the Japanese positions in the jungle. “A party had been working in the area the previous day but the men were jittery about returning,” said Major General Roy E. Geiger, who succeeded Vandegrift. “Carruthers volunteered to lead them and was killed by a bursting mortar shell a few hours later. All of the party might have been killed but Carruthers ordered the others behind the blade of the bulldozer they were using to clear a path. There was not room enough for Carruthers.” Mortally wounded, he insisted that the uninjured men attend other comrades whom he considered more severely wounded than himself and, as a result of this unselfish action, he died before reaching an aid station. A day or two later Lieutenant Commander Thomas M. Carruthers, who was in the area and had not heard from his brother recently, made inquiries and was told of his death and burial in the cemetery at Piva, a little village on Bougainville Island. The gallantry of Chief Machinist's Mate Carruthers won the admiration of his buddies, who erected at each end of a bridge simple signs on white boards with black lettering which read: “Carruthers Bridge, dedicated to Eddie Carruthers who gave his life blazing this trail.” In recognition of “his heroic spirit of self-sacrifice and unswerving devotion to duty” the Silver Star was awarded to him posthumously.34 The invasion of Tarawa, the main air base of the Japanese in the Gilbert Islands, inaugurated a series of great oceanborne offensives. Commanding the supply route to Australia and defending the road to Japan, Tarawa was of enormous strategic value. Its elaborate, recently constructed defenses were meticulously concealed in the coral island. On November 21, 1943, the Second Marine Division landed. On a destroyer, which was “up front” throughout the battle, Ship's Cook Second Class Glynn W. Amiss of Charlottesville watched the battle. Declared he, “Folks back home will never realize the extent of the terrible massacre of Marines and Sailors at Tarawa. Words cannot describe the scene I witnessed and unless the Navy Department releases uncensored pictures of the battle the public will never know what a real battle is like. ... It was too horrible to think about, and I am sorry that I can never forget it.” The loss of American life reached its height when many landing barges became stranded on coral reefs offshore, leaving the men practically helpless in the face of terrific machinegun fire from the Japanese shore installations. When the fighting had subsided, shell-torn bodies could be seen floating in the water as far away as five miles from the scene of battle. “If the folks back home could have seen what I witnessed,” continued Amiss, “or even see the motion pictures, I am sure there would be no strikes in defense plants.”35 From New Guinea, Private Lewis W. Wingfield of Charlottesville wrote his parents of a very important but in no wise unfriendly battle there in December, 1943. “Well, we have a big baseball game this Sunday,” he wrote on Wednesday the fifteenth. “From what I hear we are playing a team composed of former major and minor league baseball stars. This team just won the championship of Australia. We have a very good team, and we expect to give them a good game.” Sunday evening he fairly shouted, “We won the baseball championship of the Southwest Pacific. We beat the team that was the former champ, by the score of nine to six. I played third base.” The thought of spending Christmas away from home cast a shadow, however, and three days later he added, “I hear we get a bottle of beer for Christmas. I doubt it, we haven't had any since we have been over here. This doesn't worry me, though. All I am asking for is to be home for next Christmas.”36 During 1944 MacArthur continued to advance from east to west along the north coast of New Guinea. At the same time other forces drove from the Gilbert Islands through the Marshalls and on to the Marianas. Each step was preceded by bombing raids. Some planes did not return from these attacks, and others limped home bringing their dead. A flight surgeon, convinced that many fliers could have been saved if blood plasma had been administered shortly after they were wounded, trained the members of crews to give transfusions in the cramped quarters of a B-25. During a flight over a Japanese base in the Marshalls, Sergeant Robert V. (“Bobby”) Smith of Charlottesville, the engineer-gunner, and Lieutenant Andrew A. Doyle, the bombardier-navigator, of a Mitchell bomber were wounded. Lieutenant Doyle, whose legs were injured, was in danger of dying from loss of blood and shock. In spite of his own injury Sergeant Smith assisted the co-pilot in administering blood plasma which was credited with saving Lieutenant Doyle's life. This first successful transfusion opened the way to general use of transfusion equipment on medium bombers.37 Second Lieutenant Bernard C. Harlow of Charlottesville was the third of three brothers to win laurels in the Army Air Force. In the Central Pacific he was a crew member on one of a fleet of bombers which so effectively combed the area that a huge Navy task force landed troops at Kwajalein on January 31, 1944, unmolested by enemy planes. On April 4 Lieutenant Harlow was a crew member of a B-24 Liberator which took part in the bombing of Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands. His plane was last seen going down in flames just before the bombers broke formation to make the attack.38 In February, 1944, Staff Sergeant Gilmer M. Hall of Charlottesville whose Air Force unit received a Presidential Citation, wrote his mother. “I'll bet I was certainly funny when I was in Australia on furlough—I was walking down the crowded street one day when an automobile backfired, and I immediately fell to the ground as I always do when the air-raid signal is given. Everyone stared at me as if I were crazy or something, but it's just natural to 'hit the dirt' whenever anything like this is heard. ... One morning, I was awakened by the noise of a low-flying airplane with its gun shooting. I thought it sounded different from ours, and turned in bed to look. When I did I saw some Jap 'Zeroes' coming over the tree tops and then realized we were being strafed. Needless to say, speed records were broken going to my trench! By the time I was fully awake, I thought it was a lot of fun. One time he passed directly over, not more than fifty feet above me, and take my word for it, those big red dots on the wings are the biggest things that you've ever seen in your life!”39 But the Japs also got strafed. Commenting on a tree-top run over Wewak, New Guinea, Technical Sergeant Robert C. Walker of Charlottesville, a B-25 radio-gunner in a crack unit, said, “We had sneaked in on the Jap 'drome over a small range of hills in back of Wewak. When we reached the field I began strafing with the waist guns of our Mitchell medium bomber and the Japs strafed right back. One of their shells hit my gun and exploded. I figured I was the luckiest little boy that ever lived. If the gun hadn't been there I wouldn't have my head now. I didn't know right then that 15 of the shell fragments had cut me up. So when we got safely away from the 'drome and the pilot asked if everybody was all right. I said I was OK. I had to take it back a little later when I noticed I was bleeding, and the navigator sprinkled sulpha on my arm.”40 With a quartermaster company stationed in New Guinea, Private Edward E. Michtom of Charlottesville wrote his uncle, I. D. Levy. in the summer of 1944. “I thought I had toughened up—I've been through a hell of a lot since you heard from me, Boy! I mean WAR IS HELL—but just now a long, deadly poisonous snake came crawling through my tent, and I got out of there in a hurry! Scared the hell right out of me. ... “The going was plenty rough for a while. The Nips were trying to sneak their planes in to knock us off. Six of them came over one day, strafing to beat all hell. I was so shocked I stood there for a second as if in a daze, bullets screaming all around me. Then, like a flash, I was in my beloved fox-hole. Looking up, I could see them directly overhead. Having had enough experience by now to understand the not too comfortable situation, I knew that since they were right overhead, they could neither strafe in my vicinity or if they should drop a bomb, it would be pretty far off. (You can see bombs falling, anyway.) “About that time, the Nips got the surprise of their lives—our ack ack cut loose with a barrage that literally filled the sky with flaming tracers. Up on the edge of our foxholes, we were cheering and yelling like mad, 'Git 'em, git the B—.' Suddenly, we saw a Nip burst into flames and hurtle to the sea. The ack ack blew a second Nip to pieces in mid-air, coming down not 200 yards away. What a thrill! Meanwhile, the remaining four are zooming around. All of a sudden, all four of them simultaneously burst into flame and began falling into the sea. Perfect score, six for six! Boy, I'll never forget it. ... “The thing that tickles me about these air raids is the slow bobbing up of heads all around. One by one you see them pop up, when they feel secure enough for the moment to watch the show. What a hubbub when it's over. Every man has his own version of the panorama. You should hear them all chattering at the same time, each man with a different viewpoint on the subject. It happens every time. ... “Things have quieted down now. Once in a long while, some stray Jap may come buzzing over and wake you up out of a deep sleep, but even those futile attempts are becoming more and more infrequent. Occasionally, one can hear the roar of our mortars as they reach their target. Once in a while, one can hear a Jap 'woodpecker' (Jap machinegun that sounds like that bird) peck away, but it is soon silenced. All in all, the place has become very quiet and peaceful.”41 On June 15, 1944, the Marines attacked the Marianas Islands, landing on Saipan. The next day when a Japanese artillery battery held up the advance, Major Roger Greville Brooke Broome, III, of Charlottesville organized an attack so that the 37-millimeter gun platoon of his 24th Regimental Weapons Company outflanked and captured the enemy position. On July 5 he personally took a 75-millimeter self-propelled gun into a narrow defile against heavy enemy fire and blasted the Japanese concealed in caves which could not be reached by other weapons. Three days later he made a reconnaissance in front of the American lines and located strong enemy positions. While disposing his weapons for an assault, he received serious wounds from which he died the following January. Major Broome's Navy Cross was presented to his son.42 On Saipan Corporal Claude S. (“Billy”) Haggard of Charlottesville was also fatally wounded. An officer who served with him wrote Haggard's wife. “I was near Claude when he was hit. It was early in the morning of July 8th and we had been catching hell for about three hours. I did not actually see him receive his wounds as I had just had my radio shot out of my hand and was attempting to get reorganized. I did see and talk with him a short time later, and from our conversation I gathered he was not in a great deal of pain. “He received these wounds while trying to remove one of his wounded buddies from enemy machinegun fire. On July 9th he died from these wounds. His conduct in this action was above and beyond the call of duty and to me that makes him a great soldier. He is buried in the Second Marine Division Cemetery, Saipan Island. I have visited the cemetery and when all the work is completed it will be a fine and beautiful memorial to those boys that rest there.” Haggard's widow received the Silver Star awarded him for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity.43 Although a demolition expert with plenty of Japs to his credit, Private First Class Thomas E. Branham of Eastham won the admiration of his comrades by his rescues of the wounded on Saipan. This he had done before at Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands. where he braved a hail of death from an exploding ammunition dump to administer aid. On Saipan in the bloody battle for Hill 500, he advanced across an open field and returned with a wounded Marine. A closer call came later on Tinian, however, where he was trapped between a burning tank and a cliff full of snipers. Private First Class Branham was killed by a sniper on Iwo Jima while he was removing a mine from a road so that tanks could advance.44 On July 21, 1944, the assault on nearby Guam began. The Marine First Provisional Brigade was led ashore on Agat Point on the south coast by Brigadier General Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr., of Charlottesville. Fighting against heavy opposition, it pushed on to capture the Orote Peninsula.45 During the invasion of Guam First Lieutenant David W. Schumaker of Scottsville was engaged in clearing “blue” beach and the area behind it of Japanese land mines and unexploded projectiles. He was often under Japanese artillery, mortar, and rifle fire while doing this dangerous work, but he and his men soon made it possible for vehicles to operate on the beach. Later he also helped clear the causeway to Cabras Island of mines.46 When the American flag had been raised again over the old Marine Barracks of Apra Harbor, Marine Major Ross S. Mickey of Charlottesville, in a Grumman Hellcat fighter plane, led the first of four combat squadrons onto the hard-won air field. Especially equipped for night fighting, his squadron helped keep Japanese raiders away from Guam.47 From Saipan on July 19, 1944, Captain Harry Hubbard Cowles of Charlottesville wrote his parents. “We had some fireworks here for about a month. Things went from bad to worse, then back to bad. I finally turned up all right, which is as brief a description as I can give you up to this point. Things are now quiet. We are eating, sleeping and cleaning up generally. That's about all the news from here. I imagine you know more about this affair, from reading the papers, than I do. I get a pretty small perspective. This fighting out here has a long ways to go yet, and if my luck holds out I hope to see you in a year or so. I hope you've got that farm picked out. I'm all set to settle down when the time comes.”48 Five days later Captain Cowles was among those who invaded Tinian. Caught in a machinegun cross fire, he was instantly killed. One of his friends said of him: “He was one of the finest and bravest of officers in the Corps. He was a machinegun specialist and it was his bravery and thoughts of his men that caused his death.”49 During his first night on Tinian nineteen-year-old Private Thomas D. Hopkins of Charlottesville and six other Marines with “Old Slugger,” a 50-caliber machinegun, wiped out 106 Japanese in a sugar cane field without the loss or injury of a single Marine. “It was one of the most outstanding feats of the entire Marianas campaign,” wrote a Marine combat correspondent. “The Japs never got close enough to use their hand grenades or dynamite packs; their rifle fire was sporadic and wild, and they failed in repeated attempts to set up three .30 caliber machineguns they carried with them.”50 When the Japs had at last been cleared out, great bases were set up and many of the comforts of civilization brought in. A year later Marine combat correspondent Sergeant Phillip Joachim of Cobham landed on Agrihan in the Marianas and found it “an island paradise in the Pacific replete with beautiful native women and luscious tropical fruits.” The friendly Kanakas, who had been mistreated by the Japanese plantation overseers, greeted the Americans with pineapples, lemons, limes, watermelons, coconuts, and bananas.51 The ports of China were already under Japanese control, as were the Malay States and Singapore, when the Nipponese in 1942 pushed the British out of Burma and closed the Burma Road over which supplies had been going to China. Thereafter such supplies as reached China from the United States were flown over the Himalayan Hump from Assam, India, to Western China by American pilots. Among them Captain Robert E. Carter, III, of Charlottesville made the trip many times, helping the India-China air transport command to make a spectacular record in supplying the fighting forces in China despite high mountains and adverse weather. In March, 1944, he was with the famous Rescue Squadron which aided fliers forced down in their flights across the “hump”. Members of the squadron made regular surveys in search of crews and passengers of lost and crippled planes. When survivors were located the squadron kept constant contact with them, dropping food and other necessities until rescue was made.52 Late in 1943 Allied forces under Lord Louis Mountbatten began the drive to reestablish overland communication with China by driving the Japs out of Burma. A specially trained American infantry combat team, later known as “Merrill's Marauders” after Brigadier General Frank D. Merrill, its leader, was prominent in the fighting. With this Group was a scout and flame thrower, Technician Fifth Grade Howard Carter, Jr., of Charlottesville. Between December, 1943, and May, 1944, his regiment marched 1,120 miles through the Burma jungle and penetrated to within eighteen miles of Teng Chung, China. Though he escaped the Japanese bullets, Carter was finally knocked out by typhus and spent months in the hospital.53 Also with Merrill's Maurauders was Private William H. Hughes of Scottsville, who served as a scout and engaged in many skirmishes with the Japs. Once a bullet missed his head by a bare inch and struck the tree against which he was leaning. The Jap who fired the shot fell before a burst from Hughes' tommygun. At Nhapun Ga his battalion was surprised by the Japanese. For fourteen days the battle raged. “Despite the fact that we were surrounded and outnumbered,” he recalled, “Jap casualties were very much greater than our own. They kept coming against our lines and we kept knocking them off as fast as they came. However, things might have become pretty bad for us if one of our battalions hadn't been able to reach us and blast open an escape gap with artillery fire.”54 The climax of the campaign was the attack on Myitkyina, where an all-weather airdrome south of the city was captured on May 17, 1944, and held against savage counterattacks while American reinforcements came in by air from India. According to a CBI Roundup correspondent, First Lieutenant Henri G. (“Ricky”) Carter of Charlottesville and four companions “distinguished themselves by doing the risky job of flying all of the gas used by fighters, bombers, and transports in the battle for Myitkyina.” Not the smallest of Lieutenant Carter's feats was taking a C-46 on to the Myitkyina air strip, the dimensions of which would ordinarily preclude the landing of the giant plane. Among other things the C-46 brought in the large central casting of a half-yard shovel for the engineers. He was the only one to perform this bit of aviation gymnastics. Forced to make landings in the face of enemy fire during the early days, he and his crew would race for foxholes as soon as the plane stopped.55 Four days after the airborne troops came to the support of Merrill's Marauders, Master Sergeant John Cooke Wyllie of Charlottesvilled landed at the bloody Myitkyina air strip. Known to the men of his squadron as “Uncle John,” he moved southward through Burma with the infantry. He was in the thick of the Myitkyina-Mogaung campaign as communications chief of a Tenth Air Force squadron. He and his six-man team provided directions to bombers and fighters in close support attacks on the Japs. Sometimes bombs were dropped as close as fifty yards to his radio team in the front lines. In January, 1945, during the action at Pinwe, Wyllie was commissioned a second lieutenant in the field for outstanding work with his combat unit. Soon afterwards he was transferred to China. Here he served with various Chinese units, controlling the American air strikes in support of the Chinese advance. During the Battle of Junkow, near Poaching, Lieutenant Wyllie was promoted. He was awarded the Chinese Order of Yun Hui.56 A preliminary step in the reconquest of the Philippine Islands was the capture of the Palau Islands. Landings were made by Marines on Peleliu at eight in the morning of September 15, 1944, Corporal James N. Kardos of Charlottesville was one of eight Marines in an amphibious tank which was knocked out about fifty yards from shore during the initial landing. The group dashed ashore and took cover from Jap machinegun fire in a ditch about seven feet deep. Describing the landing, Kardos wrote: “We got caught in a tank trap but me and fifteen of the other boys got out of the trap and was trying to take a ridge that the Japs were on. We ran into a lot of pill boxes and a cross fire from Jap machineguns and snipers. In about a minute there were only three of us left. Then the Japs let loose a mortar barrage on us and the two boys that were with me were hit by a sniper as they were trying to get better cover. I dragged the one that was wounded the worst into a hole and then started for the other one. I just got my hands on him and was going to drag him back when a second shot killed him.” Kardos remained until dusk with the wounded man. When his comrade died, he made his way back to the tank trap. As he dashed for the trench, the Japs opened up with everything they had. “I got into the trap and some of the boys were still alive back there,” he continued. “They were so glad to see me that they almost kissed me.” Because of the many wounded needing attention, the group made its way in the dark to the aid station on the beach. Then Kardos started back to join his company. “It was about ten at night and very dark,” he wrote. “I took the wrong turn and ended up out in front of the lines where I ran into a Jap machinegun and spent the rest of the night there fighting them by myself. When it got light, they stopped firing. I don't know if the reason they stopped was because I had killed them or they had left. I didn't go out any farther to find out.”57 A veteran of the Solomons, Cape Gloucester, and New Britain, Staff Sergeant Warren Mowbray of Charlottesville, who hit the beach at nine-thirty on the very first day, thought Peleliu the toughest campaign he had been through, much worse than Guadalcanal. “The only Japs that we found that were not fanatical were the Koreans,” he said, “and we don't call them Japs.” Altogether his division took only about a hundred Japanese prisoners, although many Koreans were taken and used as laborers. He recalled that after experiencing the kind treatment of the Americans, the Koreans would stomp and yell with delight when a Jap plane was shot down in a dogfight.58 After a thundering naval and air bombardment, General MacArthur returned to the Philippines. First Lieutenant Ralph Erskine Conrad of Charlottesville with Troop F of the 7th Cavalry landed October 20, 1944, six miles south of Tacloban on the island of Leyte. “I was the first guy to land in the Philippines,” he wrote to his mother. “My boat was no. eleven which means first boat first wave, and since I was the platoon leader I was the first off. We killed six Japs right on the beach.” Colonel Walter Finnegan of Charlottesville, commander of the 7th Cavalry, led his soldiers into Tacloban, where the gaily dressed Filipinos lined the street to welcome the soldiers. Many trudged along happily with cases of beer and saki on their heads. These came from the stocks abandoned by the Japanese and were offered to the victorious Americans.59 After the beachhead and port had been secured by the initial success, hard fighting ensued as the Japanese and Americans struggled, each seeking to expel the other from the island. For twenty-one exhausting days Lieutenant Conrad took part in the advance across rugged and inhospitable terrain to the west coast. There were frequent, fierce skirmishes with the Japanese. Outside Villaba, shortly before dark on December 29, 1944, F Troop, which Lieutenant Conrad now commanded, encountered determined enemy resistance. It was important that the town be taken that evening. Lieutenant Conrad made a personal reconnaissance and then issued orders for the assault on Villaba. Shortly afterwards he was instantly killed. but the town was successfully occupied. The Silver Star was awarded him posthumously and presented to his mother, Mrs. Janet E. Conrad.60 During the fighting for the Philippines a soldier heard a voice near his foxhole. “Are you Mr. George Gentry's son, and is your name Cushman?” “Yes, I'm Cushman Gentry.” “Man, am I glad to see you.” Thousands of miles from home Ollie T. Woodfolk had found a friend from Albemarle. Writing home about the meeting Gentry commented that the Negro soldier had had a close call that day from Jap planes.61 On December 14, 1944, Ensign James Witt Robinson of Charlottesville, a member of Fighting Squadron Twenty, attached to the USS Lexington, flew his first mission over enemy territory to photograph Japanese air fields in the Clark Field area of Central Luzon in the Philippines. Several fighters from the carrier went along to protect him from enemy planes while he took his pictures. Of the mission Commander F. E. Bakutis, his commanding officer, wrote, “Without regard for his personal safety, Jim was making his runs through heavy antiaircraft fire. Suddenly, several bursts were seen close by his plane and that of [Ensign George William] McJimsey, and both of them began falling. One of the pilots, believed to have been McJimsey, was seen to parachute and appeared to be unconscious in his chute. Both planes crashed among the enemy installations.” First listed as missing, Ensign Robinson on January 16, 1945, was reported killed in action. Two days later he was reported safe. Actually, McJimsey was killed, and it was Robinson who had been seen to parachute. Like the hero in a movie serial, Robinson had been spared by a combination of fortuitous circumstances. A direct hit on the left wing of his plane near the cockpit threw the plane into a spin. There was a blinding explosion and Robinson lost consciousness. “The last thing I remember is going into a spin—all I had on my mind was to get out, but I don't remember bailing out nor opening the 'chute,” he recalled. “I was too weak to bail out. The only thing that I can figure is that the explosion blew the canopy off the plane and I tumbled out. Somehow the 'chute yanked open.” When he came to, Robinson was lying in a rice paddy surrounded by Filipinos. His ribs were dislocated and his wrist and arm injured. Using his first aid packet, he treated his wounds. A Filipino doctor later dressed his arm and put a splint on his wrist. That night he was turned over to one of the traveling guerrilla bands, which, because Robinson was too weak to walk, provided a two-wheel cart drawn by a carabao in which he rode for the next week. “We were on the move every night,” he recalled. “We'd travel from one barrio, as the natives called the villages, to another, and were fed and hidden by the civilians during the day. We stayed outside the towns, since there were usually several thousand Japanese in the large centers.” With Filipino guides Robinson and several other American airmen made their way to the foothills above Clark Field where the guerrilla forces had a stronghold. “In order to get there, we had to cross the Jap lines,” he said. “It took us five days to go 15 miles through the Jap lines and across a main highway. We traveled by daylight, which was dangerous, because if the Japanese saw a band of unidentified men moving around, they would conclude that they were guerrillas, and either strafe or ambush them.” Robinson remained in the foothills camp until a week after the Americans landed on Lingayen Gulf, then he started north covering the forty miles to Camiling in a day and a half. Here he rejoined the American forces on the day that city was occupied, returning, as it were, from the dead a month after he had been shot down.62 The Sixth Army had landed on the beaches of Lingayen Gulf on January 9, 1945, and put 68,000 troops ashore to secure a fifteen-mile beachhead the first day. The next day First Lieutenant George Cleveland Doner of Charlottesville with the 20th Infantry of the 6th Division wrote: “We were the assault troops and the first to land. I came in in the fifth wave about 12 minutes after the initial waves. To our surprise there was no resistance whatsoever. The Navy and Air Corps had previously given the beach a good working over but there were no Japs. We will, naturally, run into them soon but landing and getting organized has been a great asset. This is the second day and we've moved about five miles and have seen no Japs. The natives were overjoyed in our coming and have been most helpful in every way. They are extremely friendly and grateful of everything done for them and their homeland. One asked if Roosevelt was still president. They are far more intelligent than I had expected. It is a great relief after the New Guinea type of inhabitants. You'll never know how grand it was to hit land and proceed inland to a coconut grove. I saw the grass and just lay down and rolled in it. The highways, houses, and railroads were the first we'd seen in over a year. “Our trip up here was exciting and one day a Jap dived his plane into our transport. There were a few deaths and injuries but not as bad as it could have been.” Lieutenant Doner fought throughout the Luzon campaign. Six months later, on July 8, he wrote, “We have been sitting still for the past two weeks taking a little rest. Patrols are sent out every day but other than that, things have been very quiet. Quite a few prisoners have been taken in lately and one in particular ... was of special interest. He was an officer with 17 years of education, which is a lot as compared with most of the others. He spoke perfect English and gave an opinion of the average thoughts ... in the minds of the Japanese. He expressed his desire that some day he may be able to go to England to further his education. As he expressed it, he is strictly anglophilic. I had to look that one up. He is married with four children whom he loves very dearly but he had no desire to return to Japan because he knows that under the present government, he will be ostracised. He also said that the average Japanese knew that they were fighting a losing battle but they had no leader who had the power and fortitude to lead the people.” On August 12, 1945, only a day before the announcement of Japanese intention to surrender, Lieutenant Doner wrote again. “I am writing this somewhat near the front lines. I was sent up to the forward ammunition dump to consolidate and manage same. ... This is really rough country and roads are impassable because of the rain and high mountains. Naturally we are 'sweating out' the answer from Japan and at a point like this a bit of emphasis can be put on the 'sweating out'. It seems strange being here and listening to only an occasional gun shot. Yes, all firing (except air strikes and artillery) has ceased except when only necessary. The attitude of the more forward elements is, naturally, one of joking and plans for the future. ... Hope they'll let us out by the first-in-first-out system. That seems to be the concensus of opinion, and one of the biggest questions is whether or not the Japs up here will give up even after the armistice. Then, 'midst all the joking, laughter, and impatient waiting, is some tragedy. Two boys were killed last night.”63 The code name “Hot Rock” for the invasion of Iwo Jima was well chosen, for the volcanic island emits steam and sulphur fumes. Though it was heavily bombarded in preparation for the attack, its fortifications were still intact when the Marines landed on February 19, 1945. In the ensuing hours and days the defending Japs took a heavy toll of the attacking Americans. During a heavy enemy mortar barrage which had seriously reduced his platoon, Second Lieutenant Nathaniel F. Mann of Charlottesville inspired the remaining members to hold their positions by walking through the deadly hail calmly giving personal encouragement to each man. “After the barrage had lifted but while exposed to intense and accurate rifle fire, he led a platoon of reinforcements into position. Although the enemy continued to inflict severe casualties in his platoon, Lieutenant Mann voluntarily worked his way across a draw under observation to gain contact with the unit on his left, and that night was directly responsible for closing a dangerous gap in the front line by leading two more platoons into position across the draw.” For his courageous conduct Lieutenant Mann was awarded the Silver Star.64 Private First Class Harold E. Roberts of Charlottesville was one of the replacements moved up to the front lines on Iwo Jima to relieve a unit which had been “pretty badly cut up.” A bullet grazed his left cheek, inflicting a minor wound, but he refused to go back to an aid station and stayed in his foxhole awaiting orders to advance. “We'd been pinned down all morning, and when we finally got ready to move out, I threw my leg up over the hole, only to fall back with a bullet wound in it,” he recalled. For eight long hours Roberts waited while things were so “hot” in his area that the medical corpsmen could not get forward to the wounded, but later he dismissed the experience. “That sort of thing doesn't hurt, you know, there's just a hole in your leg, but no feeling.”65 Pharmacist's Mate Second Class Eugene Hoover wrote his parents describing the battle of Iwo Jima. “That was sure one of the hottest places I have even seen and for 27 days we were kept awfully busy most all the time. For a while, I was in the front line as first-aid man with the boys. You can't realize what it's like here night and day or what awful ground we had to go over. ... Japs lived like ground hogs and had to be smoked, burned and blown out. “I have some souvenirs. Two sabers—two big Jap swords, one was burned some and had no handle so I sold it for $30, but the other one is very beautiful and I still have it—a small automatic pistol, a bayonet and a pocket knife. ... “We were given new clothes and good chow after leaving Iwo Jima and the boys feel lots better after washing and shaving. This we really needed.”66 In March, 1945, the USS Trigger was lost while on war patrol in the Ryukyu Islands. The executive officer of the submarine, Lieutenant Commander John Eldon Shepherd, III, of Charlottesville, had been with the Trigger ever since January 31, 1942, when it was commissioned. He had finished his regular number of patrols the previous December, but he volunteered for two extra patrols. On the second of these the submarine was lost. The Trigger had made one of the most outstanding records of the war. For outstanding performance in combat during her fifth, sixth, and seventh war patrols she received the Presidential Unit Citation. During this time Shepherd personally earned the Navy Cross and the Silver Star.67 The offensive on the Ryukyus began March 26, 1945, when Lieutenant General Simon B. Buckner's Tenth Army landed on Kerama Retto. On April 1 landings were made on Okinawa, the main island. The Sixth Marine Division under the command of Major General Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr., of Charlottesville landed with other troops on the west coast and turned left to clear the northern part of the island. Later after that job was done they returned south to assault the chief city of Naha. By May 17 patrols of Major General Shepherd's division had crossed the muddy Asato estuary and entered the rubble-strewn capital of Okinawa. It was the largest city ever captured by the Marine Corps. After a hard campaign of eighty-two days the island was completely in American hands.68 Air attacks on American vessels were frequent during the Ryukyus campaign. The destroyer USS Newcomb was attacked near the island of Ie Shima on April 6, 1945, by four Kamikaze planes. Fireman First Class Franklin B. Giles of Charlottesville was wounded when the third suicide plane tore into his ship. “The four planes all struck our ship within a few minutes of each other,” said Giles, who was on duty below a five-inch gun. “The Japs had been flying around all day, but our planes had been successful in fighting them off. The first two planes hit with terrific explosions. The metal decking rolled up like a carpet. Looking up from my position, I saw flames. I yelled at the gunner, telling him his gun was afire. He yelled back and said so was the rest of the ship! Then the third plane hit. Our room was torn by concussion and the air was filled with flying shrapnel and pieces of metal.” Severely crippled, the Newcomb with her wounded was towed to a repair base.69 Ensign Horace Walker Heath of Charlottesville was an ace pilot with Fighting Squadron 10, the “Grim Reaper Squadron,” attached to the USS Intrepid during the Okinawa offensive. “Tuck,” as he was called by his friends, was with the “Ripper Five” division. During four months' duty in the Pacific Heath accounted in part for the destruction of fourteen planes on the ground and damaged ten others. He made many flights in support of the advance on Okinawa. On one occasion he shot down two enemy fighters and then a few days later shot down three more. Several months later, July 8, 1945, he was taking part in practice maneuvers off Pearl Harbor. As he dived making a dummy pass at the carrier, the tail and wing tops came off his plane and it started spinning with its body parallel to the water. As the plane hit the water, it disintegrated leaving no wreckage. A bronze tablet in memory of Ensign Heath was unveiled on January 19, 1947, in the chapel of St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Charlottesville.70 Off Swatow, China, on March 13, 1945, First Lieutenant Vincent dePaul Jammé, Jr., of Earlysville flew as a pilot in a formation of four B-25 aircraft on a minimum altitude bombing and strafing mission against enemy shipping along the China coast. When a destroyer and a freighter were sighted, he led his wingman in an attack on the destroyer. Though the left engine of his plane was set on fire and a propeller blade was shot off during the approach, he continued the run, strafing and bombing the vessel. Lifted out of the water by four or more bomb hits, it sank in seventy-five seconds. Forced to land on the water near the target, Lieutenant Jammé and his crew were lost. The Silver Star was awarded him posthumously.71 Airplanes were meanwhile carrying the war to the Japanese homeland. Ensign James C. Funsten of Charlottesville, flying a Navy Hellcat fighter from a carrier, escorted bombers on a smashing raid on Japan. He strafed hangars and destroyed a two-engine bomber on an enemy airdrome. An Oscar fighter came up to intercept, and Funsten got first crack at him. “I swung out wide in a downward turn and gave the Jap fighter a long burst of 50 caliber fire,” he said. “The Oscar rolled over on its back and went straight down, smoking. I didn't wait around to see him crash.”72 From bases in the Marianas Islands B-29's made regular raids on Japan. Brigadier General Lauris Norstad of Charlottesville was chief of staff of the 20th Air Force, which had its headquarters on Guam and directed these operations.73 With the 314th Bombardment Wing, First Lieutenant (later Captain) Charles W. Lucas of Charlottesville piloted a Superfortress, which his crew voted to name “City of Charlottesville” in honor of his home town. The name was painted on a flag drawn with its staff planted at Charlottesville's location on a map of North America painted on the nose of the plane. During the air assault on Japan the bomber made a record of forty-one missions. Each flight was around three thousand miles and took approximately fifteen hours. During most of these flights Lucas was at the controls. His performance of this duty earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross.74 Charlottesville also had a warship to bear her name. While the band played “Carry Me Back To Old Virginny,” the USS Charlottesville, a Coast Guard frigate, slid down the ways of the Walter Butler Shipbuilding Company at Superior, Wisconsin, on July 30, 1943. It was a good ship, three hundred six feet long and thirty-seven feet, six inches, in the beam, which Mrs. J. Emmett Gleason, the wife of Charlottesville's mayor, christened with the usual bottle of champagne. Miss Anne Nash, the maid of honor, Alvin T. Dulaney, and Mayor Gleason watched as the ship took to the water. Then was presented Charlottesville's gift to the vessel—two handsome photographs, one of Monticello and one of the Rotunda. Later the PF-25, as she was designated in Navy records, was taken down the Mississippi River to New Orleans, where she was commissioned in April, 1944. One of ninety-six such vessels built to battle U-boats and protect American convoys, the Charlottesville had a crew of one hundred ninety-six enlisted men and twelve commissioned officers under Lieutenant Commander W. F. Cass, her captain. After the commissioning ceremony Dr. H. D. Ecker of the Marine Hospital at New Orleans, a graduate of the University of Virginia Medical School whose wife was formerly an Albemarle County girl, wrote Mayor Gleason: “She was tied up at a slip not far from the hospital, with all her signal flags flying from the yardarms in a colorful display to supply as festive an air as could be expected to surround a fighting ship. The railings on the dock leading to the gangway were strung with red, white and blue bunting; the watch were uniformed in white, standing smartly at attention; and the deck was crowded with highranking officers of the Coast Guard. ... For the most part, she appears as all the other vessels of the 'frigate' class— amply supplied with fire-power and speed, and neat, compact integration of the complicated machinery of a modern fighting ship. I, naturally, was especially interested in the sick bay, which is small but adequately designed and equipped for almost any emergency. Mrs. J. Emmett Gleason makes a hit as she christens the USS Charlottesville. With all her signal flags flying, the USS Charlottesville takes her first dip. The officers' quarters are small but appear comfortable. My main interest, however, centered in the officers' wardroom where are hung two large, lovely pictures which occupy most of the forward bulkhead—one of the Rotunda, and one of Monticello. They also have hung in the wardroom a portrait of Jefferson. Lieutenant Commander Cass and several of the other officers told me that both officers and crew were most appreciative of the library sent the ship from Charlottesville. Unfortunately, the bookcase could not be accommodated, so a brass plate is being secured to the steel bookcase indicating that the library is a gift from the city of which the ship is namesake.”75 When the ship put into Norfolk in July so many of her crew wanted liberty to visit Charlottesville that Commander Cass had the applicants cut cards. Those who drew the five highest cards made the trip. As guests of the city on the first anniversary of the launching, the five sailors were shown the town. The Monticello Hotel made good on its standing offer of berths to visiting crew members. Mayor and Mrs. Gleason entertained the boys at luncheon, together with five charming hostesses. Afterward the group visited Monticello. That evening, before catching the train back to Norfolk, the visitors had dinner at the Albemarle Hotel. Just before Christmas Mrs. Gleason got a letter from one of the sailors who visited Charlottesville. He told how the Charlottesville had taken part in recent invasion operations in the Pacific. Although bombed for several days by enemy planes, she came through safely, to display proudly a reproduction of a Japanese flag and one plane as evidence that her gunners had blasted an enemy out of the sky. At the same time Ensign James R. Lewis of Charlottesville, serving aboard the USS O'Bannon, a destroyer, also wrote Mrs. Gleason about the Charlottesville, “Not so long ago, I saw her—very neat and very trim, indeed.” He described an unusual incident in which his proud destroyer was forced to take orders from the frigate which bore Charlottesville's name. Of this paradox he wrote, “To me it was nothing more or less than my home town again exerting itself as being just a little better than the next one. Yes, she seems to be doing all right for herself.”76 The Pacific war reached a climax when atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki by Superforts during the first two weeks of August, 1945. At seven o'clock on the evening of August 14 radio listeners throughout Charlottesville and Albemarle County heard the joyous news that Japan had capitulated. The formal signing of the surrender took place in Tokyo Bay on September 2, 1945, according to the calendar there; but in the time zones of the United States the date was September 1, six years to the very day after the war had begun with the German invasion of Poland.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part 3 Personnel in the Armed Forces XVI Introduction Here are printed four rosters of men and women from Charlottesville and Albemarle County who served in the armed forces of the United States during the Second World War. In accordance with the practice used in numerous service flags throughout the community, for both the city and the county there are Gold Star Honor Rolls of those who died and Blue Star Honor Rolls of those who survive. Altogether, these four rosters include substantially more than five thousand person who doffed “civvies” and donned military or naval uniforms. Their number is equivalent to about twelve per cent of the total population of the city and county at the time of the last official census in 1940—a fact which indicates that this community furnished at least its proportional share of men and women to the armed forces. These rosters are admittedly incomplete, but they are as comprehensive as it has been practical to make them. The information in the two Gold Star Honor Rolls has been secured chiefly from records \gathered by the Virginia World War II History Commission, which has its headquarters in the University of Virginia Library. The information contained in the two Blue Star Honor Rolls has been compiled principally from an official, public record maintained in the offices of the clerks of the city and county courts. This source of information is known as the “Induction and Discharge Record, World War II.” Under a statute adopted by the General Assembly in 1944 the clerks were required to put on record in appropriate volumes information which they were to secure from the local Selective Service boards about all residents of the community who entered the armed forces by voluntary enlistment or by induction under the Selective Service law. The clerks are also required to record in these volumes without charge a copy of the separation or discharge certificate issued to any serviceman or service woman who voluntarily presents this certificate to the clerk for recordation. The facts concerning the enlistment or induction of approximately 5,450 servicemen and service women from this community are recorded in ten volumes which are to be found in the offices of the clerks for the city and county, but only about half of the veterans have as yet had their discharges recorded by the clerks. Since much of the information about each person which was desired for publication herein could conveniently be found only in discharge certificates or in the clerks' copies of them, and since it has been found entirely impracticable to attempt to communicate individually with each serviceman or service woman whose discharge certificate has not yet been copied into the record at the court house. the data about each person in the following lists are in many instances incomplete. However, all facts recorded by the clerks prior to 1947 have been reviewed in the compilation of these rosters. There were also available carbon copies of discharge certificates for certain local veterans. These were loaned for use in this connection by the Virginia World War II History Commission from its statewide collection of such separation papers. Frequently the compilers have noted inconsistencies in the division of the community's uniformed personnel between the city and the county. A careful check was required to eliminate hundreds of duplicate entries, for in many instances men who were inducted through the Selective Service Board of the city have had their discharges copied into the county records or vice versa. Brothers who left the same household to serve their country may be listed partly under the county and partly under the city. If a name does not appear in the roster in which the reader expects to find it, the corresponding Honor Roll for the other unit of local government should also be examined. It should be noted that the official “Induction and Discharge Record. World War II” excludes practically all persons who were not registrants under the Selective Service law. Many local people served in the armed forces without having been involved in Selective Service procedures. Typical examples of such persons were members of the “Regular Army” and “Regular Navy,” the National Guard, organized reserves, and servicewomen. Efforts have been made to supplement the local court house records by adding names of this category: these other names were discovered in the newspapers, were sought out by personal solicitation, and were located in various other ways. In the following four Honor Rolls names have been printed in the fullest form in which they have been found available, followed by the latest titles of rank, grade, or rating ascertainable and an abbreviation indicating the branch of the armed forces in which each person served. These data are then followed by the date of entrance into the armed forces or upon active duty and by the date of separation from the armed forces by discharge or death or the date of retirement to inactive status in a reserve unit. In the case of the Gold Star Honor Rolls a brief phrase then follows to explain the place and nature of the cause of death. In each of the Honor Rolls abbreviations then indicate the military and naval decorations and medals received by each person. Finally, in the instances of the Gold Star Honor Rolls, the entry for each person is concluded with mention of the relationship, name, and (for the county) the postoffice of the nearest survivor. If any entry lacks any of these data the failure to include all the desired information is proof that some of it was regrettably unavailable. A Table of Abbreviations precedes the four Honor Rolls and explains the symbols used herein to identify the four branches of the armed forces and various decorations and medals. Official or common abbreviations have been used for all titles of military and naval rank, and it has not been felt necessary to include a long list of these abbreviations in the Table. An ordinary dictionary or common works of reference in any library should explain any questions which may arise from this omission. All veterans who have not yet presented their discharge certificates to the city or county clerk, so that these certificates may be copied into the official “Induction and Discharge Record, World War II,” should do so promptly. Such action, which costs nothing, may be of future benefit to the veteran himself in event of the loss of the original copy of the discharge certificate and, in addition, will result in making available to the public a more nearly complete record than that which is presented in the following pages.
