      <field name="fulltext">ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. For admission to any department of the University, the general conditions are the following: 1. Sufficient Age.âThe minimum legal age is sixteen years; the faculty advise seventeen or more. Nineteen years is the minimum for admission to the Department of Law. 2. Good Character.âThis must be attested by a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended, or by other valid proof. 3. Adequate Preparation.âThis must be such as will enable the candidate to meet the requirements for admission to the several departments of the University. For admission to the Department of Graduate Studies, see page 69. For admission to the College, the candidate must present a certificate or pass an equivalent examination. In either case the amount of preparation required is measured in terms of units. A unit represents a year's study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year's work. This definition of a unit takes the four-year high-school course as a basis and assumes that the length of the school year is from thirty-six to forty weeks, that a period is from forty to sixty minutes in length, and that the study is pursued for four or five periods a week; but under ordinary circumstances a satisfactory year's work in any subject cannot be accomplished in less than one hundred and twenty hours, or their equivalent. Schools organized on any other than a four-year basis can, nevertheless, estimate their work in terms of this unit. For the requirements as to the number and selection of the units required for entrance to the College, see page 57. ADMISSION BY CERTIFICATE. For admission by certificate, the applicant should file with the Dean of the University not later than September 1 a Certificate of Preparation, made out on the blank form furnished by the University. This certificate must come from a recognized institution of collegiate rank, from an accredited public high school, or from an accredited private secondary school. The candidate for admission from a public high school must be a graduate of an accredited four-year high school. The candidate for admission from a private secondary school must be a graduate of the school, or must present a certificate showing that he has completed at least the equivalent of four years of satisfactory high-school work of standard grade, covering at least fifteen entrance units. In every case the candidate for admission must have the recommendation of the principal of the certifying school. Private secondary schools in Virginia are accredited by the faculty of this university after inspection and report by a committee of the faculty. The university also accredits all four year public high schools which are fully accredited by the State Board of Education of Virginia. The Dean of the University is further authorized to accept certificates from schools outside Virginia, accredited by their own state universities or institutions of equal rank, or by their own state departments of education, provided the courses of study offered in such schools meet the requirements demanded of accredited schools in this state. If in any accredited school the number of periods given to a study, or the length of the period, is below the specified standard, the credit for such subject is reduced pro rata. In the science subjects only half-credit is allowed unless individual laboratory notebooks, properly attested by the teacher in charge, are filed with the certificate. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must in all cases take the entrance examinations. ADMISSION BY EXAMINATION. For admission by examination, the candidate must present himself at the University in June or in September, according to the dates given in the Program of Entrance Examinations. The examinations are held under the honor system, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge. All candidates who take their examinations at the times appointed are tested free of charge. In case of delayed entrance, where the grounds of postponement are good, the President of the University may admit the candidate to a special examination, for which a fee of five dollars is charged. This fee is payable in advance, and is in no case returned. PROGRAM OF ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS. June, 1923 9-11 A. M. 11 A. M.-1 P. M. 3-5 P. M.

      <field name="fulltext">REGULATIONS. REGISTRATION. Registration of New Students.âApplicants seeking admission to the University for the first time must present themselves to the Dean of the University at some time during the first three days of the session. Registration of Matriculated Students.âStudents who have previously been matriculated as members of the University must present themselves to the deans of their respective departments upon one of the first three days of the session. Delayed Registration.âAny student who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session will not be admitted unless he can explain his delay in a manner satisfactory to the President, and will be charged a delayed registration fee of five dollars. Admission to the College during the Session.âNo applicant for admission to the College who has not been previously registered therein will be admitted after the middle of the first term, unless the Committee on Entrance Requirements is satisfied that, in view of his record, he is likely to prove an acceptable student. Registration after the Christmas Recess.âOn the first week-day after the Christmas recess every student is required to register with the dean of his department between the hours of 9 a. m. and 2 p. m. Any student failing to register thus will be required to pay the delayed registration fee of five dollars, and will be liable to whatever penalties may be imposed by his professor for unexcused absences. But if the delay is due to illness or other providential cause, the dean is authorized to remit the fee and to notify the professors concerned that the student's absences have been satisfactorily explained. RESIDENCE AND ATTENDANCE. The Academic Year begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September and continues for thirty-nine weeks. Thanksgiving Day and Jefferson Day are holidays, and there is a Christmas recess beginning on the last week-day before the twenty-third of December and closing on the evening of the second of January. Attendance is required of each student throughout the entire session, with the exception of holidays, unless he has received written permission to be temporarily absent, or to withdraw before the close of the session. While in residence each student is required to attend regularly all lectures and other prescribed exercises in the courses which he pursues, or else suffer such penalties as his professors may impose for unexcused absences. Leave of Absence from the University is granted for sufficient reason by the dean of the department in which the student is registered, and must in every case be obtained in advance. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or other student organizations on excursions will not be granted except to the officers and members of these organizations. The laws relating to absence from the University of members of the athletic teams are found in the General Catalogue. The same regulations apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University and the dean of the department in which the student is registered. For the conditions governing the return of fees upon withdrawal, see page 15. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the several departmental faculties for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also the regulations as to delinquent students in the various departments. Absence from Examinations.âWritten examinations are an essential part of the work of every course in the University, and attendance upon them is required of every student. Absence may be excused only on the ground of sickness on the day of the examination (attested by a physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause which may be approved by the several faculties of the University. Special Examinations are granted only upon prompt application therefor, and in case the applicant's absence from the regular examination has been excused. See the preceding paragraph. Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the Honor System, and an unpledged paper is counted as a total failure. In matters of class standing as well, students are expected to regard themselves as governed by the law of honor. CONDUCT. The laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the University precincts or not. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University any student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The keeping of dogs by students within the university grounds is forbidden. Prohibition of Credit.âAn act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting minor students. The license to contract debts, which the President is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity. DORMITORIES AND BOARD. Dormitories.âStudents may reside in the university dormitories, in their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. The President will withdraw from the approved list any house in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Any change of residence during the session should be reported at the office of the Registrar. For rules governing the rental and occupancy of university dormitories, and the rates charged for the same, see page 17. For list of private lodging houses, with rates, apply to the Bursar. Board.âStudents may board at the University Cafeteria, at their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. For the cost of board at the Cafeteria, see page 17. For list of private boarding houses, with rates, apply to the Bursar. MEDICAL ATTENDANCE AND PHYSICAL TRAINING. Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the University Physician; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for his maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, treatment of the eye, ear, nose and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of students, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Students who take the responsibility of boarding at houses not approved by the Board of Health forfeit the right of medical attendance. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the University Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. Physical Training.âNo student is permitted to undertake an amount of work greater than he may reasonably be expected to carry without detriment to his health; and every student is advised to take a due amount of daily outdoor exercise, for which ample opportunities are afforded by the athletic fields, the tennis courts, the golf course, and elsewhere; and, in addition, to make systematic use of the facilities afforded without cost for definite and judicious physical training at the Gymnasium under the advice and instruction of the director and his assistants. For the regular course in Physical Training with credit value toward academic degrees, see page 53. Further information upon the equipment and policy of the University in the matter of Physical Training and Athletics will be found on page 270 of the General Catalogue. EXPENSES. Payment of Fees.âWhen the aggregate charge for University fee, tuition fee, laboratory fees and room rent does not exceed $50 for the session, the total amount shall be paid upon registration. If said fees aggregate more than $50, but do not exceed $100, one-half thereof shall be paid upon registration and the remainder at the beginning of the second term. When the fees aggregate more than $100, payment shall be made one-third upon registration; one-third at the opening of the second term and the remainder at the opening of the third term. If any payment remain unpaid for fifteen days after the date on which it is due, the Bursar shall immediately notify the Dean of the department in which such student is entered of the delinquency, and such student shall by him be required to at once cease attending lectures, using laboratories, library, gymnasium, athletic grounds or buildings, boarding at the dining hall, and making use of any other privileges as a student until his financial relations with the University have been arranged satisfactorily with the Bursar. Return of Fees.âA student withdrawing within five days after registering shall have his fees refunded in full, except the sum of $5 to cover cost of registration, and his name shall be stricken from the rolls. If he withdraw or is dropped from the rolls for any cause after the fifth day of the term and before the middle thereof, his fees shall be returned pro rata. If he withdraw or is dropped from the rolls for any cause after the middle of the term no refund shall be made for the respective term, except in case of sickness when the refund shall be pro-rated upon certificate of the University Physician or other reputable medical practitioner. In any case a minimum charge of $5 shall be made to cover cost of registration. Laboratory fees shall be refunded upon statement of professor in charge except where the withdrawal is within five days after registering. Regulation Concerning Registration as Virginia Student.âIn order to be considered a Virginia student, it is necessary that the applicant's parents be domiciled in the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; if he has attained his majority, it is necessary that he himself be domiciled here. One is domiciled in the State who is living in it at the time the application is made and has no intention of removing therefrom in the future, or who, though absent from the State, has not lost his former domicile by acquiring one elsewhere. No other person can honestly avail himself of this privilege. Superintendents and Teachers of Public Schools Exempt from Fees.â White male teachers and superintendents of the public schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Academic Schools of the University without payment of fees (except those charged in laboratory courses), upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the public schools of the State during the year. Applicants for admission as teachers are required to send in their names to the President of the University not later than March 5. Ministers of Religion and Candidates for the Ministry.âMinisters of religion may attend any of the Academic Schools of the University without payment of the tuition fee. The same privilege will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet without aid the expense of an education. UNIVERSITY CHARGES. University and Tuition Fees.* * The university fee goes to the fund intended to defray the general expenses of the University. Payment of this fee entitles the student, without additional charge, to the use of the library; to the privileges of the gymnasium, with baths, private lockers, etc., and the advice and aid of the physical training staff and to free medical attendance by the University Physician in case of illness. It also covers all regular examination and diploma fees. The College: VIRGINIANS NON-VIRGINIANS University fee $ 10.00 $ 40.00 Tuition* * College students from Virginia taking a single technical course in the Department of Engineering pay a tuition fee of $30, or $10 per term. 160.00 The Department of Graduate Studies: University fee 10.00 40.00 Tuition 160.00 Laboratory Fees.

A student may rent a room in one of the university dormitories and take his meals either in the University Cafeteria or in an approved private boarding house; or he may take both room and board in such boarding house, in which case he pays no room-rent or servant-hire to the University. A list of private boarding and lodging houses, with rates, may be had upon application to the Bursar. The University Cafeteria. The University Commons, conveniently situated near the center of the University, is now being conducted on the Cafeteria plan, with accommodations for seating three hundred students at one time. Good, wholesome food is being served at costs ranging from $20 to $30 per month. Many of the students are finding it possible to board at the lower rate. University Dormitories. Rules.âStudents desiring rooms should apply to the Bursar, enclosing a reservation fee of $5, which will be returned should there be no room to let. The occupant of a room may reserve it for the next session by applying to the Bursar and depositing $5 not later than May 1. No room may be sublet without the consent of the Bursar. Rates.âThe rates stated below are for furnished room. If occupied by one student, the following furniture is provided: 1 three-piece enameled iron bed with comfortable spring and mattress, 1 chiffonier or dresser, 1 table, 1 straight chair and 1 rocking chair or morris chair. If occupied by two students, the following furniture is provided: 2 single beds, or 1 double deck bed with springs and mattresses, 1 chiffonier or dresser, 1 desk or two tables, 1 rocking chair or morris chair and two straight chairs. Additional furniture may be rented if desired. All rooms are heated by hot water and lighted by electricity. The student should bring bed linen, towels, blankets, pillow, etc., or they can be purchased here if desired. The rates given are for the session of nine months. East and West Lawns. ONE OCCUPANT TWO OCCUPANTS Rooms in Bachelors' Row, W. Lawn (9) $ 90.00 Other rooms (27) 95.00 $130.00 East Range.

Rooms (51) 95.00 130.00 Single rooms (5) 60.00 80.00 APPROXIMATE SUMMARY OF NECESSARY EXPENSES. The figures in the following tables may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of nine months. As necessary expenses are reckoned here university and tuition fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. For each department three estimates are given âa low, an average, and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundry âin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. If a student shares a room with another student, and practices the strictest economy, he may possibly reduce his expenses below the low estimate.

While it is difficult for any student to be assured of remunerative work before he reaches the University, information as to such employment may be had from the Secretary of the Committee on Student Self-Help, Madison Hall. For Loan Funds for deserving students, see page 26.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THE COLLEGE. Edwin Anderson Alderman, Ph.B., D.C.L., LL.D. President James Morris Page, M.A., Ph.D., LL.D. Dean ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. The general requirements for admission to the University may be found on page 9. For admission to the College, the candidate should possess an amount of preparation which is at least the equivalent of that represented by four years of successful work in an accredited school. He must offer, either by certificate or by examination (see page 9), fifteen units, of which three must be in English, two and one-half in Mathematics (one and one-half in algebra, one in plane geometry), and one in History. The remaining eight and one-half units may be selected at will from the list on page 11, unless the candidate expects to apply for a baccalaureate degree. In that case he should offer, if he is an applicant for the degree of Bachelor of Arts, four units in Latin or two units in Greek; if he is an applicant for the degree of Bachelor of Science, two units in each of two modern languages (French, German, Spanish). Candidates who expect to apply for the degree of B.S. in Architecture should offer Solid Geometry and Physics if possible. In addition to the above, each candidate must pass at the University a qualifying examination in English before his registration can be completed. Advanced Standing is given to any candidate who, in addition to meeting the minimum requirements for entrance above stated, can show by passing an examination that he has done work equivalent to that covered by any of the following courses offered in the college: Latin A1, Greek A1, Greek A2, English A1 or A2 or A3, German A1, Mathematics A1, French A, Spanish A. Candidates who apply for examination for advanced standing must present a special certificate showing that the full content of the course, on which advanced standing is sought, has been covered in a systematic manner in the preparatory school, and in addition must present the specific recommendation of the principal of the school that the candidate be admitted to the advanced standing examination in question. The examinations for advanced standing are set at some time during the first month of the session. College Credit.âCandidates who desire credit for work done at other colleges, must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students, and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the College a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college, must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate, and must give his grades. The final validation of such certificates is effected by the successful completion of the courses taken in this university. In no case will credit be given on more than forty-eight session-hours of work done elsewhere, and any candidate who receives this maximum amount of credit can count among the remaining fifteen session-hours required for his degree only the credit value of the courses he has passed as a resident student in the College, exclusive of any credit for work done in the Summer Quarter or in any of the professional departments. In every case the candidate must spend at least one regular session of nine months exclusively in college work in this university. Conditioned Students.âA candidate for entrance must offer fifteen units as defined by the Southern Commission on Accredited Schools. At least thirteen of the units offered must be included in the list of units accepted for admission on page 11. A student not able to offer fifteen units as defined in this list may be conditioned on any two units except English A and B. All conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the session following initial registration. This may be done by private study or in the Summer Quarter. But no course taken to remove a condition may be counted as part of the work credited toward a degree. No conditioned student may be later registered as a special student. Special Students.âA candidate may be admitted as a special student without fulfilling the entrance requirements above specified, provided that, if he is a Virginian, he is more than twenty years old or, if he is not a Virginian, he is more than twenty-three years old, on the day of registration, and gives adequate evidence of serious purpose and of the training needed to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for a degree; but such students are permitted and encouraged to make up their deficiencies by private study or by taking courses in the Summer Quarter. They will then be admitted as regular students, and may be accepted as applicants for degrees, provided all entrance requirements are met at least one academic year before the date of graduation. Admission of Women.âWomen are admitted as candidates for the vocational degrees of Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, Bachelor of Science in Architecture and Bachelor of Science in Commerce. A candidate must be at least twenty years old on the birthday preceding matriculation; must present certificates showing graduation from an accredited public high-school, or not less than four years' attendance in an accredited private school, with credit for not less than fifteen college entrance units obtained at least two years before admission to the University; and must in addition show by proper certificate the completion in a standard college, subsequent to the credit obtained for fifteen entrance-units, of at least thirty session-hours, (sixty semester hours), of courses of college grade, in not less than eighteen calendar months. REGULATIONS. (1) The Session-Hour.âAll courses are measured in terms of the session-hour as a unit. A session-hour is one hour a week throughout the session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week throughout the session of laboratory work. (2) Maximum and Minimum Number of Session-Hours.âEach College student is required to undertake each session courses aggregating at least fifteen session-hours (with the exception noted in paragraph (4) ). This number may be increased in the following cases: (I) Any first-year student may take eighteen session-hours, provided he is credited with six session-hours of advanced standing. (II) A student not in his first year in the College may take eighteen session-hours, provided he (a) has passed in the preceding session courses aggregating fifteen session-hours, or (b) is in his graduating year and needs eighteen session-hours for his degree. (III) A student not in his first year may take twenty-one session-hours provided he passed in the preceding session courses aggregating eighteen session-hours. (IV) Any student whose term grade (or class grade, if the term grade is not available) for the first or second term is at least 75 per cent. in each of his courses, may take three additional session-hours for the ensuing term. Exceptions to the above regulations will be allowed only by special permission of the Committee on Rules and Courses. Physical Training is not counted in the maximum and minimum requirements detailed above. (3) Grade.âThe grade of a college student in any course either for a term or for the session, is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Class standing in any course is determined by the regularity of the student's attendance upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercises) of the course, and by the quality of his work, as indicated by his recitation grades, written tests, laboratory work, etc. For passing in any course in the college a grade of seventy-five per cent. is required. (4) Exclusion from Courses, Probation and Suspension. (I) Exclusion from Courses: A student who, after due admonition, is evidently making no real progress in a course, may, at any time during the session, be excluded from the course by the Dean upon the recommendation of the instructor concerned. A student whose term grade in a course is less than 50 per cent., or who discontinues the course without the permission of the Dean, or who is absent without excuse from the term examination, will be automatically excluded from the course, unless the instructor recommends on his term report to the Registrar that the student be retained in the course. Any student excluded from English A1, A2, or A3 in the first term, must take up English A4 at the beginning of the second term, but this required addition to the student's program of studies will not affect his total number of session-hours as far as the application of these regulations is concerned. A student who by exclusion from one or more of his courses, is left at the end of the first or second term with 15 or more session-hours, shall not be allowed to take up additional work for the ensuing term. For the case of students left with less than 15 session-hours see below. (II) Probation: (1) A student placed on 15-hour probation must pass on at least 6 session-hours of his work, or else be suspended from the college. (2) A student placed on 12-hour probation must pass on at least 6 session-hours of his work and average at least 50 per cent. on the other 6 session-hours, or else be suspended from the college. A student on 12-hour probation who passes on all of his courses may take up 3 additional session-hours and be absolved from probation. (3) A student placed on 9-hour probation must pass on 6 session-hours of his work, and receive a grade of at least 65 per cent. on the remaining 3 session-hours, or else be suspended from the college. A student on 9-hour probation who passes on all of his courses may take up 3 additional session-hours and be placed on 12-hour probation for the term next ensuing. (III) Suspension: Suspension means enforced withdrawal from the college. If imposed during the session it applies to the remainder of the regular session; if imposed at the end of the session, it applies to the whole of the following session. In no case does it apply to the Summer School. [But see also (10) below.] (IV) Probation and suspension are administered as follows: (1) A student who by exclusion from a course or courses, is left at the end of the first or second term with only 12 session-hours is put on 12-hour probation for the term next ensuing, unless he has passed all his remaining 12 session-hours. In this case he may take up 3 additional session-hours and escape probation. (2) A student who by exclusion from a course or courses, is left at the end of the first or second term with only 9 session-hours (1) will be put on 9-hour probation, unless he has passed all his remaining 9 session-hours, in which case he may take up 3 additional session-hours and be put on 12-hour probation, or (2) if he be other than a first year student, will be suspended unless he has passed on at least 3 session-hours. (3) Any student not in his first year, who by exclusion from a course or courses, is left at any time during the session with only 6 session-hours, will be suspended. Any first year student who by exclusion from a course or courses, is left with only 6 session-hours will be suspended at the end of the term unless he has passed on at least 3 session-hours. In this case he will be required to take up 3 additional session-hours and be put on 9-hour probation for the ensuing term. (4) Any student who fails to attain a session grade of at least 75 per cent. on at least 9 session-hours of his work will be put on 15-hour probation for the first term of the subsequent session. (5) No student on probation may receive leave of absence, except for imperative cause, nor may such a student be a member of an athletic team, glee club, or other student organization which publicly represents the University, such as Topics, Virginia Reel, etc. A student excused for more than one-half of his term examinations on account of illness may not be a member of one of the above organizations until he has passed his examinations. No student may continue at the College if he misses all the examinations of two consecutive terms on account of illness. (5) Absence from Examinations will not be excused, except for sickness on the day of examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. (6) Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, in accordance with (5) above, is entitled to a special examination on a date during the regular session to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge of the examination. (7) Re-Examinations.â(I) A College student whose session grade in any course falls below seventy-five per cent., but not below sixty-five per cent., may, upon the written recommendation of the professor in charge, be admitted to re-examination upon that course, or upon such portion of it as the professor shall determine, during the registration week of the following September. The fee for each re-examination is five dollars, and should be paid to the Bursar on or before July fifteenth. (II) The candidate for an academic degree who fails on only one term of one of his courses during his final session of candidacy, is entitled to a special re-examination on the work of that term before the Final Day. The candidate who passes the re-examination, as an independent unit and not averaged in with the grades of the other terms, will receive credit for the work of the whole course in question. No fee is charged for such re-examination. (8) Reports.âReports are sent at the end of each term to the parent or guardian of each College student. These reports indicate the number of times the student has been absent from lectures, and give his term grade on each course. The dean will be glad at any time to furnish to the proper person a special report on any student's standing. In addition to the above, a report on the standing of each first year student in the College is sent to the student's parent or guardian early in November. (9) Conduct.âThe laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or not. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University for the residue of the current session every student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The keeping of dogs by students within the University grounds is forbidden. (10) Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University as well as the consent of the student's parent or guardian, if he is a minor. But it should be noted that no student on probation may withdraw except for imperative reasons; and any student on probation who withdraws without permission will be suspended, not only for the residue of the current session, but also for the whole of the subsequent session. Any student, not on probation, who withdraws from the University, shall be on 15-hour probation for the first term of the next session, if he is passing on less than 9 session-hours of his courses at the time of withdrawal. (11) Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also (4). (12) Change of Studies.âNo change can be made in a student's program of studies except with the approval of the Dean together with official notification by the Registrar. Any student desiring to change his program of studies must apply to the Dean who, if he approves the change, will give the student a permit to be taken at once to the Registrar. The change becomes valid only when the Registrar notifies the student and the Professors concerned to this effect. No permit for change of courses will be issued after the end of the first week of each term, except that first-year students may make such changes within the first two weeks after the beginning of lectures in September. Any student who drops a course without permission will receive a failure in that course and may be subjected to further discipline by the Academic Faculty; and no credit may be received for any portion of a course attended before formal permission has been granted as outlined above. (13) (a) Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors, but only for sickness or like providential cause. Any explanation of an absence which a student has to offer must be made on the day of the first lecture attended after the absence. Unexcused absence from lectures renders the student liable to discipline by the Faculty. It should be carefully noted that no student is "entitled" to be absent at all. His presence is required at each class or laboratory exercise at which he is due, unless his absence is excused for reasons outlined above or in the next paragraph below. Even if the student is absent with excuse, he must make up the work lost by such absence. No student who was, for any reason, absent from more than fifty per cent. of the lectures of any one term, can receive a grade on the work of that term. (b) Absence from the University is permitted upon the written leave of the dean, and should in every case be obtained in advance. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or musical clubs on excursions will not be granted, except to the officers and members of these organizations. The laws relating to absence from the University of members of the athletic teams are found on page 276 of the Catalogue. The same regulations apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. It should also be carefully noted that no leave of absence can be granted just before or just after a vacation, or just after term examinations, except for very grave reasons. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES. Full opportunity is given to any student to carry out any definite plan of work which he may have in view on coming to the University, or which may have been prescribed for him by those under whose direction he is completing his education. But when no well-considered plan has been outlined in advance, and the end in view is that for which the great majority of students enter college, namely, the attainment of a liberal education, the student will be expected to enter upon the regular work of the college leading to a baccalaureate degree. Six degrees are offered candidates for graduation in the College. Two of these, the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science, are cultural; the Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, the name of which is inscribed on the diploma, the Bachelor of Science in Architecture, the Bachelor of Science in Commerce, and the Bachelor of Science in Medicine, are vocational degrees, designed for those who wish to fit themselves especially for professional work. No course offered by a successful candidate for one of the cultural baccalaureate degrees can be offered by the same candidate as part of the work credited toward the other cultural baccalaureate degree, nor can any work done to remove an entrance condition be counted for any degree. For a student who enters without advanced standing the normal time required for obtaining a baccalaureate degree is four years, assuming that he completes each year courses which aggregate the regular minimum of fifteen session-hours. A student receiving advanced standing in not less than two subjects may obtain a degree in three years, provided he is able to complete each year eighteen session-hours. A student may materially shorten the time required for obtaining a degree by taking courses in the Summer Quarter on which college credit is given. For credit for work done at other colleges, see page 57. The requirements for the baccalaureate degrees are such as to allow a large measure of freedom of election on the part of the individual student, such restriction only being placed upon this liberty as is necessary to insure at the same time the thoroughness and the breadth of culture for which these degrees stand. In order to secure to the recipient of a degree a due measure of acquaintance with the methods of thought characteristic of each of the leading departments of knowledge, as well as with their subject matter, his courses must be chosen subject to the specific requirements detailed below. BACHELOR OF ARTS AND BACHELOR OF SCIENCE. The degree of Bachelor of Arts or of Bachelor of Science, respectively, will be conferred upon regular students who have completed not less than sixty-three (63) session-hours of undergraduate courses, taken in conformity with the following programme: (1) Required Subjects.âCandidates for either cultural degree must take 33 hours of required subjects as stated below, 3 hours of which must be Physical Training. Of the remaining 30 hours of required subjects not less than 24 hours must be taken during the first two years, and the remaining 6 hours not later than the third year. Foreign Languages. For the Bachelor of Arts.âNine session-hours from two languages, of which six must be in either Latin or Greek (exclusive of Greek Literature B1).

      <field name="fulltext">DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. Edwin Anderson Alderman, Ph.B., D.C.L., LL.D. President Richard Heath Dabney, M.A., Ph.D. Dean ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. Admission to the Department.âFor admission to the Department of Graduate Studies a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank is required, for men and women alike. In order to become a candidate for a degree, the student must be advanced to candidacy by the Committee on Rules and Courses upon formal application, as set forth below. Advancement to Candidacy for a Degree.âAny graduate student who wishes to become a candidate for a degree must file with the Dean of the Department his application on a blank form to be secured from the Registrar. This application must include a proposed program of work arranged in accordance with the requirements for the several degrees as stated below, and must be accompanied, in case the applicant does not hold an academic degree from this University, by an official transcript of the applicant's academic record made out by the Registrar of the institution from which the baccalaureate degree was received, and by a catalogue of that institution, marked to show the courses of study pursued. The application will be submitted by the Dean to the Committee on Rules and Courses, who will consider it in conference with the professors concerned. The Committee will have the right to require that the applicant add to his program any courses, undergraduate or graduate, considered necessary to supply his deficiencies, or to enable him to pursue with profit the courses he has selected. When the program has been finally approved, the Dean will report to the applicant his advancement to candidacy for a degree. It should be distinctly understood that graduate degrees are not conferred merely upon the basis of the number of courses passed, or of the length of time spent in resident or non-resident work, but upon the basis of the quality and scope of the candidate's knowledge, and his power of investigation in his chosen field of study. Candidates whose training and attainments are inferior cannot expect to secure a degree in the normal length of time estimated below for the respective degrees. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES. Master of Arts.âThe degree of Master of Arts will be conferred upon the holder of a degree of Bachelor of Arts who has fulfilled the following requirements: (1) The successful completion, in not less than one full year of resident graduate work, of the program of studies approved for the candidate by the Committee on Rules and Courses, as embodied in his formal application for advancement to candidacy. This application must be submitted not later than one week after registration, in the year in which it is expected that the degree will be conferred. The program must form a consistent plan of work, to be pursued with some definite aim, and grouped around some one subject to be known as the candidate's Major Subject, the name of which will be incorporated in the body of each diploma conferring the degree. The program should be arranged in consultation with the professors concerned, and must be approved in writing by a professor of the candidate's Major Subject, who shall be designated by the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies, after consultation with the candidate. (2) The preparation and submission of a thesis, to be accepted as satisfactory by the Professor of the candidate's Major Subject. Two copies of the thesis, typewritten on paper of prescribed quality and size, and substantially bound, must be deposited in the office of the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies not later than May 15 of the year in which it is expected that the degree will be conferred. The back of the cover must bear the title of the thesis and the writer's name, and the title page must bear the words: A thesis presented to the Academic Faculty of the University of Virginia in candidacy for the degree of Master of Arts. Master of Science.âThe degree of Master of Science will be conferred upon the holder of a degree of Bachelor of Science who fulfills requirements corresponding to those stated above for the degree of Master of Arts. Doctor of Philosophy.âThe degree of Doctor of Philosophy will be conferred upon the holder of a baccalaureate degree who has fulfilled the following requirements: (1) The successful completion, in not less than three full years of graduate work, of the program of studies approved for the candidate by the Committee on Rules and Courses, as embodied in the student's formal application for advancement to candidacy. This application must be submitted not later than October 1 of the session preceding the final year of candidacy for the degree. The program of studies must include a Major Subject, pursued for at least three years, and may include one, or two, Minor Subjects, pursued for at least one year. The Minor Subject, or Subjects, if any, must be closely related to the Major Subject, and the program as a whole must contribute to the mastery of some definite field of knowledge as an object of study and research. The name of the Major Subject will be incorporated in the body of the diploma conferring the degree. At least one full year of graduate study, which must be the last year of the student's candidacy, must be spent in residence; but by special permission of the Committee on Rules and Courses the student may be allowed to complete his dissertation in absentia. Upon advancement to candidacy the Dean will appoint a special committee of not less than three Professors, under the Chairmanship of the Professor of the candidate's Major Subject, and including a representative of the Committee on Rules and Courses. This committee will conduct the candidate's final examinations, and pass upon his dissertation. (2) A reading knowledge of French and German sufficient to enable the student to use these languages for purposes of research. This knowledge shall be attested by passing examinations in French and German, set by the professors of these languages, in consultation with the Professor of the Major Subject, not later than Oct. 1 of the session preceding the final year of candidacy for the degree. Upon recommendation of the professor of the Major Subject, and at the discretion of the Committee on Rules and Courses, some other language may be substituted for either French or German. (3) A final examination, written, oral, or both, in addition to all examinations in course, upon such phases of the Major Subject and of allied subjects, as the special committee shall prescribe. No candidate can be admitted to the final examination until his dissertation has been accepted. Preliminary examinations may in addition be required by individual schools, as stated under the announcements of these Schools. (4) A Dissertation exhibiting independent research in some branch of the candidate's Major Subject, submitted to the Special Committee not later than April 15 of the last year of candidacy.
