It was endowed by gifts of $100,000 from John D. Rockefeller and $50,000 from the General Education Board, and was named in honor of Dr. J. L. M. Curry, the Southern educator. There were originally two professorships in the School, the Curry Memorial Professorship of Education and the Professorship of Secondary Education. In 1914 a chair of Educational Psychology and Principles of Teaching was added to the School, and two years later a Professorship of School Administration was established. In 1919 the School was organized into a Department of the University, with four professorships, and was placed upon a professional basis similar to that of the Departments of Law, Medicine and Engineering. The relation of the Department of Education to the various academic schools of the University remains close, however, since the academic training of students of Education is obtained in the academic schools, and courses in Education are credited toward the academic degrees. In the spring of 1928 plans were matured to provide more adequate facilities for observation, practice teaching, and experimental studies. The school authorities of the City of Charlottesville and the County of Albemarle joined with the University of Virginia in establishing a program of experimental education and teacher-training. After the preliminary program of organization had been approved, the General Education Board of New York City granted to the University a subsidy of $20,000 a year for a period of two years to forward the program and make possible its operation for the session of 1928-1929. The Rector and Visitors of the University made a supplementary appropriation of $5,000 annually for a period of two years, thereby giving the Department additional funds amounting to $50,000 for the biennium, 1928-1930. PURPOSE The rapid development of educational science and practice has made it necessary that ample provision be made for the professional training of those who expect to teach or to administer school affairs. The Department of Education, therefore, aims to provide the following: 1. An opportunity for the study of Education as an important function of society. 2. To give the necessary technical training for teaching and administration to: a. University students, with or without experience, who intend to teach; b. Secondary school principals; c. Normal school teachers and administrators; d. College teachers of Education; e. School superintendents, supervisors, and other executives of schools of all grades in cities, counties, and states. 3. To develop scientific methods of testing school work and to furnish demonstrations of the way in which these methods may best be applied, thus developing a spirit of observation and experimentation tending to increase our knowledge of the science and art of education. 4. To become a center of educational influence to which teachers of all grades and kinds may come for information and educational guidance. 5. To furnish to the general public information on any phase of school organization, administration, and supervision, thus helping to create a clearer general understanding about Education and the State. PEABODY HALL Peabody Hall, the Education Building, was named in honor of George Peabody, who in 1867 made his great gift to the cause of education in the South. The building was made possible through a gift of $40,000 from the trustees of the Peabody Education Fund. This amount was supplemented by an appropriation of $12,000 from the Rector and Visitors of the University. The building was completed in 1912, and is the home of the Curry Memorial Department of Education. The plans were drawn by a modern school architect, and approved by some of the leading authorities on school architecture in this country. It is, therefore, a model of excellence in this regard. It is one of the best equipped buildings in the University, and has ample classroom and laboratory facilities, and an excellent auditorium equipped with a modern motion picture machine. Modern requirements in heating, lighting and ventilation are exemplified in its construction without sacrificing conformity to the general style of classic architecture prevailing in the University. Adequate provision is made for a Departmental library, seminar rooms, classrooms, psychological laboratory, and offices for the administrative officers and teaching staff of the Department. THE HECK MEMORIAL LIBRARY The Department of Education maintains its own library in Peabody Hall named in honor of the first professor of Education in the University, the late Professor William Harry Heck. The library was made possible through the gift of Mrs. Anna Tuttle Heck of Professor Heck's private library containing approximately 2,000 well-selected books on Education, and the transfer of all books on Education from the General Library of the University. Splendid equipment was procured through a gift of money from students in Education, the Education Club and friends of Professor Heck. A gift of $3,000 from Mr. Alfred W. Erickson of New York City has enabled the Department so to strengthen its professional library as to offer very superior facilities to its rapidly growing student body, by making possible the enrichment of every course now offered. At present the library consists of approximately ten thousand select books covering most fields of Education, a complete file of publications of the United States Bureau of Education, various national, state and foreign documents, state school laws, annual reports of state superintendents of public instruction, city superintendents' reports, etc. Files of the leading educational magazines are available for free use of the students. Exhibits of elementary and high school texts for comparative studies are made available through the generosity of various publishers. REGULATIONS REGISTRATION Registration.âApplicants seeking admission to the Department of Education must present themselves to the Dean at some time during the first three days of the session. All women students must first register at the office of the Dean of Women, 20 East Lawn. Delayed Registration.âAny student who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session will not be admitted unless he can explain his delay in a manner satisfactory to the Dean and will be charged a delayed registration fee. Admission to the Department of Education During the Session.âNo applicant for admission to the Department of Education who has not been previously registered therein will be admitted after October 1, unless the Committee on Admissions is satisfied that, in view of his record, he is likely to prove successful with the work undertaken in spite of the handicap of late entrance. Registration after the Christmas Recess.âOn the first week-day after the Christmas Recess, every student is required to register by attending all the classes or laboratory exercises at which he is due that day. No further formality is necessary. Any student failing to register thus will be required to pay the delayed registration fee, and will be liable to penalties imposed for unexcused absences. But if the delay is due to illness or other providential cause the Dean is authorized to remit the fee. RESIDENCE AND ATTENDANCE The Academic Year begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September and continues for thirty-nine weeks. Thanksgiving Day and Jefferson Day are holidays, and there is a Christmas recess beginning on the last week-day before the twenty-third of December and closing on the evening of the second of January. Attendance is required of each student throughout the entire session, with the exception of holidays, unless he receives permission to be temporarily absent, or to withdraw before the close of the session. While in residence each student is required to attend regularly all lectures and other prescribed exercises in the courses which he pursues, or else suffer such penalties as may be imposed for unexcused absences. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the Department of Education. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the departmental faculty for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. Absence from Examinations.âWritten examinations are an essential part of the work of every course in the University, and attendance upon them is required of every student. Absence may be excused only on the ground of sickness on the day of examination (attested by a physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause which may be approved by the several faculties of the University. Special Examinations are granted only upon prompt application therefor, and in case the applicant's absence from the regular examination has been excused. Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the Honor System, and an unpledged paper is counted a total failure. In matters of class standing as well, students are expected to regard themselves as governed by the law of honor. Prohibition of Credit.âAn act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting minor students. The license to contract debts, which the President is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity. DORMITORIES AND BOARD Dormitories.âStudents may reside in the University dormitories, in their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. The President will withdraw from the approved list any house in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Any change of residence during the session should be reported at the office of the Registrar. For rules governing the rental and occupancy of University dormitories, and the rates charged for the same and for a list of private lodging houses, with rates, apply to the Bursar. Board.âStudents may board at the University Commons, at their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. MEDICAL ATTENDANCE Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the University Physician; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for his maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, treatment of the eye, ear, nose and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of students, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Students who take the responsibility of boarding at houses not approved by the Board of Health forfeit the right of medical attendance. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the University Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. EXPENSES Payment of Fees.âWhen the aggregate charge for University fee, tuition fee, laboratory fees and room rent does not exceed $50 for the session, the total amount shall be paid upon registration. If said fees aggregate more than $50, but do not exceed $100, one-half thereof shall be paid upon registration and the remainder at the beginning of the second term. When the fees aggregate more than $100, payment shall be made one-third upon registration; one-third at the opening of the second term and the remainder at the opening of the third term. If any payment remain unpaid for fifteen days after the date on which it is due, the Bursar shall immediately notify the Dean of the Department of the delinquency, and such student shall by him be required at once to cease attending lectures, using laboratories, library, gymnasium, athletic grounds or buildings, boarding at the dining hall, and making use of any other privilege as a student until his financial relations with the University have been arranged satisfactorily with the Bursar. Return of Fees.âA student withdrawing within five days after registering shall have his fees refunded in full, except the sum of $5 to cover cost of registration, and his name shall be stricken from the rolls. If he withdraw or is dropped from the rolls for any cause after the fifth day of the term and before the middle thereof, his fees shall be returned pro rata. If he withdraw or be dropped from the rolls for any cause after the middle of any term no refund shall be made for that term, except in case of sickness when the refund shall be pro-rated upon certificate of the University Physician or other reputable medical practitioner. In any case a minimum charge of $5 shall be made to cover cost of registration. Laboratory fees shall be refunded upon statement of professor in charge except where the withdrawal is within five days after registering. Regulation Concerning Registration as Virginia Student.âIn order to be considered a Virginia student, it is necessary that the applicant's parents be domiciled in the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; or if he has attained his majority, that he himself be domiciled in said State; and that either his parents or the applicant for admission shall have been bona fide taxpayers in the State of Virginia for at least two years prior to said application. Sons of Regular Officers of the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or Public Health Service, whether on the active or retired list, irrespective of the location of their posts of duty, are accorded the privilege of registering under the rules applicable to the registration of Virginia students. Superintendents and Teachers of Public Schools Exempt from Fees.â White male teachers and superintendents of the public schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Academic Schools of the University without payment of fees (except those charged in laboratory courses), upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the public schools of the State during the year. Applicants for admission as teachers are required to send in their names to the President of the University not later than March 5. Ministers of Religion and Candidates for the Ministry.âMinisters of religion may attend any of the Academic Schools of the University without payment of the tuition fee. The same privilege will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet without aid the expenses of an education. UNIVERSITY CHARGES** ** These charges are for three or more courses. For one course the student will pay one-third, and for two courses, one-half of the University fee and tuition, for the session. University and Tuition Fees* * The University fee goes to the fund intended to defray the general expenses of the University. Payment of this fee entitles the student, without additional charge, to the use of the library; to the privileges of the gymnasium, with baths, private lockers, etc., and the advice and aid of the physical training staff, and to free medical attendance by the University Physician in case of illness. It also covers all regular examinations and diploma fees.

BOARD AND LODGING The University Dormitories The dormitories of the University of Virginia consist of The Halls, East Lawn and West Lawn, East Range and West Range, Dawson's Row, and Randall Building. Hot water heat and electric light are furnished throughout the dormitories. Each occupant of a dormitory room must provide a pillow, pillow cases, single sheets, blankets, towels, etc., and whatever rugs, curtains, etc., he may desire. Description and Rates The Halls.âThe most comfortable, best-equipped, and most modern rooming accommodations in the University or in the city are to be found in the new University dormitories, erected in 1929. This group of eight buildings stands on the crest of the slope west of Monroe Hill, with an outlook on the Ragged Mountains and the range of the Blue Ridge, and is within less than three minutes walking distance from the gymnasium, the academic, engineering and law class-rooms, and the University Commons. These eight buildings are divided into twelve separate units, known as Halls, each with its individual entrance, and each bearing the name of some professor, distinguished in the history of the University. The buildings are of three stories and of full fire-proof brick and cement construction throughout. They provide one hundred and fifty-three two-room apartments, of living-room and bedroom, each apartment intended to accommodate two students. All of the rooms are approximately fifteen feet square. Each living-room has an open fire-place and is furnished with a desk with drawers, a table with drawer, a steel waste-basket, two rocking-chairs, two straight chairs and floor-plugs for reading lamps. Each bedroom has two large built-in clothes closets, and is furnished with two single beds, two chiffoniers, and two straight chairs. All furniture is new, of excellent quality and attractive design, the bed-springs and mattresses of especially high grade. There is an average of one bathroom to every five students. The bathrooms, each equipped with showers and an individual built-in steel locker and a medicine chest with mirror for each student using it, are so placed that every bed-room, with one sole exception, opens directly into a bath. Telephone service is provided in each Hall. Trunks and packing cases will not be permitted in the apartments of The Halls dormitories. They must be delivered to the trunk room in each Hall from which the student will remove the contents to his room. Trunks and packing cases will be stored in dry racks located in the basement. Each apartment will ordinarily be occupied by two students. The rental for the nine months of the regular session is $150 per student (or $300 for each apartment). East Lawn and West Lawn are of one-story brick construction. They contain thirty-eight rooms, each approximately twelve feet square, located between the pavilions and opening into colonnades running the entire length of "The Lawn." The rental of twenty-seven of the rooms, for the session, is $125 for one occupant or $170 for two occupants. The remaining nine rooms, called Bachelors' Row, rent for $115 for one occupant, or $160 for two occupants. These rooms are reserved for applicants for senior degrees. East Range and West Range consist of forty-six one-story brick rooms, approximately twelve feet square, built in sections running the entire length of "The Ranges," and opening into arcades. In addition, there are two two-story brick houses called the Old Gymnasium and the Club House, containing fourteen rooms, approximately fifteen feet square. The rental of the rooms on the Ranges, for the session, is $125 for one occupant or $170 for two. The rooms in the Old Gymnasium and the Club House rent for $80 for one occupant or $110 for two. Dawson's Row consists of a series of four eight-room two-story brick houses, and a six-room one-story brick house, located on the southwest side of the grounds. The rooms are approximately fifteen feet square. The rental of fifty-one of the rooms, for the session, is $95 for one occupant or $130 for two. Four of the rooms rent for $60 for one occupant or $80 for two. All of the rooms on the Lawns and Ranges and in Dawson's Row are provided with running cold water. For each of the Lawns and Ranges one bath-house is provided and there is a bath-house in Dawson's Row. Randall Building.âA two-story brick building, located at the south end of East Range, containing thirty-one single rooms ten by fourteen, ten by fifteen and ten by sixteen; eight double rooms fourteen by fifteen, fifteen by fifteen and fifteen by seventeen; one double room with study-room attached. Single rooms rent at $80 to $90; double rooms $125 for one occupant or $150 for two occupants. Double room with study-room attached, for one occupant $135, or $180 for two occupants. The furnishings of the rooms on the Lawns and Ranges, in Dawson's Row and Randall Building is as follows: For one occupantâan enamelled iron bed with comfortable springs and mattress, a chiffonier, a table, a straight chair and a rocking-chair. For two occupantsâtwo single beds or one double-deck bed with springs and mattresses, one chiffonier, one desk or two tables, one rocking-chair and two straight chairs. Board Meals may be obtained at the University Commons, which is a handsome building overlooking the McIntire Theatre and situated within two minutes' walk of any of the dormitories. The interior of the main dining-room is panelled, and the walls contain portraits of a number of distinguished alumni and officers of the University. The furnishings are attractive. The capacity of the Commons is three hundred. Board is furnished at cost and it is expected that the rate per month will in no case exceed $25. Other Accommodations In addition to the University Dormitories and the Commons, there are private lodging and boarding houses situated near the University, and a number of restaurants are nearby. A list of these will be furnished upon application. Occupants of the dormitories may take their meals either at the Commons or elsewhere. All inquiries concerning rooms or board should be addressed to The Bursar, University, Virginia. APPROXIMATE SUMMARY OF NECESSARY EXPENSES The figures in the following tables may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of nine months. As necessary expenses are reckoned here University, tuition, and athletic fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. For each department three estimates are givenâa low, an average, and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundryâin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. If a student shares a room with another student, and practices the strictest economy, he may possibly reduce his expenses below the estimate.

The holder must be a Virginian in need of financial assistance in order to attend the University; and he must pledge himself to teach or engage in some other form of public school work in Virginia for at least two years, or, failing this, to repay to the University the full value of the scholarship. Blank forms of application may be had upon request to Dean John L. Manahan, Chairman of the Committee on State Teachers' Scholarships. Appointments prior to September 1 of each year are made upon the recommendation of division superintendents. Any scholarships unassigned on September 1 are open to applicants from the State at large. In addition to the Virginia State Teachers' Scholarships, there are a number of other scholarships in the University available for students of Education. A detailed description of them is given in the General Catalogue of the University. LOAN FUNDS AND STUDENT SELF-HELP The University is in possession of funds from which loans are made to deserving students in need of such assistance. An account of these loans is given in the General Catalogue. Inquiries concerning them should be addressed to the Bursar. Opportunities for obtaining remunerative employment are afforded to students who are desirous by this means of partially paying their way through the University. It is difficult to give definite assurance of employment to a student before he reaches the University, but it may be stated that any student with sufficient resources to carry him through the first half of the session can be reasonably sure of obtaining work which will help defray his expenses for the rest of the academic year. Information as to employment may be obtained by addressing the Director, Box 1487, University, Virginia. STUDENT ACTIVITIES JEFFERSON SOCIETY Connected with the University is the Jefferson Society founded in 1825 to provide for common improvement in debate, to promote general culture among its members and the student body, and to drill its members in all those exercises which strengthen for the free duties of citizenship. All students in regular attendance upon one or more of the schools of the University of Virginia who are not members of any similar organization in this institution shall be eligible to regular membership. Such candidates shall make written applications on forms provided by the Membership Committee. These forms may be obtained at any of the literary meetings of the Society all of which are open to the public. They are announced in College Topics. WOMAN'S SELF-GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION The Association includes all women students of the University of Virginia, and exists to bring about a greater unity and mutual helpfulness among the women of the University, and to promote and maintain the highest standards of University life. ATHLETICS Intercollegiate and intramural athletics are under the supervision of the Director of Athletics and his staff. The University is represented in intercollegiate competition by both varsity and first-year football, baseball, basketball, track, cross-country, boxing, tennis, swimming and lacrosse teams. The athletic plant is one of the finest in the South. Memorial Gymnasium contains three basketball courts, a swimming pool, a track, boxing and wrestling rooms, and adequate locker facilities. Scott Stadium, which seats 22,000 people, is regarded as one of the most beautiful in the country. Lambeth Field has excellent facilities for track and baseball. Twenty-two tennis courts and four practice fields for mass games have been built near the Gymnasium. STUDENT UNION The Student Union was organized in 1932. The University has taken over Madison Hall for use as a center of student activities under the supervision of the Union of which all students are considered members. The affairs of the Union are conducted by the Student Senate. Facilities are offered for meetings of student organizations and groups and a social program is carried forward throughout the session. In the reading room are newspapers from many of the cities in the South and East. Recreation rooms are also provided. Offices of College Topics, the Magazine, Corks and Curls, the Dulaney Memorial Library and the Student Self Help Bureau are located in the building. PUBLICATIONS College Topics is a bi-weekly newspaper published by the students and devoted to the interests of the University at large. Corks and Curls is the University Annual, its aim being to present some record of the scholastic, religious, athletic and social activities of the college year. Its publication is in the hands of a chartered corporation formed by the fraternities and literary societies of the University. The University of Virginia Magazine is a literary journal published seven times a year by students and is sponsored by the Jefferson Society. SECONDARY EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA The Department of Education publishes under the editorship of Dr. W. R. Smithey, Professor of Secondary Education, a high school quarterly called Secondary Education in Virginia, devoted to the encouragement of research in Virginia secondary school problems for both public and private schools and to the reporting of research through its columns. This publication is the official organ of the Department of Education, and addressed primarily to the solution of problems of secondary education in Virginia and its columns are open to all workers in this field. It aims to encourage educational research in secondary education. RELIGIOUS WORK YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION, INCORPORATED Charles Walter Gasque, Jr. President Raymond Neikirk Wilburn Vice-President Rockwell Hall Smith Recording Secretary Elmer Irving Carruthers Treasurer William Kyle Smith General Secretary William Royall Smithey Chairman, Board of Directors History.âThe Young Men's Christian Association of the University of Virginia which has its headquarters on the second floor of Madison Hall was founded October 12, 1858, during the period of the University's expansion and reformation. Bruce, in his "History of the University of Virginia," states: "The spirit of reformation was expressed in (1) the abolition of the uniform law, and also the law that required the students to leave their beds at dawn; (2) the adoption of the Honor System; (3) and the organization of the Young Men's Christian Association." It was the first college to adopt the constitution of the Y. M. C. A., and thus has the honor of being the oldest college association in the world. Object.âThe object of this Association, as set forth generally in the Charter, is more specifically stated as follows:â to foster and promote Christian fellowship among the students of the University of Virginia by encouraging their participation in religious activities; by provoking their serious thought on great moral and religious issues; by inculcating in them the spirit of service; and by providing for them, and increasing their appreciation of, social entertainment of a wholesome and beneficial nature. Work.âThe Association affords opportunity for voluntary study of the Bible and also of problems of national and international interest, particularly with reference to the possibility of solution by the fundamental principles of Christianity. Discussion groups are addressed by prominent men and faculty members conduct regularly increasing numbers of special groups as interests are developed. Members of the Association work with the Boy Scout troops and cooperate with community agencies in other forms of welfare work. Under the Deputation Committee, student leaders and groups of students visit various preparatory and high schools in the State to conduct religious meetings, and they also carry on evangelistic campaigns in various communities throughout the State. Handbooks and student directories to the number of more than 2,000 are distributed each fall. Various conferences are attended by delegated representatives from the Association both in the State and outside when possible. Equipment.âThrough the munificence of Mrs. William E. Dodge and family, of New York City, the Association possesses a very handsome building, which was erected in 1905, at a cost, including furnishings, of about $80,000, and which is maintained in part by an endowment of over $16,000, subscribed by students, alumni, and friends of the University. This building, called "Madison Hall" in honor of President Madison, who was intimately connected with the early history of the University, faces the north front of the Rotunda. The budget for the support of the Association work is supplied by the income from a small endowment, the Chapel fund and rents. REGULATIONS (1) The Session-Hour.âAll courses are measured in terms of the session-hour as a unit. A session-hour is one hour a week throughout the session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week throughout the session of laboratory work. (2) Maximum and Minimum Number of Session-Hours.âEach student is required to undertake each session courses aggregating at least 15 session-hours (with the exception noted under Probation below). This number may be increased in the following cases: (I) Any first-year student may take 18 session-hours, provided he is credited with 6 session-hours of advanced standing. (II) A student not in his first year in the Department of Education may take 18 session-hours, provided he (a) has passed in the preceding session or in the third term thereof courses aggregating 15 session-hours, or (b) is in his graduating year and needs 18 session-hours for his degree. (III) A student not in his first year may take 21 session-hours provided he passed in the preceding session or in the third term thereof courses aggregating 18 session-hours. (IV) Any student whose term grade (or class grade, if the term grade is not available) for the first or second term is at least 75 per cent. in each of his courses, may take 3 additional session-hours for the ensuing term. Exceptions to the above regulations will be allowed only by special permission of the Faculty. Physical Education is not counted in the maximum and minimum requirements detailed above. (3) Grade.âThe grade of a student in any course either for a term or for the session, is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Class standing in any course is determined by the regularity of the student's attendance upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercises) of the course, and by the quality of his work, as indicated by his recitation grades, written tests, laboratory work, etc. For passing in any course in the Department of Education a grade of 75 per cent. is required. (4) Exclusion from Courses, Probation and Suspension: (I) Exclusion from Courses: 1. A student who is evidently making no real progress in a course, may, at any time during the session, be excluded from the course by the Dean upon recommendation of the instructor concerned. 2. A student whose term grade in a course is less than 50 per cent., or who discontinues the course without permission of the Dean, or who is absent without excuse from the term examination, will be excluded from the course. (II) Probation and Suspension: 1. Probation is a state of warning, involving withdrawal from the student of certain privileges enumerated below. Suspension means forced withdrawal from the Department. 2. A student will be placed on probation if, in any term, he does not pass on 6 hours of work; and, if he shall be excluded from a course or courses, he must, in order to avoid probation, pass on a number of hours 6 in excess of the number from which he is excluded. A student will be suspended if, in any term, he does not pass on 3 hours of work; and, if he shall be excluded from a course or courses, he must, in order to escape suspension, pass on a number of hours 3 in excess of the number from which he is excluded. 3. A student on probation must carry at least 12 hours of work or be suspended. A student not on probation must carry at least 15 hours of work or be placed on probation. 4. No student may remain on probation for more than two terms in his entire college course. If his record is such as to invoke probation a third time, he will be suspended. No student suspended a second time may reenter the Department. 5. No student on probation may be a member of any student organization which publicly represents the University, such as an athletic team, a musical club or a student publication. 6. Suspension, if imposed during the session, applies to the remainder of the regular session; if imposed at the end of the session, it applies to the whole of the subsequent session. 7. Probation or suspension may be absolved by the completion of 3 session-hours of work in one term of the Summer Quarter. 8. A student who is permitted to withdraw from the University during the session will be re-admitted only on probation if, at the time of his withdrawal, he was on probation. A student previously suspended will be readmitted only on probation. 9. The application of these regulations is automatic. A student may, however, appeal in writing to the Committee on Rules and Courses for relief from their application. The Committee is empowered to grant relief for just cause. (5) Absence from Examinations will not be excused except for sickness on the day of examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. A student excused from more than one-half of his term examinations on account of illness may not be a member of any student organization which publicly represents the University, such as an athletic team, a musical club, or a student publication, until he has taken his examinations. No student may remain in the Department if he misses all the examinations of two consecutive terms on account of illness. (6) Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, in accordance with (5) above, is entitled to a special examination on a date during the regular session to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge of the examination. (7) Re-Examinations.âA candidate for a degree who fails on only one of his courses during his final session of candidacy is entitled to a special re-examination on the work of that course before the final day, provided that he average at least 65 per cent. on the work of the three terms, and provided the professor in charge recommends that the candidate be granted a re-examination. The professor in charge is to decide whether the candidate is to stand a re-examination upon the whole course, or upon some portion or portions of the course. No fee is charged for such re-examination. It should be carefully noted that no student is entitled to more than one re-examination on a given course without repeating the course. (8) Reports.âReports are sent at the end of each term to the parent or guardian of each student. In addition to the above, a report on the standing of each first-year student in the Department is sent to the student's parent or guardian early in November. (9) Conduct.âThe laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or anywhere else. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University for the residue of the current session every student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. The President will dismiss from the University every student convicted of public drunkenness, or of other conduct reflecting serious discredit upon the University. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The keeping of dogs by students within the University grounds is forbidden. Motor driven vehicles either owned or operated by students are prohibited from parking in the roadways and alleys of the University grounds between the hours of 8:30 a. m. and 4:30 p. m. However, students suffering from serious physical disability, or living more than two miles outside the city limits, may be granted permits to park. (10) Voluntary Withdrawal.âVoluntary withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean, as well as the consent of the student's parent or guardian, if he is a minor. Any student who withdraws without permission will be recorded as having been suspended. (11) Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also Suspension, above. (12) Change of Studies.âNo change can be made in a student's program of studies except with the written consent of the Dean, together with official notification by the Registrar. No permit for change of courses will be issued after the end of the first week of each term. Any student who drops a course without permission will receive a grade of zero in that course; and no credit may be received for any portion of a course attended before formal permission has been granted as outlined above. (13) Absence from Lectures may be excused by the Dean, but only for sickness or other imperative cause. Any explanation of an absence which a student has to offer must be made in writing to the Dean within one week after the absence. But no excuse for an absence may be submitted after the beginning of an examination period. Any student not on probation is allowed 2 absences without penalty each term in each course, and a student who passed, in the preceding term, on all courses taken, aggregating not less than 15 term-hours, is allowed 4 absences without penalty each term in each course. But the performance of written work and laboratory work is not affected by the allowance of absences without penalty. Each unexcused absence (in excess of absences without penalty) from a class exercise in any term will cause one point to be deducted from the student's term grade. A total of more than 10 unexcused absences (in excess of absences without penalty) in any term will cause a student to be placed on probation. Probation imposed for absences is called "attendance probation," and it carries the penalties of probation imposed for failure in courses. If a student incurs attendance probation while on probation for failure in courses he will be suspended. No student who was, for any reason, absent from more than 50 per cent. of the lectures of a course in any term can receive a grade on the course in that term. This regulation does not apply to students on the Dean's List. The laws relating to absence from the University of members of athletic teams are found in the General Catalogue. The same regulations apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. The Dean's List.âA student who passes on not less than 15 session-hours during a session with an average of at least 85 per cent., and with no session grade less than 75 per cent., will be placed on the Dean's List, and will remain on the List as long as he receives an average of at least 85 per cent., on at least 15 session-hours per term and receives no term grade less than 75 per cent. in any course. Any student on the Dean's List failing to maintain this standard of excellence will be automatically dropped from the List. A student once dropped from the List can again make the Dean's List by meeting the above standard for entire session. A student on the Dean's List is not subject to the regulations limiting the issuance of leaves of absence from the University, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class standing, imposed for absence alone. COÃPERATIVE PROGRAM BETWEEN THE SCHOOL BOARD OF THE CITY OF CHARLOTTESVILLE AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Facilities for observation and directed teaching and for practical educational research are made available through the coÃ¶peration with the University of the school systems of the City of Charlottesville and the County of Albemarle. The CoÃ¶perative Teacher-Training Program entered into between the School Board of the City of Charlottesville and the University of Virginia provides for the employment of critic teachers in the following subjects: English, Latin, Mathematics, Natural Science and Social Science. The agreement as adopted includes the following regulations: 1. The critic teachers shall be chosen by the University with the approval of the superintendent of schools, it being recognized that no person may be elected by the School Board without the recommendation of the superintendent of schools. 2. The duties of the critic teachers shall be as follows: A. To teach two regular classes in the high school such as shall be agreed upon by the critic teacher, the principal of the high school and the superintendent of schools. B. To serve as critic teacher for the direction of the teaching of such student teachers as are assigned to him. C. To perform such routine duties in connection with the classes taught as would fall to the lot of any high school teacher in a city school system in Virginia. D. To conduct such experimental studies as the wisdom of the critic teacher, the principal of the high school and the superintendent of schools may deem advisable for the improvement of the school. Proposals for all such experimental studies shall originate with the Department of Education in the University of Virginia. 3. The salaries of the critic teachers shall be paid as follows: A. The City School Board shall pay the pro rata amount for the two regular classes taught that would be paid to any high school teacher for doing the same work according to the fixed salary schedule in effect from time to time. B. The remainder of the salary shall be paid by the University. 4. The critic teacher may teach a special methods course in the subject-matter field of his assignment, this work to be done at the University. COÃPERATIVE PROGRAM BETWEEN THE ALBEMARLE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA The CoÃ¶perative Program entered into between the School Board of the County of Albemarle and the University of Virginia provides facilities for observation and practice in the high schools of the County for the training of high school teachers and principals under a director of high school supervision; and laboratory training for rural supervisors in the elementary schools of the County under two assistant professors of rural supervision. Provision is also made for the training of division superintendents of schools under the direction of Superintendent A. L. Bennett. CRITIC TEACHERS AND DEPARTMENTAL SUPERVISORS The duties of the critic teachers and departmental supervisors in the County high schools are as follows: 1. To act as general departmental supervisor in the subject-matter field of his assignment. 2. To teach two regular classes in the high school of which he is a member of the teaching staff, such as shall be assigned by the Director of Supervision acting in agreement with the principal of the high school and division superintendent of schools. 3. To serve as critic teacher for the direction of the teaching of such student teachers as are assigned to him by the Director of Supervision. 4. To teach a special methods course in the subject-matter field of his assignment. 5. To conduct such studies of instructional problems as are approved by the Director of Supervision as being in the interest of the improvement of instruction in his subject. 6. To coÃ¶perate in directing the studies of such graduate students as are assigned to him by the Director of Supervision, acting in agreement with the Professor of Secondary Education. 7. To recommend to the principal pupil-assignment to studies in his departmental field. DUTIES OF THE RURAL SUPERVISORS The coÃ¶perative program between the University and the County of Albemarle made possible the employment of two superior rural supervisors, bringing the supervisory staff for elementary schools to five. These two supervisors, in addition to supervising all elementary schools in the districts assigned to them, direct the training of rural supervisors. In order that there may be adequate opportunity for experimentation in one-room schools two schools within easy reach of the University have been chosen for special study and demonstration by the rural supervisors. It is hoped that the record of achievement in these two schools may serve as an example and stimulus, not only to the schools of the county, but of a much wider area. TRAINING OF ELEMENTARY SUPERVISORS Students preparing for elementary school supervision must have (1) previous training equivalent to that required for the Virginia Normal Professional Certificate, and (2) at least two years of successful teaching experience in elementary schools attested by letters of recommendation from division superintendents of school under whom the teaching was done. It is a general requirement in connection with Education B4 that students shall be present for the opening of the schools in Albemarle County for the purpose of studying the problems of school organization. The schools usually open during the first week in September. COLLEGIATE PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE Recipients of the Bachelor of Science in Education will receive the Collegiate Professional Certificate, the highest form of certificate for high school teachers issued by the State Board of Education. This certificate is valid for ten years, renewable for a similar period, and entitles the holder to teach in both high and elementary schools in Virginia. Holders of Collegiate Certificates, the certificates of second rank issued by the State Board of Education, may obtain the Collegiate Professional Certificate by attending the University one session and taking four 3 session-hour courses in Education. Curricula organized to meet the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Education fulfill both academic and professional requirements for the highest grade of professional high school certificates issued without examination by the various state departments of Education to holders of baccalaureate degrees. The graduate courses in Education are recognized in states requiring graduate study for professional certificates. TEACHERS' CERTIFICATES A resolution of the State Board of Education provides that on and after September 1, 1929, the minimum qualifications for those persons beginning to teach in an accredited high school shall be a baccalaureate degree from a standard four-year college. In accordance with the above regulations it will not be necessary after September 1, 1929, to issue to incoming teachers the Special or Junior College Certificate. The new requirement for high school teachers will not be retroactive. THE SUMMER QUARTER The Summer Quarter is an integral part of the University year. Courses in the College of Arts and Sciences, as well as in the Department of Education, are the same in character and in credit value as in any other Quarter of the University. Degrees are conferred upon men and women upon exactly the same terms for work done in the Summer Quarter when the degree requirements are fully met. Those who contemplate completing their degree requirements in the Summer Quarter should keep clearly in mind, in estimating the time that will be required, that the normal amount of credit which may be taken in one Summer Quarter is 6 session-hours. Candidates for a degree who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. This certificate must be acceptable both to the Dean of the Summer Quarter and to the Dean of the Department in which the degree will be obtained. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college and must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate and must give his grades. In every case the candidate must spend at least three full Summer Quarters or an equivalent time at the University in order to meet the residence requirements. The Master's degree may be obtained by properly qualified persons in three Summer Quarters. In no case is this degree to be conferred upon any person who has not attended and done graduate work three full Summer Quarters or the equivalent time in the regular session of the University and the Summer Quarter. All persons who are looking forward ultimately to taking a degree through summer work are urgently requested to file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter an official statement of their entrance requirements and work for which college credit is desired. Blanks for this purpose will be mailed upon application. First Term begins June 18 and ends July 28. Second Term begins July 30 and ends September 1. In order to provide for the increasing number of students who complete the requirements for their degrees during the Summer Quarter, a convocation exercise will be held Friday evening, August 31, at 8 o'clock, when the degrees will be conferred. Catalogue and further information may be obtained by addressing Secretary Summer Quarter, Box 1337, University, Virginia. BUREAU OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS Educational Tests.âThe Department of Education maintains a Bureau of Tests and Measurements as a feature of its extra-University service. Select standard tests in school subjects will be supplied to cities, counties and individual schools at cost. Members of the Faculty of Education will visit the schools to be tested, train teachers in the use of the tests and personally direct the giving and scoring of them, provided the necessary traveling expenses are borne by the schools served. Mental Tests.âIn connection with its work in educational psychology, the Department undertakes to assist school authorities in the diagnosis and training of backward and gifted children. Assistance will be rendered in the making of mental surveys and the establishment of special classes. A clinic will be maintained for the study of cases accessible to the University and the services of the professor in charge will be available to any community in Virginia at the cost of the necessary test materials and traveling expenses. Any school official desiring the services of the Bureau of Tests and Measurements should address the Dean of the Department of Education. BUREAU OF APPOINTMENTS The University of Virginia maintains a Bureau of Appointments in charge of a committee consisting of Professors Manahan, Smithey, Metcalf and Lewis. The services of the bureau are free to all teachers and prospective teachers seeking positions in secondary schools (both public and private), normal schools, and colleges. Correspondence with regard to appointment should be addressed to the Bureau of Appointments, A. M. Jarman, Secretary, Room D, Peabody Hall, University, Virginia.
