      <field name="fulltext">2 REGULATIONS, &amp;c. MATRICULATION. To be admitted into the University, the student must be sixteen years of age; but the Faculty are authorized to dispense with this requisition in the case of application for admission by two brothers, one of whom is under the age of sixteen. If the applicant for admission has been a student at any other incorporated seminary, he cannot be received, but on producing a certificate from such seminary, or other satisfactory evidence to the Faculty, with respect to his general good conduct. Every student is free to attend the schools of his choice, and no other than he chooses: Provided, that if under the age of twenty-one, he shall attend at least three professors, unless he has the written authority of his parent or guardian, or the Faculty shall for good cause shewn allow him to attend less than three. The qualifications of the student to enter the schools of Ancient Languages, Mathematics, and Natural Philosophy, are tested by previous examinations. Before a student matriculates, he is furnished with a copy of the laws, which he is required to read. On matriculating, he signs a written declaration, that he will conform to those laws, and, if he be a resident student, that he has deposited with the Patron all the funds in his possession. COURSE OF INSTRUCTION. In each school, there are three regular lectures a week; besides which, there are in most of them extra lectures suited to the several classes into which the school is divided. The mode of instruction is by text-books and lectures, accompanied by rigid examinations. The course pursued in each school, is as follows: I.âANCIENT LANGUAGES. Professor Harrison.âIn this school are taught the Latin and Greek languages; the Greek and Roman History, Geography, and Literature; and the Hebrew language. The instruction is given partly by lectures and examinations, and partly by comments on portions of the text-books appointed to be read by the student. It embraces the following subjects, distributed according to the classes. I. Junior Latin.â1. General principles and doctrines of the Etymology. 2. The application of these general principles in the explanation of the formation and composition of the words of the language, considered individually, and without regard to their relations to other words in a sentence. The doctrine of the primary and secondary significations of words is considered in connection with this branch of the subject, and is illustrated in the lectures from day to day as occasion may offer. 3. The accidence, or inflectional forms of words, expressing the relations in which they stand to other words in a sentence. These modifications of the forms of words are in like manner explained by the application of the general principles of the Etymology. 4. The Syntax, or laws which govern the relations existing between the several parts of a sentence or discourse, whether indicated by the inflections of words, or by particles. This subject is treated of partly in lectures specially devoted to it, partly by way of prelections and comment on the portions of authors read in the lecture room, and partly in connection with the written exercises. For the above subjects the text-books are the Professor's printed notes, Beck's Latin Syntax, containing the most important parts of the Syntax of Zumpt's Latin Grammar. 5. The doctrine of the quantity of syllables, and the metres. The students are advised to use Carey's Latin Prosody, or Anthon's Prosody, which contains what is most useful in Carey's. 6. The Latin authors used as text-books are Horace, Virgil, Cicero's Orations, and his Epistles ad Diversos, Terence, and CÃ¦sar's Commentaries. The last chiefly with a view to the written exercises. II. Senior Latin.â1. Prelections and commentaries on portions of the classic authors, embracing, besides the other matters necessary for the better understanding of these, a further developement of the doctrines of philology taught in the Junior Class. The text-books are Horace, Juvenal, Livy, and Tacitus. 2. Geography of Ancient Italy.âThe Professor's printed notes form the text-book. The maps of ancient and modern Italy, published by the "Society for the diffusion of useful knowledge," are recommended. 3. Roman History. This subject is taught by prelections, and by examinations on the text-books. These are the History of Rome published by the "Society for the diffusion of useful knowledge," Niebuhr's History of Rome, Ferguson's Roman Republic, and Heeren's Manual. III. Junior Greek.â1. The Etymology, considered in its general principles and in its applications, the Syntax, and the Prosody and metres, are taught to this class in the same way as to the Junior Latin. For these subjects Buttmann's larger Greek Grammar is the textbook. Thiersch's Tables of the Greek verb, by Patton, are referred to and recommended. The Greek authors read and explained in the lecture room, are Xenophon's Anabasis, Herodotus, and a play of Ãschylus or Euripides. The Greek and English Lexicon of Donnegan is that preferred. IV. Senior Greek.â1. Prelections and commentaries on portions of the Greek classic authors, in the same way as in the Senior Latin class, and embracing the like subjects. The Greek authors used as text-books in this class are Euripides, Sophocles, Thucydides, and Homer. The student should have Matthiae's Greek Grammar, 5th edition of the translation. 2. Ancient Geography of Greece. The printed notes of the Professor form the text. 3. Ancient History of Greece. It is taught by prelections, and by examinations on the text-books. These are Thirlwall's History of Greece, Gillies' History of Greece, or the History of Greece in the Library of Useful Knowledge, and Heeren's Manual. It is expected of the students of Latin and Greek that they shall read in their rooms such authors and parts of authors, prescribed by the professor, as cannot be read in the lecture room: e. g.: Cicero's Epistles to Atticus, his Orations (selected,) and Treatise "de Republica;" Sallust, Virgil, Terence, Plautus: Ãschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Demosthenes, Ãschines, Thucydides, &amp;c. As an essential part of the plan of instruction, the students of each class are required to furnish written exercises; which consist in the conversion of Latin or Greek into English, and of English into Latin or Greek. The exercises are examined by the Professor, and the errors marked: they are then returned to the students, and the corrections stated and explained in the presence of the class. For these exercises the classic authors are used as the text. V. Hebrew.âThe text-books are Biblia Hebraica, Bush's or Nordheimer's Hebrew Grammar, and Gesenii Lexicon Manuale Hebr. et Chald., or Sauerwein's edition of Rehkopf's Lex. Hebr. Chald. II.âMODERN LANGUAGES. Professor Kraitsir.âThe subjects taught in this School are: I. The French, Italian, Spanish, German, and Anglo-Saxon languages and their literature. In each of these there are two classes. The instruction is given by lectures, examinations, translations and comments in the lecture room, and by written exercises out of the lecture room. II. The Geography, Ethnography, and History of Europe, since the fall of the Roman empire to the present day. If desired, there will be taught the other principal dialects of the three great families of European tongues, namely; 1st, the Roman (or language of the Troubadours), Portuguese and Valachian; 2d, the Danish, Swedish, Icelandish, and Hollandish; 3d, the Slavonian, Bohemian, Polish, and Russian. The Magyar (or Hungarian), differing from all these, can also be taught. The text-books are the principal classic authors in each language, Wm. Russell's History of Modern Europe, and Fred. Schlegel's Lectures on the History of Ancient and Modern Literature. It is required that two Degrees be obtained in this School, before that of A. M. will be conferred. III.âMATHEMATICS. Professor Courtenay.âIn this school there are four classes. Of these, the Junior commences with the theory of Arithmetic, the student being supposed to have rendered himself practically familiar with its various rules before entering the University. The elements of Algebra are then taught, and after the first difficulties are mastered, the subjects of Algebra and Synthetic Geometry, are pursued simultaneously. In the second or Intermediate Class, after completing the course of Algebra and Geometry, commenced in the preceding class, there are taught successively the theory of Plane and Spherical Trigonometry, with the application of the former to the measurement of heights and distances, and of the latter to Nautical Astronomy, the theory and practice of Land Surveying and Levelling, Navigation, Descriptive Geometry, with its applications to Spherical Projections, and the elementary principles of Analytical Geometry. The Senior Class completes the subject of Analytical Geometry, and subsequently studies the Differential Calculus, concluding the course of Pure Mathematics with the Integral Calculus. There is also a class of Mixed Mathematics, designed exclusively for such of the more advanced students as may desire to study the subjects taught therein. The course embraces the mathematical investigation of the general laws of equilibrium and motion, both of solids and fluids, with a variety of applications, especially to Physical Astronomy. It consists chiefly of selections from the works of Poisson, FrancÅur, Pontecoularet and others. The instruction in each class is conveyed partly by lectures, and partly by the systematic study of approved text-books, the student being assisted by full and frequent explanations from the Professor, and being constantly subjected to rigid examinations. The progress of the student in every class is also tested by his being required to perform written exercises, in which the principles acquired are applied to the solution of particular problems. The text-books used are: For the Junior Class, Lacroix's Arithmetic, Davies's Bourdon's Algebra, and Legendre's Geometry. For the Intermediate Class, Bourdon's Algebra, Legendre's Geometry and Trigonometry, Davies's Surveying, Descriptive Geometry and Analytical Geometry. For the Senior Class, Davies's Analytical Geometry, Young's Differential Calculus, and Young's Integral Calculus. Any student entering the school has the privilege of attending all or any of the classes, as he may elect, and if prepared to enter an advanced class, may often find it highly advantageous to review his previous studies by an attendance on a lower class also. IV.âNATURAL PHILOSOPHY. Professor Rogers.âThere are two classes in this school, viz: The general or Junior, and the Senior Class. In the former, the illustrations are experimental and graphical, with occasional references to the elementary truths of Geometry and Algebra. In the latter mathematical demonstration is almost exclusively employed, sometimes involving the use of the calculus. The various subjects embraced in this school are treated of in the following order, viz: Mechanics, including Statics, Dynamics, Laws of Impulse and Pressure, and Corpuscular Forces, Strength of Materials, Friction and Machinery; Astronomy; Hydrodynamics, including Hydrostatics, Hydraulics, Capillary Attraction, &amp;c.; Pneumatics; Acoustics; Heat, including Meteorology and the Steam Engine; Electricity and Galvanism; Magnetism; Electro-Magnetism; Optics. The text-books referred to in the Junior Class, are Lardner's Mechanics, Hydrostatics and Pneumatics; Brewster's Optics by Bache; Herschell's Astronomy; Library of Useful Knowledge, 2 vols. Nat. Philos. The text-books in the Senior Class are, in addition to those above enumerated, Young's Analytical Mechanics; Norton's Astronomy; Bache's Appendix to Brewster's Optics. The student is also referred to a selection of Theorems in Mechanics, Hydrodynamics, Pneumatics, &amp;c., made by the Professor. In the Senior Class the students are examined upon the subjects of lecture in the Junior Class, as well as the mathematical demonstrations referred to in their text-books and notes. The apparatus provided for the school of Natural Philosophy is extensive, and enables the Professor to illustrate every part of his course by experiments in the presence of his class. An Observatory, with its appropriate astronomical instruments, is attached to this school. Geology and Mineralogy form a part of the subjects embraced in this school. Members of the class of Natural Philosophy are entitled to enter that of Geology and Mineralogy without additional fee. In Geology the practical and descriptive portions of the Science are chiefly dwelt upon, particular reference being made to the geological features of our own country. In Mineralogy only those objects are treated of in detail which are interesting in an economical point of view, or important in connection with Geology. Text-books.âIn GeologyâLyell's Elements, and Bakewell or Dela Beche. In MineralogyâAllen's, Phillip's, or any of the elementary works. V.âCIVIL ENGINEERING. This school comprises the following branches of instruction, viz: I.âGraphical Mathematics, embracing Descriptive Geometry, Perspective Mensuration, &amp;c. II.âTheory of Levelling and Surveying, both ordinary and topographical. III.âTheory of Roads, Railroads, Canals, Bridges, &amp;c. IV.âTheoretical Mechanics, Hydrostatics and Hydrodynamics, as connected with Engineering. V.âLaws of Heat and Steam, Theory and Construction of the Steam Engine. VI.âGeology and Mineralogy. VII.âLevelling, Surveying, &amp;c., taught practically in the field. VIII.âPlan Drawing, Plotting, Topographical Drawing and Sketching. The subjects named under the six first heads are divided between the Professors of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. Those included under the 7th and 8th heads are taught by the Teacher of Drawing, under the superintendence of the Professor above mentioned. VI.âCHEMISTRY. Professor R. E. Rogers.âThis subject included in the medical as well as the general academic course, and forming a department of the school of Chemistry and Materia Medica, may be studied separately, or in conjunction with the latter. The Lectures, which are delivered twice a week throughout the session, embrace a very full illustration of all the topics of theoretical or practical importance in the science, and in its applications to Mineralogy, Geology, the Chemical Arts, Agriculture and Physiology. Beginning with an account of the phenomena and laws of Heat, Light and Electricity, Mechanical and Voltaic, the course next takes up the doctrines of chemical reaction, presenting a full and minute view of the principles of definite combination, with their hypothetical expression in the form of the atomic theory, and illustrating these doctrines by numerous experiments and drawings. To this succeeds Pneumatic Chemistry, in which are discussed the preparation, properties and applications of the various gaseous bodies and their compounds. This is followed by the detailed account of the metals, their oxides, chlorides, and other compounds, connecting with each metal the chemical history of its important salts. A resumÃ¨ is now given, accompanied by illustrations of the various processes of analysis deduced from the preceding facts. Organic Chemistry is next taken up, embracing an account of all the more important organic acids, alkaloids and neutral principles, together with a view of the alcaholic, acetous and putrefactive fermentation; the doctrine Eremacausis and the chemistry of nutrition, growth, respiration, &amp;c. as exhibited in the vegetable and animal economy. In connection with these topics, minute experimental illustrations are given of all the valuable processes for the detection of poisons, and for the counteracting their effects. Throughout the course, use is continually made of ample diagrams, illustrating the chemical reactions according to the precise method of equivalents now in use, and the bearings of the recent generalizations of Graham, Dumas and Leibig, are particularly referred to. VII.âMORAL PHILOSOPHY. Professor Tucker.âThere are two classes in this school. The Junior Class studies Rhetoric, Belles-Letters and Logic the first half of the session, and Belles-Letters and Ethics the last half. The Senior Class studies Mental Philosophy the first part of the session, and Political Economy the last. The examinations are on the Professor's Lectures, Brown's Philosophy, Say's Political Economy, Smith's Wealth of Nations, the Professor's works on Money and Banks, and Rents, Wages and Profits. In the Junior Class the examinations are on the Professor's Lectures, Blair's Lectures, Campbell's Rhetoric, Stewart's Active and Moral Powers, and Whately's Logic. The students in this school are also exercised in composition. VIII.âLAW. Professor H. St. G. Tucker.âThis school is arranged into two classes. The subjects studied by the Junior Class are the Elementary Principles of Municipal Law, the Law of Nature and Nations, the Science of Government, and Constitutional Law. The text books used will be Blackstone's Commentaries, that portion of Kent's Commentaries which treats of Constitutional Law and the Law of Nations, the Federalist, the Virginia Report of '99; in addition to which ample lectures are delivered on the connection between the Law of Nature and Municipal Law; on the Science of Government and its various forms, particularly the representative and federative; and on the various topics of Constitutional Law discussed in the text books. In the arrangement of the political part of this course, the Professor's object has been to lay before the student the most able dissertations on both sides of the great constitutional questions which have arisen in our country; to impress upon his mind the inestimable value of the union on the one hand, and the vital importance of preserving the rights of the states on the other; thus guarding him against latitudinarian constructions and the invasion of the reserved rights of the states, while the disorganizing principles which lead to convulsion and disunion are earnestly discarded and industriously controverted. The subjects studied by the Senior Class are the Common and Statute Law, the Principles of Equity and the Maritime and Commercial Law. The text books will be Stephens on Pleading, Tucker's Commentaries, Smith's Mercantile Law and Starkie's Evidence. The following additional works will be useful to the student for occasional examination: Thomas's Coke, Lomax on Executors and Lomax's Digest. Junior Class.âPaley's Philosophy, Constitution of Virginia. Those who desire to graduate are required to attend both classes. The design of this arrangement is to embrace in the Junior course those studies which not only form an essential part of a liberal professional education, but which from their universal interest and importance, constitute a highly useful branch of general education: whilst the Senior course is exclusively occupied with the study of the theory and practice of Law, as a profession. Students can attend either or both the classes; and those not wishing to study Municipal Law at all, can enter for that portion of the Junior course which includes National Law, Government and Constitutional Law. On the text books of both classes, comments are delivered by the Professor, in which it is his object to supply what is deficient, and explain what is obscure in the text, and to offer such remarks as he deems necessary to a thorough understanding of the subject under consideration. In those on Municipal Law, he refers to the leading cases and authorities, American and English, illustrative of the topic treated by the author, and particularly explains in its appropriate connection, the Statute Law of Virginia and the United States, and its effects on the pre-existing law. Each lecture is preceded by an examination on the last, together with its text. By a recent act of the legislature a diploma in this school dispenses with the necessity of a license from the judges. EXAMINATIONS. There are two public examinations of all the students each session, the one at such convenient time about the middle of the session as the Faculty shall appoint; the other at the close of the session. These are thus conducted: The Professor of the School prepares in writing a series of questions to be proposed to the class, and affixes to them numerical values, according to his estimate of their relative difficulty. On the assembling of the class for examination, these questions are for the first time presented to them; and they are required to answer them in writing in a prescribed time, without communication with one another or with other persons, and without any reference to books. Their answers are subsequently carefully examined and compared, and a value attached to each, not exceeding that of the corresponding question. In the schools of languages, subjects may also be selected for oral examination, and the values of these exercises are marked at the time. 3 The students are then arranged into four divisions according to the merit of their examination, as determined by the following method: The numerical values attached to all the questions are added together, and also the values of the answers given by each student. If this last number amounts to three fourths of the first, the student is ranked in the first division; if it be less than three fourths, and as much as one half, in the second; if less than one half, and as much as a fourth, in the third; if less than a fourth, in the fourth division. The examinations are conducted and the results ascertained by a committee, consisting of the Professor of the school and two other Professors. The standing of each student at the examinations is communicated to his parent or guardian; and the names of those who are in the first division are announced on the public day, at the close of the session, and published in one or more of the newspapers of the state. DEGREES. Three honorary distinctions are conferred in this Institution; a Certificate of Proficiencyâthat of Graduate in any schoolâand that of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia. The first, the Faculty may confer on any student who shall, on examination, give satisfactory evidence of a competent acquaintance with any of those particular branches which according to the regulations, may be separately attended in a school. The second, they are authorized to confer on any student who shall, on examination, give satisfactory evidence of his proficiency in the general studies of any of the schools. And the third, is obtained by graduation, in the schools of Ancient Languages, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and Moral Philosophy, and in any two of the Modern Languages. But in all cases, to obtain a diploma or certificate of proficiency, the candidate must give the Faculty satisfactory proof of his ability to write the English language correctly. No particular period of study is prescribed for the acquisition of these honours. The student obtains them whenever he can undergo the rigid examinations to which the candidates for them are subjected. The title of Doctor of Medicine is conferred on graduates in the Medical department, and that of Bachelor of Laws on graduates in the School of Law. On the last day of the session, the Visiters, Faculty, Officers, and Students, assemble in the Rotunda, and the public are invited to attend. On this occasion, the certificates and diplomas are awarded to the successful candidates, and the results of the examinations are announced. EXPENSES, &amp;c. The expenses for the session of upwards of nine months, (commencing the 1st of October, and ending the 4th of July following,) are as follows: Board, including bed and other room furniture, washing and attendance, 110 Fuel and candles, to be furnished by the Proctor, at cost, and 5 per cent. commission, estimated, if only one student in the dormitory, at $ 30, if two students in the dormitory, at 15 Rent of an entire dormitory $ 16; for half, if occupied by two students, 8 Use of the Library and public rooms, 15 Feesâif one Professor be attended, $ 50; if two, each $ 30; if more than two, each $ 25âsay, 75 Total, exclusive of books and stationery, clothing and pocket money, $ 223 In addition to the regular fee, $ 20 is paid by students who attend the Senior Class in the School of Law. The fee for attending the class of Materia Medica in the School of Chemistry; of Medical Jurisprudence in the School of Medicine; and of National Law, Government, and Constitutional Law, in the School of Law, by those who do not attend those schools, is $ 15 each. Ministers of the Gospel, and young men preparing for the ministry, may attend any of the schools of the University, without payment of fees to the Professors. Boarding-houses are provided within the precincts for the accommodation of students; and no student is permitted to board or lodge out of the precincts, unless in the family of his parent or guardian. Except, that students above the age of twenty-one years may reside out of the precincts, in such private boarding-houses as the Faculty may approve. Every student resident within the precincts, is required, on matriculating, to deposit with the Patron, all the money, checks, bills, drafts, and other available funds, which he shall have in his possession, or under his control, in any manner intended to defray his expenses while at the University, or on his return from thence to his residence. Nor shall he matriculate, till he shall have deposited a sum at least sufficient, after deducting the Patron's commission, (two per cent.) to pay for the use of his dormitory and the public rooms, to pay the fees of the Professors whom he may design to attend, to pay three months board to his hotel-keeper, to purchase the text-books and stationery which he may want at the commencement, and twenty dollars on account of fuel and candles, and ten dollars to cover contingent charges and assessments against him for injuries to the buildings, &amp;c., which two last mentioned sums are credited in the final settlement of his accounts. In like manner, he shall deposit with the Patron all the funds which he shall receive while a student of the University, for the purpose aforesaid. At the end of the first three months of the session, he shall deposit enough to pay his board and other expenses for the next three months; and at the expiration of the second period of three months, he shall deposit enough to pay his board and other expenses for the residue of the session. Students resident out of the University, are required on matriculating, to deposit with the Patron funds sufficient, after deducting the Patron's commission, to pay the fees of Professors whom they may propose to attend, the sum charged for the use of the public rooms, and ten dollars to cover contingent charges. The expenses of the students resident in the University, are limited as follows: for board, the use of the dormitory and public rooms, and tuition fees, the sums before stated; for clothing during the session, not exceeding a hundred dollars; for pocket money during the session, a sum not exceeding forty-five dollars; for books or stationery, whatever the parent or guardian may think fit to allow; for medicine and medical attendance whatever may be necessary. These are in no case to be exceeded, unless under special circumstances, the Faculty shall allow it. The act of the legislature prohibiting merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting students, is here strictly enforced. The license to contract debts which the Chairman is authorized to grant, is confined (except where the parent or guardian otherwise in writing, requests,) to cases of urgent necessity; and these, it is hoped that parents and guardians will, as far as possible, prevent from arising, by the timely supply of the requisite funds. The Faculty at their discretion, may allow any man, of undoubted moral character, above the age of twenty-three years, to attend lectures in any of the schools of the University, and to reside out of the precincts, exempt from the rules and regulations prescribed for the government of students; except only, that he shall pay the usual Professors' fees, and the usual compensation for the use of the public rooms, and shall observe all those laws of the Institution which enjoin respectful and orderly deportment. But the privilege so allowed may be withdrawn by the Faculty, at any time, when in their opinion it has been used to the evil example of the students, or otherwise to the injury of the Institution. At the end of every month, a circular letter is addressed by the Chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from the lectures he was bound to attend, and any other irregularities of which he may be guilty that month; together with such information as to the student's progress and conduct as it may be deemed proper to communicate. Divine service is performed at the University every Sunday, by the Chaplain, who is appointed in turn from the four principal religious denominations of the state.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. CHEMISTRY AND MATERIA MEDICA. Professor Ro. E. Rogers.âThis school is divided into two classes; one of Chemistry, the other of Materia Medica and Pharmacy. In the lectures on Chemistry, which are delivered twice a week throughout the session, all the important applications of the science to Pharmacy and Medicine are noticed and amply illustrated. In treating of the various Salts, Acids, &amp;c., their characters, properties and adulterations are considered, both as chemical and medicinal agents. The first part of the course is devoted to consideration of inorganic substances, and the laws of chemical combination; the subsequent lectures are appropriated to organic bodies, comprising the history, analysis and properties of animal and vegetable substances, with peculiar reference to the active principles most usually employed in Medicine. MEDICINE. Professor Howard.âThis school is composed of two classes; one of the Theory and Practice of Medicine and Obstetrics; the other of Medical Jurisprudence. To allow the student to attain proficiency in Anatomy and Physiology, Chemistry, Materia Medica and Therapeutics, before he is required to apply these branches in the study of Pathology and the practice of Medicine, the course is opened with Medical Jurisprudence and Obstetrics, both of which are completed before the lectures on the Theory and Practice of Medicine commence. The lectures on Medical Jurisprudence include a full consideration of the various topics on which medicine is called upon to aid in the administration of the laws, and the detection of crime, and are as well adapted to the Law Class as to that of Medicine. The lectures on Obstetrics comprehend an account of natural and other labours, and the professional assistance to be afforded in each; the treatment of the female before and after delivery, and the diseases of infancy. These lectures are amply illustrated by specimens and plates; and the application of instruments is exemplified on the improved phantome of the ingenious Hebermehl, upon which are taught the management of all cases of labour, natural or preternatural; a species of instruction which qualifies the student, when he enters on the practice of his profession, to rank, in this department, with practitioners of many years experience. The course on the Theory and Practice of Medicine is commenced with a description of the Ãtiology, Semeiology and Diagnosis of disease; then an exposition of the principles of Pathology and Therapeutics is given; after which, the functional and organic lesions of the various tissues and organs are successively considered, and their sympathetic relations and influences carefully explained: the subject of fevers is next treated on in much detail. By the adoption of this plan, the student becomes familiar with the local and general phenomena attendant on particular lesions, before he is called on to investigate the nature and treatment of the complicated groups of symptoms included in febrile diseases. Text Books.âOn Medical JurisprudenceâBeck, and the Professor's Outlines of Med. Juris. On ObstetricsâMeigs's Velpeau. On the Theory and Practice of MedicineâDunglison's Practice, and Bell's and Stokes's Lectures. ANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY AND SURGERY. Professor Cabell.âThe lectures on Anatomy will be illustrated by the demonstration of artificial skeletons, wet and dry preparations lately procured in Paris, and especially by careful dissections of fresh subjects, with which the school is abundantly supplied. After a thorough investigation of the structure and anatomical relations of every part of a system or apparatus of organs associated in action, the attention of the student will be directed to the physiology of their functions, by an examination of their mode of accomplishment, their uses in the economy, their dependence upon external and other influences, and the sympathies of the organs which execute them. While teaching Surgical Anatomy, the Professor instructs his class in the use of instruments by performing the various surgical operations on the dead body, and affords the students who desire it, an opportunity of repeating these operations under his superintendence. The course of lectures on Surgery will commence about the 1st March, and will embrace a description of the pathology, symptoms and treatment of all the diseases usually assigned to this branch of the healing art. Text Books.âPancoast's edition of Wistar's Anatomy, Dunglison's Human Physiology, Cooper's Surgical Dictionary. The organization of the Medical Department of the University of Virginia having been framed with a view to incorporate with the system of instruction by public lectures the important advantages of private pupilage, presents peculiarities to be found in no other School of Medicine in the Union. It would be needless to detail the circumstances by which the University has been enabled to secure to Virginia and to the South generally, all the benefits of a school so advantageously organized, but it is deemed right after several years of successful operation, during which nearly 700 medical students have been educated, that the public should be made acquainted with the peculiarities of a plan which ample experience has shewn to be admirably calculated to fulfil the intentions of its founders. 1. Unlike other Medical Schools, the session is of the same length as the academic session, nine months, and but two lectures are delivered on the same day. This arrangement, while it enables three Professors to perform all the duties which in other schools, with shorter sessions, are assigned to six, affords the student unusual facilities for gradually acquiring, and thereby digesting, the information conveyed to him by oral instruction, without that confusion of thought, and fatigue of mind, which are inevitable when, as always happens in city schools, he has to encounter daily six or seven lectures delivered in rapid succession. 2. Immediately before each lecture the students are subjected to a full and rigid examination on the subject of the preceding lecture, or on portions of some approved text-book. This practice of daily examinations, constituting one of the peculiar features in the organization of this school, enables the Professors to explain both the obscurities of the text, and such parts of their lectures as may appear to be imperfectly understood by the class, and thus supplies the student with a most valuable means of fixing in his mind correct information, while it has an incidental advantage in familiarizing him with the mode of trial to which he is subjected in his final examination for graduation. 3. The length of the session renders practicable such a division of the subjects of study, that the student has an opportunity of being well grounded in the elementary branches of medical science before he is required to listen to discourses on more complicated subjects. It is, then, apparent, that this institution offers to students of medicine facilities not found in other schools for commencing as well as completing the study of their profession, while its connexion with a general University, and its other features as already adverted to, will afford them the most favourable opportunities for laying the foundation of a liberal scientific and professional education. 4. Any person of approved moral conduct may offer as a candidate for graduation, and receive the degree of M. D. without reference to the time he has been engaged in the study of Medicine, or of joining the school, provided he undergoes in a satisfactory manner the various examinations prescribed by the enactments. 5. Connected with the Medical School, is an Anatomical and Pathological Museum, which has been lately enriched with valuable and rare specimens selected in Paris by one of the Professors. An annual appropriation is allowed by the authorities of the University for the purpose of procuring subjects, so that ample means for the study of Practical Anatomy are thus afforded to each student at the trifling cost of $ 5. The students have ready access to the Public Library, containing in its medical department most of the standard works of the profession, and several sets of splendid Anatomical Plates. 7. The expenses for the entire session of nine months, commencing on the first of October, are limited to $ 228âa sum not exceeding that which is paid for a session of four months in city schools. It provides for board, including bed and other room furniture, washing and attendanceâfuel and candlesârent of dormitoryâuse of library and other public roomsâfees to the Professorsâdissecting fees and subjects for dissection. As the Philadelphia and other city schools require as a condition for graduation that the candidate shall have attended two full courses of lectures, and recognize one course in this institution as equivalent to one of their own, students who wish to take their diplomas in Philadelphia, will yet find an advantage in availing themselves, for the first session, of the peculiar benefits of a school organized on the plan above described.</field>
