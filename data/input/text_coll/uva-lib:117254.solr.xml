      <field name="fulltext">HISTORICAL SKETCH. INTRODUCTION. HISTORICAL SKETCH. By an act of the Legislature of Virginia, dated January 12, 1803, certain citizens of Albemarle County were incorporated under the style of "Trustees of Albemarle Academy," and were empowered to take such steps as seemed practicable to raise the funds necessary for erecting buildings and putting the Academy into operation Albemarle Academy was destined never to exist except on paper, but under the guidance of Thomas Jefferson, who was elected to the board of trustees on March 23, 1814, a process of development was begun leading first to the organization of Central College, and afterwards to that of the University of Virginia. On August 19, 1814, the committee of the trustees appointed to select a site, reported that it would be desirable to locate the Academy in the vicinity of the town of Charlottesville, distant not more than half a mile therefrom. By an act of February 14, 1816, the Legislature authorized the establishment of "Central College, in the County of Albemarle, at the place which has been, or shall be, selected by the trustees of Albemarle Academy, and in lieu of such Academy." All rights and claims of Albemarle Academy were, by the same act, vested in Central College. The board of visitors of the College consisted of six members, of whom Jefferson was the only one who had been a member of the Academy board. The other five members were James Madison, James Monroe, Joseph Carrington Cabell, David Watson, and John H. Cocke. On May 5, 1817, Jefferson was elected Rector of the board, and, on the same day, the board authorized the purchase of a farm of about two hundred acres lying one mile west of Charlottesville as a site for the College. This tract now forms a part of the grounds of the University of Virginia. The cornerstone of Central College was laid on October 6, 1817, in the presence of Thomas Jefferson, Rector, and of James Madison and James Monroeâthe latter then President of the United States. This building, located on what is known as the West Lawn of the University, is now utilized as the Colonnade Club. Jefferson's plan was to erect a distinct building, a "pavilion," for each individual professorâthe buildings to be arranged around a rectangular lawn. Each pavilion was to contain "a schoolroom and apartments for the accommodation of the professor," and one-story dormitories for the students were to be erected adjacent to the pavilions. Jefferson drew most of the sketches for the buildings with his own hands, basing them upon designs by Palladio; and his ideas of architectural effect and grouping were carried out in detail when Central College was merged into the University of Virginia. HISTORICAL SKETCH. The prime object in Jefferson's mind, while Rector of the board of visitors of Central College, was to get the college well under way, and then have it adopted by the Legislature as the State University. Accordingly, in the first report of the visitors to the Legislature, on January 6, 1818, it is recommended that a state university be established on the site of Central College. By an act of February 21, 1818, the Legislature authorized the appointment by the Governor of a board of twenty-four members, to be known as the "Board of Commissioners of the University." It was the duty of this board to meet on August 1, 1818, at the Tavern in Rockfish Gap, on the Blue Ridge Mountains, and report upon the following points regarding the organization of a state university: 1. A proper site for the projected university. 2. A plan for the building thereof. 3. The branches of learning which should be taught therein. 4. The number and description of professorships; and 5. Such general provisions as might properly be enacted by the Legislature for the better organizing and governing of the University. Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe were present at the meeting of the Commissioners, and their able and elaborate report to the Legislature (indicating much careful thought) had probably been prepared by Jefferson before the meeting was held. This report, recommending, among other things, the site of Central College as the most advantageous one for the University, was forwarded in duplicate to the Speaker of the House and the Speaker of the Senate on August 4, 1818. On January 25, 1819, the Legislature adopted a formal act "for establishing an university," and this date must be reckoned as the year of the origin of the University, although the institution was not opened to students until March 7, 1825. Although Jefferson's was the dominant spirit and the shaping hand in the whole movement for the establishment of a state university, it should be stated that but for the influence and efforts of Joseph Carrington Cabell, the close personal friend of Jefferson, the acts of February 21, 1818, and January 25, 1819, would probably have failed of adoption by the Legislature. The act of January 25, 1819, establishing the University, is as follows (Revised Code, 1819, ch. 34, p. 90): "1. Be it declared by the General Assembly of Virginia, That the conveyance of the lands and other property appertaining to the Central College in the County of Albemarle, which has been executed by the proctor thereof, under authority of the subscribers and founders, to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund, is hereby accepted, for the use and on the conditions in the said deed of conveyance expressed. "2. And be it enacted, That there shall be established, on the site provided for the said College, an university, to be called the University of Virginia; that it shall be under the government of seven visitors to be appointed HISTORICAL SKETCH. forthwith by the Governor, with the advice of Council, notifying thereof the persons so appointed, and prescribing to them a day for their first meeting at the said University, with supplementary instructions for procuring a meeting subsequently, in the event of failure at the time first appointed. "3. The said visitors, or so many of them as, being a majority, shall attend, shall appoint a rector, of their own body, to preside at their meetings, and a secretary to record, attest, and preserve their proceedings, and shall proceed to examine into the state of the property conveyed as aforesaid; shall make an inventory of the same, specifying the items whereof it consists; shall notice the buildings and other improvements already made, and those which are in progress; shall take measures for their completion, and for the addition of such others, from time to time, as may be necessary. "4. In the said University shall be taught the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages; French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Anglo-Saxon; the different branches of Mathematics, pure and physical; natural philosophy; the principles of agriculture; chemistry; mineralogy, including geology; botany, zoÃ¶logy; anatomy; medicine; civil government; political economy; the law of nature and nations; municipal law; history; ideology; general grammar; ethics; rhetoric; and belles lettres; which branches of science shall be so distributed, and under so many professors, not exceeding ten, as the visitors shall think proper and expedient. "5. Each professor shall be allowed the use of the apartments and accommodations provided for him, and those first employed such standing salary as the visitors shall think proper and sufficient, and their successors such standing salary, not exceeding one thousand dollars, as the visitors shall think proper and sufficient, with such tuition fees from each student as the visitors shall from time to time establish. "6. The said visitors shall be charged with the erection, preservation, and repair of the buildings, the care of the grounds and appurtenances, and of the interests of the University generally; they shall have power to appoint a bursar, employ a proctor, and all other necessary agents; to appoint and remove professors, two-thirds of the whole number of visitors voting for the removal; to prescribe their duties and the course of education, in conformity with the law; to establish rules for the government and discipline of the students, not contrary to the laws of the land; to regulate tuition fees, and the rent of the dormitories occupied; to prescribe and control the duties and proceedings of all officers, servants, and others, with respect to the buildings, lands, appurtenances, and other property and interests of the University; to draw from the literary funds such monies as are by law charged on it for this institution; and, in general, to direct and do all matters and things which, not being inconsistent with the laws of the land, to them shall seem most expedient for promoting the purposes of said institution; which several functions they shall be free to exercise HISTORICAL SKETCH. in the form of by-laws, resolutions, orders, instructions, or otherwise, as they shall deem proper. "7. They shall have two stated meetings in every year, to-wit, on the first Mondays of April and October; and occasional meetings at such other times as they shall appoint, or on a special call, with such notice as themselves shall prescribe by a general rule, which meetings shall be at the University, a majority of them constituting a quorum for business; and on the death, resignation of a member, or failure to act for the space of one year, or on his removal out of the Commonwealth, or by the Governor, with the advice of Council, the Governor with the like advice shall appoint a successor. "8. The said rector and visitors shall be a body corporate, under the style and title of `The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia,' with the right, as such, to use a common seal; they shall have capacity to plead and be impleaded in all courts of justice, and in all cases interesting to the University, which may be subjects of legal cognizance and jurisdiction; which pleas shall not abate by the determination of their office, but shall stand revived in the name of their successors; and they shall be capable in law, and in trust for the University, of receiving subscriptions and donations, real and personal, as well from bodies corporate or persons associated, as from private individuals. "9. And the said rector and visitors shall, at all times, conform to such laws as the legislature may from time to time, think proper to enact for their government; and the said University shall in all things, and at all times, be subject to the control of the legislature. And the said Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia shall be, and they are hereby, required to make report annually to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund (to be laid before the legislature at the next succeeding session), embracing a full account of the disbursements, the funds on hand, and a general statement of the condition of said University. "10. The said board of visitors, or a majority thereof, by nomination of the board, shall, once in every year at least, visit the said University; enquire into the proceedings and practices thereat; examine the progress of the students, and give to those who excel in every branch of science there taught, such honorary marks and testimonials of approbation as may encourage and incite to industry and emulation. "11. On every twenty-ninth day of February, or, if that be Sunday, then on the next, or earliest day thereafter on which a meeting can be effected, the Governor and Council shall be in session, and shall appoint visitors of the said University, either the same or others at their discretion, to serve until the twenty-ninth day of February next ensuing, duly and timely notifying to them their appointment, and prescribing a day for their first meeting at the University; after which, their meetings, stated and occasional, shall be as hereinbefore provided: Provided, that nothing in this act contained shall suspend the proceedings of the visitors of the said HISTORICAL SKETCH. Central College of Albemarle; but for the purpose of expediting any objects of said institution, they shall be authorized, under the control of the Governor and Council, to continue the exercise of their functions, and fulfil those of their successors, until the first actual meeting of their said successors. "12. And be it further enacted, That the additional sum of twenty thousand dollars shall be, and the same is hereby, appropriated to the education of the poor, out of the revenue of the literary fund, in the aid of the sum heretofore appropriated to that object, and to be paid in the same manner and upon the same conditions in all respects as is prescribed by the fourth section of the act entitled `An act appropriating part of the revenue of the literary fund, and for other purposes, passed the twenty-first day of February, eighteen hundred and eighteen.' "13. This act shall commence and be in force from and after the passing thereof." The first Board of Visitors consisted of four members of the old board of Central Collegeânamely, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Joseph Carrington Cabell, and John H. Cocke; the additional appointees were James Breckenridge, Chapman Johnson, and Robert Taylor. The board met for the first time on March 29, 1819, and elected Thomas Jefferson rector. Henceforth, until his death in 1826, Jefferson was the dominating and directing power of the University, not only evolving the entire system of education introduced, but actually devising, to the minutest detail, every feature of construction and administration. The organization of the University, its government, discipline, and methods of instruction, were virtually prescribed by Jefferson alone; and in many respects they still retain the impression derived from him. By virtue of its charter, the supreme government of the institution, under the General Assembly, is vested in the Rector and Visitors. Under the general direction of this board, and subject to its regulations, the affairs of the University were administered, for the first eighty years of its existence, by the Faculty and its chairman, the latter being a member of the faculty, who occupied temporarily the position of chief executive officer of the institution. As the University grew, it became more and more difficult for a member of the teaching staff to fill the position of Chairman, and attend to the manifold executive duties attached to that office. In October, 1903, the Visitors decided that modern conditions rendered necessary the creation of the office of president; and in June, 1904, Edwin Anderson Alderman was elected first president of the University of Virginia. The scheme of instruction organized by Jefferson contemplated no fixed uniform curriculum of studies to be pursued by every student alike, without discrimination. Each distinct branch of knowledge was, as far as was practicable, assigned to an individual "School" with its own instructors; and the University was to consist of a collection of independent HISTORICAL SKETCH. Schools. The origin of the elective system at the University of Virginia is found in the fact that students were permitted to matriculate in any School or Schools of the University for which they were prepared. The wisdom of the Founder in establishing such a system has been amply vindicated in the history of this university and in the adoption by almost all schools of higher education in the country of methods involving this principle. The original organization embraced eight independent Schoolsâ namely, Ancient Languages, Modern Languages, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Moral Philosophy, Chemistry, Medicine, and Law. The first seven Schools mentioned were opened to matriculates on March 7, 1825, with an aggregate attendance, during the first session, of 123 students. The School of Law was not opened until 1826. This original organization was gradually enlarged and modified. As early as 1837 the School of Medicine was elevated to a Department, consisting of three individual Schools; while in 1850 the School of Law was enlarged to a Department consisting of two Schools. Other Departments and Schools have been added from time to time. A most notable addition was made in May, 1909, when, through a gift from Mr. Andrew Carnegie to the General Alumni Association, six new Schools were established by joint action of the Rector and Visitors and the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund: The Andrew Carnegie School of Engineering, The James Madison School of Law, The James Monroe School of International Law, The James Wilson School of Political Economy, The Edgar Allan Poe School of English, The Walter Reed School of Pathology. In April, 1919, was founded through the generous gift of Mr. Paul Goodloe McIntire, the McIntire School of Fine Arts, embracing instruction in Art, Architecture and Music. It was provided by the first Board of Visitors, in accordance with Jefferson's wishes, that but two degrees should be conferred by the University. The lower degree, characteristic of the institution for many years, was conferred upon a student who had completed all the work offered in any one School; to such a candidate the untitled degree of "Graduate" in the School in question should be given. The other, the higher degree, was to be the doctor's degree and was to be given to the graduate in two or more Schools who had, in addition, exhibited well-developed powers of research. There is abundant evidence that, in planning the organization of the University of Virginia, Thomas Jefferson had in mind the so-called continental type of university. The first faculty were, however, with one or two exceptions, Oxford or Cambridge men. Naturally they had in mind the English type of university, and the result was that in 1831 the faculty substituted for the doctor's degree proposed by Jefferson, the master's degree, common in England. The degree of "Master of Arts of the University of Virginia" was accordingly, for more than half a century, the leading degree conferred by this institution. HISTORICAL SKETCH. THE HONOR SYSTEM. For eighteen years after the opening of the institution, written examinations were conducted under the surveillance of a committee of three professors. This was not altogether satisfactory, and in June, 1842, Judge Henry St. George Tucker, Professor of Law, offered the following resolution, which the Faculty at once adopted: Resolved, That in all future written examinations for distinction and other honors of the University, each candidate shall attach to the written answers presented by him on such examination a certificate in the following words: "I, A. B., do hereby certify, on honor, that I have derived no assistance during the time of this examination from any source whatever, whether oral, written, or in print, in giving the above answers." This was the beginning of the honor system at this institution, and it has been in operation ever since without interruption. Later the pledge was extended so as to preclude the giving as well as the receiving of assistance. Still more recently the scope of the honor system has been enlarged so as to cover other phases of student conduct. Its administration is entirely in the hands of the students, the essence of the system being that the violation of a student's word of honor is an offense not against the university authorities, but against the whole student body, and on the rare occasions on which it has occurred, the students themselves have quietly and promptly sent the offender away from the University without need of faculty action. Examinations are required to be held in one place and in the presence of the professor in charge of the course or one of his assistants. These regulations in no way conflict with the spirit of the honor system, but are regarded as being necessary to give a proper dignity and formality to the occasion.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. For admission to any department of the University, the general conditions are the following: 1. Sufficient Age.âThe minimum legal age is sixteen years; the faculty advise seventeen or more. Nineteen years is the minimum for admission to the Department of Law. 2. Good Character.âThis must be attested by a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended, or by other valid proof. 3. Adequate Preparation.âThis must be such as will enable the candidate to meet the requirements for admission to the several departments of the University, as detailed below. For admission to the Department of Graduate Studies, see page 178. For admission to the Department of Law, see page 246. For admission to the Department of Medicine, see page 262. For admission to the College, the Department of Education, or the Department of Engineering, the candidate must present a certificate or pass an equivalent examination. In either case the amount of preparation required is measured in terms of units. A unit represents a year's study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year's work. This definition of a unit takes the four-year high-school course as a basis and assumes that the length of the school year is from thirty-six to forty weeks, that a period is from forty to sixty minutes in length, and that the study is pursued for four or five periods a week; but under ordinary circumstances a satisfactory year's work in any subject cannot be accomplished in less than one hundred and twenty hours, or their equivalent. Schools organized on any other than a four-year basis can, nevertheless, estimate their work in terms of this unit. For the requirements as to the number and selection of the units required for entrance, see, for the College, page 164; for the Department of Education, page 187; for the Department of Engineering, page 205. Admission of Women.âThe admission of women to the several departments of the University is subject to the following conditions: 1. General Requirements: The applicant must be at least twenty years old on the birthday preceding matriculation; must present a certificate showing graduation from an accredited public high school, or not less than four years' attendance in an accredited private-school, with credit for not less than 15 college entrance units obtained at least two years before admission to the University; and must in addition show by proper certificate the completion in a standard college, subsequent to the credit obtained for 15 entrance-units, of at least 30 session-hours, (60 semester hours), of courses of college grade, in not less than eighteen calendar months. 2. Specific Departmental Requirements: These will be found in the requirements for admission to each of the several departments. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. SUBJECTS ACCEPTED FOR ADMISSION. The subjects accepted for admission and their values in units are given below in tabulated form. Fuller definitions of the units may be had upon application to the Dean. Subject Topics Units English A Grammar and Grammatical Analysis 1 English B Composition and Rhetoric 1 English C Critical Study of Specimens of English Literature 1 English D Critical Study of Specimens of English Literature 1 Mathematics A1 Algebra to Quadratic Equations 1 Mathematics A2 Quadratics, Progressions, and the Binomial Formula Â½ or 1 Mathematics B Plane Geometry 1 Mathematics C Solid Geometry Â½ Mathematics D Plane Trigonometry Â½ History A Greek and Roman History 1 History B Medieval and Modern European History 1 History C English History 1 History D American History and Civil Government 1 Latin A Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Latin B Caesar's Gallic War, I-IV; Grammar; Composition 1 Latin C Cicero's Orations (6); Grammar; Composition 1 Latin D Virgil's Ãneid, I-VI; Grammar; Composition 1 Greek A Elementary Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Greek B Xenophon's Anabasis, 1-VI; Grammar; Composition 1 Greek C Homer's Iliad, I-III; Grammar; Composition 1 German A Elementary Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 German B Intermediate Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 German C Third-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 German D Fourth-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 French A Elementary Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 French B Intermediate Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 French C Third-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 French D Fourth-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Spanish A Elementary Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Spanish B Intermediate Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Spanish C Third-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Spanish D Fourth-year Grammar, Composition, and Translation 1 Science A Physical Geography 1 Science B Inorganic Chemistry 1 Science C Experimental Physics 1 Science D Botany Â½ Science E Zoology Â½ Vocational Subjects (Not more than four Units) Manual Training Mechanical and Projection Drawing Â½ to 1 Free-Hand Drawing Â½ to 1 Shop-Work Â½ to 4 Agriculture (Accredited Agricultural Schools) 1 to 4 Commercial Subjects Commercial Geography Â½ Shorthand Â½ to 1 Typewriting Â½ Bookkeeping 1 Commercial Arithmetic Â½ to 1 ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. ADMISSION BY CERTIFICATE. For admission by certificate, the applicant should file with the Dean of the University not later than September 1 a Certificate of Preparation, made out on the blank form furnished by the University. This certificate must come from a recognized institution of collegiate rank, from an accredited public high school, or from an accredited private secondary school. The candidate for admission from a public high school must be a graduate of an accredited four-year high school. The candidate for admission from a private secondary school must be a graduate of the school, or must present a certificate showing that he has completed at least the equivalent of four years of satisfactory high-school work of standard grade, covering at least fifteen entrance units. In every case the candidate for admission must have the recommendation of the principal of the certifying school. Private secondary schools in Virginia are accredited by the faculty of this university after inspection and report by a committee of the faculty. (see page 105.) The university also accredits all four year public high schools which are fully accredited by the State Board of Education of Virginia. The Dean of the University is further authorized to accept certificates from schools outside Virginia, accredited by their own state universities or institutions of equal rank, or by their own state departments of education, provided the courses of study offered in such schools meet the requirements demanded of accredited schools in this state. If in any accredited school the number of periods given to a study, or the length of the period, is below the specified standard, the credit for such subject is reduced pro rata. In the science subjects only half-credit is allowed unless individual laboratory notebooks, properly attested by the teacher in charge, are filed with the certificate. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must in all cases take the entrance examinations. ADMISSION BY EXAMINATION. For admission by examination, the candidate must present himself at the University in June or in September, according to the dates given in the Program of Entrance Examinations. The examinations are held under the honor system, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge. All candidates who take their examinations at the times appointed are tested free of charge. In case of delayed entrance, where the grounds of postponement are good, the President of the University may admit the candidate to a special examination, for which a fee of five dollars is charged. This fee is payable in advance, and is in no case returned. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. PROGRAM OF ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS. June, 1924 9-11 A. M. 11 A. M.-1 P. M. 3-5 P. M.

      <field name="fulltext">ACCREDITED SCHOOLS. ACCREDITED SCHOOLS. Conditions for the Accrediting of Private Secondary Schools.âA school desiring to be placed on the accredited list of the University should apply to the Chairman of the Committee on Accredited Schools. In response to the application, a blank form inquiring into the course of study, faculty, etc., of the school will be sent to the principal. Upon the return of this blank, properly filled out, a representative of the University will be sent to inspect the school, and to report on such matters as the quality of instruction, the general intellectual and moral tone of the school, and the efficiency of the equipment, especially library and laboratory facilities. If his report is favorable and the Committee concurs, the school will be accepted and the principal duly notified. The name of the school will be entered upon the list of accredited schools and published in the catalogue of the University. Each school must meet the following requirements: (1) A course of study covering not less than four years of high-school work, based on at least seven years of competent elementary instruction, and embracing at least sixteen units. These sixteen units must include English A, B, C, Mathematics A1, A2, B, and one unit of History. Those schools that wish to prepare students for the study of Latin in the University must offer instruction in this subject to the extent of four units. (2) A teaching force of not less than three teachers, each of whom devotes his entire time to high-school instruction, and conducts not more than six recitation periods a day. The University will scrutinize with extreme care any school in which any instructor teaches more than six periods a day. All teachers should possess college training, and preference will be given to those schools in which the teachers are college graduates. Accrediting of Public High Schools.âThe University accredits all four year public high schools which are fully accredited by the State Board of Education of Virginia. List of Accredited Private Secondary Schools.âThe following is a list of the private secondary schools within the State of Virginia at present accredited by the University. This list is revised annually by the Committee, and any school which fails to report to the Committee when requested to do so, or which fails to maintain the standard above specified, may be removed therefrom: Augusta Military Academy (Fort Defiance). Benedictine College (Richmond). Blackstone Military Academy. ACCREDITED SCHOOLS. Chatham Training School. Daleville Academy (Daleville). Danville Military Institute.

      <field name="fulltext">REGULATIONS. REGULATIONS. REGISTRATION. Registration of New Students.âApplicants seeking admission to the University for the first time must present themselves to the Dean of the University at some time during the first three days of the session. Registration of Matriculated Students.âStudents who have previously been matriculated as members of the University must present themselves to the deans of their respective departments upon one of the first three days of the session. Delayed Registration.âAny student who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session will not be admitted unless he can explain his delay in a manner satisfactory to the President, and will be charged a delayed registration fee. Admission to the College during the Session.âNo applicant for admission to the College who has not been previously registered therein will be admitted after the middle of the first term, unless the Committee on Entrance Requirements is satisfied that, in view of his record, he is likely to prove an acceptable student. Registration after the Christmas Recess.âOn the first week-day after the Christmas Recess, every student is required to register by attending all the classes or laboratory exercises at which he is due that day. No further formality is necessary. Any student failing to register thus will be required to pay the delayed registration fee, and will be liable to whatever penalties may be imposed by his professors for unexcused absences. But if the delay is due to illness or other providential cause, the dean is authorized to remit the fee and to notify the professors concerned that the student's absences have been satisfactorily explained. RESIDENCE AND ATTENDANCE. The Academic Year begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September and continues for thirty-nine weeks. Thanksgiving Day and Jefferson Day are holidays, and there is a Christmas recess beginning on the last week-day before the twenty-third of December and closing on the evening of the second of January. Attendance is required of each student throughout the entire session, with the exception of holidays, unless he has received written permission to be temporarily absent, or to withdraw before the close of the session. While in residence each student is required to attend regularly all lectures and other prescribed exercises in the courses which he pursues, or else suffer such penalties as his professors may impose for unexcused absences. REGULATIONS. Leave of Absence from the University is granted for sufficient reason by the dean of the department in which the student is registered, and must in every case be obtained in advance. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or other student organizations on excursions will not be granted except to the officers and members of these organizations. The laws relating to absence from the University of members of the athletic teams are found on page 306. The same regulations apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University and the dean of the department in which the student is registered. For the conditions governing the return of fees upon withdrawal, see page 110. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the several departmental faculties for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also the regulations as to delinquent students in the various departments. Absence from Examinations.âWritten examinations are an essential part of the work of every course in the University, and attendance upon them is required of every student. Absence may be excused only on the ground of sickness on the day of the examination (attested by a physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause which may be approved by the several faculties of the University. Special Examinations are granted only upon prompt application therefor, and in case the applicant's absence from the regular examination has been excused. See the preceding paragraph. Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the Honor System, and an unpledged paper is counted as a total failure. In matters of class standing as well, students are expected to regard themselves as governed by the law of honor. CONDUCT. The laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the University precincts or not. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University any student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The keeping of dogs by students within the university grounds is forbidden. Prohibition of Credit.âAn act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting minor students. The license to contract debts, which the President is authorized to grant, is limited REGULATIONS. (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity. DORMITORIES AND BOARD. Dormitories.âStudents may reside in the university dormitories, in their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. The President will withdraw from the approved list any house in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Any change of residence during the session should be reported at the office of the Registrar. For rules governing the rental and occupancy of university dormitories, and the rates charged for the same, see page 113. For list of private lodging houses, with rates, apply to the Bursar. Board.âStudents may board at the University Cafeteria, at their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. For cost of board at the Cafeteria, see page 113. For list of private boarding houses, with rates, apply to the Bursar. MEDICAL ATTENDANCE AND PHYSICAL TRAINING. Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the University Physician; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for his maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, treatment of the eye, ear, nose and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of students, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Students who take the responsibility of boarding at houses not approved by the Board of Health forfeit the right of medical attendance. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the University Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. Physical Training.âNo student is permitted to undertake an amount of work greater than he may reasonably be expected to carry without detriment to his health; and every student is advised to take a due amount of daily outdoor exercise, for which ample opportunities are afforded by the athletic fields, the tennis courts, the golf course, and elsewhere; and, in addition, to make systematic use of the facilities afforded without cost for definite and judicious physical training at the gymnasium under the advice and instruction of the director and his assistants. For the regular course in Physical Training with credit value toward academic degrees, see page 159. Further information upon the equipment and policy of the University in the matter of Physical Training and Athletics will be found on page 301.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EXPENSES. EXPENSES. Payment of Fees.âWhen the aggregate charge for University fee, tuition fee, laboratory fees and room rent does not exceed $50 for the session, the total amount shall be paid upon registration. If said fees aggregate more than $50, but do not exceed $100, one-half thereof shall be paid upon registration and the remainder at the beginning of the second term. When the fees aggregate more than $100, payment shall be made one-third upon registration; one-third at the opening of the second term and the remainder at the opening of the third term. If any payment remain unpaid for fifteen days after the date on which it is due, the Bursar shall immediately notify the Dean of the department in which such student is entered of the delinquency, and such student shall by him be required to at once cease attending lectures, using laboratories, library, gymnasium, athletic grounds or buildings, boarding at the dining hall, and making use of any other privileges as a student until his financial relations with the University have been arranged satisfactorily with the Bursar.

Every graduate student in Chemistry is expected to carry on research. No special courses are listed, as the nature of the work and the credit received, will vary with the time spent upon it, the previous training of the student and the degree for which the student is applying. At present researches are under way in the laboratory in the fields of catalysis; adsorption; organic equilibria; ionic equilibria; photochemistry; colloid chemistry; rate of flow of gases; organic synthesis, and other problems in organic chemistry. The Chemical Journal Club will meet once a week (hour to be arranged) for the critical review and discussion of various topics of interest in current chemical literature and of such chemical researches as are in progress in the University. All members of the teaching staff and advanced students in chemistry are expected to participate in these meetings and to take part in the discussions. The privileges of the club are extended to all members of the University and others who are interested in the progress of Chemistry. The Chemical Laboratory, recently completed, is of brick, fire-proof construction, and the three floors afford 30,000 square feet of space. The seven larger laboratories will accomodate 625 students, and, in addition to these there are smaller laboratories for the use of the instructors and advanced students. There are also rooms for assay furnaces, gas and water analysis, photography, etc. The equipment is satisfactory for purposes of both instruction and research. The laboratory maintains a working library containing about 4,000 volumes directly relating to chemistry as well as complete files of the more important periodicals. SCHOOL OF COMMERCE.

      <field name="fulltext">THE COLLEGE. THE COLLEGE. Edwin Anderson Alderman, Ph.B., D.C.L., LL.D. President James Morris Page, M.A., Ph.D., LL.D. Dean ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. The general requirements for admission to the University may be found on page 101. For admission to the College, the candidate should possess an amount of preparation which is at least the equivalent of that represented by four years of successful work in an accredited school. He must offer, either by certificate or by examination (see page 103), fifteen units, of which three must be in English, two and one-half in Mathematics (one and one-half in algebra, one in plane geometry), and one in History. The remaining eight and one-half units may be selected at will from the list on page 102, but no credit will be given for less than two units in any foreign language. Candidates who expect to apply for the degree of B.S. in Architecture should offer Solid Geometry and Physics if possible. In addition to the above, each candidate must pass at the University a qualifying examination in English before his registration can be completed. This examination will be held on the Tuesday of the first week of the session. Advanced Standing is given to any candidate who, in addition to meeting the minimum requirements for entrance above stated, can show by passing an examination given sometime during the first month of his first session that he has done work equivalent to that covered by any of the following courses offered in the college: Latin A1, Greek A1, Greek A2, English A1 or A2 or A3, German A1, Mathematics A1, French A, Spanish A. Candidates who apply for examination for advanced standing must present a special certificate showing that the full content of the course, on which advanced standing is sought, has been covered in a systematic manner in the preparatory school, and in addition must present the specific recommendation of the principal of the school that the candidate be admitted to the advanced standing examination in question. This examination will be held on the Tuesday of the week during which entrance examinations are held. College Credit.âCandidates who desire credit for work done at other colleges, must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students, and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the College a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college, must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate, and must give his grades. The final validation of such certificates is effected by the successful completion of not less than 12 session-hours of work during his first session. In no case will credit THE COLLEGE. be given on more than forty-five session-hours of work done elsewhere, and any candidate who receives this maximum amount of credit can count among the remaining fifteen session-hours required for his degree only the credit value of the courses he has passed as a resident student in the College, exclusive of any credit for work done in the Summer Quarter or in any of the professional departments. In every case the candidate must spend the last session of his candidacy, which must be a regular session of nine months, exclusively in college work in this university; and the courses offered as major electives must all have been completed in residence in this university. A maximum of 15 session-hours may be granted for one year of college work, and 33 hours for two years. Conditioned Students.âA candidate for entrance must offer fifteen units as defined by the Southern Commision on Accredited Schools. At least thirteen of the units offered must be included in the list of units accepted for admission on page 102. A student who, while able to offer fifteen units, cannot offer fifteen units as defined in this list may be conditioned on any two units not including English A, B, or C, or Mathematics A1. All conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the session following initial registration. This may be done by passing entrance examinations or by passing equivalent courses in the Summer Quarter. But no course taken to remove a condition may be counted as part of the work credited toward a degree. No conditioned student may be later registered as a special student. Special Students.âA candidate may be admitted as a special student without fulfilling the entrance requirements above specified, provided that, if he is a Virginian, he is more than twenty years old or, if he is not a Virginian, he is more than twenty-three years old, on the day of registration, and gives adequate evidence of serious purpose and of the training needed to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for a degree; but such students are permitted and encouraged to make up their deficiences by private study or by taking courses in the Summer Quarter. They will then be admitted as regular students, and may be accepted as applicants for degrees, provided all entrance requirements are met at least one academic year before the date of graduation. Admission of Women.âWomen are admitted as candidates for the vocational degrees of Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, Bachelor of Science in Architecture and Bachelor of Science in Commerce. A candidate must be at least twenty years old on the birthday preceding matriculation; must present certificates showing graduation from an accredited public high-school, or not less than four years' attendance in an accredited private school, with credit for not less than fifteen college entrance units obtained at least two years before admission to the University; and must in addition show by proper certificate the completion in a standard college, subsequent to the credit obtained for fifteen entrance units, of at least thirty session-hours, (sixty semester-hours), of courses of college grade, in not less than eighteen calendar months.

Physical Training is not counted in the maximum and minimum requirements detailed above. (3) Grade.âThe grade of a college student in any course either for a term or for the session, is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Class standing in any course is determined by the regularity of the student's attendance upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercises) of the course, and by the quality of his work, as indicated by his recitation grades, written tests, laboratory work, etc. For passing in any course in the college a grade of seventy-five per cent. is required. (4) Exclusion from Courses, Probation and Suspension. (I) Exclusion from Courses: A student who, after due admonition, is evidently making no real progress in a course, may, at any time during the session, be excluded from the course by the Dean upon the recommendation of the instructor concerned. A student whose term grade in a course is less than 50 per cent., or who discontinues THE COLLEGE. the course without the permission of the Dean, or who is absent without excuse from the term examination, will be automatically excluded from the course. Any student receiving a grade of less than 65 per cent. in English A1, A2, or A3 in the first or second term, must drop the course and take up English A4 at the beginning of the ensuing term. (II) Probation: (1) A student placed on 15-hour probation must pass on at least 6 session-hours of his work and average at least 60 per cent. on all his courses, or else be suspended from the College. A student placed on 15-hour probation who attains an average grade of at least 70 per cent. on all his courses, is absolved from probation. (2) A student placed on 12-hour probation must pass on at least 6 session-hours of his work and average at least 65 per cent. on all his courses, or else be suspended from the College. A student on 12-hour probation whose average grade on all his courses is at least 75 per cent., may take up 3 additional session-hours and be absolved from probation. (3) A student placed on 9-hour probation must pass on 6 session-hours of his work and average at least 70 per cent. on all his courses, or else be suspended from College. A student on 9-hour probation whose average grade on all his courses is at least 75 per cent., may take up 3 additional session-hours and be placed on 12-hour probation for the term next ensuing. A student on 9-hour probation who passes on all his courses may take up 6 additional session-hours and be absolved from probation. (III) Suspension: Suspension means enforced withdrawal from the College. If imposed during the session, it applies to the remainder of the regular session; if imposed at the end of the session; it applies to the whole of the subsequent session. In no case does it apply to the Summer Quarter. See also (6) below. No student suspended for a second time may re-enter the College. (IV) Probation and Suspension are administered as follows: (1) A student who by exclusion from a course or courses is left at the end of the first or second term with only 12 session-hours, is put on 12-hour probation* * Or 15-hour probation for a student excluded from English A1, A2, or A3, and thereby forced to take up English A4. for the term next ensuing, unless his average grade on the remaining 12 session-hours is at least 75 per cent. In this case he may take up 3 additional session-hours and escape probation. (2) A student who by exclusion from a course or courses is left at the end of the first or second term with only 9 session-hours, (a) will be put on 9-hour probation,â  â  Or 12-hour probation for a student excluded from English A1, A2, or A3, and thereby forced to take up English A4. unless his average grade on his remaining 9 session-hours THE COLLEGE. is at least 75 per cent., in which case he may take up 3 additional session-hours and be put on 12-hour probation, or, (b) if he be other than a first-year student he will be suspended unless he has passed on at least 3 session-hours. (3) Any student not in his first year, who by exclusion from a course or courses is left at any time during the session with only 6 session-hours, will be suspended at the end of the term. Any first-year student left with only 6 session-hours will be suspended at the end of the term unless he has passed on at least 3 session-hours. In this case he will be required to take up 3 additional session-hours and be put on 9-hour probation for the ensuing term. (4) Any student not on probation who fails to attain a third-term grade or a session grade of at least 75 per cent. on at least 9 session-hours of his work, will be put on 15-hour probation for the first term of the subsequent session. A student who is permitted to withdraw from the University during the session will be readmitted on 15-hour probation if, at the time of his withdrawal, he was (a) on probation, or (b) passing on less than 9 session-hours of his work. A student previously suspended will, if re-admitted to the College, be placed on 15-hour probation. (5) No student may remain on probation for more than three terms, whether consecutive or not, in his entire college course. If his record is such as to call for the imposition of probation for a fourth time, he will be suspended instead of being placed on probation. (6) Probation or suspension imposed at the end of the regular session may be absolved by the successful completion of prescribed work in the Summer Quarter. (7) No student on probation may receive a leave of absence, except for imperative cause, nor may such a student be a member of any student organization which publicly represents the University, such as athletic teams, musical clubs, student publications, etc. (5) Absence from Examinations will not be excused, except for sickness on the day of examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. A student excused from more than one-half of his term examinations on account of illness may not be a member of any student organization which publicly represents the University, such as the athletic teams, musical clubs, student publications, etc., until he has passed his examinations. No student may remain in the College if he misses all the examinations of two consecutive terms on account of illness. (6) Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, in accordance with (5) above, is entitled to a special examination on a date during the regular session to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge of the examination. THE COLLEGE. (7) Re-Examinations.â(I) A College student whose session grade in any course falls below seventy-five per cent., but not below sixty-five per cent., may, upon the written recommendation of the professor in charge, be admitted to re-examination upon that course, or upon such portion of it as the professor shall determine, during the registration week of the following September. The fee for each re-examination is five dollars, and it should be paid to the Bursar on or before July fifteenth. (II) The candidate for an academic degree who fails on only one term of one of his courses during his final session of candidacy, is entitled to a special re-examination on the work of that term before the Final Day. The candidate who passes the re-examination, as an independent unit and not averaged in with the grades of the other terms, will receive credit for the work of the whole course in question. No fee is charged for such re-examination. (8) Reports.âReports are sent at the end of each term to the parent or guardian of each College student. These reports indicate the number of times the student has been absent from lectures, and give his term grade on each course. The dean will be glad at any time to furnish to the proper person a special report on any student's standing. In addition to the above, a report on the standing of each first year student in the College is sent to the student's parent or guardian early in November. (9) Conduct.âThe laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or not. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University for the residue of the current session every student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The keeping of dogs by students within the University grounds is forbidden. (10) Voluntary Withdrawal.âVoluntary withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University as well as the consent of the student's parent or guardian, if he is a minor. Any student who withdraws without permission will be recorded as having been suspended for the residue of the current session. No student on probation may withdraw except for imperative reasons; and any student on probation who withdraws without permission will be suspended, not only for the residue of the current session, but also for the whole of the subsequent session. THE COLLEGE. (11) Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also Suspension, above. (12) Change of Studies.âNo change can be made in a student's program of studies except with the written consent of the Dean, together with official notification by the Registrar. No permit for change of courses will be issued after the end of the first week of each term, except that first-year students may make such changes within the first two weeks after the beginning of lectures in September. Any student who drops a course without permission will receive a grade of zero in that course; and no credit may be received for any portion of a course attended before formal permission has been granted as outlined above. (13) (a) Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors, but only for sickness or like providential cause. Any explanation of an absence which a student has to offer must be made on the day of the first lecture attended after the absence. Unexcused absence from lectures renders the student liable to discipline by the Faculty It should be carefully noted that no student is "entitled" to be absent at all. His presence is required at each class or laboratory exercise at which he is due, unless his absence is excused for reasons outlined above or in the next paragraph below. Even if the student is absent with excuse, he must make up the work lost by such absence. No student who was, for any reason, absent from more than fifty per cent. of the lectures of any one term, can receive a grade on the work of that term. (b) Absence from the University is permitted upon the written leave of the dean, and should in every case be obtained in advance. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or musical clubs on excursions will not be granted, except to the officers and members of these organizations. The laws relating to absence from the University of members of the athletic teams are found on page 306 of the Catalogue. The same regulations apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. No student on Probation may receive a leave of absence except for imperative cause. It should also be carefully noted that no leave of absence can be granted just before or just after a vacation, or just after term examinations, except for very grave reasons, or unless the applicant is passing in all his courses. (14) The Dean's List.âA second-year student who passed on not less than fifteen hours his first session, with an average of at least eighty-five per cent., and with no grade less than seventy-five per cent., is placed on the Dean's List, and remains on the list as long as he receives no term grade less than seventy-five per cent. If a student on the Dean's List receives a term grade less than seventy-five per cent., he is automatically dropped from the List. A student on the Dean's List is not subject to the regulations limiting the issuance THE COLLEGE. of leaves of absence from the University, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class standing, imposed for absence alone. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES. Full opportunity is given to any student to carry out any definite plan of work which he may have in view on coming to the University, or which may have been prescribed for him by those under whose direction he is completing his education. But when no well-considered plan has been outlined in advance, and the end in view is that for which the great majority of students enter college, namely, the attainment of a liberal education, the student will be expected to enter upon the regular work of the college leading to a baccalaureate degree. Six degrees are offered candidates for graduation in the College. Two of these, the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science, are cultural; the Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, the name of which is inscribed on the diploma, the Bachelor of Science in Architecture, the Bachelor of Science in Commerce, and the Bachelor of Science in Medicine, are vocational degrees, designed for those who wish to fit themselves especially for professional work. No course offered by a successful candidate for one of the cultural baccalaureate degrees can be offered by the same candidate as part of the work credited toward the other cultural baccalaureate degree, nor can any work done to remove an entrance condition be counted for any degree. For a student who enters without advanced standing the normal time required for obtaining a baccalaureate degree is four years, assuming that he completes each year courses which aggregate the regular minimum of fifteen session-hours. A student receiving advanced standing in not less than two subjects may obtain a degree in three years, provided he is able to complete each year eighteen session-hours. A student may materially shorten the time required for obtaining a degree by taking courses in the Summer Quarter for which college credit is given. For credit for work done at other colleges, see page 164. The requirements for the baccalaureate degrees are such as to allow a large measure of freedom of election on the part of the individual student, such restriction only being placed upon this liberty as is necessary to insure at the same time the thoroughness and the breadth of culture for which these degrees stand. In order to secure to the recipient of a degree a due measure of acquaintance with the methods of thought characteristic of each of the leading departments of knowledge, as well as with their subject matter, his courses must be chosen subject to the specific requirements detailed below. THE COLLEGE. BACHELOR OF ARTS AND BACHELOR OF SCIENCE. The degree of Bachelor of Arts or of Bachelor of Science, respectively, will be conferred upon regular students who have completed not less than sixty (60) session-hours of undergraduate courses, taken in conformity with the following programme: (1) Required Subjects.âCandidates for either cultural degree must take 30 hours of required subjects as stated below and must in addition, unless exemption is granted on a physician's certificate, complete the two years' course in Physical Training which is not evaluated in session-hours. Of the 30 hours of required subjects not less than 24 hours must be taken during the first two years, and the remaining 6 hours not later than the third year. Foreign Languages. For the Bachelor of Arts.âNine session-hours from two languages, of which six must be in either Latin or Greek (exclusive of Greek Literature B1). For the Bachelor of Science.âNine session-hours from two languages, of which six must be in either French, German or Spanish. Mathematics. For either degree.âMathematics A1 or A2âthree session-hours. Natural Science. For either degree.âSix session-hours. English. For either degree.âSix session-hours, 3 of which may be in Biblical History, or Biblical Literature, or Public Speaking, or Greek Literature B1; the other 3 being in English or English Literature. Social Science. For either degree.âThree session-hours in History B1 or B2, or Economics B1, or Government B1. Economics B1, if selected, cannot be taken before the candidate's second year. Philosophy. For either degree.âThree session-hours in Philosophy B1, Philosophy B2, or Psychology B1. Physical Training. For either degree.âTwo years' course required of all candidates, which must be completed before graduation. If not completed during the first two years, an additional study-course of 3 session-hours must be taken. A candidate entering with advanced standing or with college credit shall in his first, and, if necessary, continuously in subsequent sessions, take such THE COLLEGE. courses as are necessary to complete these requirements for the first and second sessions. (2) Electives-at-large.âOf the remaining 30 session-hours required for the baccalaureate degree, 18 session-hours may be elected from any courses in the academic schools for which the candidate has adequate preparation. (3) Major-Electives.âThe remaining 12 session-hours required for either degree, shall be known as Major-Electives. The Major-Electives shall include at least one C course, and must all be offered from some one of the following Major-Groups of related subjects, except that when the Major-Group is Group III, the candidate may offer, in lieu of a C course, any six-hour B course in this Group, for admission to which another six-hour B course in the Group is prerequisite. The Major-Electives must all be completed in this College or in some professional department of this university. Group I.âLanguages, Literature, Fine Arts, and Music. Group II.âSocial and Philosophical Sciences. Group III.âMathematical and Natural Sciences. (4) Substitutions for Major-Electives.âThe first-year course in Law, or the first-year course in Medicine or 12 session-hours of technical courses in one of the professional departments of Engineering or Education may be substituted for the 12 session-hours of Major-Electives in academic subjects. This work, which must be completed in one of the professional departments of this University, cannot be begun by the candidate until he has spent at least 2 sessions of 9 months each in successful work in this College, and has at least 45 session-hours to his credit. DEGREES WITH HONORS. The courses required for the cultural B.A. and B.S. degrees are adapted to the powers of the average student, and any graduate of an accredited school, who has, either by certificate or examination satisfied the requirements for admission to the College, if he is reasonably industrious and regular in his studies, should obtain one of these degrees without difficulty in four sessions' work. In every body of students, however, there is a varying proportion of men and women who possess greater ability and application than the average, and whose ambition aims higher than a bare pass-mark on their work. For the proper stimulation of such students toward the best that they can do, and for due and authoritative recognition of unusual ability and high achievement in studies, the Academic Faculty has instituted the following system of Special Honors. Intermediate Honors. A certificate of Intermediate Honors is conferred by the Academic Faculty on the student who, during his first two regular sessions in the College of this University, has passed on not less than 30 session-hours, including all required THE COLLEGE. A courses, without failure or re-examination on any course, and with an average grade on all courses of 85 per cent. or more. The holder of a Certificate of Intermediate Honors, so long as he has no grade below 75 per cent. on the work of any term in any course, is not subject to any of the rules limiting the issuance of leaves of absence from the University, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty affecting class-standing imposed for absence alone. The Certificates of Intermediate Honors are publicly conferred at the Annual Convocation of the University following the session in which the honors have been attained. The names of the holders of these certificates are published under a separate heading in the annual catalogue of the University. Final Honors. Final Honors are conferred only on graduation, and the diploma of B.A. or B.S. with Final Honors states that the graduate has obtained special honors, and the subjects in which honors were won. A student who wishes to obtain Final Honors must be accepted as a candidate for honors two sessions before graduation. Any holder of the Certificate of Intermediate Honors, or any student who has credit for not less than 30 session-hours, including all required A courses, passed in this college or elsewhere, and who satisfies the Special Committee on Honors of his capacity for superior work, may become a candidate for Final Honors. The candidate for Final Honors, in addition to completing, without failure in any course, the regular degree requirements not later than the end of his second year of candidacy, will, before graduation, take a special comprehensive examination, oral or written, for Final Honors in some one group of subjects, selected by him at the beginning of his candidacy from the list of such groups published by the Special Committee on Honors. Final Honors are conferred on the basis of the standing on this examination alone, and not of the grades obtained in any or all of the courses required for the baccalaureate degree. Students who have credit for 30 session-hours and who are interested in Final Honors, are urged to consult the temporary Chairman of the Committee on Honors, Professor W. H. Faulkner, before registering. BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN A SPECIAL SUBJECT. The degree of Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject will be conferred upon regular students who have completed not less than sixty-three (63) session-hours of undergraduate courses, taken in conformity with the following programme: (1) Required Subjects: Candidates must complete 33 session-hours of required subjects as stated below, of which 3 must be in Physical Training B1.

Dean ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. Admission to the Department.âFor admission to the Department of Graduate Studies a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank is required, for men and women alike. In order to become a candidate for a degree, the student must be advanced to candidacy by the Committee on Rules and Courses upon formal application, as set forth below. Advancement to Candidacy for a Degree.âAny graduate student who wishes to become a candidate for a degree must file with the Dean of the Deparment his application on a blank form to be secured from the Registrar. This application must include a proposed program of work arranged in accordance with the requirements for the several degrees as stated below, and must be accompanied, in case the applicant does not hold an academic degree from this University, by an official transcript of the applicant's academic record made out by the Registrar of the institution from which the baccalaureate degree was received, and by a catalogue of that institution, marked to show the courses of study pursued. The application will be submitted by the Dean to the Committee on Rules and Courses, who will consider it in conference with the professors concerned. The Committee will have the right to require that the applicant add to his program any courses, undergraduate or graduate, considered necessary to supply his deficiencies, or to enable him to pursue with profit the courses he has selected. When the program has been finally approved, the Dean will report to the applicant his advancement to candidacy for a degree. It should be distinctly understood that graduate degrees are not conferred merely upon the basis of the number of courses passed, or of the length of time spent in resident or non-resident work, but upon the basis of the quality and scope of the candidate's knowledge, and his power of investigation in his chosen field of study. Candidates whose training and attainments are inferior cannot expect to secure a degree in the normal length of time estimated below for the respective degrees.

The Curry Memorial School of Education was founded in 1905 as one of the academic schools of the University. It was endowed by gifts of $100,000 from John D. Rockefeller and $50,000 from the General Education Board, and was named in honor of Dr. J. L. M. Curry, the Southern educator. There were originally two professorships in the School, the Curry Memorial Professorship of Education and the Professorship of Secondary Education. In 1914 a chair of Educational Psychology and Principles of Teaching was added to the School, and two years later a Professorship of School Administration was established. In 1919 the School was organized into a Department of the University, with four professorships, and was placed upon a professional basis DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. similar to that of the Departments of Law, Medicine and Engineering. The relation of the Department of Education to the various academic schools of the University remains close, however, since the academic training of students of Education is obtained in the academic schools, and courses in Education are credited toward the academic degrees. PURPOSE. The rapid development of educational science and practice has made it necessary that ample provision be made for the professional training of those who expect to teach or to administer school affairs. It is the main purpose of the Department of Education to provide opportunity for such professional training. Since education is of great importance as an agency of Democracy and as an aspect of civilization, the Department also aims to provide courses of cultural value for citizens generally. In addition to affording opportunities for study and training, the Department, as a part of the State University, offers its services to school authorities throughout Virginia, with a desire to coÃ¶perate in the solution of practical educational problems and in the furtherance of public education. PEABODY HALL. Peabody Hall, the Education Building, was named in honor of George Peabody, who in 1867 made his great gift to the cause of education in the South. The building was made possible through a gift of $40,000 from the trustees of the Peabody Education Fund. This amount was supplemented by an appropriation of $12,000 from the Rector and Visitors of the University. The building was completed in 1912, and is the home of the Curry Memorial Department of Education. The plans were drawn by a modern school architect, and approved by the leading authorities on school architecture in this country who were consulted before its erection. It is, therefore, a model of excellence in this regard. It is one of the best equipped buildings in the University, and has ample classroom and laboratory facilities, and an excellent auditorium equipped with a modern motion picture machine. Modern requirements in heating, lighting and ventilation are exemplified in its construction without sacrificing conformity to the general style of classic architecture prevailing in the University. THE HECK MEMORIAL LIBRARY. The Department of Education maintains its own library in Peabody Hall, named in honor of the first professor of Education in the University, the late Professor William Harry Heck. The library was made possible through the gift by Mrs. Anna Tuttle Heck of Professor Heck's private library containing approximately 2000 well-selected books on Education, and the transfer of all books on Education from the General Library of the University. Splendid DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. equipment was procured through a gift of money from students in Education, the Education Club and friends of Professor Heck. A recent gift of $2000 from Mr. Alfred W. Erickson of New York City will enable the Department so to strengthen its professional library as to offer very superior facilities to its rapidly growing student body, by making possible the enrichment of every course now offered. At present the library consists of several thousand select books covering most fields of Education, a complete file of publications of the United States Bureau of Education, various national, state and foreign documents, state school laws, annual reports of state superintendents of public instruction, city superintendents' reports, etc. Files of the leading educational magazines are available for free use of the students. Exhibits of elementary and high school texts for comparative studies are made available through the generosity of various publishers. OBSERVATION, DIRECTED TEACHING AND RESEARCH STUDIES. Laboratory facilities are made available through the coÃ¶peration of the school systems of the County of Albemarle and the City of Winchester, the local school boards in each case having approved such coÃ¶peration. This arrangement gives to students in the Department of Education a splendid opportunity to study the problems of both city and county school organization and administration. The school system of Albemarle County is now organized on the county unit basis. It consists of the following schools for white pupils: seven accredited four-year high schools, four junior high schools, five four-room schools, four three-room schools, fourteen two-room schools and twenty-one one-room schools. A number of the small schools are recognized by the State Department of Education as standard in their respective grades. During the session of 1922-23 there were 4500 white pupils enrolled. These were taught by 130 elementary school teachers and 36 high school teachers. The supervision of the county schools is under the direction of the county superintendent and four full time supervisors. The total value of sites, buildings and equipment is $435,000. This includes several new buildings of modern construction. The school system of the city of Winchester is open for observation, research and experiment by students of the Department of Education. This school system is divided into four departments: Primary, consisting of kindergarten and Grades 1, 2 and 3; Elementary, consisting of Grades 4, 5 and 6; Junior High School, consisting of Grades 7, 8 and 9; and Senior High School consisting of Grades 10, 11 and 12. Each department is in charge of a supervisor who gives all of his or her time to supervision except in the case of the supervisor of the junior high school, who does part time teaching temporarily. There are twelve teachers in the primary department, ten in the elementary department, and seventeen in the junior and senior high school departments. The new plant opened in 1923 provides many features in addition to the regular classrooms. For the elementary school division there will be a covered play DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. court with fresh air ventilation for year-round use; a nature study court; outdoor classrooms for convalescent and anemic children; and facilities for hot lunch provided in the high school cafeteria. In the junior and senior high school division, besides the regular classrooms equipped with movable desks, there will be a business department with special equipment; science laboratories and science lecture rooms; sewing and cooking laboratories with special equipment; art studios; music studios; industrial shops for woodworking, metal working, electrical working and agriculture; library study and reference room; gymnasium and swimming pool; teachers' work room and library. For recreation and community service there will be provided an art gallery exhibit and history museum, auditorium seating twelve hundred, an athletic stadium, tennis courts, golf course, arboretum, and public park. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. Requirements for the Admission of Men.âTo be admitted to regular standing in the Department of Education, men must have satisfied the entrance requirements of the College. Students who have decided to enter the teaching profession at the time of entering college should register with the Dean of the Department of Education in order to be advised in planning their curricula. Holders of State Teachers' Scholarships are required to register in the Department of Education. Requirements for the Admission of Women.âTo be admitted to regular standing in the Department of Education, women must be twenty years of age, must meet the entrance requirements of the University and must have completed two years of college work aggregating thirty session-hours in academic subjects. Candidates not able to meet these requirements may make up their deficiencies during the summer quarter. Special Students.â(a) Graduates of colleges and universities other than the University of Virginia, desiring to secure the necessary professional training to qualify for the Collegiate Professional Certificate, may register in the Department of Education and upon completion of the required courses receive a certificate which will entitle them to the Collegiate Professional Certificate issued by the State Board of Education. (b) Men may be admitted as special students without fulfilling the entrance requirements above specified, provided that, if they are Virginians, they are more than twenty years old or, if they are not Virginians, they are more than twenty-three years old, on the day of registration, and give adequate evidence of serious purpose and of the training needed to pursue with profit the courses for which they are registered. No special student may be a candidate for a degree; but such students are permitted and encouraged to make up deficiences by private study or by taking courses in the Summer Quarter. They will then be admitted as regular students, and may be accepted as applicants for degrees, provided all entrance requirements are met at least one academic year before the date of graduation. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. (b) Women, twenty-five years of age, giving satisfactory evidence that they are qualified to pursue courses in Education successfully, may be admitted as special students, even though they fail to show credit for the 30 session-hours of academic work required of women for admission to regular standing.

Recipients of the Bachelor of Science in Education will receive the Collegiate Professional Certificate, the highest form of certificate for high-school teachers issued by the State Board of Education. This certificate is valid for ten years, renewable for a similar period, and entitles the holder to teach in both high and elementary schools in Virginia. Holders of Collegiate Certificates, the certificates of second rank issued by the State Board of Education, may obtain the Collegiate Professional Certificate by attending the University one session and taking four three-session-hour courses in Education. Curricula organized to meet the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Education fulfill both academic and professional requirements for the highest grade of professional high school certificates issued without examination by the various state departments of Education to holders of baccalaureate degrees. The graduate courses in Education are recognized in states requiring graduate study for professional certificates. SPECIAL CERTIFICATES IN HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS. Students who find it necessary to leave college to teach before completing their full course may be issued special certificates by the State Board of Education to teach any high-school subjects in which they have completed six session-hours of study of college grade. These students should plan to take two courses in Education during their second year in order to become familiar with school problems. COURSES FOR TEACHERS IN SERVICE. Saturday courses in any subject offered in the Department of Education will be arranged at the University for teachers in service, if requested by at least five teachers. Degree credit will be allowed on the same basis as in the regular courses, provided that not more than one and one-half session-hours' credit shall be given for the work in any course for one year. Superintendents and Teachers of Public Schools Exempt from Fees.â White male teachers and superintendents of the public schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Academic Schools of the University without payment of fees (except those charged in laboratory courses), upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the public schools of the State during the year. Applicants for admission as teachers are required to send their names to the President of the University not later than March 5. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. UNIVERSITY EXTENSION TEACHING COURSES. Extension teaching courses are courses of instruction corresponding closely with those regularly given in the University by regular members of the faculty, and are under the administration, supervision and control of the University, for the benefit of persons unable to attend the regular courses of instruction and to take work in residence. Each course represents a definite amount of study corresponding to an equivalent amount of work done in residence at the University, and when completed satisfactorily by persons meeting the entrance requirements of the University, receives the same credit as if taken in residence. Extension teaching classes in Education, conducted by members of the faculty of the Department of Education, were organized in the session of 1923-24 under the Division of Extension of the University, in Alexandria, Lynchburg, Manassas, Richmond and Waynesboro-Basic. Additional Extension Teaching classes were conducted by members of the regular faculty of the University and instructors in the Extension Division of the University in Amherst, Richmond, Bristol, Charlottesville, Lynchburg, Roanoke, and Schoolfield. Extension Teaching Courses will be organized upon application for them in as many centers as possible, if a sufficient number (usually not fewer than fifteen) apply for them. Application for such courses should be made to the Director of University Extension, Box 149, University, Virginia. THE SUMMER QUARTER. The Summer Quarter is an integral part of the University year. Courses in the College of Arts and Sciences, as well as the Department of Education, are the same in character and in credit value as in any other Quarter of the University. Degrees are conferred upon men and women upon exactly the same terms for work done in the Summer Quarter when the degree requirements are fully met. Sixty-three session-hours of undergraduate courses, taken in conformity with the requirements published herewith, are required for the Bachelor's degree. Those who contemplate completing their degree requirements in the Summer Quarter should keep clearly in mind, in estimating the time that will be required, that the normal amount of credit which may be taken in one Summer Quarter is six session-hours. Candidates for a degree who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. This certificate must be acceptable both to the Dean of the Summer Quarter and to the Dean of the Department in which the degrees will be obtained. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college and must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. and must give his grade. In every case the candidate must spend at least three full Summer Quarters at the University in order to meet the residence requirements. The Master's degree may be obtained by properly qualified persons in three Summer Quarters. In no case is this degree to be conferred upon any person who has not attended and done graduate work three full Summer Quarters or the equivalent time in the regular session of the University and the Summer Quarter. On account of the increasing demand for graduate work in the Summer Quarter, the number of graduate courses will be enlarged in 1924. All persons who are looking forward ultimately to taking a degree through summer work are urgently requested to file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter an official statement of their entrance requirements and work for which college credit is desired. Blanks for this purpose will be mailed upon application. BUREAU OF TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS. Educational Tests.âThe Department of Education maintains a Bureau of Tests and Measurements as a feature of its extra-University service. Select standard tests in school subjects will be supplied to cities, counties and individual schools at cost. Members of the Faculty of Education will visit the schools to be tested, train teachers in the use of the tests and personally direct the giving and scoring of them, provided the necessary traveling expenses are borne by the schools served. Mental Tests.âIn connection with its work in educational psychology, the Department undertakes to assist school authorities in the diagnosis and training of backward and gifted children. Assistance will be rendered in the making of mental surveys and the establishment of special classes. A clinic will be maintained for the study of cases accessible to the University and the services of the professor in charge will be available to any community in Virginia at the cost of the necessary test materials and traveling expenses. Any school official desiring the services of the Bureau of Tests and Measurements should address the Dean of the Department of Education. BUREAU OF APPOINTMENTS. The University of Virginia maintains a Bureau of Appointments in charge of a committee consisting of Professors J. L. Manahan, W. R. Smithey, J. C. Metcalf and I. F. Lewis. The services of the bureau are free to all teachers and prospective teachers seeking positions in secondary schools (both public and private), normal schools, and colleges. Correspondence with regard to appointment should be addressed to the Bureau of Appointments (J. L. Manahan, Director), University, Virginia. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. PHI DELTA KAPPA FRATERNITY. A chapter of the national honorary educational fraternity of Phi Delta Kappa has been organized in connection with the Department of Education. Under the constitution of the fraternity, only those students are eligible to membership who expect to make teaching or administration of schools a permanent vocation, and who give evidence of superior qualities of character, scholarship and initiative. The standards of scholarship governing election to membership in the fraternity are similar to those prescribed for election to Phi Beta Kappa. The purpose of the fraternity as stated in its constitution is "to develop among the students of Education at the University of Virginia the spirit of `Research, Service and Leadership,' " and to endeavor by every worthy means at its command to create and foster fellowship and true fraternalism among the members of the society. EDUCATION CLUB. An Education Club is conducted for the purpose of fostering a scientific study of educational problems. Membership is open to all students taking courses in Education, teachers, principals and superintendents now in service, and members of the faculty of the University who are willing to lend their influence and efforts toward placing the teaching profession in Virginia and the South on a professional basis. SCHOLARSHIPS. In order to encourage the training of teachers, the General Assembly of Virginia, in 1918, founded one hundred and nineteen Virginia State Teachers' Scholarships, one for each School Division in the State. The emolument is free lodging, heat, light and janitor service in the university dormitories. The holder of one of these scholarships must be a Virginian needing financial assistance in order to attend the University, and he must pledge himself to engage in some form of school work in the State for at least two years, or, failing this, to repay to the University the value of the scholarship. Appointments are made prior to September 1, upon the recommendation of Division Superintendents of Schools. If any Superintendent fails to make a recommendation, the vacancy thus created may be filled from the State at large by the President of the University. Blank forms of application will be sent upon request. In addition to the Virginia State Teachers' Scholarships, there are a number of other scholarships in the University available for students of Education. A detailed description of them is given in the General Catalogue of the University. LOAN FUNDS AND STUDENT SELF-HELP. The University is in possession of funds from which loans are made to deserving students in need of such assistance. An account of these DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. loans is given in the General Catalogue, page 106. Inquiries concerning them should be addressed to the Bursar. Opportunities for obtaining remunerative employment are afforded to students who are desirous by this means of partially paying their way through the University. It is difficult to give definite assurance of employment to a student before he reaches the University, but it may be stated that any student with sufficient resources to carry him through the first half of the session can be reasonably sure of obtaining work which will help defray his expenses for the rest of the academic year. Information as to employment may be obtained from the secretary of the Committee on Student Self-Help, Madison Hall, University, Virginia. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses of a Virginia student in the Department of Education may be estimated at from $320 a year upward, according to the mode of living; for students from other States, $510 upward. A fuller statement of expenses will be found in the General Catalogue of the University.</field>

For admission to the Freshman Class in the Department of Engineering the candidate must be at least sixteen years old. He must present a certificate of honorable withdrawal from the school last attended, or other valid proof of general good character. He must further satisfy the Dean of the University as to his adequate preparation for the work by passing the Entrance Examinations specified below or by the presentation of equivalent certificates of preparation signed by the president of a recognized institution of collegiate rank, or by the principal of an accredited high school. The topics required for entrance and their values in units are as follows, the unit being one year's work on the subject in an accredited high school: English A.âGrammar and Grammatical Analysis 1 English B.âComposition and Rhetoric 1 English C.âCritical Study of Specimens of Literature 1 Mathematics A1.âAlgebra to Quadratics 1 Mathematics A2.âQuadratics, Progressions, Binomial Formula 1 Mathematics B.âPlane Geometry 1 Mathematics C.âSolid Geometry Â½ Mathematics D.âPlane Trigonometry Â½ History.âAncient; MediÃ¦val; English; American (any one) 1 Electives 7 Total 15 DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. High school students who expect to study Engineering are advised to include among their electives at least one Foreign Language (Latin or French or German), one Science (Chemistry or Physics with adequate laboratory work) and an additional unit of History. Other electives which may be profitably offered are History of English and American Literature, Greek, Botany, ZoÃ¶logy, Physical Geography. A candidate may be admitted as a Conditioned Student in spite of some deficiencies in required entrance subjects, provided these are not such as will impair the integrity of his work, but be must submit not less than 15 units. No such candidate will be conditioned except upon subjects actually taught in this university, nor will any candidate be conditioned on more than two units; and all conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the next session after initial registration. Courses taken for the removal of entrance conditions may in no case be counted as part of the work credited for any degree. No conditions will be allowed in English A or B or in Mathematics A1, A2, or B. As the table of Entrance requirements shows, the full High School course in Mathematics is required for entrance to the Department of Engineering, but unfortunately the graduates of the High Schools are often deficient in Solid Geometry and Plane Trigonometry and can be admitted only upon conditions in those subjects. High School principals are advised to urge their graduates, with this status, to attend a Summer Session at the University before entering the Department of Engineering so that these deficiencies may be overcome. If the prospective student finds it impossible to attend a Summer School previous to his regular matriculation, a course has been planned which will allow him to make up his deficiencies by taking work in the Summer School following his first year in Engineering. This course provides for Trigonometry, Solid Geometry and College Algebra in the three terms of the regular session, with the other work as outlined for the regular student, and in addition, in the two terms of the Summer School, Analytical and Coordinate Geometry are taken. Such a program will prepare the student for entrance with Sophomore standing and will save him from the failure usually encountered by students who attempt to make up the deficient work in regular session in addition to the full course of required subjects. A candidate may be admitted as a Special Student, without formal examination, provided he is more than twenty years old if a Virginian and not less than twenty-three years old if a non-Virginian, and gives evidence of serious purpose and of fitness to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for any degree. No conditioned student may register later as a special student. ADMISSION OF WOMEN. Women are admitted as candidates for the Engineering Degrees but not as Special Students. A candidate must be at least twenty years old DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. on the birthday preceding matriculation; must present certificates showing graduation from an accredited public high-school, or not less than four years' attendance in an accredited private school, with credit for not less than fifteen college entrance units obtained at least two years before admission to the University; and must in addition show by proper certificate the completion in a standard college, subsequent to the credit obtained for fifteen entrance-units, of at least thirty session-hours, (sixty semester-hours), of courses of college grade, in not less than eighteen calendar months. ADVANCED STANDING. Under the elective system of the University of Virginia, a student who has completed courses of college or university grade in other institutions of learning on mathematical or scientific subjects may be excused from attendance upon these courses by the Dean, with the advice and consent of the professor in charge, and will then be registered for the more advanced work, provided the full entrance requirements have been satisfied. In order to secure College Credit upon such courses toward a degree in Engineering from this University, the applicant must showâ 1. That the courses offered are coextensive with the corresponding courses as given in the University of Virginia. 2. That his grades on them were not below the seventy-five per cent. pass-mark of this University. Such credits may be granted by the faculty upon the recommendation of the Dean and the professors in charge; but are automatically revoked by the failure of the student to pass in the more advanced courses in the related topics. Advanced standing in the technical engineering subjects of higher grade than those of the Sophomore year will not be given except to graduates of other institutions offering technical engineering instruction and then only upon special consideration of each application for such advanced standing. No degree in Engineering will be awarded for less than one full year's work in a regular session of this University and the work of a candidate's last year must be performed in residence here. The same rules apply to Credits on Summer School Courses; except that for courses in the Summer School of this University the examination questions must be prepared by the professor in charge of the regular course, and the answers must be read and graded by him. Students, suspended from other universities, are not granted college credit on courses previously passed, except upon the explicit recommendation of the suspending university, and after such additional tests as this Engineering Faculty may impose. Credits on Practice-Courses in Drawing, Shop-work, or Field-work may be granted to applicants who have gained in professional practice the training which these courses represent. Such applicants must file with the Dean DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. proper certificates from the official under whom the work was done and must in every case pass an additional practical test on the subjects for which credit is desired. College credit is not granted for high-school work. PROGRAMS OF STUDY. The candidate who has satisfied the requirements for entrance as above defined is matriculated as a student of Engineering and admitted to the Freshman Class. The studies of this class comprise lecture courses in English, Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Chemistry with associated laboratory courses in Chemistry, Drawing, Shop-work and Field-work. For advancement to the Sophomore Class the student must have completed at least two-thirds of his Freshman work. Upon entering this class the student majoring in Chemical Engineering begins his specialized work, while all others pursue identical courses of study through the year. On entering the Junior year each student elects his specialty. The courses thereafter diverge according to the major subject chosen by the student. Programs of study for each degree are given below. The courses are so ordered that the specified entrance requirements are adequate for the work of the Freshman Year. Each succeeding year pre-supposes the completion of the work for all the foregoing years. Students are advised to adhere strictly to the regular programs. The arrangements specified in them have been carefully planned and are the best. Departures from the curriculum will in almost every case produce conflicts in lecture hours or laboratory periods and may cost the student a year's time. Haphazard election is discouraged and in extreme cases will be prohibited. No student will be registered for a course unless, in the opinion both of the Dean and of the professor, his preliminary training has fitted him for the profitable pursuit of that course. Students are especially advised against the attempt to crowd too many studies into their scheme of work, and are warned that admission to advanced courses will be granted only to those who have adequate mathematical and scientific training to profit by them. Men overloaded with work, too great in volume or in difficulty for their powers, suffer inevitable discouragement and incur almost certain failure. Changes of classes with transfer of fees may be made, subject to the approval of the Dean, within two weeks after the beginning of any term. Thereafter such changes may be made only by special order of the faculty, and then without transfer of fees. Upon the completion of the four years' course as defined in any one of the Programs of Study, the faculty will award to any student in regular and honorable standing the degree of Bachelor of Science in Engineering. Upon the completion of the additional Graduate Course in a satisfactory manner the faculty will award the appropriate degree of Civil Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Chemical Engineer, or Mining Engineer. The new five-year curriculum has been adopted at the University of DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. Virginia in view of the impressive and growing demand from practicing engineers and industrial leaders that Schools of Engineering should enlarge the field of study to embrace more of the humanities and better opportunities for student research, to the end that graduates may be better fitted to undertake their duties as engineers and citizens. The entering classes, beginning with 1923-24, will be matriculated under the new program as presented in this volume of the University of Virginia Record, while students registered before the session of 1923 or with corresponding advanced standing will be permitted to graduate under the former four-year curriculum, but not later than June, 1926. Complete programs of the former four-year degree courses may be found in Volume IX of the University of Virginia Record for those who are yet to graduate under the older curriculum. The present volume presents in detail only the new five-year curriculum. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION.

Elections are made each year based on scholarship and general record of ability and promise of future service to the profession of engineering. ENGINEERING JOURNAL. During the session of 1920-1921 the University of Virginia Journal of Engineering was first issued. The Journal is published by the Students of Applied Science and is issued ten times yearly. Contributions are made by students, instructors and alumni and the Journal gives to the students especially an opportunity to take part in an activity of interest and value while providing a medium in which may be published results of individual experience and research. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. ENGINEERING STUDENTS' READING CLUB. A gift to the Department of Engineering from Messrs. Arthur P. Jones, William Barham Jones (B.A. 1907) and Major Kenneth S. Jones (B.A., LL.B., C.E. 1915, Major U. S. A., Engineer Corps) in memory of their father, the late Walter H. Jones of Norfolk, Va., and of his deep interest in the University of Virginia, in the form of an endowment fund has made it possible to provide a considerable number of professional periodicals representing the various engineering activities. To promote the regular use of these periodicals an Engineering Students' Reading Club has been formed to which all engineering students are eligible and this club is expected to foster proper use of the periodicals to the end that the maximum of value will be obtained by the students from their reading.

The examination day for a particular course is indicated in the table above by the Roman numeral in the first or last column for the corresponding lecture hours in the middle column. The examination period covers ten days at the end of each term. A change in lecture for any course will change the examination day correspondingly. Classes for which lecture periods are not indicated will have examination days fixed by the arranged lecture hour in accordance with above schedule. In the schedule printed above for 1924-1925 the courses listed are the new courses for Freshmen and Sophomores and the older courses for Juniors and Seniors. The older courses are found completely explained in Vol. IX of the University of Virginia Record and apply to those students who will complete the old curriculum not later than June, 1926. During the transfer period from the older to the new curriculum the hour schedule has been as closely adapted to the five-year hour schedule as could be made feasible. As a consequence it will be necessary for students during the next two years to use both the old and new catalogue material in order to fix their actual hour schedule for a current year. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. EXPENSES OF REGULAR STUDENTS. The average annual expense of a student who pursues the regular course in Engineering will be: NonVirginians Virginians University Fee $ 60 $ 40 Tuition 160 85 Laboratory Fees (average) 35 35 Living Expenses (for nine months) 400 400 Books and Drawing Materials 30 30 Incidental Expenses (for nine months) 60 60 Total annual for average conditions $745 $650 The charges for Tuition are uniform to all students, except that Virginians are relieved of tuition on courses offered in the College, this exception saving regular Freshmen from Virginia $100 and all other Virginia students $65 each year in comparison with non-Virginians. The laboratory charges are $15 per class for the year's course in Physics, and $20 per class for a year's course in Chemistry. A deposit for breakage of $5 is required for each laboratory course in Chemistry. The fee for each practice course in the Engineering Department, Drawing, Engineering Laboratories, and Shop-work is $5 per term for each course. The fees for Field-work and Bridge Drafting are each $10 per term per course. These fees include all charges for laboratory materials; but the student is held further responsible for breakage. The living Expenses include board, lodging, fuel and lights, servant and laundry; the average is $10.00 per week, the minimum $7.50, and a reasonable maximum $12.50. Books and Drawing Materials will cost about $120 for the four-year course. Incidental Expenses ought to be kept within modest bounds; the above estimate is sufficient; large allowances of pocket money promote idleness and attract companions of the baser sort. No allowances are included for clothing and travel, the expenses for which vary too much to be introduced into any general estimate. The charges payable on entrance are the University Fee, and the Tuition and Laboratory Fees EXAMINATIONS AND REPORTS Oral examinations are held at the beginning of each lecture hour on the topics of the preceding lecture. Written test papers are set monthly, or at such interval as the professor may appoint. Absences from lecture except by reason of sickness are not excused without a written leave from the Dean. Class standing is determined on the basis of the oral examinations and the written tests. Absence from the latter or failure to answer incurs a zero grade. Absences from laboratory periods, however caused, must be made up by special private arrangement with the instructor. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. Written examinations are held at the end of each term on the entire work of that term. The result of examination combined with the student's class-standing gives his term-grade. The pass-mark is seventy-five per cent. Absence from the written term examination incurs a zero term-grade, which may not be removed except by the passage of a special written examination on the work of that term. Such special examinations are granted only upon presentation of a written certificate from a reputable physician that the student by reason of sickness on the day of the regular examination was unable to attend. Regular Reports are sent out at the end of every term to the student's parent or guardian. These state for each course followed the term-grade and the number of absences. Further comment may be added by the Dean or the professor, if it appears probable that such comment would be helpful to the student. Parents are urged to examine these reports carefully and to exert such parental influence as may seem needed to establish and confirm the student in habits of industry and order. Special Reports are sent to parents at the end of each month for students delinquent in attendance or studiousness and for delinquents only. When a student is making steady progress and showing due diligence in his work, only the regular reports are sent. The receipt of a special report is evidence that, in the judgment of the faculty, prompt and pointed parental admonition is urgently needed. If in any class in the Department of Engineering a student fails to make satisfactory progress, he is first admonished by the professor in charge. In default of prompt and permanent improvement, he is next formally warned by the Dean. If due amendment is then not immediately effected, the student's name is dropped from the rolls of the Department, on the ground that he is not accomplishing the purposes for which he should have entered upon a University course of study. REGULATIONS. The following regulations, adopted to define the policy of the faculty, are published for the information and guidance of the students: 1. Practice-courses as well as lecture-courses must be conducted under the Honor System. The student who submits any work to be graded is considered to submit it under pledge. 2. When the lecture-course and the associated practice-course are given in the same term of the same year, no student will be admitted to examination on the lecture-course until he has completed at least three-fourths of the practice-course. 3. No student will be admitted to any practice-course unless he is at the same time pursuing the associated lecture-course, or has already received credit for the same. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. 4. No student will be admitted to the graduating examination on a lecture-course unless he has been present at more than half the lectures in that course. 5. In the technical courses in Engineering (i. e., courses not given in the College) term-grades shall not be averaged; except that the term-grades for Freshman Applied Mathematics may be averaged for the first-year men only, provided no mark is below 65. 6. The pass-mark in every course is 75. Class standing is estimated at 20 points; the written examination at 80 points. 7. No student who fails to make 75 on term-grade shall be granted another examination on the course until he has again attended lectures on that course. 8. Special examinations are not given except by reason of sickness on the day of examination, attested by the written certificate of a reputable physician, or for other like providential causes. In every case they must be validated by special vote of the faculty. 9. A student whose term-grades average less than 40 for all the courses in which he is registered shall be at once dropped from the rolls. If his average is above 40 with no mark above 65, he is placed on probation. 10. A student on probation, who in the next term makes less than 65 on each and all his courses, shall be at once dropped from the rolls. DRAFTING ROOMS. The drafting rooms are abundantly lighted and are provided with solidly constructed tables with locked drawers for instruments and materials. Each student is assigned to a table and has a drawer for his exclusive use. The regular Drawing Classes execute each one plate a week under the supervision of the Instructors in Drawing. The more advanced students have such additional drawings assigned by their respective professors as are needed for the full development of the courses of study. Careful attention is given to the training of the students in free-hand lettering, in the conventional signs of mechanical drawing, in the proper lay-out of drawings, and in neat and accurate execution. Exercises are required also in tracing and in blue-printing, the rooms for which are conveniently arranged and in close contiguity to the drafting rooms. While, however, technical dexterity is demanded, the graphical method is taught and used primarily as an indispensable instrument of research, the thoughtful mastery of which is essential for the instructed Engineer. The construction and theory of the Polar Planimeter, the Slide Rule, and the Pantograph are carefully taught, and the student is trained in the practical use of these appliances for the rapid and accurate production of estimates and copies from finished drawings. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. SHOPS. The machine shop is provided with six first-class engine lathes, illustrating the practice of the best American makers; with a planer, a shaper, two drill presses, a universal milling machine (Brown &amp; Sharpe), and a universal grinder (same makers); also with a gas forge for tempering tools, a cut-off saw for metal rods, an emery wheel, grindstone, and so on.

The outfit of field instruments contains compasses, transits, and levels of various approved makes; a solar transit, furnished also with stadia wires and gradienter for tachymetric work; a Gurley mining, transit, one of the finest products of the instrument maker's art; hand-levels and clinometers for field topography; plane tables; a sextant; together with an adequate supply of leveling rods, telemeter rods, signal poles, chains, tapes, pins, and so on. For hydraulic surveys a hook guage and a current meter are provided. All students are instructed in the theory and adjustments of the field instruments and in their practical use in the field. They are also required to make up their field-books in standard forms; to reduce their surveys and execute all the necessary profiles, plans, and maps; and to determine lengths, areas, and volumes both from the maps and from the original notes. Polar planimeters are provided for facilitating such estimates, and a pantograph for making reduced copies of finished drawings. ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING LABORATORY. The Scott Laboratory of Electrical Engineering.âThis laboratory was initially equipped and endowed by Mrs. Frances Branch Scott, of Richmond, Va., as a memorial to her late son, an alumnus of this University. During the year 1910 the equipment was substantially increased through the generosity of the Hon. Charles R. Crane, of Chicago, Ill., a friend of the University. During 1912 still further substantial additions were made, consisting of measuring instruments, auxiliary control apparatus, and more particularly a steam-turbine-driven three-phase alternating-current generator with exciter and control switchboard. Within the past year very considerable additions have been made to the equipment. The laboratory has been rearranged and rewired and a special treatment has been used on the floors to eliminate dust. The newer apparatus installed comprises a complete three-element oscillograph set with the necessary accessories, two direct-current motor generator sets with automatic push-button start and stop control complete, an experimental test generator with modern switch board panel for its control and motor for driving it equipped with automatic push-button start, stop and reverse control. The latest apparatus installed now ready for use consists of a synchronous motor driving an alternating current generator and a three-wire direct current generator, with two exciters, on a common shaft. A complete three-panel switchboard for the control of this set is equipped with full sets of instruments and controls including a voltage regulator for the alternating current generator. In addition to full sets of electric meters with the appliances for testing and calibrating them, galvanometers of the best modern types, standard cells and resistances, standard condensers, and other pieces of apparatus DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. for minor tests, this laboratory contains numerous pieces of the very best construction. Such are the Wolff potentiometer, the Seimens and Halske Thomson double bridge, the Koepsel permeameter, the Station photometer with Lummer-Brodhun screen, Macbeth illuminometer, the Carey-Foster bridge and others. For the work in machine testing there are, in addition to the newer equipment listed above, a number of direct-current generators and motors, series, shunt and compound, an interpole motor, a double current generator, a two-phase alternator, a General Electric experimental test set for alternating current, comprising a generator furnishing single, two, three, six or twelve-phase current, and, in addition, offering three types of induction motors with all necessary starting and controlling devices, a single-phase repulsion motor, a two-phase induction motor, two three-phase induction motors, several pairs of constant voltage transformers, a constant current transformer, frequency meters, power factor indicator, synchronism indicator, ground detector and the auxiliary apparatus used in testing these machines. The laboratory has been arranged with a system of universal plug and receptacle-connections to facilitate the setting up of all experimental combinations. BUILDINGS. The buildings devoted wholly or in part to the work of the Department of Engineering are the following: The Mechanical Laboratory is the main seat of the instruction in technical studies. It is 180 by 70 feet and contains on the main floor the Dean's office and the offices of three other professors; and three lecture-rooms. Above are an office, a small drafting room for advanced students, and blue-print and photographic rooms. Below on the ground floor are an office and classroom, the electrical laboratories, the testing laboratories, apparatus and storerooms, and the students' lavatory. In order to more adequately care for increased numbers this building has undergone a considerable rearrangement during the past year. Wood and machine shop equipment has been entirely removed from the building, as well as the facilities for Freshman and Sophomore Drawing. This change made available much needed classroom space and allowed the electrical laboratories to be expanded. Incident to the changes new cement floors were constructed for the Road Materials Testing Laboratory, the main testing Laboratory and the main hall. A new high-pressure steam line from the Power House was also installed. The Shops are now temporarily housed in the Garage erected for the Motor Truck Training Detachment during the World War. This building gives a floor space of some 5,000 square feet and has allowed the rearrangement of wood and machine shop equipment for group drive by four electric motors. Space is also available in this structure for use in connection with the course in automobile construction and testing. The Drawing Room is temporarily housed near Peabody Hall in one of DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. the Barracks taken from the Training Camp site and rebuilt and fitted for drawing. The building accommodates about 180 men, each man having his individual drawing desk. The Power House is a single-story building 110 by 40 feet. In addition to the University boiler plant and the electric lighting plant, this contains the foundry and the forge-room. The Boiler plant consists of two horizontal return-tubular boilers, each of 140 horse-power. The lighting plant consists of three electric generators directly connected to high-speed engines, the respective capacities being 25, 50, and 75 kilowatts. The whole plant is available for purposes of instruction, study and experiment. In addition to the University plants there are available by courtesy of the owners for purposes of inspection, study and tests such plants as the turbine station and railway and power substation of the Virginia-Western Power Company, the water turbines and oil engine plant of the Charlottesville Woolen Mills, and plants of the local ice companies and cold storage. The Geological Museum is 120 by 50 feet. It is a three-story building. The main floor is devoted to the very extensive geological collection of specimens, charts, relief maps, and so on. The gallery above contains an equally good collection of minerals and numerous models of typical crystallographic forms. The upper floor contains the lecture-rooms and the laboratories of Economic Geology. In the basement are stored subsidiary collections and new material accumulated in more recent geological surveys. The Physical Laboratory faces the Mechanical Laboratory on the opposite side of the quadrangle, and has almost the same proportions. The main floor contains the lecture-room, the professors' offices, the laboratory of experimental physics, and the storeroom for the very large collection of apparatus used in the lectures. On the ground floor is the laboratory of theoretical electricity, the storage battery room, a well-equipped shop for the repair and manufacture of apparatus, and smaller rooms for the work of graduate students. The new Chemical Laboratory was opened for use in September, 1917. In this fire-proof structure all the work in Chemistry is assembled. The floor area provided is about 30,000 square feet. The lecture-rooms seat classes of 300, 75 and 25 students. The laboratories assigned to General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Qualitative Analysis, Quantitative Analysis, and Physical Chemistry contain 110, 60, 40, 30, and 20 desks. Altogether by dividing classes into sections, 600 students may be accommodated. Smaller private laboratories are provided for research workers. Large stock rooms communicating by elevators with the several floors contain ample stores of chemical supplies. The 5,000 volumes of books and bound sets of journals constituting the Departmental Library of Chemistry are so housed as to be accessible to both teachers and students.</field>

For other information, address the Dean of the Department of Law. Historical.âAmong the original Schools contemplated in Mr. Jefferson's plan for the organization of the University of Virginia was "Law: Municipal and Foreign; Embracing the General Principles. Theory and Practice of Jurisprudence, together with the Theory and Principles of Constitutional Government." Accordingly the School of Law was established in 1826, and has been in continuous operation since. From the establishment of the Law School until 1894, the course comprised the work of a single year. With the session of 1894-1895, a two years' course was inaugurated, which continued up to the session of 1909-1910, when the course was extended to three years. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. The aim of the Department of Law has always been to maintain a high standard as a requirement for graduationâthe degree being conferred only upon such students as are thorough masters of the prescribed course of study. This policy has been rigorously enforced, and its wisdom has been vindicated by the high position which the graduates of the Law School are accustomed to attain at the bar and in public life. The course of instruction has been extended from time to time to conform to changing conditions and to meet the increasing needs of the profession. Minor Hall.âThe Law School is accommodated in its own building, designated as Minor Hall, in honor of the late John B. Minor, whose distinguished service of fifty years as a professor in the Law School, the University thus commemorates. The building is located between Dawson's Row and the southern end of West Range. The architecture is on classic lines, in keeping with the general design of the other university buildings. It contains on the first floor four large lecture halls, with convenient offices, lavatories, etc., and on the second floor a stack room with ample space for books, two commodious reading rooms, and a number of offices for the use of the librarian and the teaching staff. Law Library.âThe Library contains sixteen thousand volumes. Its financial resources, from appropriations by the Visitors, and from income from special endowments, make possible substantial additions annually. The Library contains the English Reports, practically complete, from and including the Year Books to date; the United States Supreme Court Reports; reports of all the American States; the National Reporter System, complete; selected and annotated reports, together with modern search-books in the form of general Digests, and the leading Encyclopedias, besides a large collection of textbooks, bound volumes of law magazines, etc. Law students have the privileges of the general University Library, containing more than ninety thousand volumes. The Library is the beneficiary of three special endowments; one of $10,000, the gift of William W. Fuller, Esq. ('78); another of $10,000, the gift of Farrell Dabney Minor, Esq. ('83) and Mrs. Minor, in memory of their son, the late Lieutenant Farrell Dabney Minor, Jr. ('11), who died in France (1918), from wounds received in battle; and one of $5,100, the gift of the Coolidge Family of Boston as a memorial to their distinguished ancestor, Thomas Jefferson. In 1922 the late Judge George Moffett Harrison (LL.B. 1870) judge of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia from 1895 to 1917, and president of the Court from 1916 to 1917, presented his entire well selected law library of several hundred volumes to the Law School; and the Honorable John Bassett Moore (1880), Permanent Court of International Justice at the Hague, donated an especially fine collection of books on International Law, designated as the John Bassett Moore Library of International Law, which is regularly receiving additions through the generosity of the donor. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. In memory of Raleigh Colston Minor the alumni and active members of Minor Inn of Phi Delta Phi have made a gift to the University for the establishment and maintenance of a section of the Law Library, on Legal Ethics and Legal History. The Virginia Law Review.âUnder the title of The Virginia Law Review, the undergraduate students of the Law School conduct a law journal devoted to the discussion of general questions of American jurisprudence. Eight numbers are issued annually, from October to May inclusive. The Review is now in its tenth volume. From its inception it has maintained a high standard of excellence, and a worthy rank among the leading law journals of the country. Association of American Law Schools.âThe Law School is a member of the Association of American Law Schools. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. Suggestions as to Preliminary Education.âStudents, and their parents or guardians, are admonished that the law is peculiarly an intellectual profession, and for its successful prosecution, whether in a law school or in the broader fields of professional life, demands a well-trained mind. If it be true that untrained recruits, in rare instances, under diligent and persistent effort, develop into successful practitioners after entrance upon the practice, such exceptional cases but serve to illustrate the rule that out of a given number of candidates entering upon the study of law, those with sound preliminary training will have incomparably the advantage, while those without such training are likely never to rise above mediocrity in their profession. The experience of the Law Facultyâindeed, of all law teachersâis, that the standing and progress of law students may, in general, be measured by their academic preparation. Students are therefore advised not to begin their legal studies until they have completed an academic course approximating that required for a baccalaureate degree. So high a standard, however, is not exacted as a condition of entrance into the Law School. These conditions are shown in the following sections. 1. Regular Students.âCandidates for the degree of Bachelor of Laws must have attained the age of nineteen years (counting to the nearest birthday) before entering the department, must produce a certificate of good character from the school or college last attended, or from other satisfactory source, and must conform to the general requirements following: For Admission to the Department of Law, in addition to the completion of an approved high school course of four years, or its equivalent, the candidate must present evidence that he has pursued at least two years of standard college work, of which he must have successfully completed at DEPARTMENT OF LAW. least twenty-four session-hours, distributed among three or more courses, and exclusive of courses in Art, Music, Commercial Law, Education (Course B3, as described in the bulletin of the Department of Education of this University, or its equivalent completed elsewhere, will be accepted), Physical or Military Training, and Public Speaking. A session-hour is one hour a week of recitation, or two hours a week of laboratory work, throughout the college year. Credit will be given for completed courses only. A completed course is one for which the student is entitled to final credit toward a baccalaureate degree. It is deemed advisable that in preparation for entering the Law School the student select his courses from among the following subjects: English, Latin, French or Spanish, History, a Natural Science, Mathematics, Government, Accounting, and for students of more than average maturity Economics, Logic and Ethics. Prospective law students should take notice that the minimum college hours here indicated will be increased to 27 session hours of standard college work beginning with the session of 1926-27. Admission of Women.âWith the beginning of the session 1920-21, women were admitted to the Law School for the first time. The conditions of their admission are the same as in the case of male applicants. Forensic Debating.âAs indicated in a preceding regulation, Forensic Debating is excluded from the category of courses accepted in fulfillment of entrance requirements. This course, however, as one of the required subjects in the regular curriculum of the Law School, may be substituted by the completion of an equivalent course in the College of this university, or other institution of collegiate rank, evidenced by proper certificate. But the student is advised to defer the pursuit of this course until entrance into the Law School. The High School Subjects for Admission to the College, and their values in units are indicated in the General Catalogue of the University, in connection with that department. Evidence of the Required High School and College Work must be in the form of a certificate, properly authenticated by the Registrar or other authorized official of the institution at which the work was done. 2. Special Students.âAn applicant who is at least 23 years old, and who presents proper evidence of good character, and of needful maturity and training, though unable to fulfill the foregoing entrance requirements, may, by special action of the Law Faculty, in exceptional cases, be admitted as a special student, and not as a candidate for the degree. Every applicant for admission as a special student is required to make written application to the Dean of the Law School, on a blank furnished for DEPARTMENT OF LAW. the purpose, with detailed information as to his age, general habits, his educational and business experience, and his general fitness to undertake the study of law. Such application, together with such testimonials as may be required, should be filed with the Dean of the Law School not later than September 1 of the year in which the applicant desires to enter the Law School. Every such applicant for admission as a special student must (if required) pass a satisfactory examination, to be held at the University during the registration days of the session. The examination, which will be conducted by a committee of the Law Faculty, may include the subjects of English, American and English History, and Civil Government. This regulation is subject to the general university regulation as to delayed entrance examinations. Special students who fail to complete 60 per cent. of the work taken during any session may be declared ineligible for readmission the following session. Admission with Credits.âNo advanced standing, or other credit, is given, in any case, for attendance at another law school, nor for time spent in private reading.1. 1. Credit may be received, however, for Forensic Debating. See above. The candidate for graduation must spend three years in residence, and pursue all required courses in the curriculum, and pass the regular examinations therein. GENERAL INFORMATION. The Session begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September, and continues for thirty-nine weeks, ending about June 15. The first three days of the session are given to registration, and all students, both old and new, are required during that time to place their names upon the books of the University and the rolls of their respective classes. Lecture courses begin on the Monday following, and absences will be recorded against any student not present from the opening lecture of each course. Students entering after the first three days, without satisfactory excuse, will be charged a fee for registration. The session is divided into Three Terms. The first term ends December 23; the second, March 21; and the third, with the close of the session. Late Entrance.âStudents are advised that late entrance upon the work of any term is a serious hindrance to progress. The student who enters late must begin his work at the point to which the several courses have advanced at the time of his entrance; and credit for three years' attendance cannot be secured unless the student is in actual residence at least thirty weeks per session. No registration in absentia is permissible. When Students May Enter.âIt is highly desirable that students of any DEPARTMENT OF LAW. year, and particularly those entering the work of the first year, should enter at the beginning of the year's work which they propose to pursue. Where this is impossible students may register at the beginning of the second term, but not later, save in exceptional cases. In case of such late entrance the student's chief handicap (often a serious one) will be lack of familiarity with preceding courses, on some of which his own work may be based. Entrance at the beginning of the later term, therefore, is not advised, but only permitted. Where the student has thus entered in a later term, he may not make up the work of the earlier term except by returning for such portion of a fourth year as is covered by the term omitted. Expenses.âThe necessary expenses of a student in the Department of Law may be estimated at $500 per session of nine months. This minimum estimate includes all university and tuition fees, board, lodging, laundry and books. An average estimate would be $600 per session, reckoning living expenses at a somewhat higher figure. The university fee applicable to all law students (including those from Virginia) is $60; and the tuition fee is $160 for the regular work of each session. Three Years' Course.âThe course of study embraces three years of thirty-seven weeks each, exclusive of holidays. Residence for three years, with attendance of at least thirty weeks a year, exclusive of holidays, is essential to graduation. Plan of Instruction.âThe instruction is sought to be made as thorough as possible, and is given mainly through textbooks and lectures, supplemented in some of the courses by the study of cases. While convinced of the value of the combined textbook and lecture system, which has prevailed for more than half a century in the Law School, the Law Faculty have long appreciated the value that the study of cases possesses, in illustrating the practical application of legal principles. The present organization of the Law School gives opportunity for more emphasis on this form of instruction, and the case-book is now used more extensively than here-toforeânot as supplanting, but as supplementing, textbooks and lectures. The daily oral quiz has long been a marked and, as experience has proved, a most valuable feature of the system of instruction. This oral quiz is supplemented by frequent written tests, the results of which are carefully recorded, and, in the professor's discretion, are considered in estimating the final grade of the student. Practical Work.âIn the procedural courses, in Forensic Debating, and in Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, special stress is laid upon practical work. In the course on Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, an intimate acquaintance with law books and skill in their use are secured by oral and written quizzes, and finally by practical tests; and briefs on assigned topics are required to be prepared according to rigorous standards. Much practical work is done in the headnoting of cases, on scientific principles. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. Required for Graduation.âThe degree of Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) is conferred upon such students as have satisfied the entrance requirements; have attended three full sessions of the Law School; and have successfully passed the required examinations, with satisfactory performance of assigned practical work. More specifically, the candidate for graduation must have completed all of the obligatory courses (see Outline of Courses, below), and at least two elective courses, one of which must be Virginia Pleading or Code Pleading. SCHOLARSHIPS. The Louis Bennett Scholarship in the Department of Law, with a yearly income of two hundred and fifty dollars.

General Scholarships.âThere are other scholarships applicable to all departments. These are described in the General University Catalogue. Special inquiries with reference to these scholarships should be addressed to the Dean of the University. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. THE WILLIAM H. WHITE FOUNDATION. This Foundation was established in 1922 by a gift of $10,000 by Mrs. Emma Gray White, widow, Mrs. Emma Gray Trigg, daughter, and W. H. Landon White and William H. White, Jr., sons, of the late William H. White, a distinguished Alumnus and for many years a Visitor of the University. The conditions require that the income be used in securing each session the delivery before the University Law School of a series of lectures, preferably not less than three in number, by a jurist or publicist, who is specially distinguished in some branch of jurisprudence, domestic, international, or foreign; that the lecturer present some fresh or unfamiliar aspect of his subject. Each series of lectures shall possess such unity that they may be published in book form; and that the copyright thereof shall vest in the Foundation. The first lectures under the William H. White Foundation were delivered during the session of 1923-24 by Dean Roscoe Pound of the Harvard Law School, upon the subject of "Codification." OUTLINE OF COURSES. The schedule, as outlined below, contemplates an average of ten lecture periods (or fifteen hours) per week.

Registration of New Students.âBefore registration in the Law School, students who have not before been registered in any department of the University must produce to the Dean of the Law School (office in Minor Hall) a proper certificate indicating that entrance requirements have been fulfilled. 2. Registration Generally.âStudents must register in advance at the office of the Dean of the Law School and with the Registrar for every course taken, and no credit will be given for work done in any course without proper registration therefor. 3. Delayed Registration.âStudents are not permitted to delay their registration through carelessness or for inadequate reasons. Any student, new or old, who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session, and between the hours of nine a. m. and two p. m. on the first week-day after the Christmas Recess, will be charged a special registration fee of five dollars. 4. Exchange or Omission of Courses.âAfter registration no course may be exchanged or omitted except on the written approval of the professor in charge and of the Dean. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. 5. Carrying Over Uncompleted Work.âStudents who are deficient in the work of one year will be permitted to take but a limited amount of the work of the succeeding year. 6. Minimum for Which Student Must Register.âNo student, without special permission, and for good cause, may register for less than nine periods per week. 7. Advanced Work.âStudents of one year are not permitted to anticipate the courses of a subsequent year, without urgent reasons satisfactory to the Dean. 8. Late Entrance into Classes.âNo credit is given for the completion of any course upon which the student has entered after fifty per centum of the lectures thereon have been delivered. See requirements for Graduation, ante. 9. Optional Attendance.âA student who has attended the required lectures on any subject but has failed on the examination, may, on written application, with the endorsed approval of the professor in charge, and of the Dean, secure optional attendance on such subjects the following session, but subject to Regulation 5. Re-examinations are granted only in this form, or in that designated in Regulation 17, infra. 10. General Requirements.âEvery student of the Law School is required to attend all regular exercises of the classes of which he is a member, and to perform all the work assigned, including quizzes and examinations, unless excused for good cause. 11. Invalids.âStudents whose condition of health is too precarious to permit regular attendance upon lectures, but not serious enough to admit them as patients of the hospital, will be required to withdraw from the University until able to resume their regular work. 12. Conditions of Readmission.âAny student who, without satisfactory cause, has not attained for the session, on his examinations, credit for courses comprising in the aggregate at least 150 lecture periods, will be excluded from the Law School the following session. In this connection, attention is called to Regulation 5 foregoing. 13. First-Year Students.âFailure on the part of any first-year student, without just cause, to attain, for the first term, an average grade of 75 per cent. on the daily written quizzes, will place such student on probation for the remainder of the session, and the student and his parent or guardian will be so notified. Unless, in the opinion of the Law Faculty, a decided improvement in the character of his work is indicated at the end of the second term, his resignation will be required. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. 14. Absence from the University is permitted on the written leave of the dean of the Law School. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or musical clubs on excursions will not be granted, except to the officers and members of the organization. Nor, except for good cause, may leaves be granted in anticipation or extension of holidays. 15. Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors for sickness or other providential cause. Such excuses must be rendered promptly. Unexcused absences from lectures render the student liable to be disciplined. 16. Special Examinations.âNo special examinations are granted, save in cases of sickness on the day of examination (attested by physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause approved by the Law Faculty. In no case will such examination be granted unless prompt application be made therefor. 17. Third-Year StudentsâIncomplete Work.âCandidates for the degree, who have failed on one or more subjects in any year, may return the following session, and stand the regular examinations on such subjects, without further attendance upon lectures. But this privilege may be exercised but onceâthat is to say, after a second failure the candidate must take the lectures over again, on the subject or subjects on which he has for a second time proved deficient. See Regulation 9. 18. Examination Fees.âThe fee for standing such examinations as are mentioned in the preceding regulation is $5 for each examination taken. Students, who, under such circumstances, return for further lectures, and who have paid full matriculation and tuition fees for three years, pay a matriculation fee in proportion to the amount of work taken plus $5 for each course. There is no charge for special examinations granted for imperative cause. 19. Application for Degree.âCandidates for graduation are required to file a written application with the Dean, not later than November 15th of their third year, indicating the courses completed, together with a schedule of the courses to be pursued during their final year. Blanks for this purpose will be supplied at the Dean's office. 20. Required Withdrawal.âThe right is reserved to require the withdrawal of any student who, in the opinion of the faculty, is not profiting nor likely to profit by the instruction offered; or whose neglect or irregular performance of required duties, after admonition, indicates indifference or contumacy; or whose character or habits are a menace to the good order of the Law School. 21. Honor System.âAll examinations are conducted under the Honor System.</field>

For other information, address the Dean of the Department of Medicine. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. The session of 1924-1925 opens on September 18. The registration days are September 18-20. A fee is required for delayed registration. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. The requirement for admission to the first year of the Department of Medicine is a four-year high-school education or its full equivalent, and two years of work in a college of arts and sciences approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association, as follows: I. HIGH SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS. The following are the minimum high school requirements of the American Medical Association and the Association of American Medical Colleges and must be satisfied for admission to all Class A medical schools. Students entering the College of the University of Virginia for their premedical college work must also satisfy the regular entrance requirements for admission to the College. (See the General Catalogue.) These differ from the requirements stated below only in that 2Â½ units of mathematics (1Â½ in Algebra and 1 in Plane Geometry) are required. (a) For admission to the two-year premedical college course, students shall have completed a four-year course of at least fifteen units in a standard accredited high school or other institution of standard secondary school grade, or have the equivalent as demonstrated by examinations conducted by the College Entrance Examination Board or by the authorized examiner of a standard college or university which has been approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association. (b) Credits for admission to the premedical college course may be granted for the subjects shown in the following list and for any other subject counted by a standard accredited high school as part of the requirements for its diploma, provided that at least eleven units must be offered in groups I-V: Group I. English. (Three units required) Literature and Composition. Group II. Foreign Languages. (Two units required, both of which must be in the same language) Latin, Greek, French, German, Spanish, Italian, or other modern foreign language. Group III. Mathematics. (Two units required) Elementary Algebra, Advanced Algebra, Plane Geometry, Solid Geometry, Trigonometry. Group IV. History. (One unit required) Ancient History, Medieval and Modern History, English History, American History, Civil Government. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Group V. Science. Botany, ZoÃ¶logy, Chemistry, Physics, Physiography, Physiology, Astronomy, Geology. Group VI. Miscellaneous. Agriculture, Bookkeeping, Business Law, Commercial Geography, Domestic Science, Drawing, freehand and mechanical, Economics and Economic History, Manual Training, Musicâappreciation or harmony. A unit is the credit value of at least thirty-six weeks' work of four or five recitation periods per week, each recitation period to be not less than forty minutes. II. PREMEDICAL COLLEGE COURSE. The requirements given below are strictly minimum requirements. Premedical students are advised to take more than thirty session-hours of college work, either by spending an additional year in college or by taking thirty-three or thirty-six session-hours during their two years as college students. Entrance conditions of any kind whatsoever are absolutely prohibited and no substitution can be allowed for any required subject. In addition to the high-school work specified above, a candidate for admission to the Department of Medicine must present evidence of the completion in a manner satisfactory to this medical school of at least thirty session-hours of collegiate work in a college approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association. A session-hour is the credit value of one hour a week of lecture or recitation or two hours a week of laboratory work throughout a session of at least thirty-two weeks, exclusive of holidays. The subjects included in the thirty session-hours of college work should be in accordance with the following schedule: Required Subjects: Session-hours. General Inorganic Chemistry (a) 4 Organic Chemistry (b) 3 Physics (c) 4 Biology (d) 4 English Composition and Literature (e) 3 Other non-science subjects (f) 6 Subjects Strongly Urged: French or German, Advanced Botany or Advanced ZoÃ¶logy, Psychology, Advanced Algebra, Solid Geometry, and Trigonometry, additional courses in Chemistry. Other Suggested Electives: English (additional), Economics, History, Sociology, Political Science, Logic, Mathematics, Latin, Greek, Drawing. Credit Not Given for an Incomplete Course. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Credit can be accepted only when the student has a clear record on the entire course; for example, if the course in general physics is a six session-hour course consisting of 3 hours lecture and six hours laboratory weekly for three trimesters and the student passes on two trimesters but fails on the third, no credit for admission to medicine can be given for the portion of the subject passed, even though the credit value of this work is four session-hours. In all cases the student must have completed the entire subject for which he is registered. Deficiencies of this kind may however be made up by obtaining a clear record in the portion of the subject in which the failure has occurred, without repeating the entire course. REQUIREMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL COLLEGIATE SUBJECTS. (a) General Inorganic Chemistry. Four session-hours are required, including two session-hours of laboratory work. In the interpretation of this rule work in qualitative analysis may be counted as general inorganic chemistry. It is desirable that more time than this be given to general chemistry and especially that either the elements of physical chemistry be included in a 6 session-hour course in this subject or a supplementary course in elementary physical chemistry be taken. Students are also advised when their premedical work extends over more than two sessions to take at least four session-hours of qualitative analysis and two session-hours of quantitative analysis. (b) Organic Chemistry. Three session-hours are required of which at least one must be laboratory work. Four session-hours including two session-hours of laboratory work are recommended as giving better preparation in organic chemistry. (c) Physics. Four session-hours required, of which at least one must be laboratory work. It is urged that this course be preceded by a course in trigonometry and solid geometry. (d) Biology. Four session-hours required, of which two must consist of laboratory work. The requirement may be satisfied by a course of four session-hours in general biology or zoÃ¶logy, or by courses of two session-hours each in zoÃ¶logy and botany, but not by botany alone. Courses in physiology and hygiene, sanitation, bacteriology, histology, and other similar work covered in the medical curriculum cannot be accepted as part of the premedical college requirements in biology. (e) English Composition and Literature. The usual introductory college course of three session-hours, or its equivalent, is required. (f) Non-Science Subjects. Of the thirty session-hours required as the measurement of two years of college work, at least nine, including three session-hours of English, should be in subjects other than the physical, chemical, or biologic sciences. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Although not required for admission to the medical school, premedical students are strongly urged to acquire the basic knowledge of French or Germanâand preferably of both French and Germanâwhich will enable them with a little practice to read with ease the medical literature published in these languages. Apart from the cultural value of the study of a foreign language and the use which may be found for French and German in the study of medicine, a reading knowledge of one or both of these languages is required for certain desirable post-graduate scholarships and fellowships. When the student presents for admission to the premedical college course 2 units of high school work in either language, the usual 3 session-hour "second year" college course will amply give this basic knowledge. When he begins the study of the language in college, he should take at least 4, and preferably 5, session-hours in the language. College courses in Physical Training and in Military Training or Military Science will not be counted towards the thirty session-hours required for admission to medicine; nor will required courses in Bible and Biblical Literature be counted, unless the course has a credit value of at least three session-hours for one session. No entrance conditions whatever can be allowed nor can any substitutions be made for the required subjects. Premedical students in other colleges and universities who are considering the possibility of entering upon their medical studies in this university are urged to have the authorities of the University of Virginia pass officially upon their academic credit early in their last premedical college year and in no case later than June 1, of that year. Deficiencies may be discovered in this way in time to remove them before the following September. Such students will incur no obligation to enter this medical school. The prohibition of entrance conditions in all Class A medical colleges makes it especially important for the student to be absolutely sure six months or more beforehand that the course he is taking will admit him to the study of medicine. Many deficiencies can be made up by work in summer schools. In planning two years of premedical college work students are advised to take English, mathematics (solid geometry, plane trigonometry, and advanced algebra), biology, and general inorganic chemistry the first year; and organic chemistry, physics, foreign language, and one or more electives the second year. This arrangement of studies is advised because mathematics should precede physics and general inorganic chemistry must precede organic chemistry. Those who have to take four or more session-hours of college work in foreign language may find it advisable to take foreign language both years and take the mathematics in a summer school following the first premedical college session. Admission with Advanced Standing.âStudents are admitted to advanced standing in the second and third years under the following conditions: 1. Satisfaction of the requirements for entrance into this department at the time of entrance of the class to which the applicant seeks admission. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. 2. The presentation of a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended. 3. The presentation of the complete record of the student in the school previously attended, on blanks to be obtained from the Dean of the Department of Medicine. This record will be submitted to the action of the Faculty Committee on Advanced Standing, and the admission of the student, together with the terms of admission, will be determined by this committee. The Committee on Advanced Standing will not in general consider favorably applications which are not accompanied by a distinctly good record in the school previously attended. Only in case of illness or equivalent cause will it admit a student to a year in which he has failed elsewhere and then only when, in the judgment of his previous instructors, he would have succeeded but for his illness. Students are not received with advanced standing to the fourth year class. Limitation of Numbers and Reservation of Places.âThe number of students in the first-year class is limited to sixty-five: and in the second, third, and fourth year classes to sixty each. Reservation of a place, if desired by the applicant, can be made beforehand on the conditions hereinafter described. At the time of registration, applicants will be registered in the order in which they present themselves, until all vacancies are filled. Applicants who have not made reservations, as described below, are therefore advised to apply for registration at 9 o'clock of the first day of registration (September 18, 1924). Any applicant whose record has been endorsed by the Dean of the Department of Medicine as entitling him to admission to the class to which he seeks admittance, may at any time after June 25 and before the registration period in September have a place reserved for him until 12:00 noon of the first day of registration by depositing with the Bursar the sum of $50.00 in part payment of the tuition fee. A reservation so made can be cancelled only in exceptional cases. In case a student who has obtained a reservation fails to register, the deposit of $50.00 will be forfeited to the University unless, in case of illness or equivalent cause, the Dean of the Department of Medicine directs that it be returned. By the deposit, under similar conditions, of the entire fees for the year a student may have a place reserved for him until 5 p. m. of the last day of registration. Women over twenty years of age are admitted to the medical department by satisfying the entrance requirements specified above. FACILITIES FOR AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION. There are well-equipped laboratories for the study of biochemistry, gross anatomy, histology and embryology, bacteriology and pathology, physiology, pharmacology, materia medica, and clinical diagnosis. These laboratories are all presided over by trained teachers, to whom teaching and investigation are primary considerations. The number of hours assigned to laboratory subjects DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. is quite large and affords ample time for thorough study by the best methods. The student is brought into close contact with teachers who are both willing and able to guide him; he gains a very large part of his knowledge at first hand and by his own exertions, and thus acquires the habit of working out things for himself; he becomes self-reliant, a quality essential to the practice of his difficult profession. Trained in this manner, he acquires an understanding of the medical sciences and the ability to apply the facts of these sciences to the subsequent study of disease. For these reasons the great fundamental sciences receive the utmost consideration, constituting the entire work of the first two years. The methods of clinical instruction are based upon the belief that no clinical teaching is efficient which is not governed by essentially the same principles as those which govern the best laboratory teaching. This instruction is accordingly designed to enforce with the individual student a careful, thorough, face-to-face study of disease and its management. The facilities afforded by the University Hospital and Out-Patient Department are described on a subsequent page. After two sessions devoted to laboratory training, the student is introduced in the third year to the study of disease in living persons. In the Out-Patient Department and in the Hospital he learns the methods of examining patients, of diagnosing their diseases, and of instituting rational treatment; and he learns these things in much the same way as he studied in the laboratory, that is to say, by doing them himself under the direction and criticism of the instructors. This practical training is accompanied by a systematic study of the various subjects by means of lectures, textbooks, and recitations. With this preparation the student is ready to enter upon the hospital work in his fourth year. Here he has advantages for clinical training similar to those enjoyed by internes. Each clinical patient on admission to the hospital is assigned to a student, and that patient is regarded as his "case." The student conducts a complete examination, records his observations in a scientific manner, makes a diagnosis, states his view as to the treatment indicated, and keeps a complete record of the case, all under the advice and criticism of the physician or surgeon in charge. He is expected to keep himself informed of the progress of the case throughout its course. If it is one requiring surgical treatment, he assists at the operation, and thus is able to follow all the procedures of the operator at close range. In addition, students make frequent visits to the wards with the attending physicians and surgeons, during which visits the nature, treatment, and progress of various cases are gone over in detail. To carry out this method of clinical instruction the hospital had last year over 3,800 cases. The patients of the Blue Ridge Sanatorium afford additional material for clinical instruction. Since the number of students in each class is relatively small, it is clear that the department offers capable young men clinical advantages which are distinctly exceptional. Opportunities are offered in the third and fourth years for more extended DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. training in certain subjects with a view toward possible specialization after graduation. At the meetings of the Medical Journal Club reviews of important articles and results of original research are presented by the instructors and by invited guests. These meetings are open to the students. REGULATIONS, EXPENSES, ETC. Regulations.âThe records given after the regular examination on a course, with their explanations, are as follows: Passed indicates the satisfactory completion of the course and admits to all dependent subjects. Conditioned means that to obtain a clear record on the course the student must pass a special examination. Failure to take or to pass this examination is equivalent to a record of "failed." The record "conditioned" is not given in fourth year subjects, except in case of illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty. A student may be conditioned on any examination because of failure to maintain a reasonable standard of English composition. Deficient indicates that part of the work of the course has not been completed. Upon the satisfactory completion of this work within the time and in the manner prescribed by the professor in charge, the student receives the record "passed"; otherwise the record is "failed" on the entire course. Failed indicates that the course must be repeated; except that when the laboratory or other practical work has been satisfactorily performed, the professor in charge may, at his discretion, excuse the student from repeating the same; and, by special vote of the faculty, the student may be granted optional attendance upon the course, in whole or in part. In general, a student who is repeating a course will be required to attend all the exercises of the course, and will not be excused from any exercise thereof because of schedule conflicts with more advanced work. Absence from a regular examination, when excused because of illness or equivalent cause, gives a record of conditioned: if not excused, a record of failed. To pass a regular or a special examination, a grade of eighty per cent. is required. If the grade is less than eighty per cent. but not less than seventy per cent., the student is entitled to the record conditioned; but the record conditioned is not given in fourth-year subjects, except under the conditions noted above. Save by special vote of the Medical Faculty to the contrary, the following records at the close of the regular session in June require repetition of the entire work of the year. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. For first year students; 1. Failure in two subjects. 2. Failure in one subject and Conditions in two subjects. 4. Conditions in four subjects. For second and third year students: 1. Failure in one subject and Condition in one subject. 2. Conditions in three subjects. Save by special vote of the Medical Faculty to the contrary a clear record on all first and second year subjects at the time of registration is required for admission to the work of the third year. The clause in the above rules, "save by special vote of the Medical Faculty to the contrary" refers solely to "illness or equivalent cause." It does not refer to the necessity for summer occupation or to any other than the most weighty reasons for excuse from the operations of these rules. Generally the Faculty will take the initiative in allowing exceptions to these rules. A student may not take any course, either in whole or in part (as explained under the above definition of failed) more than twice. A second record of failed on the same course involves withdrawal from the Department of Medicine. Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine, who have less than one full year's work to complete, may be required to take such additional work and to pass such additional examinations as the Medical Faculty may prescribe. This additional work may be selected from any of the courses given in the Department of Medicine, even when such prescribed courses have previously been taken and passed by the candidate in question. Certificates of Attendance.âStudents who attend the whole regular course of one or more of the four years are entitled to an official statement under the seal of the University, showing all courses for which the student was registered each year as a medical student and the record (see above under "Regulations") with the grade received on each course for which he was registered. These statements will also contain any special faculty votes affecting the student's registration in this school. In no case will the University give an official certificate of the completion of a part of a course. The professor in charge may, at his discretion, make a personal statement by letter to the head of the same department in another medical school of the work done by the student in his course; but he must at the same time clearly state that this letter does not give credit in this medical school. Requirements for Graduation.âThe degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred by the University of Virginia upon candidates who have complied with the entrance requirements of this department; attended a regular medical course of four years of at least eight months each, the last two of which years must have been at this institution; and have satisfactorily completed all of the subjects included in the medical course. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Examinations.âThese are in writing, accompanied in many subjects by individual practical examinations. Examinations may be held only during the regular examination periods at the end of each term or during the vacation periods. No examinations may be given while regular class work is in progress; provided this rule is not to be interpreted to prohibit unannounced written tests or regular daily or weekly tests which count on the class standing of students. The regular examinations are held at stated periods during the session. In addition, examinations are held each year during the week immediately preceding the beginning of lectures. To the latter are admitted: 1. Students of the previous session who, from illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty, were unable to present themselves for examination in any particular subject at the regular time. 2. Students who at the regular examination in any first, second, or third year subject of the preceding session have attained a grade less than eighty per cent., but as much as seventy per cent., on one or more subjects, as explained in a preceding paragraph; or any student who has received the record conditioned on a course taken in this university. 3. Certain applicants for advanced standing who are required to take examinations by the Committee on Advanced Standing. The usual period for special or conditioned examinations is in September during the week of registration; but such examinations may be scheduled, at the option of the professor in charge, for any other time, provided regular class work is not in progress and also provided all students entitled to take examination agree to the change of date. For a special or condition examination held at any other time than that assigned for all students entitled thereto a fee of five dollars is charged. This fee must be paid to the Bursar before the examination is held. In all courses in which there is practical work, either in the laboratory or in the outpatient department or wards of the hospital, two records are returned to the Registrar's office for each student: one of these records is for the practical laboratory or clinical workâin which the record is P(assed), D(eficient), or F(ailed), the other record is for the didactic work, including the final examinationsâin which case the record is P(assed), C(onditioned), D(eficient), or F(ailed), with the approximate percentage grade. To obtain a clear record on the course a student must have a record of P(assed) both on practical and on didactic work; in no case will the two grades be averaged. No record whatever is given on didactic work unless there is a record of P(assed) on practical work nor will any record be given on practical work until a clear record is obtained on didactic work: failure on practical work gives a record of F(ailed) on the entire course. The Fall Examinations for 1924-1925 begin September 15 and close September DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. 20. Students entitled to admission to these examinations will be informed of the date of examination by the Dean. Expenses.âThe fees for instruction are 1, the tuition fee; 2, the university fee which entitles the student to the use of the Library, Gymnasium, to medical attention, etc.; and 3, special laboratory fees, as specified below: FIRST YEAR SECOND YEAR THIRD YEAR FOURTH YEAR Tuition $160.00 $160.00 $135.00 $135.00 University fee 60.00 60.00 60.00 60.00 Laboratory fees: Biochemistry 10.00 Anatomy 17.50 2.50 Histology and Embryology 7.50 Physiology 10.00 Bacteriology and Pathology 12.50 Pharmacology 5.00 Clinical Diagnosis 5.00 5.00 Materia Medica and Toxicology 5.00 Total $255.00 $255.00 $205.00 $195.00 The minimum for necessary living expenses, including room, heat, light, furniture, service, board, books, and laundry, is estimated at $400. In the course in Biochemistry, a deposit of $10 is required to cover cost of breakage. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University and the dean of the department in which the student is registered. When a permit is granted upon the University Physician's certificate that withdrawal is necessary on account of ill health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct, the fees are returned pro rata. Under no other circumstances will there be a return of fees. Combined Degrees in Arts (or Science) and Medicine.âStudents who have credit for the forty-eight session-hours of the group electives required in this university for the cultural baccalaureate degrees in arts and science may substitute for twelve session-hours of electives-at-large the first-year course in the Department of Medicine and receive the degree of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Sciences at the end of the year. For further information, see the General Catalogue of the University. The University offers also the degree of Bachelor of Science in Medicine. This degree has recently been placed in charge of the Medical Faculty. New requirements are now being formulated, whereby the degree will be open to medical students from other colleges as well as to those who have had one year of premedical work in the Academic Department of the University of Virginia. A DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. statement of the new requirements for the degree will be issued before the close of the present session. The William A. Herndon Scholarships are founded upon the bequest of Dr. Cumberland George Herndon, a graduate in medicine of this university. They are awarded by the Medical Faculty after a competitive examination held during the summer vacation preceding enrollment as a student in the Medical Department. Candidates must be unable to defray the expenses of their medical education and must signify their intention of entering the medical service of the army or navy of the United States. These scholarships provide for the necessary expenses of the student during the entire four years of his medical course and are awarded whenever there is a vacancy. Both Herndon scholarships were awarded in September, 1923, one to a student in the present first year class and one to a student in the second year class. New appointments to these scholarships are therefore unlikely to be made until the session 1926-27. Applications must be made not later than July 1 of the year of appointment. For information as to the examinations and other requirements, address the Dean of the Department of Medicine. The Richard Henry Whitehead Scholarships, founded by an anonymous donor in memory of Dr. Richard Henry Whitehead, Professor of Anatomy and Dean of the Department of Medicine, 1905-1916, are awarded to young men of promise who contemplate entering upon lines of medical work which will advance medical knowledge either pure or applied. They are usually awarded only to students who have completed at least two years of the medical curriculum. It is not probable that new appointments will be made until the session 1925-26. For further information address the Dean of the Department of Medicine. Other Scholarships and Fellowships open to medical students in common with students in other departments of the University are: The Valentine Birely Scholarship; the Thompson Brown Scholarship; the Isaac Cary Scholarship; the William C. Folkes Scholarships; the Bennett Wood Green Scholarships; the McCormick Scholarship; the Pi Kappa Alpha Scholarship; the Thomas Fortune Ryan Scholarships; the Virginia Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy Scholarship; and the John Y. Mason Fellowship. Loan funds also are available. For full information regarding scholarships, fellowships, and loan funds, see the General Catalogue of the University. The Alpha Omega Alpha Society.âOn November 15, 1919 a charter was issued for the establishment in this University of a chapter of the honor medical society, Alpha Omega Alpha, to which there are chosen annually one-fifth of each graduating class, on the basis of scholarship, character, and professional promise. Since publication of the catalogue of 1923-24 the following have been elected to membership: from the class of 1923, Silas Eldridge Chambers, Eugene Leslie Lowenberg, B. S., John Powell Williams, B. A.; from the class of 1924, Morris Cohen, Hall Holloway Ratcliffe and Winston Underwood Rutledge. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. In the following description of courses, the number of hours represents the amount of time each student devotes to the course. In addition to the hours scheduled in the third and fourth years of the course, each student devotes a considerable amount of time to practical work which does not appear in the schedule, but the satisfactory performance of which is essential to graduation. Thus the taking of histories, the visits to his cases in the hospital, assisting at operations, attendance upon cases of labor, the employment of microscopical and chemical methods of diagnosis in the hospital, require much time which it has not seemed possible to record in a rigid schedule. It should, however, be stated that each student in the fourth year gives at least six hundred hours to this required but unscheduled practical work. The session, exclusive of the time devoted to examination, is divided into a fall term of twelve weeks, a winter term of ten weeks, and a spring term of ten weeks. FIRST YEAR. Anatomy 1.âTwenty-four hours weekly during the first term and twelve hours weekly during the second term. This course begins with a systematic study of the bones, on the completion of which a part is assigned to each student for dissection and study. On the completion of this course each student has dissected a lateral half of the body. The student obtains his knowledge at first hand and by his own personal efforts. The work in gross anatomy is completed by Anatomy 3 of the second year. Dr. Bean, Dr. Speidel and Dr. Hubbard. Anatomy 2.âSix hours weekly during the third term. This course consists in a laboratory study of the anatomy of the central nervous system carried out in considerable detail. The gross anatomy of the spinal cord and brain is first considered, on the completion of which sections of the more important regions are studied carefully with the aid of the microscope. Fresh brains and series of sections of the cord and brain are thoroughly used. A reconstruction of the central nervous system showing the more important pathways is prepared by each student. Dr. Bean and Dr. Speidel. Histology.âThree lectures or recitations and six hours of laboratory work weekly during the first and second terms. This course aims to acquaint the student with the microscopic structure of tissues and organs. Cytogenesis and histogenesis are briefly considered in the case of many tissues studied. The relation of histology to physiology and pathology is constantly kept in view. The student is also given opportunity to acquaint himself with the principles and practice of histological technique. A record of seventy per cent. in this course is required for admission to Physiology, and of eighty per cent. for admission to Pathology. Dr. Jordan and Dr. Kindred. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. Embryology.âNine hours weekly during the third term. The laboratory work (six hours weekly) with sections and dissections of mammalian embryos, is supplemented by lectures, recitations, and the study of models. The course aims to give the student a knowledge of developmental processes, in the light of which he may the better understand the more abstruse normal conditions of adult anatomy, as well as many anomalies and variations. Dr. Jordan and Dr. Kindred. Biochemistry.âLectures and recitations, six hours weekly during the second and third terms; laboratory work, six hours weekly during the second term; twelve hours weekly during the third term. The chemical structure and reactions of carbohydrates, lipins, proteins, and other compounds occurring in the body. Blood, milk and bile. The chemical physiology of digestion, secretion, excretion, internal secretion, intermediary metabolism, and nutrition. The laboratory work includes the study of carbohydrates, fats, fatty acids, soaps, proteins, purine compounds, etc.; blood, milk, and bile; the digestive enzymes and the digestion of foods; and extensive qualitative and quantitative work on urine. A grade of seventy per cent. on this course is required for admission to Physiology. Dr. Hough, Mr. Hershenson and Dr. Hiden. SECOND YEAR. Anatomy 3.âFour hours weekly through the first and second terms. This course is the continuation of Anatomy 1, and consists of the systematic study of topographic anatomy, with the aid of cross sections of the human body, special dissections, and wet preparations with a review of the whole body in relation to the needs of the student in general medicine and surgery. At the end of this course a practical examination is given, covering the work of Anatomy 1, 2 and 3. Dr. Bean, Dr. Speidel and Dr. Hubbard. Physiology.âLectures, recitations, and demonstrations, eight and a half hours weekly during the first term, four and a half hours during the second term; laboratory work, eleven and a half hours weekly during the first term, two and a half hours weekly during the second term. The physiology of muscle and nerve; blood and lymph; the circulation; respiration; secretion; digestion; and nutrition, and the central nervous system. The work of the laboratory closely follows the lectures as an integral part of the study of each subject. Open only to students who have obtained grades of seventy per cent. in Histology and Biochemistry. An average grade of seventy per cent. and the satisfactory completion of the laboratory work of this course is necessary for admission to Pharmacology. Dr. Hough, Mr. Hershenson and Dr. Hiden. Bacteriology and Pathology.âTwelve hours weekly throughout the session and four additional hours a week during the second term. The work in pathology is open only to students who have obtained a record of passed in Histology. Bacteriology and Pathology are taught in a combined course. Emphasis is laid upon the medical and public health aspects of bacteriology. Autopsies and the study of gross and microscopic specimens supply the practical work DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. accompanying the systematic study of pathology. Opportunity is given selected students for advanced work. Dr. Marshall, Dr. Hunt and Dr. Lukianoff. Pharmacology.âLectures, recitations and demonstrations five hours weekly and laboratory work six hours weekly, during the third term. The physical and chemical characteristics and the mode of action of representative drugs and other chemic agents are dealt with in both didactic and practical exercises. Special attention is given to analysing and interpreting the results obtained in the laboratory. An average grade of seventy per cent. on Physiology together with the satisfactory completion of the laboratory work of Physiology is required for admission to the course. Dr. Waddell, assisted by Mr. Ratcliffe, Mr. Rutledge, Mr. Warthen, Mr. Rollins, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Nowlin. Clinical Diagnosis.âSix hours weekly during the third term. In this course the student is made familiar with those laboratory methods which are helpful in the diagnosis of disease. These include, among others, the examination of blood, urine, sputum, gastric contents, feces, spinal fluid, exudates and transudates. Instruction is given in the Clinical Laboratory in the north pavilion of the hospital, which is well equipped with the most modern instruments and apparatus. This subject is completed in the second term of the third year. Dr. Bray. Journals.âIn connection with the work in Physiology, Bacteriology and Pathology, the second-year students meet with their instructors for one hour each week from the first of December to the end of the session for reports and discussion of the current literature of the above sciences. Three reports are made at each meeting by the students. Physical Diagnosis.âFour hours weekly during the third term. Instruction is given in the principles and methods of physical examination. Attention is given especially to the study of the normal subject. Dr. Flippin, Dr. Mulholland and Dr. Wood. THIRD YEAR. Materia Medica.âLectures and recitations six hours weekly and laboratory work six hours weekly, during the first three-fourths of the fall term. A thorough study is made of the sources, preparation, composition, properties and interactions of medicinal substances to the end that they may be intelligently prescribed. Special attention is paid to their standardization for purity and potency. Prescription writing and incompatibility are dealt with in frequent practical exercises. While the consideration of the more important preparations of the Pharmacopeia and the New and Non-Official Remedies consumes the greater portion of the allotted time, the course is concluded with a critical study of many of the so-called patent medicines. Dr. Waddell, assisted by Mr. Cohen, Mr. Nowlin, Mr. Ratcliffe and Mr. Rutledge. Toxicology.âLectures and recitations six hours weekly and laboratory work six hours weekly, during the last quarter of the fall term. A systematic DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. review is made of the pharmacological action of such chemic agents as are particularly liable to cause injury to health or loss of life, special attention being given to their quantitative effects. Practical instruction is given in the methods of isolating and identifying. The treatment of poisoning is dealt with in detail. Dr. Waddell, assisted by Mr. Ratcliffe and Mr. Rutledge. Clinical Diagnosis.âEight hours weekly during the second term. Continuation and completion of the second year course in this subject. The examination, written and practical at the close of the course covers the work given in the second and third years. Dr. Bray. Theory and Practice of Medicine.âThree hours weekly of lectures and recitations throughout the session; six hours weekly in the clinics for one-half the session. A systematic course of lectures, supplemented by work in the outpatient department and hospital. The class is divided into two sections, each of which devotes itself for half the year to the medical service in the out-patient department, and also twice a week receives instruction on selected cases in the wards of the hospital. There is a general medical clinic once a week in the hospital amphitheater. Dr. Davis, Dr. Flippin, Dr. Daniel, Dr. Nelson, Dr. Smith, Dr. Mulholland and Dr. Wood. Dermatology and Syphilology.âTwo hours weekly of lectures during the third term; six hours of clinic weekly for medical section. The importance, etiology, prophylaxis, pathology, clinical history, diagnosis and treatment of syphilis are discussed. This subject is completed in the fourth year, q. v. Dr. Smith. Surgery and Gynecology.âFour hours weekly of lectures and recitations, and two hours weekly of surgical clinic throughout the session; with six hours weekly in the out-patient department, two hours weekly in ward rounds in the hospital. The study of surgery begins in the third year and continues through the fourth year. In the third year the classroom work consists of lectures and recitations, as arranged in the schedule, in which the principles and practice of surgery, surgical diseases, surgical diagnosis, etc., are thoroughly discussed. The outpatient department course in the third year gives opportunities for diagnosis and treatment of clinical cases under close personal supervision. Experience in dressings, bandaging, anesthesia and minor surgery is afforded. Surgical appliances and technique are demonstrated to the students, divided into small groups. The work in gynecology follows closely the outlines already described for surgery. In addition, the out-patient department affords practice in palpation, diagnosis and treatment. Dr. Watts, Dr. Goodwin, Dr. Bigger, Dr. Page and Dr. Helvestine. Urology and Proctology.âOf the total time assigned to surgery, one lecture hour weekly for the first and second terms, and six hours weekly in the outpatient department for one-fourth of the session are devoted to urology and proctology. In the classroom a general survey of the surgery of the genito-urinary tract and rectum is made by lectures and recitations. Especial emphasis is placed DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. upon modern methods of diagnosis and treatment. In the out-patient department, one-fourth of the class at a time obtains supervised experience in handling clinical cases and performing minor operations. Ample opportunity is afforded for the observation of cystoscopic, urethroscopic and proctoscopic procedures. Dr. Neff and Dr. Howze. Orthopedics.âOne hour weekly during the first and second terms; and two hours weekly during the third term, with six hours weekly in the out-patient department. Dr. Voshell. Roentgenology.âLectures, and practical demonstrations to the class in sections throughout the year. The application of the X-rays to medicine and the interpretation of plates in diagnosis. Dr. Wiatt. Phthisiotherapy.âSix hours weekly for eight weeks, with each of the four sections of the class. The work is given in three two-hour sessions a week, held at the Blue Ridge Sanatorium, and consists of demonstrations, ward rounds and assignment of cases for history taking and physical examination. At the end of each clinic session the case history, physical signs, X-ray plates and laboratory findings are compared in conference. The section is also invited to be present at the fluoroscopic examinations on Friday mornings at the University Hospital. The procedure followed aims to instruct in the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis by systematically presenting each step separately at first and later combining them all in the full consideration of the case, including the management and treatment of the patient both in institutions and private practise. Dr. Brown. Obstetrics.âFive hours weekly of lectures, recitations and manikin demonstrations during the year, supplemented by work with patients in the wards of the hospital. The class is divided into sections of five for manikin instruction and for examination of patients in the hospital. The manikin course forms an important part of the work, not only for teaching presentation, position and posture, but also the mechanism of normal and abnormal labor and the application of forceps. When the section is taken into the wards of the hospital, the methods of examination, particularly abdominal palpation, are practiced on the living subject. Dr. Macon. Elective Courses.âIn the second and third terms each student is required to take an elective course of approximately five hours weekly. Elective courses vary from year to year, and include both pre-clinical and clinical subjects. FOURTH YEAR. Theory and Practice of Medicine.âThe same plan is followed in the clinical work as that already described for the third year, each of the two sections of the class devoting itself for half the year to the medical service in the wards of the hospital. Full histories are taken of every case, thorough examinations made, and management indicated by the students of each division. These records are considered in the final grading of the student. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. The subjects treated with the approximate division of time among them are as follows: Nervous Diseases and Insanity.âThree lectures and recitations weekly, supplemented by clinical work during the first term. In this course is given also instruction in electrotherapeutics. Dr. Davis Pediatrics.âThree lectures and recitations weekly, supplemented by clinical work during the second term. This course of lectures is intended to point out in a brief way how disease is modified by childhood and to indicate how the difficulties of diagnosis and treatment due to early age may best be dealt with. The principles of infant feeding are emphasized and the student is taught how to prepare the food. There is also a baby welfare clinic once a week in the outpatient department. Dr. Royster and Dr. Waddell. Case Teaching, Medical Ethics and Economics, and Insurance Exam- inations.âTwo hours weekly during the third term. Dr. Davis. Internal Medicine.âTwo lectures weekly throughout the session. In this course the endeavor is made to bring to the attention of the senior student the more important problems of Internal Medicine. The relationship of recent investigations in the fields of normal and pathological physiology, biochemistry, immunology, etc., to internal diseases is especially emphasized. No text-book is used; students are referred to the files and current issues of journals and to reference works in the Medical Library as sources of information. Dr. Flippin. Dermatology and Syphilology.âTwo lectures weekly during the first term. After review of the anatomic and histologic structure and physiology of the skin the diseases commonly met with are discussed. Ward rounds once weekly for one-half the year. The interesting cases seen in the out-patient department are admitted to the hospital for detailed study. Dr. Smith. Surgery and Gynecology.âTwo hours weekly of surgical clinic throughout the session; five hours weekly of ward classes, supplemented by clinical work in the wards and operating room for one-half the session with each of the two sections of the class. Instruction in surgery is carried on by clinics and bedside demonstrations in the hospital. In the wards the students are assigned cases, whose histories they must take. They must also make complete physical and clinical examinations, urine analyses, blood examinations, etc. In the ward rounds the diagnosis, operaative and other treatment, post-operative care of the cases, complications, prognosis, etc., are discussed in detail. A large variety of cases is available and the close contact of the students with their cases and with the routine of hospital management offers many of the opportunities that an interneship affords. In the operating rooms the students, in small groups, take part in the operations, thus acquiring familiarity with technique, anesthetization, etc. Those of the class who are not assisting witness the operations, whose important features are demonstrated to them. In gynecology, urology and orthopedics the students have the same general DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. work as in surgery, consisting of the examination and the recording of the cases in the public wards, attendance on ward rounds, at which the cases are discussed, and observation and assistance in the operating rooms. Dr. Watts, Dr. Goodwin, Dr. Neff, Dr. Voshell, Dr. Bigger, Dr. Page and Dr. Helvestine. Orthopedics.âOne hour weekly throughout the year for ward rounds. Dr. Voshell. Surgical Pathology.âAn optional course. Two hours weekly during one-half the session. This course is intended to supplement the general courses in pathology and surgery and consists of lectures upon the pathology of surgical lesions, demonstrations of fresh tissues obtained from the operating rooms, and examination of microscopic sections. The student reviews pathological technique, and frozen section work is emphasized. Dr. Goodwin. Obstetrics.âThe student attends, under the guidance of an instructor, the labor cases in the hospital, and is required to prepare the history of patients and to follow up the cases through the puerperium. Instruction is also given in the care of the new-born. In addition the student has the opportunity of attending patients in the out-patient department, and each student is expected to attend at least six cases of labor. A clinic for third year students is held one day in the week in the out-patient department for recording and examining pregnant women. The patients are instructed in prenatal care, and students are assigned to each case for attendance during labor under the guidance of an instructor. Dr. Macon. Medical Jurisprudence.âOne lecture weekly during one term of the fourth year. The application of medical knowledge and skill to the needs of the law is presented. References to literature are assigned for the fuller development of special topics. Dr. Waddell. Phthisiotherapy.âTwo lectures weekly for four weeks supplemented by demonstration clinics at the Blue Ridge Sanatorium. Dr. Brown. Diseases of the Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat.âTwo lectures weekly during the first two terms, supplemented by regular two- to three-hour clinics three times a week throughout the session and clinical lectures to sections of the class as suitable cases occur. The class is divided into small sections and each student is taught the methods of examination and the use of the ophthalmoscope, head mirror, and of the laryngeal and post-nasal mirrors. In the clinics each patient is assigned to a student, who must take the history and keep the record of that patient; the case is then demonstrated by the professor in charge, and, if possible, each student makes his own examination under the personal supervision of the attending physician. Clinical cases are abundant, and during the year the student sees and handles practically all the common diseases of the eye, ear and upper respiratory tract. Dr. Hedges and Dr. Compton.

FACILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESEARCH. The Department of Medicine not only fosters in its methods of instruction the inductive study by the student himself of the phenomena presented by the human body in health and disease, but also encourages the spirit of investigation of unsolved problems of medical science and practice on the part of the instructors and students. During the past few years there have appeared annually a number of papers from its laboratories embodying the results of such investigations, and it is the policy of the department to enlarge this feature of its work in the future. Students are encouraged to engage in research as they are prepared for it, usually assisting an instructor in some special study or else conducting the research under his guidance and advice. For this purpose the scientific and clinical laboratories offer the necessary facilities, and heads of departments will always be glad to suggest and outline problems for investigation by any medical student or by others possessing the necessary training therefor. Library.âThe medical Library contains upwards of 7,000 volumes. It is housed in the basement of the Rotunda, and is in charge of a special Librarian. The more important of its current journals include the following: American Journal of Anatomy, American Journal of Diseases of Children, American Journal of the Medical Sciences, American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, American Journal of Pharmacy, American Journal of Physiology, American Journal of Physical Anthropology, Genetics, American Journal of Psychology, American Journal of Public Health, American Journal of Syphilis, American Journal of Tropical Medicine, American Review of Tuberculosis, Annals of Surgery, Archives of Pediatrics, Archives of Internal Medicine, The American Naturalist, Anatomischer Anzeiger, Anatomical Record, Annales de L'Institut Pasteur, Annales de MÃ©decine, l'Anthropologie, Archiv fÃ¼r Gynaekologie, Archives of Dermatology and Syphilology, Archino italiano di ematologia e sierologia, Archives de Biologie, Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry, Archiv fÃ¼r die Gesammtes Physiologie, Archives d'Anatomie microscopique, Archives internationales de Physiologie, Archiv fÃ¼r Mikroskopische Anatomie und Entwicklungsmechanik, Biochemical Journal, The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, Brain, The British Medical Journal, British Journal of Dermatology and Syphilis, Bulletin of the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Bulletins et MÃ©moires de la SociÃ©tÃ© D'Anthropologie de Paris, Comptes Rendus, Endocrinology, Folia hematologica, Index Medicus, The Journal of Abnormal Psychology, The Journal of Anatomy and Physiology, The Journal of the American Medical Association, The Journal of Biological Chemistry, The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, The Journal of Comparative Neurology, The Journal of Experimental Medicine, The Journal of Hygiene, The Journal of Immunology, The Journal of Infectious Diseases, The Journal of Medical Research, The Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases, The Journal of the Optical Society of America, The Journal of Pathology and Bacteriology, The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, The Journal of Physiology, The Journal of Radiology, The Journal of Social Medicine, The Journal of DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE.

DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION IN PUBLIC HEALTH. A public health officer directs the public health activities over the region which includes Charlottesville, Albermarle County and the University of Virginia. The Director of the health unit is a member of the teaching staff of the University, and gives a course to the medical students, and another to the Summer School students. A course is offered which leads to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Health Education in which emphasis is placed on public health, personal hygiene and physical training. (See "Department of Education," p. 191. After conference with the directing officials of the State Board of Health two special courses have been designed to meet the existing needs in the counties and smaller towns of Virginia. Course No. 1. Training for Rural Health Officers. Medical graduates will be received for twelve weeks of intensive training in the practical public health work of county and town. The students will be under the supervision of the Director of the Public Health Unit and will receive training in the field and office; in addition they may be assigned for special training in one of the laboratories or hospital departments of the University. Lectures will be given upon the public health aspects of selected medical subjects. The training will be selected from field work in problems of sanitation, water supply, farm hygiene, school inspection and follow-up work, rural health nursing work, the organization and conduct of clinics for the diagnosis of tuberculosis, baby welfare, dental work, etc., and in the office management of a health office for a county or town. Upon successfully completing twelve weeks of training the applicant will be recommended by the authorities of the University to the State Board of Health for work as director of a rural health unit. Classes limited to five. Students may begin work in January, April or October, or at other times by special arrangement. Correspondence and inquiries relative to this course should be addressed to the Department of Medicine. Course No. 2. Training for Sanitary Inspectors. Qualified applicants twenty-one years of age or over will be received for practical instruction with the Health Department. The applicants will be taught the fundamental duties of a Sanitary Inspector through practical training in Albemarle County and Charlottesville. They will be under the supervision of the Director of the Health Department. After satisfactorily completing ten weeks of such training the student will receive from the University a card certifying to the State Board of Health that he has the training necessary for a rural sanitary inspector. Classes limited to five. Students may arrange by correspondence for admission at any season convenient to the Health officer. Correspondence and inquiries should be addressed to the Department of Medicine. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HOSPITAL. Hospital Board: Drs.

William Ellis Pinner Resident Assistant in Roentgenology. Rees Morgan Pharmacist. The hospital is the property of the University and is under the exclusive control of its Medical Faculty. It was designed and is administered as a teaching hospital, being so arranged that free use can be made of its clinical material without in any way disturbing or violating the privacy of other patients. The buildings are arranged upon the pavilion system, consisting of a central structure, four stories in height, to which have been added up to the present time three additional units of three stories each. The central building is largely devoted to administrative purposes and general service departments, but also contains an amphitheater and suite of private operating rooms, sterilizing and anesthetizing rooms. The three pavilions are connected with the main building by corridors on each floor. In these are located the wards and suites of rooms for private patients. As at present constituted, the hospital has a capacity of about 200 beds; of these, upwards of 160 are available and used for clinical teaching. The north pavilion contains, in addition to quarters for ward and private patients, on the first floor, a specially designated series of laboratory rooms, which have been equipped with new and modern furnishings and apparatus throughout. The basement floor is devoted in large part to the Out-Patient Department of the Hospital. Here separate waiting rooms for white and colored patients are provided, examining rooms for medical cases, operating rooms for minor surgery, specially equipped rooms for genito-urinary and orthopedic surgery and for the treatment of diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat. On the same floor is the Roentgen Ray Department of the hospital. Attention is particularly called to the fact that the hospital, with its associated Out-Patient Department, constitutes a most valuable adjunct to the teaching facilities of the Department of Medicine. The size of the clinic permits the presentation of a wide variety of cases, and the organization of the hospital as an integral part of the Medical Department affords exceptional facilities for thorough study of the individual case. The location of the University Hospital is a most favorable one, being situated at the intersection of two great railway trunk lines near the geographical DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE. center of the State. A large population outside of the city of Charlottesville is available as a source of clinical material, both in the wards and the Out-Patient Department. The hospital is thus enabled to serve a large area of the State, and the transportation facilities are such that this service includes a progressively increasing number of emergency cases and cases of acute illness.

Commodious and well-equipped quarters for the treatment of ambulant cases are provided in the north pavilion of the hospital, and the service is conducted under the direct personal supervision of members of the teaching staff of the Medical Department. Clinics are held three times a week for general medical, surgical and genito-urinary diseases, which are attended by students of the third year; and twice weekly for the diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat, attended by students of the fourth year. The character of the equipment of this department and its location in the hospital make possible the use of most advanced methods in the diagnosis and treatment of cases, and the systematic and thorough examination of each case is thus emphasized at the very outset of the student's clinical experience. An out-patient obstetrical service, and provision for attendance in the home of certain cases of illness by the student, under the supervision of an instructor, are a part of the organization of this department. THE BLUE RIDGE SANATORIUM. The Blue Ridge Sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis, which is owned and controlled by the Virginia State Board of Health, lies within easy reach of the Medical School. Under a plan of coÃ¶peration agreed upon by the State Board of Health and the University, the Medical Director of the Sanatorium teaches phthisiotherapy in the Medical School, and the 120 beds of the Sanatorium afford excellent clinical material for first hand, practical experience for internes, medical students and nurses of the University Medical School. Work at the Sanatorium is part of the required course of the Medical School. This affiliation of the Sanatorium and the Medical School offers an opportunity almost ideal for the medical student to become thoroughly familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of this most important disease. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HOSPITAL TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES. A training school for nurses is conducted in connection with the hospital. Full information regarding requirements for admission, and the course of instruction may be obtained by addressing the Superintendent of Nurses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SUMMER QUARTER. THE SUMMER QUARTER. Edwin Anderson Alderman, Ph.B., D.C.L., LL.D. President. Charles Gilmore Maphis, Ped.D., LL.D. Dean. The faculty of the Summer Quarter in 1923 numbered one hundred and ten members, a complete list of whom may be found in the Summer Quarter Catalogue. SUMMARY OF ATTENDANCE. 1923. From Virginia 2525 From other states and countries 604 Total 3129 Less Duplicates 538 Net enrollment 2591 ANNOUNCEMENTS. The Summer Quarter of the University is an integral part of the University Year, the Courses in the College of Arts and Sciences being the same in character, method and in credit value as in the other quarters. In the Department of Education many professional courses for elementary and high school teachers which are not offered in the regular session are given to meet certificate requirements. The Summer Quarter is divided into two terms for the accommodation of those who can give only six weeks to the work but who desire University credit. The First Term will begin June 16th, and will close July 26th, with lectures five times a week. The Second Term will begin July 28th, and will close August 30th, with six lectures a week. Students may enter for either term or both. A separate registration card must be filled out for each Term. The normal amount of work for college credit which a student may take, is three courses aggregating three session-hours. A student may take four session-hours, provided he (a) has passed in the regular session at the college last attended courses aggregating fifteen session-hours, or (b) is in his graduating year and needs four session-hours for his degree. Exceptions to the above regulations will be allowed only by special permission of the Dean of the Summer Quarter and all of the professors concerned. SUMMER QUARTER. Physical training is not counted in the maximum and minimum requirements detailed above. FEES. For Non-Virginia Students.âA registration fee of $5.00 and a tuition fee of $15.00 for each term will be charged each undergraduate non-Virginia student. This fee will entitle the student to enter any of the courses outlined in the catalogue, except a few special courses which are so designated. The fee for graduate students will be $15.00 for each course, only two courses being allowed. For Virginia Students.âStudents from Virginia who are not teachers will be charged the same tuition as non-Virginia students. Tuition is entirely free to all Virginia teachers in all the regular courses leading to the professional certificates. To meet local expenses, the State Board of Education has fixed a registration fee of $5.00 for a six weeks' term for all the summer schools of the State, and this fee will be charged here. There are a few special courses offered to meet certain demands, but not necessarily for certificate credit, for which fees will be charged. The fee for each is designated in the catalogue. Small extra fees are charged in laboratory courses. However, Virginia teachers will be charged an extra fee of $5.00 for each graduate course taken. EXPENSES. Board and Rooms.âBoard and rooms may be had at prices ranging from $7.50 per week, where several stay in the same room, upward, according to accommodation and proximity to the University, the average being $7.50 to $10.00 a week. Most of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the university grounds. The University Commons conducts a first-class cafeteria at which meals may be obtained at very low rates. The average cost per month for three meals a day last year was approximately $22.50. Two hundred and twenty-five double rooms in the university dormitories will be reserved for women in the order of application upon the following terms: For the term, $6.00 for each person, two persons assigned to each room. No reduction will be made for parts of a term. Applications for rooms must be accompanied by the full amount of the fee in order to have them reserved. The amount of the fee will be returned for good reason, and room released if application is made before June 9th. No rooms will be rented to any person who does not register and pay the fee in the Summer Quarter. SUMMARY OF COURSES OFFERED. The following courses were offered in the Summer Quarter of 1923 and will, with slight changes, be repeated in the session of 1924. Agriculture (4 Courses), Art (3 Courses), Biblical Literature (1 Course), Biology (6 Courses), Chemistry (12 Courses), Commercial Subjects (5 Courses), Commercial Law (3 Courses), Drawing (5 Courses), Economics (12 Courses), SUMMER QUARTER. Education (42 Courses), Engineering (4 Courses), English (25 Courses), French (8 Courses), General Science (1 Course), Geography (5 Courses), German (4 Courses), Government (6 Courses), History (9 Courses), Household Arts (12 Courses), Latin (6 Courses), Library Economy (2 Courses), Manual and Industrial Arts (5 Courses), Mathematics (15 Courses), Medical Sciences (7 Courses), Music (26 Courses), Philosophy (6 Courses), Physical Education (11 Courses), Physics (8 Courses), Psychology (4 Courses), Sociology (3 Courses), Spanish (9 Courses), Writing (4 Courses). CREDITS AND DEGREES. Degrees are conferred upon men and women for work done in the Summer Quarter when the degree requirements are fully met. Sixty-three session-hours of undergraduate courses, taken in conformity with the requirements published on pages 172-173 are required for the Bachelor's degree. Those who contemplate completing their degree requirements in the Summer Quarter should keep clearly in mind, in estimating the time that will be required, that the normal amount of credit which may be taken in one Summer Quarter is six session-hours. Candidates who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. This certificate must be acceptable both to the Dean and to the professor in charge of the course accredited. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college and must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate and must give his grade. In every case the candidate must spend at least three full Summer Quarters at the University in order to meet the residence requirement. The Master's degree may be obtained by properly qualified students in three Summer Quarters. In no case will this degree be conferred upon any person who has not attended and done work three full Summer Quarters or the equivalent time in the regular session of the University. A larger number of graduate courses will be offered in the Summer Quarter of 1924 in order to meet the increased demand for graduate work. All persons who are looking forward ultimately to taking a degree through summer work are urgently requested to file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter an official statement of entrance credits and work for which college credit is desired. PRE-MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS. Courses covering all the required subjects for entrance to the first year of the Medical School, as described on page 263 of this catalogue, are offered in the Summer Quarter so that it is possible for the student to meet the pre-medical requirements in two summer quarters and one regular session of the University. PRE-LAW REQUIREMENTS. Courses are offered in the Summer Quarter covering all the required college work for admission to the Department of Law, see page 246 of this catalogue.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">STUDENT ACTIVITIES. STUDENT ACTIVITIES. THE VIRGINIA UNION. The Virginia Union was organized for the general purpose of directing and coÃ¶rdinating various phases of student activity. It has set for itself the function of initiating, promoting, and supervising movements that merit student attention and deserve student patronage. Its activities include intercollegiate debating, oratorical contests, and through the coÃ¶peration of the faculty Committee on Public Celebrations, the control of miscellaneous lectures, concerts, and other entertainments. The union gives at least one public program each term and holds informal entertainments at frequent intervals. Membership is extended to students, faculty and alumni of the University, on payment of an annual fee of two dollars. All business is conducted through an executive board composed of both student and faculty members, elected annually. LITERARY SOCIETIES. Connected with the University are two literary societies of long standingâthe Jefferson Society and the Washington Society. At weekly meetings in their respective halls they hold debates and practice extemporaneous and other forms of public speaking. Each society annually offers gold medals for excellence in debating and oratory, and each organization contests for intersociety prizes. WOMAN'S SELF-GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION. The Association includes all women students of the University of Virginia, and exists to bring about a greater unity and mutual helpfulness among the women of the University, and to promote and maintain the highest standards of University life. PUBLICATIONS. The University of Virginia Magazine, designed to encourage literary work among the students, is published by the students with the advisory assistance of the Linden Kent Memorial School of English Literature, and appears at monthly intervals, eight times during the session. As a stimulus to literary activity, the Magazine offers every year three medals: One for the best poem, one for the best short story, and one for the best essay, of student authorship, appearing in one of the numbers of the publication. The awards are made by alumni committees, one committee for each of the three medals. College Topics is a semi-weekly newspaper published by the students and devoted to the interests of the University at large. STUDENT ACTIVITIES. Corks and Curls is the University annual, its aim being to present some record of the scholastic, religious, athletic and social activities of the college year. Its publication is in the hands of a chartered corporation formed by the fraternities and literary societies of the University. The Virginia Law Review is a journal devoted to the discussion of general questions of American jurisprudence, published monthly from October to May, inclusive, by the students of the Law Department. The Virginia Reel is an illustrated magazine of humor, published by the students ten times a year. The University of Virginia Journal of Engineering is published by the students of the Department of Engineering ten times a year.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RELIGIOUS WORK. RELIGIOUS WORK. YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION, INCORPORATED. Robert Lee Hiden, President. Branch Spalding, Secretary. Mrs. Albert Edward Walker, Hostess. Object.âThe Young Men's Christian Association of the University of Virginia has the distinction of being the oldest organization of its kind in existence. It was founded October 12, 1858, and has today a larger proportionate membership than that in any other state university in America. The purpose of the Association is to aid in the development of the highest type of Christian character in the men who are to go out from this institution, and to influence them to devote themselves, individually and in associated effort, to the task of Christianizing the relationships of human society. Work.âThe Association affords opportunity for voluntary study of the Bible and also of problems of national and international interest, particularly with reference to the possibility of solution by the fundamental principles of Christianity. Through denominational clubs the organization seeks to relate the students to the churches of their choice and through voluntary service of its members materially assistsâand in some cases wholly mansâthe Sunday Schools and young people's societies of the churches in the community. In addition to this definite religious service in the community members of the Association work with Boy Scout troops and coÃ¶perate with community agencies in other forms of welfare work. Both religious and welfare activities are carried into the outlying districts under the supervision of the Extension Department of the Association; and free medical clinics which were originally established in these localities by the Association have increased in usefulness and importance through active coÃ¶peration with the State and University medical staffs. Under the Deputation Committee, student leaders and groups of students visit various preparatory and high schools in the State to conduct religious meetings, and they also carry on evangelistic campaigns in various communities throughout the State. In addition to these activities outside the University the Association, through its Student Self-Help Committee, renders valuable aid to students seeking employment; and through receptions, entertainments, and "Open Houses" stimulates social intercourse among the students. Equipment.âThrough the munificence of Mrs. William E. Dodge and family, of New York City, the Association possesses a very handsome building, which was erected in 1905 at a cost, including furnishings, of about $80,000, and which is maintained in part by an endowment of over $16,000, subscribed by RELIGIOUS WORK. students, alumni, and friends of the University. This building, called "Madison Hall" in honor of President Madison, who was intimately connected with the early history of the University, faces the north front of the Rotunda. In recent years Madison Hall has become the center of the social and student activities of the University as well as of the religious; and offices in the building have been furnished gratis to the more prominent student publications and organizations. A tennis field of fifteen courts is maintained at the rear of Madison Hall and is open to students upon payment of a small fee. THE UNIVERSITY CHAPEL. The handsome Gothic chapel was erected upon the university grounds by the voluntary gifts of students, alumni, members of the faculty and other friends. For many years regular Sunday services were conducted in it until easy access to the city churches rendered that needless. It is now used for occasional services addressed by religious leaders of national repute, thus supplementing the religious meetings of the churches and the Y. M. C. A.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PHYSICAL TRAINING. PHYSICAL TRAINING. William Alexander Lambeth, M.D., Ph.D. Director of Physical Training Henry Haden Lannigan Associate Director of Athletics James Porter Baker, Jr. Instructor in Physical Training Frederick Virginius Watkins Instructor in Physical Training Meredith Erskine Watkins Instructor in Physical Training The method of instruction pursued does not follow blindly any so-called system, but proper attention is given to all methods which in whole or in part have proved useful or effective. The importance of individual training is in every case recognized, especially where an examination discloses the student's inability to pursue with safety or profit general or concerted exercises. Students are entitled, without cost, to a thorough physical examination by the director, and are urged to avail themselves of this privilege soon after they enter the University. The examination includes an accurate measurement of the student's physical proportions, a careful examination of the condition and action of the heart and lungs, and the strength of the principal muscular groups. Upon the basis of the facts thus ascertained, advice is given as to particular exercises and the use of various developing appliances. The examination is repeated at intervals, note is taken of any improvement, and new exercises are suggested. In addition to individual work, daily instruction is given to classes in light gymnasticsâmarching, figure-running, calisthenics, dumb-bells, and clubsâadapted as nearly as possible to the needs of individuals of varying age and physical condition. The exercises are gradual and progressive, commencing with the simplest movements and proceeding to others more complicated and difficult. During the winter months instruction in gymnastics which require great strength and agility is given to those who are fitted for it by previous training. This work is terminated by an annual gymnastic tournament held usually in the early part of March. The faculty regulations on athletics require that members of the university athletic teams shall give evidence of satisfactory physical condition by passing in doubtful cases a strength test, in addition to the regular physical examination. For members of the football teams, 1,300 points are required; for members of the baseball team, 1,100 points. The New Gymnasium. The new Gymnasium to be completed early in 1924, is situated between the athletic field and the university golf links, and offers facilities unsurpassed in any American university. The main exercise room is 180 by 96 feet, with a ten-foot running track gallery of twelve laps to the mile. There is also an PHYSICAL TRAINING. auxiliary gymnasium 30 by 70 feet. The swimming pool is 30 by 75 feet, with a gallery for spectators. A general locker room provides for 1700 full-length steel lockers, with two shower rooms. There are also spacious locker rooms and baths for home and visiting teams, as well as special rooms for boxing, fencing, and wrestling, and three hand-ball courts. The administration wing includes offices for the staff, examination rooms and a large lecture room. For the course in Physical Training with credit value for degrees, see page 159. ATHLETICS. The Athletic Park contains twenty acres, and includes two athletic fields, Lambeth Field and Lefevre Field. Two hundred thousand surface feet have been perfectly graded, drained and fenced, for football, baseball, and track work. This surface was completed at a cost of about fifty thousand dollars, and involved the removal of forty-eight thousand cubic yards of earth. A concrete stadium has been erected seating five thousand persons, and additional wooden stands provide seating space for three thousand. Intramural athletics are under the supervision of the Director of Physical Training and his staff. Intercollegiate Athletics are under the special direction of the General Athletic Association, a student organization whose object is to encourage this phase of physical exercise. The faculty exercises a general advisory control over all athletics, endeavoring to foresee and avert dangerous tendencies or excess in physical exercise. The development of the general policies of the University in athletics is intrusted to the Athletic Councilâa body composed of three representatives of the student body, three representatives of the Alumni Association, three representatives of the General Faculty and the President of the University. The action of this body is subject to ratification by the General Faculty. The Executive Committee of the Athletic Council, composed of one of its student members, one of its alumni members, its three faculty members and the President of the University are responsible for the administration of any laws or regulations governing intercollegiate athletics whether originating from the Athletic Council, the faculty or from any Conference of which the University may be a member. The University of Virginia is a member of the Southern Intercollegiate Conference. EXTRACTS FROM THE BY-LAWS OF THE SOUTHERN INTERCOLLEGIATE CONFERENCE. Article VII. General Code. Section 1. Post Season Games. The members of this Conference agree with the recommendation of the National Collegiate Athletic Association that member institutions play no post-season games in any intercollegiate sport. PHYSICAL TRAINING. Section 2. Freshman Teams. Freshman teams shall be composed of members of the freshman class only, and who shall not compete as such for more than one year, and shall be eligible under the rules of this Conference, except the one-year rule. For the purpose of this rule, a Freshman is a student who enters the Institution from a High School or a Preparatory School. Section 3. Training Table and Training Quarters. No member of this Conference is permitted to maintain a training table for any intercollegiate team. Section 4. Preliminary Training. There shall be no preliminary training prior to September 10 or the opening of the college. Section 5. Contests with Non-Conference Members. No Conference Institution shall compete with any non-conference institution in conference territory; of similar rank athletically, that is, one which competes with any member of the Conference upon the basis of athletic equality, unless both compete under the rules of eligibility of the Conference. A list of such institutions shall be determined from year to year at the annual meeting. Section 6. Before any student can compete in any intercollegiate contest the faculty chairman of the Athletic Committee of his Conference Institution shall certify his eligibility to the Chairman of the Executive Committee. All lists shall be made on blanks furnished by the Secretary and such blanks shall have printed on their face the rules of eligibility of the Conference and also a certificate in the following form, which certificate shall be signed by the Registrar of the Institution, who certifies to the competitor's eligibility on a scholastic basis, and by the Faculty Chairman of the Athletic Committee who certifies to the competitor's eligibility on the basis of the Conference Rules. "We certify that the following men are eligible according to the rules of eligibility of the Southern Intercollegiate Conference and the scholastic requirements of (member institution)." Article XII. Rules of Eligibility. The following rules apply to all sports: Rule 1. Bona Fide Students. No one shall participate in any intercollegiate contest unless he is a bona fide matriculated student regularly enrolled and doing full work as defined by the regulations of the institution in which he is enrolled. A student in special agricultural or other special courses who does not present the full entrance credits is not eligible under this rule. Rule 2. No person shall participate in intercollegiate athletics at an institution until after the expiration of twelve months from the date of his matriculation there, and until he shall have completed the scholastic requirements of that institution. Rule 3. Attendance. No student having been a member of any athletic PHYSICAL TRAINING. team of his college during any year and having been in attendance less than six months of the college year shall be permitted to participate in any intercollegiate contest thereafter until he shall have been in attendance six calendar months. Note.âAttendance during Summer Sessions is not counted as "attendance" for the purpose of this rule. Rule 4. Migrant Students. (a) No person who has participated in any Intercollegiate contest in any branch of sport as a member of any college team shall be permitted to participate in any Intercollegiate contest in the same sport as a member of a team of any other Institution in this Conference. (b) Students who have pursued courses of study at one university or college but who have not participated in any intercollegiate contest, shall be eligible to participate in intercollegiate athletics at another institution, but only when they have satisfied the conditions as set forth in Rule 2âthe one-year-residence rule. Rule 5. Limit of Participation. Participation in intercollegiate athletics shall be limited to three years, over a five-year period, counting from the time of first matriculation. Participation in any intercollegiate sport in any college year shall constitute one year of athletic participation. Rule 6. Compensation. (a) No person who receives any compensation from his institution for services rendered by way of regular instruction shall be allowed to participate in intercollegiate contests. (b) No person shall be allowed to participate in any intercollegiate contest who receives any gift, remuneration, or pay for his services on a college team. (c) No person shall be permitted to participate in any intercollegiate contest who has ever used or is using his knowledge of athletics or his athletic or gymnastic skill for gain. Note.âThis rule does not apply to any person who has work in connection with a playground or a summer camp where the requirements do not call for a man with technical preparation in physical training. Rule 7. Summer Baseball. No athlete in any Conference Institution shall participate as a member of any summer baseball team without the consent of his Faculty Committee on Athletics; and such a player when given permission to play on such team shall submit at the re-opening of the school term to his Faculty Committee, a certified statement that he has not received pecuniary compensation therefor. Rule 8. No student shall be eligible to participate in intercollegiate contests if he has played on any baseball team which is a member of an organized league operating under the National agreement and under supervision of the National Baseball Commission. To the list of professional teams thus proscribed shall be added all the teams in any state which the Conference Institutions of such state declare professional and from which they debar their own players. PHYSICAL TRAINING. Rule 9. Assumed Name. No person shall take part in any intercollegiate contest under an assumed name. Rule 10. Delinquency in Studies. No student who is found delinquent in his studies by the faculty shall be permitted to participate in any intercollegiate contest. Resolution Defining Retroactive. Be it Resolved, that men who shall have regularly matriculated at any college by January 1, 1922, shall have all rights and privileges accorded them which the present athletic rules of that college accord them, shall have their eligibility judged by those rules and shall be allowed to finish their athletic careers under those rules except that the right to play in intercollegiate contests after transference from one college to another shall cease January 1, 1922. Transfer after that time shall cause the loss of this privilege. This rule shall in no way be construed to allow participation of a student as a summer baseball player after January 1, 1922, on any other basis than as set forth in Rules 7 and 8 of Article XII. REGULATIONS OF THE GENERAL FACULTY CONCERNING ATHLETICS. 1. The Athletic Council is intrusted with the general oversight of athletics, and is authorized to forbid any features in these exercises which endanger the health or morals of the participants, and to foster the true spirit of amateur sport among them. 2. No student shall play upon the university athletic teams except after physical examination by the Director of the Gymnasium (or by a responsible expert officer of the University, acting in his stead and by his request and with the approbation of the Director.) 3. Only students who act as regular or substitute members of the athletic teams will be granted leaves of absence to accompany them on trips away from the University. 4. The athletic teams shall not have contests elsewhere than upon the university grounds with any teams except those from other institutions of learning. 5.

(See page 167.) 6. Before any student can take part in any intercollegiate contest, he shall make application in a prescribed form in writing to the Executive Committee of the Athletic Council and secure the endorsed approval of his application from the committee. It shall be the duty of the Executive Committee of the Athletic Council to have the executive officers of the University PHYSICAL TRAINING. endorse such application to the effect that the applicant is eligible under Rule 5. 7. It shall be the duty of the Executive Committee of the Athletic Council to inquire into and make a record of the athletic experiences of the applicant, who shall appear before the committee and answer on his honor such questions as the committee may see fit to ask. 8. It shall be the duty of the Executive Committee of the Athletic Council, before it endorses an application, to require of the applicant a written pledge, certifying on his honor that he has never accepted directly or indirectly remuneration, compensatory gift, valuable consideration or the promise thereof for or on account of his athletic services, and that he is in the proper and strict sense of the word an amateur athlete. 9. No student who is receiving from the University remuneration for teaching or administrative services shall be eligible for the university teams. 10. It shall be the duty of the President of the Athletic Association, the Executive Committee of that Association, the Graduate Manager, the Manager and the Captain of the team concerned, the Director of the Gymnasium, the Associate Director of Athletics, and the Treasurer of the Association, to furnish on request a statement to the effect that each member of an athletic team is above their suspicion as to his eligibility to represent the University as a proper amateur player, before such player shall be allowed to take part in any contest. 11. No coach or trainer of any athletic team shall be employed without the sanction of the Athletic Council. 12. The members of any athletic team may be allowed not more than eight days' leave of absence from the University for the purpose of engaging in athletic contests; but no student who is a member of more than one athletic team shall be allowed more than sixteen days' leave of absence during the entire session for such purpose, nor more than eight days' leave of absence during any one term. 13.
