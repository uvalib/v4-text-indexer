      <field name="fulltext">ANNOUNCEMENTS. 1886-'87. The Session begins on the 1st of October, and continues nine months, without intermission. On Public Day, which is the Wednesday before the 3rd of July, the Visitors, Faculty, Officers and Students of the University assemble in the Public Hall, whither also the public are invited. On this occasion the results of the exmainations are announced, degrees are conferred, and the session is formally closed. The University of Virginia is situated in a picturesque and healthful location among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake and Ohio and the Virginia Midland, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. It has a post office, with numerous daily mails; is in communication by telephone with the neighboring town of Charlottesville; and by telegraph is connected with every quarter of the world. The climate is invigorating and healthful, and at all times free from malarial conditions; while the excellent sanitary arrangements, recently improved and extended at great cost, are considered the most perfect possible. There is a copious supply of the purest water; the system of drains and sewers is complete; and the moderate infirmary fee secures medical treatment and skillful nursing in a well equipped infirmary under the care of the Professors of the Medical Department whenever the need arises. The Courses of Instruction are Academical and Professional. The former are comprised in two departments, the Literary and the Scientific; the latter in the five Departments of Law, Medicine, Pharmacy, Engineering, and Agriculture. In the various Departments there are altogether nineteen distinct Schools, each affording an independent course under a Professor, who alone is responsible for the system and methods pursued.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACADEMICAL SCHOOLS. LITERARY DEPARTMENT. WILLIAM E. PETERS, LL. D., Professor of Latin. JOHN H. WHEELER, M. A., Ph. D., Professor of Greek. M. SCHELE DE VERE, Ph. D., J. U. D., Professor of Modern Languages. JAMES M. GARNETT, M. A., LL. D., Professor of English. GEORGE FREDERICK HOLMES, LL. D., Professor of Historical Science. NOAH K. DAVIS, M. A., Ph. D., LL. D., Professor of Moral Philosophy. WM. H. PERKINSON, Instructor in Modern Languages. JOHN STAIGE DAVIS, Instructor in Latin and Greek. SCHOOL OF LATIN. Prof. Peters. The School of Latin is divided into two classes, Junior and Senior. The Junior Class.âA student who is able to read CÃ¦sar or Virgil, and has a proper acquaintance with the Forms, is prepared to enter this class. The class begins with Sallust, or a writer of like difficulty. Systematic attention is given to the study of the Forms. The Syntactical work is the study of the Case-relations, the exact force of the Tenses, and a consecutive outline of the connections in which the Subjunctive Mood is required. Principles and facts explained are applied by frequent exercises in Latin Composition. The reading is confined to selected portions of Sallust, Cicero, Livy and Horace. A limited amount from each author is prescribed for private reading. For the examinations, passages are selected for translation from the Latin assigned as private reading. There are two examinationsâthe Intermediate, held about the middle of the session, the Final, at its close. The examinations are conducted in writing. The Senior Class.âThis class commences with Juvenal or Livy, and reads during the session selected portions of Juvenal, Livy, Cicero, Seneca, Tacitus or a play of Plautus. The Case-relations are reviewed, and the LITERARY DEPARTMENT. Syntax of the Verb is systematically presented. Latin Versification is taken up early in the session, and continued throughout the term. A theoretical acquaintance with this subject is insufficient. Prompt identification and correct recitation of every variety of Latin verse is insisted upon. A very prominent place is assigned to Latin Composition, as an indispensable means of acquiring an exact knowledge of the Language. Portions of the authors read in the Lecture-room are designated as parallel and private reading. The object of parallel reading is to enable a student to acquire a more copious vocabulary than is furnished by the limited amount of Latin read in the Lecture-room, and to afford a wider field for the application of the principles explained in the Lectures. In this class there are two examinationsâone occurring about the middle of the session, the second at its close. The examinations are conducted in writing. For the second or Final examination, passages for translation are selected partly from the parallel and partly from Latin which the class has not read. In this class due attention is given to Roman History and Literature. Text-Books.âAny approved editions of the authors above named. Grammars:âGildersleeve's, Syntax of the Verb by the Professor, Printed Lectures by the Professor on the Latin Cases and Versification. History:âLiddell's, with Long's or any approved Atlas. Literature:âBender's, as a Hand-book and Guide, supplemented by Lectures. Sanskrit.âThe Professor will also give instruction in the elements of Sanskrit whenever a sufficient number of students desire it. SCHOOL OF GREEK. Prof. Wheeler. The School is organized in three classes, the Junior, the Intermediate, and the Senior. The method of instruction is by lectures, by daily examination upon the matter of the lectures and upon assigned portions of the text-books, and by written and oral exercises. A full knowledge of the regular Attic inflections and some experience in translation are necessary as a preparation for the Junior Class. Two books of Xenophon's Anabasis, or some suitable equivalent, may be regarded as a proper amount of preparatory reading. Students inadequately prepared may often, if ambitious and diligent, make good progress with the aid of a Licentiate. (See p. 70.) LITERARY DEPARTMENT.2 The Junior Class is intended to give a practical familiarity with the simpler Attic prose. The grammar is rapidly but carefully reviewed; for translation into Greek, sentences are given out which involve the vocabulary and the idioms of the Greek texts studied. The authors read are Xenophon (parts of the Memorabilia and of the Cyropedia), and Lysias. The Geography and Political History of Greece are also taught in this class. The Intermediate Class, for which the Junior course, or some equivalent, is the appropriate preparation, continues the study of Attic prose usage, and gives an introduction to authors of great literary importance who wrote in other dialects. The exercises for translation into Greek, to which great attention is given, are based upon assigned passages from Lysias, whose usage students are urged to observe and imitate. Selected portions of the grammar are closely studied, especially the use of Cases, of Prepositions, of the Negatives, and the Formation of Words. The authors read are Lysias, Herodotus, and Homer. Instruction in Greek Antiquities is also given in this class. The Senior Class demands such attainments as may be acquired in the two lower classes, or an equivalent. The main purpose of the instruction is to introduce students, so far as practicable, to the masterpieces of the literature of Athens. The authors read this session are Demosthenes, Plato, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, and the fragments of the Lyric Poets. The Syntax of the Greek Verb is discussed, and courses of lectures are given upon the History of Greek Literature, Metres, and Historical Grammar. Text-books.âLiddell and Scott's Greek Lexicon, Veitch's Greek Verbs, Hadley's Greek Grammar, Goodwin's Greek Moods and Tenses, Smith's History of Greece, Fyffe's Primer of Greek History, Tozer's Primer of Ancient Geography, Mahaffy's Primer of Greek Antiquities, and the Teubner (or Weidmann) text editions of the authors read. For each class a course of private reading is prescribed, and weekly exercises in Greek composition are given out. The state of preparation of a student joining the school may often make it expedient to take two classes at once. In the examination of candidates for graduation, all the subjects taught in the School are involved, and the passages set for translation are selected from the classic writers at will. Hebrew.âThe Professor will give elementary instruction in Hebrew, when the demand for such instruction is sufficient. LITERARY DEPARTMENT. SCHOOL OF MODERN LANGUAGES. Prof. Schele De Vere. The subjects taught in this School are as follows: 1. The French, German, Spanish and Italian languages. A number of classic and of modern authors are read in the class, to practice the pronunciation, to acquire facility in prompt rendering of the foreign idiom, and to appreciate the literary beauties of eminent writers. A much larger number of works, mainly by modern authors, are expected to be read privately, in order to acquire that familiarity with foreign writers which enables the student to judge of the difference in style and diction in individuals, and in various periods of literature. At every meeting of the class, moreover, a lecture is delivered, and to a large extent illustrated by examples and quotations, written on the blackboard, so that the eye and the ear may mutually assist each other. In these lectures the Grammar and the Syntax of each idiom is discussed in a manner varying according to the state of preparation of each class. The treatment is mainly historical: the words, the sentences and the general structure being exhibited as they gradually developed themselves from the earliest efforts made by the infant nation to the highest results obtained in its so-called Golden Age. These lectures are again accompanied by weekly exercises, translations from the vernacular into foreign idioms. They furnish the Professor with evidence of the success or want of success with which he has tried to explain the rules and the usages of each language. After having been carefully marked, they are returned to the student, and then written, in correct form, on the blackboard. The Professor, as he writes there, accompanies them with a running commentary on the various rules that have been violated or misunderstood. At stated intervals the Professor reads aloud, so as to train the ear; at others, he dictates extracts from foreign writers for the same purpose. After the classes have become somewhat familiar with the language they are given a series of lectures treating of the History of the Idiom. Its forms, its structure and its spiritual characteristics are carefully traced through the different periods of their history, and minutely compared with each other. This gives an opportunity for instruction in the fundamental rules of the Science of Language, to which much attention is given. These lectures are followed by another course on the Literature of each Idiom. The different periods of the literature are explained and illustrated by LITERARY DEPARTMENT. sketches of the lives and criticisms on the works of the principal writers of each age. The parallelism between the national growth of a people and its literary proficiency is carefully pointed out. After each lecture the Professor remains some time in the lecture-room to meet informally such students as desire additional information. Diplomas of graduation are conferred in each of the four languages named above; and upon the student who succeeds in any two of them, sclected according to his own choice, a diploma of graduation in the School of Modern Languages is conferred; but graduation in French and German is required for the M. A. degree. 2. The study of Anglo-Saxon is mainly pursued in its aspect as the mother of English, furnishing the student the means of tracing the history of his native tongue from its earliest beginning. Much attention is given to the illustration of the history of words, their first birth, their fate under the yoke of the Norman, and their subsequent modifications. Whilst the student is furnished with a key to the rich and historically invaluable literature of our forefathers, he is at the same time given an opportunity to learn the inner nature, the inherent power and the right to supremacy awarded to his native tongue. Extracts from Anglo-Saxon writers are read, and the bearing of their works on the history of our race is fully explained. Certificates of Proficiency in Anglo-Saxon are conferred. The following text-books are used in the several languages: French. Junior Class.âThe Professor's Grammar and First Reader, TÃ©lÃ©maque, Saintine's Picciola, Masson's Dictionary. Senior Class.âThe Professor's Grammar, Brachet's Grammar, MoliÃ¨re, Racine, Voltaire, Taine's L'Angleterre, Masson's, Gasc's or LittrÃ©'s Dictionary. A course of private reading is prescribed.

Prof. Garnett. Instruction in this School is given in three classes: I. The Class of Early English.âIn this class the historical and philological study of the language is pursued, the class beginning with its oldest forms, and tracing the language, by the study of specimens, through its different periods to the formation of modern English. After a thorough study of the grammar, selected pieces of Old and Middle English prose and poetry are read, both in class and privately, with a view to acquiring a philological knowledge of the origin and structure of English. Lectures on the position of English in the Indo-European family of languages, and on the history of the language, are also given. Text-books.âSweet's Anglo-Saxon Reader; Morris and Skeat's Specimens of Early English, Parts I. and II. For reference.âCook's Sievers's Grammar of Old English; Kington-Oliphant's Old and Middle English. II. The Class of Modern English.âIn this class the study of the later language, i. e., from Chaucer, is pursued, and Shakspere is made a special subject of study. The critical study of a play of Shakspere, with private reading of about half of the plays, is followed by similar study of selected works of Chaucer and of Spenser. Lectures on the history of the Elizabethan drama and on the history of the later language, are given. Text-books.âFor 1887-'88, Othello (Rolfe's edition); Dowden's Shakspere Primer; Abbott's Shaksperian Grammar; Chaucer's Prologue and Knight's Tale (Morris's edition); Spenser's Faery Queene, Book I. or II. (Kitchin's edition.) For reference.âThe Globe Shakspere and Fleay's Shakspere Manual; Keltie's British Dramatists; Sweet's Chaucer Primer; Kington-Oliphant's New English. III. The Class of Rhetoric and English Literature.âIn this class the principles of Composition and Rhetoric are first studied, and LITERARY DEPARTMENT. then the study of the history of English Literature is taken up. Along with study of the text-books, selected works of authors are assigned for private reading. Essays are required at regular intervals. Lectures on each subject are given in connection with the text-books. Text-books.âA. S. Hill's Principles of Rhetoric; Morley and Tyler's Manual of English Literature; Ward's English Poets. For reference.âMinto's Manual of English Prose Literature; Saintsbury's Specimens of English Prose Style. Each class meets twice a week, and may be attended separately; but graduation in I. and III., or II. and III., will be necessary for a diploma in the School. N. B. Books marked "For reference" are used at the option of the student. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF HISTORICAL SCIENCE. Prof. Holmes. In this School are two classesâone of General History, the other of the Processes of Historical Change. Either class may be taken separately, or either branch of the latter class. I. General History.âIn this class the story of advancing civilization is followed through the succession of the leading nations, from the commencement of authentic and continuous history to the Age of Revolution still in progress. An effort is made to impress the vital connection of nation with nation, of generation with generation, and of anterior with ensuing conditions of historical development. The rise, the decline and the fall of States are referred to their causes. The political, intellectual and social condition of the people in the more prominent periods is carefully expounded; and the sources of their power and prosperity, or of their weakness and impoverishment are noted, so far as the necessary limitation of the subject will permit. The object contemplated is to present the human family in History as an organic unity, all of whose parts, at all times, and through all successions, are thoroughly interdependent. Text-books.âSmith's History of Greece; Merivale's History of Rome (abridged by Puller); Gibbon, History of the Decline and Fall of Rome (abridged by Smith); Lodge, Modern History; Labberton's New History and Historical Atlas. II. The other class embraces Political Economy and the Science of Society, Political Economy being considered as a subordinate branch of social investigation. LITERARY DEPARTMENT. 1. Political Economy.âIn the treatment of this department of knowledge, there is no rigid adherence to the school of Smith, Ricardo, and Mill. The modification of older doctrines necessitated by the increase of productive inventions and productive operations is steadily regarded. Attention is paid to the inquiries and criticisms of Thornton, Cairnes, Jevons, etc.; and the altered views propounded by Laveleye, Walker, and the school of the Cathedrists are duly considered. Text-Book.âMill's Political Economy (abridged by McLaughlin). 2. Science of Society.âThe latter half of the course in this class is devoted to the Science of Society. In this is prosecuted the investigation of the laws and movements, the growth, decay and constitution of Societies, in the different phases and stages of social development. The necessary organic functions of society are studied in their several forms. They are also regarded in their reciprocal relations and in their conjoint action in successive forms of civilization. All systems are interpreted: no ideal constitution is contemplated. The course is descriptive of the processes by which experienced results have been obtained: not speculative in advocacy of theoretic dreams. The Class is dependent on notes on the Lectures, as no text-book exists. SCHOOL OF MORAL PHILOSOPHY. Prof. Davis. There are two classes, best taken in two successive sessions: I. The class in Logic studies Deductive Logic, Inductive Logic, and Applied Logic. Two lectures a week. Text-books.âThe Professor's Logic, Mill on Induction, Whately's Rhetoric, Jevons's Principles of Science. II. The class in Philosophy studies Psychology, Ethics, and History of Philosophy. Three lectures a week. Text-books.âThe Professor's Psychology, Hamilton's Metaphysics, Cousin's "Du Vrai, du Beau, et du Bien," Lotze's "GrundsÃ¤tze der Praktischen Philosophie," Kant's Theory of Ethics, Ueberweg's History of Philosophy. GRADUATE COURSES. School of Latin.âThis work is intended for students who desire to pursue their Latin studies beyond the requirements for graduation. LITERARY DEPARTMENT. The value of the course to a student who proposes to teach, or who desires to equip himself for original investigation in the language, cannot well be overstated. The scope of the work is such as to familiarize him with the language in its several periods. An extensive course of reading is prescribed, and subjects for independent investigation are from time to time assigned. The Lecture-room exercises consist in translation and the discussion by the student of the passage translated. He is invited to propound such questions to the Professor, or to a member of the class, as he would to a pupil. In addition, a careful translation from some one of the best Latin prose writers is prepared, and the student is required at once to write on the blackboard his Latin rendering of it, and to give his reasons as well for the forms of the periods as for the syntactical constructions employed. Though it requires at least two years to complete this course, yet one year given to it abundantly repays the student, as the greater part of the first year of the course is devoted to the Archaic period of the language, which cannot be considered to any great extent in the course for graduation. School of Greek.âThis course is designed primarily for those who intend to become teachers of the classical languages, and who desire a thorough introduction to Greek philology as a part of their professional equipment. With such students the professor will read and discuss the more difficult Greek authors. Courses of private reading are marked out, including important text-books and monographs; and by systematic lectures, as well as by constant supervision and advice, the Professor will aid and direct the student's endeavors. As an exercise in the independent investigation of philological problems, each student is from time to time expected to prepare a paper, discussing thoroughly some topic selected by himself. Constant practice is given in Greek composition. School of Modern Languages.âGraduates in this school who wish to extend the study of any one of the idioms there taught (including Anglo Saxon) beyond the limits of the under-graduate course, and candidates for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, are expected to do the following work: They will read additional foreign authors, pursue the study of Comparative Philology, till mastery is secured, and write monthly essays on kindred subjects, which must give proof of original research. A thorough knowledge of at least one ancient language, and graduation in two modern languages, are deemed prerequisite. Candidates for honors will, however, have the choice between the two methods of comparing idiomsâeither by tracing out the kinship existing between several languages, LITERARY DEPARTMENT. or families of languages, such as the Romance, the Germanic or the Slavic, in their lexical, grammatical or psychological nature; or by comparing with each other the different aspects borne by one and the same idiom in its successive periods of life. The writings of Diez, Hovelacque, Sayce, Max MÃ¼ller, and others, are carefully studied; and the final result of the whole course of study is to be shown in a concluding dissertation specially written for the degree, and evidencing original thought. School of English.âIn this School two separate graduate courses will be arranged to suit the needs of those students who desire to pursue further either philological or literary studies. The former will comprise the further study of Anglo-Saxon and Middle English works, especially of Anglo-Saxon poetry, or the study of Gothic and the comparative grammar of the Teutonic languages. The latter will comprise the study of some distinctive period in English literature, or of some particular writer, or writers, including the political, social, and literary characteristics of the age under consideration. In each course a thesis will be required, giving evidence of independent private study of some subject cognate with the course pursued, in addition to such examinations as may be advisable. The selection of the course and subject is left to the student himself, under guidance of the Professor. School of Historical Science.âThe graduate course in this School for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy will be varied from year to year, but will always be designed to train the student in original research and systematic exposition of the results. Some historical period, with the accompanying social, political and intellectual development of the people, will be made the subject of study. Such instructions and directions as may be required to render these pursuits efficacious will be given throughout the session. School of Moral Philosophy.âThe history of philosophy, ancient and modern, with a special study of Aristotle and Kant. N. B. Graduation in a School is prerequisite to admission to the advanced Graduate Course of that School. SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. CHARLES S. VENABLE, LL. D., Professor of Mathematics. FRANCIS H. SMITH, M.

This class meets twice a week (3 hours). Text-books:âSnowball's Trigonometry, Puckle's Conic Sections, the Professor's Collection of Exercises in Plane Geometry. Senior Class.âThe subjects taught in this class are pursued in the following order: 1. Analytical Geometry of three dimensions, through the discussion of the Conicoids and some Curves in Space. 2. Differential and Integral Calculus, with various applications. 3. A short course of the Calculus of Variations. 4. The Theory of Equations, and lectures on the History of Mathematics. This class meets three times a week (4Â½ hours). Text-books:âThe Professor's Notes on Solid Geometry (Analytical); Todhunter's Differential Calculus; Williamson's Integral Calculus; Todhunter's Theory of Equations. Candidates for graduation in Pure Mathematics are required to pursue in the University the studies of both the Intermediate and Senior Classes. II. Mixed Mathematics. This course is designed for those students who may desire to prosecute their studies beyond the limits of Pure Mathematics. It embraces an extended course of reading under the instruction and guidance of the Professor on the applications of the Differential and Integral Calculus to Mechanics, Physical Astronomy, and selected portions of Physics. The class in Mixed Mathematics meets twice a week (3 hours). Text-books:âPrice's Infinitesimal Calculus, Vols. II. and III.; Cheyne's Planetary Theory. The instruction in each class in the School of Mathematics is conveyed partly by lectures and partly by the systematic study of approved text-books. The progress of the student in each class is tested constantly by his being called upon to apply the principles acquired to the independent solution of selected problems. SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. SCHOOL OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. Prof. Smith. This School includes two courses, as follows: I. General Physics. Junior Class.âThe object of the course of lectures to this class is to furnish the student with a comprehensive view of modern Physics, and to make him familiar with its methods of investigation. With the design of laying a thoroughly scientific basis for the course, a large space is given at the outset to the discussion of the cardinal doctrines of motion, force, energy, and potential, and to their simpler applications in the pressure and motion of visible masses. With this preparation the student proceeds to the subject of Molecular Physics, embracing Sound, Light, Heat, and Electricity. Throughout the course the laws of motion and force are kept steadily in view, and an attempt is made to exhibit the evidence, daily becoming stronger and clearer, for the belief prevalent among scientists, that the entire body of Physics is a coherent and harmonious system of mechanical truth. Members of the Junior Class are admitted at convenient times to the Physical Laboratory, where they may repeat and extend the experiments of the lecture room. Such exercise is entirely optional. Experience shows that this privilege is highly valued and extensively used. Text-books:âThe Professor's Syllabus; Everett's Units and Physical Constants; Daniell's Physics. Senior Class.âThis class studies selected portions of Mathematical Physics and Spherical Astronomy. The parts of Physics studied are usually Sound and Light one session, and Heat and Electricity the next. The members of this class are required to spend from one to two months in the Physical Laboratory. Text-books:âCummings' Electricity; Everett's Wave Motion; Glazebrook's Physical Optics; Glazebrook's Practical Physics; Norton's Astronomy; Notes and Problems given by the Professor. Candidates for graduation in Natural Philosophy are required to attend only the foregoing classes. II. Practical Physics. This course is for students preparing to become teachers of science, and for those who, for other reasons, desire to push their studies in Physics beyond the limits of the under-graduate course. The instruction SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. is partly theoretical and partly experimental, embracing the following topics: 1st. Theoretical.âReduction of observations. Graphical representation of results. Interpolation. Method of Least Squares. Essays on prescribed Physical topics. 2nd. Experimental.âIn this, the main portion of the course, the student will learn physical manipulation, and the use of instruments by actual practice. (1), Lecture-room Apparatus and Lecture-room Experiments. (2), Physical measurements and "instruments of precision." Cathetometer. Spherometer. Dividing Engine. Goniometer. Balance. Syren. Monochord. Revolving Mirror. Photometer. Microscope. Spectroscope. Diffraction-bench. Polariscope. Electrometer. Galvanometer. Magnetometer. Meteorological instruments, with daily use of the same. Text-books:âChauvenetâ"Method of Least Squares;" Kohlrauschâ"Physical Measurements." SCHOOL OF GENERAL AND INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY. Prof. Mallet. In this School are two courses, as follows: I. General Chemistry. The course consists of three lectures a week throughout the session. The fundamental ideas of chemical science, the relations of Chemistry to Physics, the laws regulating chemical combination by weight and by volume, the atomic theory as at present viewed in connection with Chemistry, the chemical nomenclature and symbols now in use, and a general survey of the descriptive chemistry of the elements and their compounds, inorganic and organic, are brought forward in order, with incidental allusion to the applications in medicine, the arts and manufactures, of the facts mentioned. Text-books:âFownes's Chemistry (last edition). For reference:âRoscoe and Schorlemmer's (or Miller's) Elements of Chemistry; A. Naquetâ"Principes de Chimie fondÃ©e sur les thÃ©ories modernes"; Watt's Dictionary of Chemistry. II. Industrial Chemistry. This course, in which also three lectures a week are delivered, examines in detail the chemical principles and processes specially concerned SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. in the more important arts and manufactures, upon which in large measure depends the development of the natural resources of the country, the opportunity being thus presented of preparation for such positions as those of the miner and metallurgist, the chemical manufacturer, the dyer, bleacher, tanner, sugar refiner, etc. Text-books:âWagner's Chemical Technology. For reference:âRichardson and Watt's Chemical Technology; Muspratt's Chemistry as Applied to Arts and Manufactures; Ure's Dictionary of Arts and Manufactures; Girardinâ"LeÃ§ons de Chimie ÃlÃ©mentaire appliquÃ©e aux Arts Industriels"; Percy's Metallurgy, etc. The lectures in both these courses are illustrated by suitable experiments, and by such specimens, models, drawings, etc., as the various subjects require. The collections of the University in illustration of the processes and products of Industrial Chemistry have been procured with much expense and pains in this country, England, France and Germany, and are unusually extensive and goodâamongst the best on this side of the Atlantic. (See page 63.) In both courses there are one or more reviews each week of the subjects under discussion, involving questions put by, as well as to, the students; and exercises in writing are from time to time given out to afford practice in the calculations which are needed by the Chemist. SCHOOL OF ANALYTICAL AND AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY AND PHARMACY. Prof. Dunnington. The subjects taught in this School are as follows: I. Analytical Chemistry. Instruction in this subject is given largely by lectures and experiments, and the student is required to repeat the latter at his working table; this is supplemented by much individual teaching, according to the capabilities and aims of the student. The First Class meets in the laboratory five times a week during the first half of the session; or, when judged best, twice a week throughout the session, on each occasion spending, after the lecture, from three to four hours in practical experiments. A regularly arranged course of practice in chemical manipulation is first pursued. This is followed by Blowpipe Analysis and Fire Assay of lead, silver, and gold ores. A systematic course in inorganic Qualitative Analysis is then taken up, in SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. which students are taught to determine the composition of mixtures of salts, alloys, ores, etc. Instruction is also given in Determinative Mineralogy. Toward the close of the course, the elements of Quantitative Analysis are taught. The Second Class have access to the laboratory six days of each week throughout the session, during the whole of the working hours of each day. After having accomplished the entire work of the first class as given above, it pursues an extended course of Quantitative Analysis, both gravimetric and volumetric, determining the composition of ores, minerals, clays, soils, building-stones, manures, technical products, and like substances, and involving a full course of practical chemistry, therein receiving practical preparation for the pursuit of analytical chemist and assayer, or of teaching chemistry. Students are assisted and encouraged to undertake original research, and work of this nature will be considered with much weight in ascertaining their fitness for graduation. The third class is intended for students of medicine. (See page 43.) Among the works recommended to laboratory students are: Freseniusâ"Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis;" Greville Williamsâ"Handbook of Chemical Manipulation;" Woehlerâ"Examples for Practice in Chemical Analysis;" Von Kobellâ "Tafeln zur Bestimmung der Mineralien" (also in English translation); Odlingâ "Practical Chemistry for Medical Students;" A. Classenâ"Elementary Quantitative Analysis." II. Agricultural Chemistry. In this course there is one class, to which lectures are delivered three times a week during two months of the session; or, when found more convenient to students of Agriculture, one lecture a week is given for a longer time. The chemical and physical properties of soils, of the atmosphere, and of plants, the chemistry of the processes of vegetable life and growth, the composition and chemical preparation of manures, etc., are discussed. Text-books:âJ. F. W. Johnston and C. A. Cameronâ"Elements of Agricultural Chemistry and Geology" (12th edition). For reference:âS. W. Johnsonâ"How Crops Grow," and "How Crops Feed;" N. T. Luptonâ"Elementary Principles of Scientific Agriculture." Farmers who are not regular students of the University are invited to attend this special course without charge. III. Pharmacy. Instruction is given in Practical Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Chemistry. (See page 48.) SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF NATURAL HISTORY AND GEOLOGY. Prof. Fontaine. In this School are three classes: Geology, Mineralogy, and Botany. I. Geology.âThis subject will be taught during the entire session, and three lectures a week will be devoted to it, until the examination in Mineralogy, which takes place usually in the latter part of February; thereafter five lectures a week are given to Geology, until the final examination, which takes place late in April. The aim of the course of instruction is to give as thorough an exposition of the fundamental principles of the science as possible, and to teach the student how to use them in practical work in the field. Text-books:âLe Conte's Elements of Geology. For referenceâDana's Manual, and Lyell's Elements and Principles of Geology. II. Mineralogy.âThis subject will be studied until the intermediate examination in February. Two lectures a week will be devoted to it. Special attention will be paid to crystallography, as well as to the chemical and physical properties of minerals. In Descriptive Mineralogy, the mode of occurrence, the geological importance and relations of the species will be made prominent. Text-books:âDana's Manual of Mineralogy and Lithology. For reference: Dana's Text-book of Mineralogy. III. Botany.âFor the present this subject is transferred to the School of Agriculture, Zoology and Botany. (See page 54.) The large and carefully selected collections of geological, mineralogical, and botanical objects found in the Lewis Brooks Museum of Natural History (see page 62), afford unsurpassed facilities for the full illustration of the principles taught. As free access to these collections is allowed the student, he can find in their study an opportunity, rarely obtained, for gaining a practical acquaintance with natural objects acquired from various parts of the world, and chosen for their typical character. These collections are especially useful to students pursuing special courses of study in Geology, Mineralogy, and Botany. The subjects Geology and Mineralogy are taught mainly by lectures. These are supplemented by portions of the text-books. In order to give the members of the classes in Geology and Mineralogy an opportunity to study the method of field work, the Professor, when a SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. sufficient number desire it, organizes a field party. The University has hitherto borne a portion of the expense of the party. The field work is done in the month of July, and is entirely optional with the students. Persons engaged in the study of Geology and Mineralogy may, although not members of the University class, with the consent of the Professor, and on paying $25 to the Proctor, join the exploring party. SCHOOL OF PRACTICAL ASTRONOMY. Prof. Stone. The courses in this school are arranged primarily for persons proposing to become practical astronomers. The Junior courses in Spherical and Practical Astronomy are also recommended to students in Engineering; the second Junior course in Spherical and Practical Astronomy, and the courses in Celestial Mechanics and Computing, are recommended to graduate students in Mathematics. The courses pursued are as follows: I. Spherical and Practical Astronomy.âEach twice a week. 1. Junior, first half.âCo-ordinates, their transformations, and their changes; time, latitude, and longitude. 2. Junior, second half.âInterpolation; mechanical quadratures; least squares. 3. Senior, first half.âThe telescope; the meridian circle; refraction. 4. Senior, second half.âThe equatorial; subsidiary instruments; star catalogues. Text Books:âDoolittle's Practical Astronomy; Chauvenet's Spherical and Practical Astronomy; American Ephemeris; various memoirs and volumes of observations in the observatory library. II. Celestial Mechanics,âEach twice a week. 1. Junior, first half.âRelations referring to position in orbit and in space; determination of the elements of a parabolic orbit. 2. Junior, second half.âDetermination of the elements of an undisturbed orbit, no assumption being made in regard to the eccentricity. 3. Senior, first half.âSpecial perturbations. 4. Senior, second half.âGeneral perturbations. Text-books:âOppolzer's Lehrbuch zur Bahnbestimmung; Gauss's Theoria Motus; Hansen's Auseinandersetzung; various memoirs. SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT.3 III. Practice in Observing. Junior.âObservations with the transit instrument for time and latitude; with the small equatorial, of occultations, positions of comets, etc. Senior.âObservations with the great equatorial. IV. Practice in Computing. Junior.âReductions of observations; determination of the undisturbed orbit of an asteroid. Senior.âReductions of observations; computation of the perturbations of the asteroid whose orbit has been determined in the Junior course, up to the time of the next opposition, including an ephemeris therefor. Students, upon entering the school, should have a working knowledge of the fundamental principles of co-ordinate geometry, plane and spherical trigonometry, and differential and integral calculus. A previous knowledge of French and German will not be insisted upon; but both of these languages are continually employed in the work of the school. For other courses in Astronomy, see Mixed Mathematics, p. 26, and Senior Natural Philosophy, p. 27. GRADUATE COURSES. School of Mathematics.âThe graduate course includes 1. The course of Mixed Mathematics. (See p. 26.) 2. Advanced Studies in the Modern Higher Geometry, the Infinitesimal Calculus, and in the Higher Algebra. For those candidates for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy who select the Mathematics as their chief study, the graduate course will extend through two sessions. School of Natural Philosophy.âFor graduate studies the reader is referred to the Course in Practical Physics, page 27. School of General and Industrial Chemistry.âThe principal part of the graduate course will consist of practical laboratory work on subjects of original investigation, with special attention to the logical connection between facts observed and conclusions to be drawn from them; advanced reading may also be prescribed, especially in the shape of the bibliography of particular topics, to be looked up from various sources and condensed by the student. SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. School of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry.âThe course for graduates in this school will be arranged to suit the aims of each student. It consists of laboratory work in an advanced course of analysis, comprising practice in the more elaborate processes of analysis, study of methods of analysis, and original investigations in the composition of rare or unusual minerals, and technical products presenting scientific or economic interest. School of Natural History and Geology.âIn this School no fixed course of study will be laid down for graduates. Subjects will be selected from one or more of the branches included in the School, and assigned to the students. As far as possible, original research will be required in the treatment of the subjects chosen. School of Practical Astronomy.âA prescribed course in this School, to be agreed upon in a conference of the Professors interested, will be considered as the equivalent of the graduate course in either Mathematics or Natural Philosophy for graduates of these schools. N. BâGraduation in a School is prerequisite to admission to the advanced Graduate Course of that School; and for admission to a graduate course in the School of General and Industrial Chemistry, or in the School of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry, previous graduation in both the schools named will be required. But this part of the requirement may be waived, provided satisfactory evidence be furnished that the student has already made equivalent attainments elsewhere. ACADEMICAL DEPARTMENT. PREPARATION FOR THE ACADEMICAL SCHOOLS. Some special preparation for the courses taught in the Schools of Latin, Greek and Mathematics will be found indispensable. But even for these Schools it is more important that the preliminary studies should have been careful and accurate in quality than that they should be extensive. For the other Schools the essentials of a plain education in the common school branches constitute the only indispensable preparation. In all the Schools alike, however, the student who has had the benefit of mental training, and who brings with him good and well-established habits of study, will derive increased profit from the University instruction because of these advantages. In order to encourage the desire for a proper preliminary training, the Legislature has made the free tuition of Virginia Academic students conditional upon their reasonable preparation for the schools which they wish to enter. (See p. 71.) But it has never been the policy of the University to reject any student merely because of deficient preparation. The standards of teaching and of examination can be otherwise maintained; and experience has shown in a multitude of instances that young men of vigorous mind and earnest purposes of diligence, brought hither by a laudable ambition to excel, may overcome all disadvantages, and become conspicuous among their fellows for success in study. On the other hand, such cases of failure to profit by the University teaching as sometimes occur are traceable, in nearly or quite all cases, whatever may have been the state of preparation, to ill health, to idle or vicious propensities, or at least to a lack of earnest and resolute diligence. In such cases, as they arise, the proper remedy is applied; it is not thought useful or necessary to guard against their occasional occurrence by indiscriminate rejections at the outset. The attention of the young men of Virginia who have been taught in the Public Schools is especially invited to the advantages here offered them for extended and substantial courses of study in those branches for which their preparation is fairly adequate, and to which they are admitted under the law without payment of tuition fees. ACADEMICAL SCHOOLS. COURSES OF LIBERAL STUDY. The system of independent schools, in the Academic, as well as the other Departments of the University, assumes that opportunities for study and instruction are privileges to be sought voluntarily and eagerly. Students are therefore allowed to elect for themselves the courses of study to which they are led by their individual tastes and proposed pursuits in life. The wisdom of the founder in establishing such a system has been amply vindicated by time and experience; and in recent years many institutions of higher education in the United States have, to a greater or less extent, adopted methods involving the same principle. And not alone to those who wish to make special attainments in single departments of knowledge does this freedom of election commend itself; it has serious advantages also for most of those students who seek the common goal of liberal education by ways which varying aptitude, varying preparation, or varying opportunities render of necessity divergent. But numerous and carefully arranged groups of studies leading to liberal degrees have been marked out; and it is generally best for the academic student from the outset to follow a definite plan of studies, under competent advice, leading to one or more of these degrees, though not necessarily limited by the requirements for any degree. A course of study leading directly to an academical degree will have one or the other of two general characters:âit will be a specialized literary or scientific course on the one hand, or it will have a broader character, embracing both literary and scientific studies. Of the former character will be courses of study leading to the degrees of Bachelor of Letters and Doctor of Letters, and to the degrees of Bachelor of Science and Doctor of Science; while literary and scientific studies will be united in the courses leading to the degrees of Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, Bachelor of Philosophy, and Doctor of Philosophy. The attainments required by the law for the several degrees are stated elsewhere (see pp. 59, 60); but for the guidance of students in arranging their plans of study some of the explanations most often needed are given here. Three different groups of studies lead to the degree of Bachelor of Letters, as follows: (1). Latin. (2). Latin. (3). Latin. Greek. Greek. Greek. Moral Philosophy. Moral Philosophy. Moral Philosophy. Modern Languages. English. Historical Science. ACADEMICAL SCHOOLS. In the first of these groups a still further variation may be introduced, as the choice of the two languages to be pursued in the School of Modern Languages is varied. (See p. 19.) For the degree of Bachelor of Science the requirement is rigid and admits of no variation, save in the order of taking up the several studies; and the same may be said with reference to the degree of Master of Arts. The number of possible groups of studies leading to the degree of Bachelor of Philosophy is very considerable. Any three of the six Literary Schools may be selectedâsay Latin, Greek, and Moral Philosophy; or French and German, English and Historical Science; or Latin, Greek and English (the number of possible combinations is twenty). After making a choice among the Literary Schools, the student will select any two of the four Schools in the Scientific Departmentâsay Natural Philosophy and Mathematics, or General Chemistry and Natural Philosophy (the number of possible combinations is six). The candidate for the degree of Bachelor of Arts also has a very wide liberty in arranging his group of studies. By way of illustrating the meaning of the law stated at p. 60, two specimen forms of compliance with its three-fold requirement are here sketched: A. (1) Distinctions in B. (1) Distinctions in Senior Latin. Senior Latin. Junior and Intermediate Greek. Junior and Intermediate Greek. Junior Physics. Junior Physics. Logic. Philosophy. A Proficiency in A Proficiency in Junior and Intermediate Mathematics. Junior and Intermediate Mathematics. (2). A Distinction in (2). Proficiencies in General Chemistry. Geology and A Diploma in Rhetoric and English Literature. French. (3). Graduation in (3). Graduation in Mathematics and English and Moral Philosophy. Historical Science. The student should seek competent advice, not only in relation to the choice, but the order also of his studies. Upon this subject no fixed law can be laid down equally applicable in all cases. ACADEMICAL SCHOOLS. SPECIAL COURSES OF INSTRUCTION FOR TEACHERS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. White male teachers and superintendents of the Free Schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Schools of the Academical Department of the University without payment of fees. Applicants will present certificates from the State Superintendent, or from their respective County Superintendents, that they have been teachers or superintendents in the Public Free Schools. In order still more fully to open the doors of university training to their fellow-workers in the Public School System of the State, the members of the Faculty will offer the following special courses of instruction. The bracketed numerals show the number of weekly lessons: Latin: 1. A special course in CÃ¦sar (or Ovid or Sallust) and Latin Composition. [3.] 2. The regular course in Cicero (or Horace) with the Junior Class. [3.] Greek: A special course in Xenophon's Anabasis. [2.] English: A special course in Historical English Grammar. [2.] French: 1.

Students matriculated under the above provision may also attend any of the regular classes in the Academical Department of the University without charge. At the conclusion of the courses certificates of attendance will be given by the several Professors to those students whose work is approved. Applicants for admission are requested to send in their names to the Chairman of the Faculty not later than March 15. University dormitories will be assigned free of rent, in the order of application, as far as the vacant rooms will serve. Lodging can also be had near the University, or in Charlottesville. The only necessary expenses will be for board, lights and washing, which will together cost from $3.50 to $5.50 a week. For further information address the Chairman of the Faculty. LOCAL EXAMINATIONS. Written examinations, first instituted in 1878, will be held on Thursday, April 28, 1887, and the two following days at different centres by examiners appointed by the University. Centres will be established wherever an examination is desired by a sufficient number of candidates of either sex. The examinations, which are of two grades, will cover the subjects usually taught in the higher public and private schools. Candidates who pass with credit will receive certificates to that effect; and twenty gold medals will be awarded in 1887 for distinguished merit. Every candidate admitted to examination will be required to pay a fee of two dollars to defray necessary expenses. The latest day of entry is April 15, 1887. Teachers and others interested will please apply for further information to the Chairman of the Faculty.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. LAW DEPARTMENT. JOHN B. MINOR, LL. D., Professor of Common and Statute Law. JAS. H. GILMORE, Professor of Constitutional and International Law, Equity, etc. This Department is organized with a view to acquaint the student familiarly and practically with the principles of his profession. The instruction is as thorough as possible, and is given partly through textbooks and partly through lectures, with daily examination upon both. A Moot-court, in connection with other instruction, tends to perfect the student in the details of practice. Under the immediate supervision of the Professors, he is required to pronounce opinions upon supposed cases; to devise and institute remedies by suit or otherwise; to conduct suits at law and in equity from their inception, through all their stages; to draw wills, conveyances, and other assurances; and in short, to perform most of the functions of a practising lawyer. The Department comprises two Schools, each of which is divided into two classes, and the course of study is as follows: SCHOOL OF COMMON AND STATUTE LAW. Prof. Minor. Junior Class:âMinor's Institutes of Common and Statute Law, namely: Vol. I., The Rights which Relate to the Person. Vol. II., The Rights which Relate to Real Property. Minor's Synopsis of Criminal Law. Blackstone's Commentaries. Senior Class:âMinor's Institutes of Common and Statute Law, namely: Vol. IV., The Practice of the Law in Civil Cases, including Pleading. Vol. III., The Rights which Relate to Personal Property. Stephen on Pleading. For reference:âVirginia Code (1873); Revised Statutes of United States. LAW DEPARTMENT. SCHOOL OF CONSTITUTIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW, MERCANTILE LAW, EVIDENCE, AND EQUITY. Prof. Gilmore. Junior Class:âVattel's International Law, with Lectures; Lectures on Government; Federalist. Senior Class:âSmith's Mercantile Law; Greenleaf's Evidence; Adams's Equity, with Lectures. For reference:âStephen's Digest of the Law of Evidence, (Chase's edition preferred.) In the Department of Law, the degree of Bachelor of Law is conferred upon those who, upon examination conducted in writing, manifest an intimate acquaintance with the subjects taught in all the classes; and to those who, upon like examination, exhibit a competent knowledge of International and Constitutional Law, including the Science of Government, a Certificate of Proficiency is awarded. In order to obtain the degree, the whole of the course must be completed here, no preliminary examination being had upon entering. The course is designed for two sessions, and in general it is not prudent to devote less to it; the future professional success of the student depending much upon his full mastery of it. It is a maxim sanctioned by long and wide experience, that "he who is not a good lawyer when he comes to the bar, will seldom be a good one afterwards." And in order to such thorough acquaintance with the elements of the law, thought is requisite as well as reading; and for the purpose of thought, there must be time to digest, as well as industry to acquire. One cannot expect to gorge himself with law, as a boa constrictor does with masses of food, and then digest it afterwards; the process of assimilation must go on, if it is to proceed healthfully and beneficially, at the same time with the reception of the knowledge. So the athlete judges, who wishes to train the physical man to the most vigorous development, and the intellectual athlete should imitate the example. But whilst the student is advised, as a general rule, not to attempt to complete the course in a single session, yet, if he chooses to essay it (as some do successfully), he is admitted to the graduating examinations, and if he attains the standard required, he is entitled to the degree. The expenses of a Law student are from $269 to $324 for the session; books will cost about $80 additional, and a degree, if taken, $15. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. JAMES L. CABELL, M. A., M. D., LL.

COURSES OF STUDY IN GENERAL. The session of the Medical Department continues through the full nine months of the University session. This arrangement enables five professors to do thoroughly the work which is often allotted to a larger number in institutions whose session is much shorter. The importance of a knowledge of Chemistry, Anatomy and Physiology, before commencing the study of the more practical branches, is fully recognized; and the course of study is so arranged, that during the first half session the instruction is in these important elementary branches. During the same time the subjects of Medical Jurisprudence and Obstetrics, especially the mechanical features of the latter branch, are studied by the class. The courses and methods of instruction in the several Schools of the Department are as follows: SCHOOL OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY. Prof. Mallet. In this School the students are taught thoroughly Chemical Physics and the principles of Chemistry; and their attention is directed, whenever an occasion presents itself, to the application of chemical principles to the Practice of Medicine, Therapeutics, Toxicology and Sanitary Science. (See p. 28.) Text-Book:âFownes's Chemistry. For reference:âCharles's Physiological and Pathological Chemistry; Wormley's Micro-Chemistry of Poisons. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. SCHOOL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY AND PHARMACY. Prof. Dunnington. In this School two distinct courses of instruction are offered to students of Medicine: I. A course, intended to supplement the instruction in General Chemistry, consisting of sixteen lessons in the laboratory upon the practical applications of Chemistry to Medicine. Students are taught the methods of detecting poisons and of examining animal products (blood, urine, etc.), chemically and under the microscope. For this course, if taken, a fee of $15 is charged; the cost of material is $5 additional. II A course in practical Pharmaceutical manipulations. This instruction is offered to those members of the regular Medical classes who desire to avail themselves of it, without extra charge for tuition, provided they engage to attend throughout the course. The benefit of such instruction to physicians, who may often be obliged to put up their own prescriptions, is obvious. The charge for material consumed is $5. Both the courses in this School are optional, no examination in them being required for the Medical degree. SCHOOL OF ANATOMY AND MATERIA MEDICA. Prof. Towles. I. Anatomy.âThe instruction in Descriptive, Surgical, and Topographical Anatomy is given both by didactic lectures and in the course of Practical Anatomy as taught in the Dissecting Hall. The endeavor is, throughout, to render the teaching as completely practical as possible; scarcely is there a statement made that is not illustrated by its exhibition, either on actual dissection or on the preparation of a dissection; the effort being to convey knowledge in the so-called natural method; i. e., by mental imagery formed by repeated observations of nature. This is accomplished by exhibiting to the student and requiring him to handle the dissected parts and preparations made therefrom. The equipment of the school for this purpose is most ample; and, in addition to the numerous preparations and dissections, there are models and anatomical paintings, representing the greater part of the anatomy of the body. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. For the course in Practical Anatomy, dissecting material, obtained under a permissive law of the State, is abundantly supplied without cost to the student. Each medical student, however many sessions he may have attended, is required to dissect, under the constant and careful supervision of the Demonstrator. Attendance in the dissecting-room is compulsory, a strict record being kept in the case of each student. Besides the class-examination, which precedes each lecture, and the other examinations to be mentioned hereafter, each student is required to stand seven practical examinations on anatomy, one upon osteology, four upon the different parts of the muscular system, one on the viscera, and one on the vessels and nerves. These examinations are oral and private, each student being examined alone. They consist of the identification of the truths of anatomy on the bones, the cadaver, and the dissected cadaver, and are thus a perfect test of the student's acquaintance with the gross structure of the body. II. Materia Medica and Therapeutics.âThe lectures on Materia Medica occur in the latter half of the session, after the student has obtained a knowledge of the primary branches, a prerequisite to the proper understanding of the subject. Particular stress is laid upon the physiological action and rational therapeutical applications of drugs. The physical properties of drugs are taught by requiring the student to learn them from specimens, a complete collection being provided, which contains specimens both of all the crude drugs and of all their preparations, which have been dealt with in the lectures. Text-book:âWilson's or Gray's or Weisse's Anatomy; Bruce's Materia Medica and Therapeutics. SCHOOL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND SURGERY. Prof. Cabell. I. In Physiology the lectures are illustrated by plates, and the students are instructed in Histology as well as in Physiology proper. Much attention is given throughout the course to the practical bearings of physiological and histological facts on pathology, and their relations to the nature and treatment of disease. Extra lectures are given, commencing about the middle of December, at which the students are questioned on all that part of Physiology which they have studied previously. It has been found that these "review lectures" are very useful to the students as a preparation for the final examinations. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. II. In Surgery especial attention is given to the causation and pathology of the various surgical affections, and the lectures are illustrated by excellent paintings and by morbid specimens. The applications of splints and apparatus for the different fractures and the details of minor surgery are practically exhibited to the class. Text-books:âYeo's Manual of Physiology; "Human Physiology," by Henry Power (American edition); Wilson's Manual of Hygiene and Sanitary Science (fifth edition, 1884); Ashurst's Surgery; Klein's Histology. For occasional reference: Foster's Physiology; Landois's Physiology; and a few monographs on special subjects. SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, OBSTETRICS, AND MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE. Prof. Dabney. I. In Medical Jurisprudence the student is instructed in the principles of the science, and is taught how to apply these principles when he is summoned as a witness in a court of law. II In Obstetrics instruction is given by lectures, and the mechanical principles involved in the study are explained and illustrated by the use of suitable preparations and models. The student is drilled in this part of the subject during the early part of the course, and attention is subsequently called to the diseases and accidents incident to pregnancy and the puerperal state. Each student is also taught practically the various manipulations, both manual and instrumental. III. In Practice of Medicine especial attention is given to the Principles of the subject, the aim of the teacher being to instruct the students as thoroughly as possible in the causation of diseases and the morbid changes which occur in the different tissues. The lectures are illustrated by morbid specimens, both coarse and microscopic, and each student has the opportunity of examining these specimens for himself. Each student furthermore is taught the method of making a physical examination of a patient, and is required to learn by actual examination, under the supervision of the Professor, the normal appearances and sounds in the different regions of the body and over the different organs. IV. Classes have also been established in Practical Microscopy. Attendance in these classes is optional, but the desire to make good use of the opportunity thus offered seems to be general. Each student is MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. taught practically how to use the microscope, to cut and stain sections of tissues, to examine urine and blood, etc. In addition to a knowledge of microscopic manipulation thus obtained, it is found that students can get a far clearer idea of morbid anatomy and pathology in this way. There is no fee for this course. Text-books:âReese's Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology; Playfair's Midwifery (last edition); Loomis's Practice of Medicine; Flint's or Loomis's Physical Diagnosis; Green's Pathology; Friedlander's Practical Microscopy. INSTRUCTION IN THE DISPENSARY. A Free Dispensary is now in operation at the University, under the charge of the Medical Professors. Here the students are taught the methods of examining patients, and the changes which occur in the normal functions of the body as a result of disease. In recognition of the impossibility of giving practical instruction by the ordinary clinical lectures, the class is divided into sections, so that each student may have the opportunity of examining patients for himself, under the guidance of the Professor. In addition to the patients who come to the Dispensary, others who are too sick to attend there are visited at their homes. EXAMINATIONS. The examinations are of two characters: 1st. The daily oral examinations; 2nd. Written examinations, Intermediate and Final. The value of the daily examination or recitations on the subject of the preceding lecture can scarcely be overestimated; students who would not otherwise take advantage of their opportunities for instruction being thereby stimulated to increased exertion. These recitations also give the Professor an opportunity of finding out the difficulties which the student may have encountered in the previous lecture, and of correcting erroneous impressions which he may have formed. The intermediate written examinations stimulate the student to proper reviews, and serve to familiarize him with the form and methods of examination for graduation. The examinations for graduation are rigid written examinations, in which the answers to the questions must be full and comprehensive. Besides these examinations, there is a general oral review at the very close of the session on all the different branches on which the student MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. has graduated during either that session or some preceding one; this review, being intended to test the permanent acquisition of such general knowledge as every practitioner of medicine should possess, need call for no special preparation. Heartily approving the regulation of medical practice by the State, and the establishment of State Boards of Medical Examiners, entirely independent of medical schools, the Faculty have introduced these oral reviews in order to prepare students more thoroughly for the State Examinations in Virginia, and the other States which hold such examinations, as well as for entrance into the Medical Corps of the Army and Navy and the Marine Hospital service. REQUISITES FOR GRADUATION. Graduation in Medicine, as in the other Departments and Schools of the University of Virginia, does not depend upon the length of time which may have been spent in the study of medicine, but upon the real preparation of the student, as indicated by rigid examinations, which he is called upon to stand. Hence it is possible for a diligent student to graduate in one session; but the severe and protracted labor necessary for this purpose is attended with evils of which the medical faculty is fully conscious; and it is considered far better for a student to attend lectures for two sessions, giving his attention during the first session to the subjects of Chemistry, Anatomy, and Physiology especially, and endeavoring to obtain only a general knowledge of the other branches, so that he may be the better enabled to complete the course and to profit by the instruction of the second year. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses of a medical student will be from about $315 to about $365, varying as the individual may choose plainer or more expensive board. No estimate is here included for books, travelling expenses, or pocket-money. DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACY. J. W. MALLET, Ph. D., M. D., F. R. S., Professor of General Chemistry. F. P. DUNNINGTON, B. S., Professor of Analytical Chemistry and Pharmacy. W. B. TOWLES, M. D:, Professor of Materia Medica. J. R. PAGE, M. D., Professor of Botany. In establishing this Department, which is intended to give thorough and practical instruction in the branches of science important to the properly-trained Pharmacist, it has not been found necessary to establish new schools in the University. By making use of the ample equipments already available, and by a suitable arrangement of the instruction already provided for in the existing schools, it has been found possible to offer liberal advantages to students of Pharmacy. The course of instruction continues through the nine months of the University session. A well-prepared student may complete the course in one session; but two sessions would give a larger opportunity for practical experience in the laboratory. The teaching is by systematic lectures, combined with the study of text-books and practical laboratory work, under the supervision of the Professors. The instruction in the Department is arranged as follows: General Chemistry.âChemical Physics, Inorganic and Organic Chemistry. (The course described on p. 28.) Analytical Chemistry.â(a), The work of the first class in Analytical Chemistry (except Fire Assaying), comprising a full course in Qualitative Analysis, together with practice in the preparation of chemicals and in the detection of impurities in commercial articles. (See p. 29.) (b), Sixteen lectures in the practical applications of Chemistry to Medicine, (the detection of poisons, chemical and microscopic examination of animal products, urine, blood, etc.) Pharmacy.âPharmaceutical Manipulation in the preparation and dispensing of Medicines, with additional practice in connection with the Dispensary of the University, for three hours each week throughout the session. (For laboratory equipment, see p. 63.) DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACY. Botany.âPhysiological, Structural, and Systematic Botany. The time is mainly devoted to the study of flowering plants, their analysis and determination. Cryptogamic Botany, especially fungi and fungoid diseases of plants, receive as much attention as possible. The class commences about the middle of March, and continues until the end of the session. Materia Medica.âThe regular course of the Medical Department on the Identification, Therapeutic uses, and Medical application of Drugs. (See p. 44.) Candidates for the degree of Graduate in Pharmacy will be required to complete the prescribed course in each of the subjects named above, and to pass successfully the regular examinations held in the several schools in which the instruction is given. Students are advised to devote two sessions to the course. This will give an opportunity for taking, in addition to the instruction described above, a course in Industrial Chemistry, (see p. 28), or the second class in Analytical Chemistry (see p. 30). The following order of studies is recommended:âFirst Year,âGen-eral Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry (a) and (b), Pharmacy, and Botany. Second Year,âIndustrial Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry (a), Pharmacy and Materia Medica. The chemical lecture-room and laboratory are well provided with facilities for illustration and practical instruction. An excellent collection of chemicals, a new set of specimens of Materia Medica, and an extensive herbarium, will be employed as aids in instruction. The expenses of a student of Pharmacy taking the whole course in one year, not including books, will be from $305 to $360. ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT. W. M. THORNTON, Professor of Mathematics Applied to Engineering. CHARLES S. VENABLE, LL. D., Professor of Mathematics. FRANCIS H. SMITH, M. A., LL. D., Professor of Natural Philosophy. JOHN W. MALLET, Ph. D., M. D., LL. D., F. R. S., Professor of Chemistry. F. P. DUNNINGTON, B. S., Professor of Analytical Chemistry. WM. M. FONTAINE, M. A., Professor of Natural History and Geology. R. D. BOHANNAN, B.

Subjects marked with * are not required for the degree of C. E.; those marked with â  are not required for the degree of M. E. Instruction in the foregoing subjects is conveyed by a course of systematic lectures, combined with assiduous practice in the field and at the drawing-board, continued throughout the course. ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT. In the lecture course, after careful elucidation of fundamental principles, the rules of construction are deduced, and applied to the criticism of existing structures and the design of proposed works. In the field course the adjustments and use of the instruments are carefully taught, and the student, after a thorough drill in the methods of measuring and estimating lengths, altitudes, angles, and velocities, is required to execute for himself surveys of lands, buildings, and topography; to locate lines for railways, highways and canals; and to set out curves, earth-works and masonry. In the course of design the easy and accurate use of pen and brush is first acquired by exercises in projective and topographic drawing. The student is then required, from assigned data, to compute the dimensions of proposed structures, and on the basis of his computations to prepare bills of material, and general and detailed drawings of the works; to draw up specifications and furnish estimates of quantities and cost in accordance with prices current. To facilitate the instruction in this department, the University has provided a commodious and well-lighted lecture room and drawing hall, a liberal supply of field instruments of the best construction, and models and drawings of a large variety of structures, illustrating the best practice of modern engineers, American and foreign. Students who desire to enter the Department of Engineering should possess an accurate knowledge of the elements of Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry. With such preparation the following order of studies, leading to the Degrees of C. E. and M. E. is recommended: Degree of C. E.âFirst Year:âJunior Applied Mathematics, Chemistry, Mathematics. Second Year:âSenior Applied Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Mineralogy and Geology. Degree of M. E.âFirst Year:âJunior Applied Mathematics, General Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics. Second Year:âSenior Applied Mathematics, Industrial Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry, Mineralogy and Geology. The expenses of a student of Civil Engineering are from $300 to $360. Those of a student of Mining Engineering are from $330 to $485. AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. JOHN R. PAGE, M. D., Professor of Agriculture, Zoology and Botany. FRANCIS H. SMITH, M. A., LL. D., Professor of Natural Philosophy. JOHN W. MALLET, Ph. D., M. D., LL. D., F. R. S., Professor of Chemistry. F. P. DUNNINGTON, B. S., Professor of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry. WM. M. FONTAINE, M. A., Professor of Natural History and Geology. W. M. THORNTON, Professor of Mathematics Applied to Engineering. Trustees of the Miller Fund. J. F. SLAUGHTER, President. W. W. MINOR, S. V. SOUTHALL, RANDOLPH HARRISON, H. W. JONES, GEO. W. PALMER, B. JOHNSON BARBOUR. R. T. W. DUKE, Secretary. The late Samuel Miller, of Lynchburg, having by deed given in trust one hundred thousand dollars for the establishment of a Department of Scientific and Practical Agriculture in the University, this Department was organized in 1869. Subsequently the above-named Professors were nominated by the Trustees of the Miller Fund, and elected by the Visitors; certain lands belonging to the University were set aside, and brought into cultivation as an Experimental Farm; and all necessary implements, apparatus, models and specimens of various kinds have been collected as material aids to the course of instruction. The studies of the Agricultural Department are distributed into an Introductory Course, comprising Zoology and Botany, Mineralogy and Geology, General Chemistry, and Physics; and an Advanced Course, comprising Scientific and Practical Agriculture, Industrial Chemistry, Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry, and Agricultural Engineering. Applicants for the degree of Bachelor of Scientific Agriculture are required to complete all the studies of both courses. They are recommended to take the studies of the Introductory Course for the first year, AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. and to distribute the studies of the Advanced Course over two more years. For the conditions of award and tenure of the Miller Agricultural Scholarships, see p. 66. Detailed descriptions of the courses in Mineralogy and Geology, Physics, General and Industrial Chemistry, Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry, will be found under the several schools to which they belong. MILLER SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE, ZOOLOGY, AND BOTANY. Prof. Page. In this school there are two courses, as follows: I. Zoology and Botany. 1. In Zoology the class studies the leading principles of the science, with special reference to the anatomy, physiology and morphology of typical species throughout the animal kingdom. Special lectures are given during the course on insects injurious to vegetation, on fish and oyster culture, and on the breeding, rearing and diseases of domestic animals. The fine collection of Zoological specimens in the Brooks Museum affords excellent facilities for study of the science. The class is continued until the examination, about the middle of March. Instruction is given not only by lectures with reference to suitable textbooks, but practical exercises in dissection are also employed, and the student is trained to repeat the demonstrations of the Professor. 2. In Botany, the instruction commences about the middle of March, and continues until the end of the session. The time is mainly devoted to the study of flowering plants, their analysis and determination. Cryptogamic Botany, especially fungi and fungoid diseases of plants, receive as much attention as possible. In this course as in that of Zoology, careful attention is paid to the analysis and classification of actual specimens, and practical exercises are required from the student, both in the laboratory and in the field. AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. II. Scientific and Practical Agriculture. 1. The Scientific Course comprises a review of what is known of the chemical composition, the structure and the functions of the organs of plants; and of the atmosphere and soil, as related to vegetable production. 2. The Practical Course comprises the study of the nature and formation of soils; their exposure and drainage; the best methods of tillage; and the use of manures and fertilizers, with experiments to show their effects. Special instruction is given in the mechanical operations of the farm, and in the practical management of teams. This class is continued throughout the session. Text-books:â"How Crops Grow," and "How Crops Feed," by Johnson; "Scientific Agriculture," by Pendleton: "American Farmer," by Flint; "Manual of Zoology," by Nicholson; "School and Field Book of Botany." by Gray; Sack's Textbook. For reference:âCarpenter's Zoology; Harris's Insects Injurious to Vegetation; Mivart's Comparative Anatomy; "Flora of the Southern States," by Chapman; Armsby on "Cattle Feeding," and Law's Veterinary Adviser. The Course in Agricultural Engineering, under the Professor of Mathematics applied to Engineering, includes lectures and practical exercises in the field and at the drawing-board on the following subjects: Land Surveying and Levelling, with special applications to the surveying and the mapping of farms, the location of roads and ditches, and the measurement of ordinary earthworks. Design and Erection of structures in Earth, Timber, Brickwork and Masonry, as buildings, simple forms of highway bridges, dams for storage reservoirs, etc. Elementary principles of Hydraulics, with applications to the drainage and irrigation of lands, the reclamation of swamps, the storage and conveyance of water, etc. Elements of the Mechanics of Machines, with special reference to the more important types of Agricultural Machinery.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">FREEDOM OF STUDY. So far as the hours appointed for lectures permit, any student is at liberty to select any course of instruction given in any Department without restriction. But Academical students are, in general, required to attend at least three Schools. (See p. 69.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EXAMINATIONS. Besides the daily examination upon the previous lecture, two General Examinations of each class are held during the session, which every member is required to stand. The Intermediate Examination occurs near the middle of the session, and is upon the subjects of instruction of the first part of the course. The Final Examination occurs near the end of the session, and is upon the subjects of instruction of the second part of the course only, or upon those of the entire course. These examinations are conducted in writing. The questions have numerical values affixed. If the answers at any general examination amount in value to three-fourths of the aggregate value of the questions, a Distinction is awarded to the student, and the fact published at the close of the session. Examination for a Proficiency or for Graduation usually coincides with a general examination. The general and graduating examinations are conducted in each School by the Professor, in the presence of two other Professors, forming with him the committee of examination for that School. They are sufficiently comprehensive and difficult to render it impossible for a student, without steady diligence, to attain a Distinction, and candidates for a Proficiency or for Graduation are subjected to searching interrogations on the details as well as on the general principles of the subject, and are expected to be accurately versed in all matters treated in the lectures and correlative text. Moreover, the student's command of English, and his standing at both daily and general examinations are taken into account in estimating his qualification for the certificate or diploma.

      <field name="fulltext">EQUIPMENTS. LIBRARY. The Library of the University, originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, and since much enlarged by purchases and donations, now contains about 48,000 volumes. (See p. 70.) LEWIS BROOKS MUSEUM. The Lewis Brooks Museum contains collections illustrating the subjects of Geology, Mineralogy, Zoology and Botany. Each of the collections is selected so as to exemplify the principles of these sciences, and, at the same time, to exhibit a large variety of subjects for their study. Its primary object is to serve as an aid in teaching Natural History. In Geology the collections are large and well selected. The specimens of rocks show all the different kinds classified according to mineral character, and the formations in which they occur. The collection of fossils, plaster casts, maps, etc., is exceptionally fine, and fully illustrates Historical Geology. In Mineralogy the principles of the science are made plain by well-chosen suits of specimens, models of crystals, etc. The general collection of minerals contains all the important minerals, and many of the rarer ones, in good specimens. The science of Zoology is well illustrated by a fine and large collection of objects, such as mounted skeletons, stuffed animals, dried specimens, plaster casts, etc. In Botany the collections contain charts, papier-machÃ© models of flowers, fruits, sections of wood, etc. The bulk of the collection is in the form of an herbarium selected from the most important and interesting botanical regions of the world. In addition to the above, a beginning has been made of a collection to illustrate the geology and mineralogy of the State of Virginia, and this will be increased as rapidly as possible. LEANDER McCORMICK OBSERVATORY. The Astronomical Observatory on the University grounds is the gift of Leander J. McCormick, Esq., of Chicago. It contains the great refracting telescope of 26 inches aperture, constructed for Mr. McCormick EQUIPMENTS. by Alvan Clark &amp; Sons, and given by him to the University. The directorship has been endowed with the sum of $50,000 by the Alumni and other friends of the University; and an additional sum of $25,000, given to the Institution by the late Wm. H. Vanderbilt, Esq., of New York, has been invested, that the income may form a working fund for the Observatory. (See page 32.) CHEMICAL LABORATORY. A building planned and erected for the purpose is exclusively used as a chemical lecture-room and laboratory. It is completely fitted with the most approved appliances, and stocked with apparatus, models, materials and specimens. The commodious lecture-room, with work and store rooms attached, is provided with every convenience for exhibiting a complete series of experiments illustrating the lectures on General Chemistry. The large room assigned to Analytical Chemistry will accommodate fifty working students, and is furnished with work tables, gas, water, and all proper laboratory fixtures; and all requisite apparatus, chemicals, minerals, materials for analysis, etc., are kept constantly supplied by home purchase and importation. A very large number of specimens, constituting a Museum of Industrial Chemistry, has been collected, at much expense and pains, in this country, England, France and Germany, illustrating the products and processes of Chemistry applied to the Arts and Manufactures, and so arranged as to be a most valuable aid to the student of Industrial Chemistry. (See page 29.) PHYSICAL LABORATORY. A suitable room has been assigned to this object by the Board of Visitors. The needful fittings have been partly provided, and its thorough equipment will be pushed forward as rapidly as funds for the purpose can be obtained. (See p. 27.) UNIVERSITY CHAPEL. A sum sufficient to build a handsome chapel within the University precincts is being subscribed by the present members, alumni, and friends of the University. The walls and roof have been recently erected, and the building will be pushed on to completion as speedily as the progress of the subscription will allow.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">SCHOLARSHIPS. University Scholarships.âEleven scholarships, entitling the successful candidates at a competitive examination to prosecute the studies of one session at the University of Virginia without the payment of matriculation or tuition fees, are open to new-comers from all the States at the beginning of the academic year (October 1st). Of these eleven scholarships, five are in the Academic Department, and two each in the Departments of Law, Medicine, and Engineering. The examination is uniform, and embraces Latin, Greek, Mathematics, and English. In order to secure positive attainments, the right is reserved to reject any papers that do not reach the standard required for a Distinction at the Final Examination in Junior Latin, Junior Greek, and Junior Mathematics, and do not show a competent acquaintance with the grammatical and rhetorical structure of the English language. The subjects of examination in Latin, Greek and Mathematics for these scholarships will be found under the head "Junior Class" of those Schools. For more precise information apply to the Professors. Free Scholarships.âThe Visitors, in September, 1882, founded three free scholarships, to be called the Corcoran Scholarship, the McCormick Scholarship, and the Vanderbilt Scholarship. For information respecting these apply to the Chairman of the Faculty. Miller Scholarship.âIn honor of Samuel Miller, founder of the Agricultural Department, there will be awarded at the end of each session a scholarship, called the Miller Agricultural Scholarship, tenable during the two following sessions. The emoluments consist of $250 per session, with free tuition in the Schools of the Agricultural Department. The conditions of award are as follows:â The Scholarship will be awarded to that student who in the year of his candidacy obtains distinction in all the classes of the Introductory Course of Agricultural Studies, and receives the highest aggregate of marks on the subjects of that course. For the conditions of tenure, or other information, apply to the Chairman of the Faculty. Alumni Scholarships.âThe appointments to these rest with the persons who founded them, or with the Executive Committee of the Society of Alumni. For information apply to the Secretary of the Society, (see p. 68).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SOCIETIES OF STUDENTS. Literary Societies.âThere are two Literary Societies of long standing, the Washington Society and the Jefferson Society, connected with the University. They meet weekly in their respective halls for the purpose of cultivating debate and composition, and hold public exhibitions at intervals during the session, and at its close. The two Societies jointly maintain the University Magazine, and annually invite some distinguished orator to deliver an address before them in the Public Hall at the close of the session. During the Session of 1885-'86 the Societies awarded medals as follows: Jefferson Society. Washington Society. Claude A. Swanson, Orator's Medal. Robt. G. Bickford, Orator's Medal. Geo. Wayne Anderson, Debater's Medal. Jos. G. Covington, Debater's Medal. John S. Mosby, Jr., Magazine Medal. Young Men's Christian Association.âThis society seeks to guard new students from evil influences, and furnishes opportunities for Christian work in the University and its neighborhood. It has been in active operation many years. It has established and maintains theâ Students' Reading Room.âThis is convenient of access, comfortably arranged and furnished, and supplied with a large selection of the best periodical literature. It is open to all members of the University upon the payment of an annual fee of $4.00 to meet its current expenses. Temperance Union.âThis is an association which does good service in guarding students against vice, and promotes literary culture by valuable prizes to its best debaters and orators. In the Session of 1885-'86 the Temperance Union awarded medals as follows: Charles M. Himel, Orator's Medal. Francis F. Causey, Debater's Medal. Squibb Gymnasium Association.âFounded upon a liberal gift from E. H. Squibb, M. D., of Brooklyn, N. Y., for the promotion of physical culture.

      <field name="fulltext">REGULATIONS. ADMISSION. To be admitted as a student of the University, the applicant must be at least sixteen years of age; but the Faculty may dispense with this requirement in favor of one who has a brother of the requisite age entering at the same time. If the applicant for admission has been a student at any other incorporated seminary, he must produce a certificate from such seminary, or other satisfactory evidence of general good conduct. NUMBER OF SCHOOLS. An Academical student must attend at least three Schools, unless upon the written request of his parent or guardian, or for good cause shown, the Faculty shall allow him to attend a less number. ENTRANCE AND WITHDRAWAL. An abatement of one-third is made in the matriculation, tuition fees and room rent, if the student enter after the first of January, but no portion is refunded on account of withdrawal from the University before the close of the session, unless the withdrawal be rendered necessary by ill health. The charges for board, fuel, lights, and washing, are estimated from the time of entrance. Many disadvantages to the student result from late entrance; therefore prompt attendance at the beginning of the session is earnestly enjoined upon all who wish to derive full benefit from the course of instruction. DORMITORIES. The following are enactments of the Visitors: 1. A student who proposes to lodge in a University dormitory shall pay in advance the full rent of the same, with the privilege of sharing the room and its rent with a fellow student: provided, in case of joint occupancy and of changes, the charge be equitably divided by the Proctor among the joint or successive occupants, so as to obtain not less than the full rent of the dormitory. 2. Every student lodging elsewhere shall deposit in advance $15 as an indemnity for rent; and at the close of the session the amount due for unoccupied dormitories shall be estimated and divided equally among the students lodging elsewhere as a charge to each, the remainder, if any, being credited in final settlement: provided, said charge for indemnity shall in no case exceed $15. 3. To secure dormitory rooms in the University Buildings, application may be made by letter to the Proctor; but if the rent be not deposited with him before the 15th of September, the room is considered unengaged. REGULATIONS. PRIVILEGED STUDENTS. Ministers of the Gospel may attend any of the Schools of the University without the payment of tuition fees. The same privilage will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet the expenses of education at the University without aid. MONTHLY CIRCULAR. At the end of every month a circular letter is addressed by the Chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from lectures and examinations, and any other irregularities of which he may have been guilty, together with such further information as to the student's progress and conduct as it may be deemed proper to communicate, or as the parent or guardian may specially request. The object of such reports being, on the one hand, to incite the student to steady diligence, by eliciting the commendation and encouragement of his friends, and, on the other, to restrain him from idleness and disorder, or to urge him to amendment by their admonition and advice, their usefulness greatly depends upon the prompt and judicious attention they receive from those to whom they are addressed. Parents and guardians, therefore, cannot be too earnest in communicating such advice or encouragement as the monthly reports may suggest. LICENTIATES. Any person of unexceptionable character and habits, upon producing to the Faculty satisfactory evidence of suitable capacity and attainments, will be licensed by the Faculty to form classes for private instruction in any School of the University, in aid of and in conformity to the public teachings of the Professor upon any subject taught therein. The employment, selection, and compensation of such Licentiate is left to the determination of the students. PROHIBITION OF CREDIT. An act of the legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting students. The license to contract debts, which the Chairman is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing), to cases of urgent necessity; and these, it is hoped, parents and guardians will prevent, as far as possible, by a timely supply of the requisite funds. DISCIPLINE AND RELIGIOUS WORSHIP. Morality and Religion are recognized as the foundation and indispensable concomitants of education. The discipline of the University is sedulously administered with a view to confirm integrity, and to maintain a sacred regard for truth. Great efforts are made to surround the students with religious influences; but experience having proved that the best way to effect this result is to forbear the employment of coercion, the attendance on religious exercises is entirely voluntary. Prayers are held every morning in the chapel, and divine service is conducted twice on Sunday by a Chaplain, selected in turn from the principal religious denominations. USE OF LIBRARY. Students are allowed the use of the books under the usual restrictions, and the Librarian is present in the library for six hours daily, to attend to their wants. REGULATIONS. Persons at a distance, who may desire to consult the library by correspondence, can do so on payment of a small charge, proportioned to the time and labor expended on the research required, the copying of titles, or passages from authors, etc. A letter on this subject, addressed to James B. Baker, Librarian, will receive attention. INFIRMARY. There is a well-appointed Infirmary connected with the University for the care and comfort of sick students. Every student on matriculation deposits the infirmary fee ($7.00), which entitles him, in case of sickness during the session, to the advice and attendance of the infirmary physicians (the Professors in the Medical Department), and, if necessary, to nursing by professional nurses, without additional charge. VIRGINIA ACADEMICAL STUDENTS. By act of the General Assembly of Virginia, approved March 15th, 1884, the University "shall give instruction to all white students of the State of Virginia, over the age of sixteen years, who shall be matriculated under the rules and regulations prescribed by the Board of Visitors, without charge for tuition in the academic department, consisting of the following schools, to-wit: the schools of Latin, Greek, modern languages, pure mathematics, moral philosophy, natural philosophy, historical science, agriculture, zoology and botany, natural history and geology, general and industrial chemistry, and English language and literature: provided, that no person shall be admitted as a student, free of charge for tuition fees, under the provisions of this act, unless the Faculty shall be satisfied by actual examination of the applicant, or by a certificate from some college or preparatory school, that he has made such proficiency in the branch of study which he proposes to pursue as will enable him to avail himself of the advantages afforded by the University." ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS. A Virginian wishing to secure the advantages offered by the foregoing enactment must pass a satisfactory examination, held by the Committee of Examination of the School named therein which he proposes to enter, such examination being subject to revision by the Faculty. The entrance examinations occur at the opening of the session. No student is subjected to entrance examinations, excepting Virginians seeking free tuition. Certificates from former teachers are carefully considered. For admission to the Schools of English, Modern Languages, Chemistry, Natural History and Geology, and Agriculture, Zoology and Botany, the requirements are a knowledge of English and Arithmetic. For the other Academical Schools, students are referred to the Professors in charge, or to the Chairman of the Faculty. DONATIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. Under an act of the Legislature, "any person may deposit in the treasury of this State, or bequeath money, stock, or public bonds of any kind, to be so deposited, or grant, devise, or bequeath property, real or personal, to be sold, and the proceeds to be so deposited . . . . for the benefit of the University of Virginia. . . . . The State of Virginia is hereby constituted the trustee for the safe-keeping and due application of all funds which may be deposited in the treasury in pursuance of this act." The Society of Alumni is also authorized to hold funds for the benefit of the University.</field>
