      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION In his 1988 essay, Indian/White Relations: A View from the Other Side of the Frontier, Alfonso Ortiz asserts that American history is written strictly from the white man's perspective. While an American culture was being established, the cultures of the Native American were totally distorted. In fact, the European invaders tried to destroy that culture under the guise of trying to assimilate or Christianize the Native American in to the European culture. To have a true history of this land, the records must be written by all participants. In his essay, Ortiz laid out a model that would present people with a more accurate view of American history. Part of that model demanded that the historical values of oral traditions must be respected. As well, Ortiz felt it the duty of Native Americans to take on roles as historians and to accept the challenge to seek out, gather, and present accurate portrayals of history.[1] Decades before Ortiz's article, one Native American was already attempting to safeguard cultural features of his society. B. N. O. Walker, or Hen-Toh, was born in Kansas in 1870 and was one of eight children born to Isaiah and Mary Walker. At the age of 4, Walker's family was removed from Kansas and sent to live in lands allocated to the Wyandot in extreme northeastern Indian Territory, slightly southwest of Seneca, Missouri. Hen-Toh received his education at a local mission school as well as public schools and a private academy in Seneca. His higher education was obtained under a private tutor, a former college professor in Seneca. From 1890 until his death in 1927, Hen-Toh spent the majority of his time working for the Indian Service. He worked the first 10 years as a teacher in federal Indian schools in California, Arizona and Missouri and later worked as a clerk at various Indian agencies. At the time of his death, Hen-Toh was working at the Quapaw Agency in Miami, Oklahoma as Chief Clerk; however, for Hen-Toh, home was always the family homestead near Seneca. [2] Hen-Toh was raised in an environment in which much of the history, myths, and folklore was handed down by word of mouth. Preserving the past was also part of Hen-Toh's background. Both Hen-Toh's mother and father were descended from well-known families of their respective tribes. Hen-Toh's great-uncle, William Walker, had been a Wyandot chief who later served as the first provisional governor for the Nebraska Territory. He was also known as a speaker, writer and poet. In addition, a close relative of Hen-Toh's mother was Peter Dooyentate Clarke. In 1870, the year of Hen-Toh's birth, Clarke published Origin and Traditional History of the Wyandot in which Clarke "endeavor[s] to give a sketch as I had it from the lips of such, and from some of the tribes that have since passed away" of the history of the Wyandot people. [3] Clarke's considered his attempt at preserving Wyandot history corresponding to the increasing notion that the Native American was becoming extinct. In his words, The different Indian tribes who once inhabited this part of North America to the Mississippi (with an exception of a remnant here and there), have all faded away like shadows of clouds passing over the earth, and the story of their fate has passed into the great history of the world, reminding us of the irresistible fate of nations. Clarke envisioned that the fate of the red man was to give place to another race of people-and vanish before the march of civilization. Clarke's notion was very much in keeping with the general attitude regarding the Native American at the time. Brian Dippie writes in the preface of his book, The Vanishing American: White Attitudes and U.S. Indian Policy, that the American tradition of the time, one that was 'rich in pathos and older than the Republic' was that "Indians...are a vanishing race; they have been wasting away since the day the white man arrived, diminishing in vitality and numbers, until in some not too distant future, no red men will be left on the face of the earth." [4] The idea of the disappearing Indian was at its peak during Hen-Toh's life. The notion was found in stories, songs and plays of the era. In addition, the social science community became active in collecting artifacts for the disappearing cultures. Several Native American ethnologists were busy trying to capture for posterity their own segment of native culture. Arthur Caswell Parker, Iroquois, assumed many roles while documenting Iroquois history such as ethnologist, archeologist, Indian rights advocate, children's author, historian and museum curator. Parker's works, which helped to inform Americans on Indian mores, include The Iroquois Uses of Maize and Other Food Plants (1910), The Amazing Iroquois (1927), The Constitution of the Five Nations (1918), Skunny Wundy: Seneca Indian Tales (1926), The American Indian What Is He? (1914), and The Indian How Book: Authentic Information on American Indian Crafts, Customs, Food and Clothing, Religion and Recreations (1927) [5]. Parker's support of Iroquois artisans was of equal relevance. He collected the works of numerous craftspeople while with the New York State Museum. After the formation of the Works Progress Administration, Parker encouraged the WPA to engage and support the work of Iroquois artists. While many Native Americans were arguing for full citizenship and trying to disappear into the white man's world, the work of Parker and Clarke, along with others such as Francis LaFlesche and James Murie, shows a small group intent on preserving the artistic fundamentals of cultures that were perceived to be failing. Like these preservationists, Walker felt that much of the traditional culture was lost with each passing generation and felt that to be particularly true of the Wyandot. Although Walker's works have never been widely known, they are illustrative of the oral traditions of his people. His narratives and poems are written through an Indian persona and represent his attempts to preserve some of the old stories he learned as a child. In 1924, Walker published a collection of poetry entitled Nubbins, a reference to small, underdeveloped ears of corn. The original edition was published by the Harlow Publishing Company of Oklahoma City. The topics of the poetry are varied and reflect many aspects of Wyandot life: from objects like the calumet and arrowhead to love songs and lullabies. Not only do they point toward the life of the Wyandot, they are written to illustrate the dialect of the people and should be read with that in mind. The initial version also included art work by another Indian, Roger Roy Eubanks (Cherokee). In addition to the poetry contained in Nubbins, Walker also wrote Tales of the Bark Lodges, a collection of 12 stories full of wit and humor. Both volumes of work are written in a way to not only preserve the stories and the tradition of story telling, but to preserve the dialect as well. History has unjustly ignored those whom Walker refers to in the poem O-See-O as the TRUE AMERICANS and they the things they really value about their native cultures: their languages, religions, oral traditions and arts. It is essential to recognize that both written and oral traditions hold value and to accept the challenge of exploring, gathering and bringing forth real Native American History. As Alfonso Ortiz argued, to have a true history of this land, it is vital the works of those such as B. N. O. Walker, Hen-Toh, be included to avoid a history that is incomplete.</field>

A prayer goes to the One Great Spirit, thus; Oh that the whole wide World could now Accept the Redman's ancient symbol, Off'ring its incense to the Universe; And blot out fierce, wild war's red stain, Bringing Good-will to earth again With Peace, white Peace. 1918. "MY FREN'" To J. W. C. On his leaving for the Army during the great war. You my fren', no diff'ence what say, anyone, If I seen you now, or don' see fo' years. You know reason, t'aint what I done, You could look my eye, don' see it tears, When you sed it: 'Good-bye'. You my pardner, you sed it one time, It's l-o-n-g 'go, but me, I don' fo'get; If you go flat bust, an' I got one dime, I know wha' you could fin' nickel, I bet, Or mebbe ten cent. It's jus' that way all time, me an' you, We bin know'd each otha' how you say, well. I don' care fo' hundred snakes what you do; Even you tell it me: "You go to hell," I could do it, e-a-s-y. You come back war-trail, it's be jus' same, Kin' a smile and sed it: "You my pardner yet?" I jus' look at you an' sed it you name, Mebbe so wink it, then sed it: "You bet!" I don' fo'gotten nothin'. "INJUN SUMMA'" You seen it that smoky, hazy, my frien', It's hangin' all 'roun' on edges of sky? In moon of fallin' leaves, 'at's when It's always come, an' jus' floatin' by. You know, my fren', what's make it that kin'? It's spirits o' home-sick warriors come; An' somewha's his lodge fires all in line. Jus' near as could get it to his ol' home. I think he's like it, Happy Huntin' Groun', It's mus' ta be nice, eva'thin' ova' tha'; But, mebbe so, fo' little' bit, jus' kin' a look 'roun' When year it's get ol', an' days an sky it's fair, He's kin' a like to wanda' back ol' huntin' groun'. But don't want a stay, No, cause it's all gone, Beaver, Bear, Buffalo, all; it's can't be foun'; Anyhow, makes good dream fo' him, 'bout eva' one. So he's come back an' make it his lodge fire, All 'roun' ova' tha' on edges of sky; An' it's nice wa'm sun, an' you don't get tire, Cause it's Ol' Injun Summa'-time, 'at's why. "THE SEASONS" What sed it Ol' Injuns 'bout a spring-time? Oh it's pritty girl, it's comin' from a south, All dress' up in fine white buckskins. He don' walk, he's jus' dance, He don' look, he jus' glance, 'Roun' at eva'body, pleasant, Jus' like happy; An' he's bring it nice bowl o' strawberry, An' jus' scatta' eva'wha'. What sed it Ol' Injuns 'bout a summa-time? Oh it's good woman followed that girl, An' it's dress like a nice, jus' all kin' a green. He don' dance, jus' kin' a float, Like on wata', seen it, boat, An' jus' smile 'roun' eva-wha' goes, Jus' like good; An' he's bring it string o' squaw-corn, An' jus' pile up eva'wha'. What sed it Ol' Injuns 'bout a fall-time? Oh it's young man comes from kin' o' west, Huntin' shirt an' leggin' kin' o' color brown. He's straight jus' like an arrow, An' his fringes color, 'yarrow'. He's got laugh in eye an' it's a keen, Jus' like brave; An' he's bring it bunch o' wil' grape an' acorn, An' jus' hang up eva' wha'. What sed it Ol' Injuns 'bout a winta-time? Wooh! It's o-l' man, he's comin' from a north, From lan' of Great White Rabbit, 'at's his home. His long robe it's shine an' glis'en, You could heard it clink, you lis'en, When he's walk kin' o' slow Jus' like tired. He's bring lots o' ice an' plenty snow, An jus' drift up eva'wha'. "FISHIN'." Eva' fishin' much? It's good. Sunshine in sky, shake in a wood, Down on riva' bank jus' wait an' wish I could ketch im hurry, that dam fish; Take 'im home, cook 'im, an' eat im. Sometimes it's ketch 'im right now, Sometimes don' ketch 'im all day; But Injun he's sure know how He could ketch 'im a'right, 'notha way. Long 'go 'fore whiteman, he's come here, Ol' Injun use to fishin' with spear. That kin' o' spear it's make o' stone' He's got hook too, make o' bone; But he could ketch 'em plenty fish - sometime. Sometime he's fishin' on a shore, Sometime he's fishin' in canoe; Some day he's ketch 'em plenty more, Someday it's jus' nothin' do. Now-days he's got littl' stick, green an' red, L-o-n-g line, he's wind it up, 'at's how he sed. It's tie on end littl' fish made o' wood. Lot's o' hook, seems to me it's no good; But he's sure ketch 'im b-i-g one, bass. That bass he's like Injun, mebbe so, Whiteman's fool 'im, since long 'go. Spec' so, dam fool, bofe of it, Cause you can't fool 'im, whiteman, littl' bit. FIRE I think Injun like it betta' 'an anythin', fire, But I don' jus' know why. Mebbe so it's cause 'at smokes go high, Way up towar'ds a sky, An' could carried it message, higher an' higher, 'Til He's got it, Great Spirit. When he's smoke it, Peace Pipe, anywha' Council, or in lodge, Smokes curl 'jus' kin' a like it's dodge An' carried it off, jus' way up tha', 'Til He's heard it, Great Spirit. Long 'sometime, he's want it sen' word His frens way off, 'notha' wha. He's fin' it high place, an' tha' Make it smokes go straight in air, An' his frens, it's like they heard, What he's ask Him, Great Spirit. An' Injuns, his folks, time come when he die, He's bury him somewha', not far, An' on grave, 'bout time it's shine star, He's make it littl' fire. What for? It's make it light fo' soul on road, 'at's why, To place wha' He's call 'im, Great Spirit. SMOKIN' Say, he don' smokin', jus' to smokin', Ol' Injun, long 'go, Like he's do eva'body, eva'wha' now days, Jus' puff, puffin' so. Long 'go, Injun', he's thinkin an' thinkin' 'Bout word he's want to sent, To Great Spirit, somethin' it's good one To help 'im, what it's meant; Then he's smokin' plenty. He don' sed nothin', jus' smokin' an' think Jus' 'bout that what he's want. He's do this way long time, himse'f, 'Til he's sure it's that way. Don' tole nobody 'bout it but jus' hese'f, 'Cause too much talk no good Whiteman he's smart, but not foun' that out yet, 'Spec' so no b'lieve it, if he could "Put it in you pipe an' smoke it", I hear 'im, whiteman say. It's jus' how he's do, Ol' Injun, Meb' so, 'at's how he pray. Cause he don' like it to tlak to Great Spirit, An' tole 'IM it, what mus' do, So he's think it, an' smoke carry thinkin' Eva'wha', up wha' looks blue.

He say it's all a time makes 'im mad, That horse, 'cause it's don' want go; Sometime he's want a work prit' bad, An' that horse he's stan' jus' so.

He's tell it, Big Tree, an' he's say: "Horse heap dam' fool, that's the one; Sometime he's go, sometime he's stay, He's jus' too 'nuff or too none." "A BORROWED TALE" Say, you know that time that Ol' Otta' He's slide down that mount'in from th' sky? Well, he's wored it jus' all a fur off his tail, Jus' smoof, an' skin looks ugly an' a' dry.

On the plains and in the vales of Oklahoma, Grew a flower of the Tyrian hue, The color that is loved by the Redman, That tells him light and life, And love are true. Long ago it flamed in beauty on the prairies, Lighting reaching vistas with its glow; Ere advent of the whiteman and his fences, Told the care-free, roving hunter He must go. The throng, the herd, and greed have madly trampled Prairie, woodland, valley, and the height; Crushed the feath'ry flower and rudely blighted Its pride and life and beauty, And its light. Today 'tis found in silent glades and meadows Where by twos and threes it greets the May. Like the scattered braves who loved its color, It has passed, been trodden out Along the way. As the oriflamme it flaunted through past ages Went to gladden the fairness of the earth; So the greatness of the Indian will linger In the land that loves them both And gave them birth. Note: The Scarlet Painted Cup was called by the Wynadots, the Warrior's Plume A MOJAVE LULLABY. Sleep, my little man-child, Dream-time to you has come. In the closely matted branches Of the mesquite tree, The mother-bird has nestled Her little ones; see From the ghost-hills of your fathers, Purpling shadows eastward crawl, While beyond the western sky-tint pale, As twilight spreads its pall. The eastern hills are lighted, See their sharp peaks burn and glow, With the colors the Great Sky-Chief Gave your father for his bow. Hush my man-child; be not frighted, 'Tis the father's step draws night. O'er the trail along the river, Where the arrow-weeds reach high Above his dark head, see He parts them with his strong hands, As he steps forth into view. He is coming home to mother, Home to mother and to you. Sleep my little man-child, Daylight has gone. There's no twitter in the branches, Dream-time has come. COYOTE. Yo-ho, Little Medicine Brother in gray, Yo-ho, I am list'ning to your call As it comes from the edge of th' chapparral, And I wonder, what is that you say. Now your voice is faint, it sounds far away. Are you telling of the coming of friends? Or do you say that the bison-herd wends Hitherward, is distant but a day? Now your notes are broken, sharp, and clear, Warning of the coming of the foe; Of their warriors and their spears I must know, And must reckon by your yelps if they're near. When your tones quaver low like a child, I know that gaunt famine cometh nigh; And you shiver on your hummock closely by, As you scent the grim, gray norther wild. A DESERT MEMORY. Lonely, open, vast and free, The dark'ning desert lies; The wind sweeps o'er it fiercely, And the yellow sand flies. The tortuous trail is hidden, Ere the sand-storm has passed With all its wild, mad shriekings, Borne shrilly on its blast. Are they fiends or are they demons That wail weirdly as they go, Those hoarse and dismal cadences, From out their depths of woe? Will they linger and enfold The lone trav'ler in their spell, Weave 'round him incantations, Brewed and bro't forth from their hell? Bewilder him and turn him From the rugged, hidden trail, Make him wander far and falter, And trembling quail At the desert and the loneliness So fearful and so grim, That to his fervid fancy, Wraps in darkness only him? The wind has spent its fierce wild wail, The dark storm-pall has shifted, Forth on his sight the stars gleam pale In the purpling haze uplifted. And down the steep trail, as he lists, He hears soft music stealing; It trembling falls through filmy mists, From rock-walls faint echoes pealing. Whence comes this mystic night-song With its rhythm wild and free, With is pleading and entreaty Pouring forth upon the sea Of darkness, vast and silent, Like a tiny ray of hope That oft-times comes to comfort When in sorrow's depths we grope? 'Tis the An-gu, the Kat-ci-na, 'Tis the Hopi's song of prayer, That in darkness wards off danger, When 'tis breathed in the air; Over desert, butte, and mesa, It is borne out on the night, Dispelling fear and danger, Driving evil swift a-flight. A INDIAN LOVE SONG Light o' the lodge, how I love thee, Light o' the lodge, how I love thee, Mianza, my wild-wood fawn! To wait and to watch for thy passing. On hill-top I linger at dawn. Glimmer of morn, how I love thee, Glimmer of morn, how I love thee! My flute to the ground now I fling, As you treat the steep trail to the spring, For thy coming has silenced my song. Shimmer of moon on the river, Sheen of soft star on the lake! Moonlight and starlight are naught; Their gleam and their glow is ne'er fraught With such love-light as falls from thine eyes. A WYNADOT CRADLE SONG. Hush thee and sleep, little one, The feathers on thy board sway to and fro; The shadows reach far downward in the water The great old owl is waking, day will go. Rest thee and fear not, little one, Flitting fireflies come to light you on your way To the fair land of dreams, while in the grasses The happy cricket chirps his merry lay. Tsa-du-meh watches always o'er her little one, The great owl cannot harm you, slumber on 'Till the pale light comes shooting from the eastward, And the twitter of the birds says night has gone. Hi-a-stah, Wynadot for father. Tsa-du-meh, Wynadot for Mother. WYNADOT NAMES "O-he-zhuh"! 'Ats how sed it, Wyandots; "O-hee-oh"! 'At's how say, Frenchman; "O-hi-o"!

That fatha' that motha', both Sha-wah-no-ro-noh, They b'long that band what come from fa' south, Come back to ol' huntin' grounds an' they own peoples, Cause Injun always like do that way; But got none huntin' grounds, now. Great mans them two, Te-cum-tha, La-lee-wah-see-ka, Great chief, warriors, leader of all they peoples. That las' one, he's Shawnee Prophet, An' he's see what's goin' do white-mans.

NOTE: "Weengk" is the Odjibwa Spirit of Sleep. A SONG OF A NAVAJO WEAVER. By Hen-toh. For ages long, my people have been Dwellers in this land; For ages viewed these mountains, Loved these mesas and these sands, That stretch afar and glisten, Glimmering in the sun As it lights the mighty canons Ere the weary day is done. Shall I, a patient dweller in this Land of fair blue skies, Tell something of their story while My shuttle swiftly flies? As I weave I'll trace their journey, Devious, rough and wandering, Ere they reached the silent region Where the night stars seem to sing. When the myriads of themglitter Over peak and desert waste, Crossing which the silent runner and The gaunt co-yo-tees haste. Shall I weave the zig-zag pathway Whence the sacred fire was born; And interweave the symbol of the God Who brought the corn- Of the Rain-god whose fierce anger Was appeased by sacred meal, And the trust that my brave people In him evermore shall feel? All this perhaps I might weave As the woof goes to and fro, Wafting as my shuttle passes, Humble hopes, and joys and care, Weaving closely, weaving slowly, While I watch the pattern grow; Showing something of my life: To the Spirit God a prayer. Grateful that he brought my people To the land of silence vast; Taught them arts of peace and ended All their wanderings of the past. Deftly now I trace the figures, This of joy and that of woe; And I leave an open gate-way For the Dau to come and go. NOTE: There is an irregularity in every design woven into a Navajo blanket, thus leaving a place for the "Dau" or spirit of the blanket to go out and in. ARROW-HEADS Bit by bit with tireless effort, Was the hard flint flaked to form Tip for shaft and spear-head Long ago. Time was counted naught in those days, And the end sufficed the needs Of the patient worker For his bow. Skilled in craft of plain and mountain, He must ever be alert, In the haunts of bison, Or of deer. On the shores of lak and river, Trod his moccasin'e foot, As he sought shy quarry For his spear. Lithe of limb with might of muscle, Swiftly wends he o'er the portage, Shoulders bearing lightly His canoe. Should he meet a wily foeman, As he treads the darksome glades His the need to dare then And to do. Thoughts like these come as we wander O'er the fallowed fields and find In our path an old Arrow-head. And new form in fervid fancy, As we scan th' enduring flint, A measure of those brave Warriors dead.

That is, the man was in a hurry and tried the ford rather than waiting for the ferry. That is, Joe pulls out his gun and speaks again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Editor's Note This edition contains the original poetry contained in the 1924 publication of Nubbins (Harlow Publishing Company, Oklahoma City). There were no other known published copies of this text. Walker saw his poetry as part of his effort to preserve Wyandot culture. Therefore, he wrote in a manner to capture the English dialect of the Wyandot speakers. For that reason, no effort has been made to "improve" the text. Original notes follow the poems they reference.
