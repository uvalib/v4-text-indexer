Last month (February) a bill was passed by the Virginia legislature establishing a bureau to be known as the Virginia State Geological Survey. This is a measure of great importance, and should prove of great value to the Commonwealth. The bureau is to have its headquarters at the University; and the board is to be composed of the Governor (ex-officio), the president of the University, the president of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and two citizens at large. An annual appropriation of ten thousand dollars is provided for in the bill. University Band. On February 14 a number of students met at Madison Hall and organized a band. Sixteen men, all of whom have had experience in band work, have been enrolled; and the following officers have been elected: Director, M. R. Faville; assistant director, A. H. Lueders; manager, Thos. V. Williamson; assistant manager, W. G. Kollock. The main need of the band at this juncture is money to pay for the instruments; but students, teachers, and alumni are aiding the project, and the need will likely be met in due time. On March 22 President Alderman will make an address on "The Constructive South" before the Civic Forum, in Carnegie Hall, New York City. Other eminent speakers from America and Europe will participate in the discussions of the organization. A copy of the Jewish Encyclopedia, recently issued by Funk &amp; Wagnalls in 12 magnificent volumes, has been presented to the University library through the initiative of Rev. E. N. Calisch, Richmond, Va. James Bequest. By the provisions of the will of the late E. W. James, Esq., of Norfolk, Va., the sum of $250,000, in round numbers, âthe bulk of his estate,âwill come to the University. One-half of the income from the bequest, however, is to be paid for the period of fifteen years to the Soldiers' Home at Richmond. New Requirement for Ph. D. Men. At a meeting of the Academic Faculty, December 7, 1907, the following regulation was passed in reference to candidates for the degree of Doctor of Phils- ophy: "The candidate's `reading knowledge of French and German' must be tested at the beginning of the first year of his candidacy, by examination on these languages in the presence of a committee consisting of the professor of the candidate's major subject and the professors of French and German. In case of failure on either or both of the examinations, he shall be required to enter the appropriate class or classes in one or both of the languages, and shall not be regarded as a regular candidate for the Ph. D. degree until he has fulfilled the requirements in French and German. "It is provided, however, that any student who has already passed on the regular B. A. course in either or both of these languages at this University shall be considered as having the requisite knowledge of either or both of them, as the case may be." Summer School. The University of Virginia Summer School, for high school teachers and principals, will begin on June 18, 1908, and continue till July 31. Full information may be obtained by addressing Bruce R. Payne, Director, Charlottesville, Va. Dr. John Beverley Pollard, who graduated in the medical department in 1905 after a brilliant record as student and athlete, has been secured as coach for the baseball team this spring. Prof. W. M. Thornton delivered an admirable address to the students at the inauguration of "College Hour," January 16. On February 11 he spoke on "The Larger Hope of the Commonwealth" in Winchester, Va., at the ninth annual banquet of the Charley Rouss Fire Company. Mr. Herbert Massey Peck, the new General Secretary of the Y. M. C. A., represents at least five phases of student lifeâscholarship, athletics, forensics, fraternity, and Christianityâand is proving the right man for the position he holds. The Arcadians, the University dramatic club, are presenting this spring the "Merry Mexican Comedy," La Serena. They have played in Staunton, at the University, in Norfolk, Petersburg, Richmond, Lynchburg, and Roauoke, with great success. Washington's Birthday. Lectures were suspended from 12 till 2 on February 22, and the teachers and students, with a number of other persons, assembled in Madison Hall where Dr. Albert Shaw, editor of the American Review of Reviews, delivered an address fitting to the occasion. The speaker referred to a former visit to the University, when he spoke upon the occasion of a Jefferson birthday celebration; and remarked that one can hardly come to Virginia at all without finding the day worthy of celebration on account of some great man or his deeds. The address centered chiefly about the year 1808â just a hundred years pastâand the end that year of the importation of slaves. The far-reaching significance of this event was pointed out, and the relation of Washington and Jefferson to the great questions at issue was shown in a masterly way. Lecture on Mathematics. On the evening of January 28, Dr. C. J. Keyser, Adrain Professor of Mathematics in Columbia University, spoke to a large audience in Madison Hall. The subject of Mathematics was treated with the skill of mastery, and was presented in its practical and poetical as well as in its abstract and theoretical aspects. The relation of mathematics to logic, psychology, and other sciences was pointed out, and many interesting questions suggested. College Hour. The University has recently inaugurated "College Hour"âa single hour that comes once each monthâwhen faculty and students meet together in Cabell Hall, sing songs, practice yells, listen to the organ, and talk. One man does not do it all, but every man has a chance to say what he thinks will be for the good of all. An opportunity is thus afforded to discuss vital and interesting current questions, and to get acquainted. The president of the graduate school had the chair at the first "hour," January 16; the president of the academic class presided the next time, February 8. On Friday, March 6, the president of the law class was in charge, and Prof. T. W. Page was the chief speaker. Prof. J. B. Henneman of Sewanee, an old student, was present and made a short address.</field>
