      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION. HISTORICAL SKETCH. By an act of the Legislature of Virginia, dated January 12, 1803, certain citizens of Albemarle County were incorporated under the style of "Trustees of Albemarle Academy," and were empowered to take such steps as seemed practicable to raise the funds necessary for erecting buildings and putting the Academy into operation. Albemarle Academy was destined never to exist except on paper, but under the guidance of Thomas Jefferson, who was elected to the board of trustees on March 23, 1814, a process of development was begun leading first to the organization of Central College, and afterwards to that of the University of Virginia. On August 19, 1814, the committee of the trustees appointed to select a site, reported that it would be desirable to locate the Academy in the vicinity of the town of Charlottesville, distant not more than half a mile therefrom. By an act of February 14, 1816, the Legislature authorized the establishment of "Central College, in the County of Albemarle, at the place which has been, or shall be, selected by the trustees of Albemarle Academy, and in lieu of such Academy." All rights and claims of Albemarle Academy were, by the same act, vested in Central College. The board of visitors of the College consisted of six members, of whom Jefferson was the only one who had been a member of the Academy board. The other five members were James Madison, James Monroe, Joseph Carrington Cabell, David Watson, and John H. Cocke. On May 5, 1817, Jefferson was elected Rector of the board, and, on the same day, the board authorized the purchase of a farm of about two hundred acres lying one mile west of Charlottesville as a site for the College. This tract now forms a part of the grounds of the University of Virginia. The cornerstone of Central College was laid on October 6, 1817, in the presence of Thomas Jefferson, Rector, and of James Madison and James Monroeâthe latter then President of the United States. This building, located on what is known as the West Lawn of the University, is now utilized as the Colonnade Club. Jefferson's plan was to erect a distinct building, a "pavilion," for each individual professorâbuildings to be arranged around a rectangular lawn. Each pavilion was to contain "a schoolroom and apartments for the accommodation of the professor," and one-story dormitories for the students were to be erected adjacent to the pavilions. Jefferson drew most of the sketches for the buildings with his own hands, basing them upon designs by Palladio; and his ideas of architectural effect and grouping were carried out in detail when Central College was merged into the University of Virginia. The prime object in Jefferson's mind, while Rector of the board of visitors of Central College, was to get the college well under way, and then have it INTRODUCTION. adopted by the Legislature as the State University. Accordingly, in the first report of the visitors to the Legislature, on January 6, 1818, it is recommended that a state university be established on the site of Central College. By an act of February 21, 1818, the Legislature authorized the appointment by the Governor of a board of twenty-four members, to be known as the "Board of Commissioners of the University." It was the duty of this board to meet on August 1, 1818, at the Tavern in Rockfish Gap, on the Blue Ridge Mountains, and report upon the following points regarding the organization of a state university: 1. A proper site for the projected university. 2. A plan for the building thereof. 3. The branches of learning which should be taught therein. 4. The number and description of professorships; and 5. Such general provisions as might properly be enacted by the Legislature for the better organizing and governing of the University. Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe were present at the meeting of the Commissioners, and their able and elaborate report to the Legislature (indicating much careful thought) had probably been prepared by Jefferson before the meeting was held. This report, recommending, among other things, the site of Central College as the most advantageous one for the University, was forwarded in duplicate to the Speaker of the House and the Speaker of the Senate on August 4, 1818. On January 25, 1819, the Legislature adopted a formal act "for establishing an university," and this date must be reckoned as the year of the origin of the University, although the institution was not opened to students until March 7, 1825. Although Jefferson's was the dominant spirit and the shaping hand in the whole movement for the establishment of a state university, it should be stated that but for the influence and efforts of Joseph Carrington Cabell, the close personal friend of Jefferson, the acts of February 21, 1818, and January 25, 1819, would probably have failed of adoption by the Legislature. The act of January 25, 1819, establishing the University, is as follows (Revised Code, 1819, ch. 34, p. 90): "1. Be it declared by the General Assembly of Virginia, That the conveyance of the lands and other property appertaining to the Central College in the County of Albemarle, which has been executed by the proctor thereof, under authority of the subscribers and founders, to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund, is hereby accepted, for the use and on the conditions in the said deed of conveyance expressed. "2. And be it enacted, That there shall be established, on the site provided for the said College, an university, to be called the University of Virginia; that it shall be under the government of seven visitors to be appointed forthwith by the Governor, with the advice of Council, notifying thereof the persons so appointed, and prescribing to them a day for their first meeting at the said INTRODUCTION. University, with supplementary instructions for procuring a meeting subsequently, in the event of failure at the time first appointed. "3. The said visitors, or so many of them as, being a majority, shall attend, shall appoint a rector, of their own body, to preside at their meetings, and a secretary to record, attest, and preserve their proceedings, and shall proceed to examine into the state of the property conveyed as aforesaid; shall make an inventory of the same, specifying the items whereof it consists; shall notice the buildings and other improvements already made, and those which are in progress; shall take measures for their completion, and for the addition of such others, from time to time, as may be necessary. "4. In the said University shall be taught the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages; French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Anglo-Saxon; the different branches of Mathematics, pure and physical; natural philosophy; the principles of agriculture; chemistry; mineralogy, including geology; botany, zoÃ¶logy; anatomy; medicine; civil government; political economy; the law of nature and nations; municipal law; history; ideology; general grammar; ethics; rhetoric; and belles lettres; which branches of science shall be so distributed, and under so many professors, not exceeding ten, as the visitors shall think proper and expedient. "5. Each professor shall be allowed the use of the apartments and accommodations provided for him, and those first employed such standing salary as the visitors shall think proper and sufficient, and their successors such standing salary, not exceeding one thousand dollars, as the visitors shall think proper and sufficient, with such tuition fees from each student as the visitors shall from time to time establish. "6. The said visitors shall be charged with the erection, preservation, and repair of the buildings, the care of the grounds and appurtenances, and of the interests of the University generally; they shall have power to appoint a bursar, employ a proctor, and all other necessary agents; to appoint and remove professors, two-thirds of the whole number of visitors voting for the removal; to prescribe their duties and the course of education, in conformity with the law; to establish rules for the government and discipline of the students, not contrary to the laws of the land; to regulate tuition fees, and the rent of the dormitories occupied; to prescribe and control the duties and proceedings of all officers, servants, and others, with respect to the buildings, lands, appurtenances, and other property and interests of the University; to draw from the literary funds such monies as are by law charged on it for this institution; and, in general, to direct and do all matters and things which, not being inconsistent with the laws of the land, to them shall seem most expedient for promoting the purposes of said institution; which several functions they shall be free to exercise in the form of by-laws, resolutions, orders, instructions, or otherwise, as they shall deem proper. "7. They shall have two stated meetings in every year, to-wit, on the first Mondays of April and October; and occasional meetings at such other times as they shall appoint, or on a special call, with such notice as themselves INTRODUCTION. shall prescribe by a general rule, which meetings shall be at the University, a majority of them constituting a quorum for business; and on the death, resignation of a member, or failure to act for the space of one year, or on his removal out of the Commonwealth, or by the Governor, with the advice of Council, the Governor with the like advice shall appoint a successor. "8. The said rector and visitors shall be a body corporate, under the style and title of `The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia,' with the right, as such, to use a common seal; they shall have capacity to plead and be impleaded in all courts of justice, and in all cases interesting to the University, which may be subjects of legal cognizance and jurisdiction; which pleas shall not abate by the determination of their office, but shall stand revived in the name of their successors; and they shall be capable in law, and in trust for the University, of receiving subscriptions and donations, real and personal, as well from bodies corporate or persons associated, as from private individuals. "9. And the said rector and visitors shall, at all times, conform to such laws as the legislature may, from time to time, think proper to enact for their government; and the said University shall in all things, and at all times, be subject to the control of the legislature. And the said rector and visitors of the University of Virginia shall be, and they are hereby, required to make report annually to the president and directors of the literary fund (to be laid before the legislature at the next succeeding session), embracing a full account of the disbursements, the funds on hand, and a general statement of the condition of said University. "10. The said board of visitors, or a majority thereof, by nomination of the board, shall, once in every year at least, visit the said University; enquire into the proceedings and practices thereat; examine the progress of the students, and give to those who excel in every branch of science there taught, such honorary marks and testimonials of approbation as may encourage and incite to industry and emulation. "11. On every twenty-ninth day of February, or, if that be Sunday, then on the next, or earliest day thereafter on which a meeting can be effected, the Governor and Council shall be in session, and shall appoint visitors of the said University, either the same or others at their discretion, to serve until the twenty-ninth day of February next ensuing, duly and timely notifying to them their appointment, and prescribing a day for their first meeting at the University; after which, their meetings, stated and occasional, shall be as hereinbefore provided: Provided, that nothing in this act contained shall suspend the proceedings of the visitors of the said Central College of Albemarle; but for the purpose of expediting any objects of said institution, they shall be authorized, under the control of the Governor and Council, to continue the exercise of their functions, and fulfill those of their successors, until the first actual meeting of their said successors. "12. And be it further enacted, That the additional sum of twenty thousand dollars shall be, and the same is hereby, appropriated to the education of the INTRODUCTION. poor, out of the revenue of the literary fund, in the aid of the sum heretofore appropriated to that object, and to be paid in the same manner and upon the same conditions in all respects as is prescribed by the fourth section of the act, entitled `An act appropriating part of the revenue of the literary fund, and for other purposes, passed the twenty-first day of February, eighteen hundred and eighteen.' "13. This act shall commence and be in force from and after the passing thereof." The first Board of Visitors consisted of four members of the old board of Central Collegeânamely, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Joseph Carrington Cabell, and John H. Cocke; the additional appointees were James Breckenridge, Chapman Johnson, and Robert Taylor. The board met for the first time on March 29, 1819, and elected Thomas Jefferson rector. Henceforth, until his death in 1826, Jefferson was the dominating and directing power of the University, not only evolving the entire system of education introduced, but actually devising, to the minutest detail, every feature of construction and administration. The organization of the University, its government, discipline, and methods of instruction, were virtually prescribed by Jefferson alone; and in many respects they still retain the impression derived from him. By virtue of its charter, the supreme government of the institution, under the General Assembly, is vested in the Rector and Visitors. Under the general direction of this board, and subject to its regulations, the affairs of the University were administered, for the first eighty years of its existence, by the Faculty and its chairman, the latter being a member of the Faculty, who occupied temporarily the position of chief executive officer of the institution. As the University grew, it became more and more difficult for a member of the teaching staff to fill the position of Chairman, and attend to the manifold executive duties attached to that office. In October, 1903, the Visitors decided that modern conditions rendered necessary the creation of the office of president; and in June, 1904, Edwin Anderson Alderman was elected first president of the University of Virginia. The scheme of instruction organized by Jefferson contemplated no fixed uniform curriculum of studies to be pursued by every student alike, without discrimination. Each distinct branch of knowledge was, as far as was practicable, assigned to an individual "School" with its own instructors; and the University was to consist of a collection of independent Schools. The origin of the elective system at the University of Virginia is found in the fact that students were permitted to matriculate in any School or Schools of the University for which they were prepared. The wisdom of the Founder in establishing such a system has been amply vindicated in the history of this university and in the adoption by almost all schools of higher education in the country of methods involving this principle. The original organization embraced eight independent Schoolsânamely, Ancient Languages, Modern Languages, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Moral INTRODUCTION. Philosophy, Chemistry, Medicine, and Law. The first seven Schools mentioned were opened to matriculates on March 7, 1825, with an aggregate attendance, during the first session, of 123 students. The School of Law was not opened until 1826. This original organization was gradually enlarged and modified. As early as 1837 the School of Medicine was elevated to a Department, consisting of three individual Schools; while in 1850 the School of Law was enlarged to a Department consisting of two Schools. Other Departments and Schools have been added from time to time. A most notable addition was made in May, 1909, when, through a gift of $500,000 from Mr. Andrew Carnegie to the General Alumni Association, six new Schools were established by joint action of the Rector and Visitors and the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund: The Andrew Carnegie School of Engineering, The James Madison School of Law, The James Monroe School of International Law, The James Wilson School of Political Economy, The Edgar Allan Poe School of English, The Walter Reed School of Pathology. It was provided by the first Board of Visitors, in accordance with Jefferson's wishes, that but two degrees should be conferred by the University. The lower degree, characteristic of the institution for many years, was conferred upon a student who had completed all the work offered in any one School; to such a candidate the untitled degree of "Graduate" in the School in question should be given. The other, the higher degree, was to be the doctor's degree and was to be given to the graduate in two or more Schools who had, in addition, exhibited well-developed powers of research. There is abundant evidence that, in planning the organization of the University of Virginia, Thomas Jefferson had in mind the so-called continental type of university. The first faculty were, however, with one or two exceptions, Oxford or Cambridge men. Naturally they had in mind the English type of university, and the result was that in 1831 the Faculty substituted for the doctor's degree proposed by Jefferson, the master's degree, common in England. The degree of "Master of Arts of the University of Virginia" was accordingly, for more than half a century, the leading degree conferred by this institution. THE HONOR SYSTEM. For eighteen years after the opening of the institution, written examinations were conducted under the surveillance of a committee of three professors. This was not altogether satisfactory, and in June, 1842, Judge Henry St. George Tucker, Professor of Law, offered the following resolution, which the Faculty at once adopted: Resolved, That in all future written examinations for distinction and other honors of the University, each candidate shall attach to the written answers presented by him on such examination a certificate in the following words: "I, A. B., do hereby certify, on honor, that I have derived no assistance during INTRODUCTION. the time of this examination from any source whatever, whether oral, written, or in print, in giving the above answers." This was the beginning of the honor system at this institution and it has been in operation ever since without interruption. Later the pledge was extended so as to preclude the giving as well as the receiving of assistance. Still more recently the scope of the honor system has been enlarged so as to cover other phases of student conduct. Its administration is entirely in the hands of the students, the essence of the system being that the violation of a student's word of honor is an offense not against the university authorities but against the whole student body, and on the rare occasions on which it has occurred, the students themselves have quietly and promptly sent the offender away from the University without need of faculty action. Examinations are required to be held in one place and in the presence of the professor in charge of the course or one of his assistants. These regulations in no way conflict with the spirit of the honor system, but are regarded as being necessary to give a proper dignity and formality to the occasion. EQUIPMENT. The teaching staff numbers one hundred and twenty-three, of whom sixty-five are of professorial grade. The general and departmental libraries contain about one hundred and four thousand volumes. The value of the grounds, buildings, and equipment owned by the University is $2,383,314.68. The University holds productive funds to the amount of $2,211,472.25. In addition to the income from endowment, students' fees, dormitories, etc., it receives from the State annually $120,000. The expenditures for the session of 1915-16 were $380,673.20. The Leander McCormick Observatory, the Rouss Physical Laboratory, the Chemical Laboratory, the Geological Laboratory, the Engineering Laboratories, the Power, Light, and Heating Plant, the Lewis Brooks Museum of Natural History, the Biological Laboratory, the Anatomical Laboratory, the laboratories of Histology, Embryology, Pharmacology and Pathology, the Physiological Laboratory, and the Hospital buildings and laboratories offer large and modern facilities for the study of pure and applied science. The Department of Law and the School of Education are housed in buildings which have been recently completed. INTRODUCTION. ORGANIZATION. The University comprises a number of independent Schools. The courses of instruction given in these various Schools are so coÃ¶rdinated as to form six Departments, two of which are academic, and four professional, viz.: THE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS. The College, with the degrees of Bachelor of Arts; Bachelor of Science; Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject; Bachelor of Science in Education; Bachelor of Science in Medicine. The Department of Graduate Studies, with the degrees of Graduate in a School; Master of Arts; Master of Science; Master of Science in a Special Subject; Doctor of Philosophy. THE PROFESSIONAL DEPARTMENTS. The Department of Law, with the degree of Bachelor of Laws. The Department of Medicine, with the degree of Doctor of Medicine. The Department of Engineering, with the degrees of Civil Engineer: Mechanical Engineer; Electrical Engineer; Chemical Engineer; Mining Engineer. The Department of Agriculture.* * Pending a reorganization of this department, the section of the catalogue treating of it is omitted for the current session. But see p. 124. The Summer School.

ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. For admission to any department of the University the general conditions are the following: 1. Sufficient Age:âThe minimum legal age is sixteen years; the Faculty advises seventeen or more. Eighteen years is the minimum for admission to the Department of Law. 2. Good Character:âThis must be attested by a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended, or by other valid proof. 3. Adequate Preparation:âThis must be such as will enable the candidate to meet the requirements for admission to the several departments of the University, as detailed below. For admission to the Department of Graduate Studies, see page 160. For admission to the Department of Medicine, see page 185. For admission to the College, the Department of Law, or the Department of Engineering, the candidate must present a certificate or pass an equivalent examination. In either case the amount of preparation required is measured in terms of units. A unit represents a year's study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year's work. This definition of a unit takes the four-year high-school course as a basis, and assumes that the length of the school year is from thirty-six to forty weeks, that a period is from forty to sixty minutes in length, and that the study is pursued for four or five periods a week; but under ordinary circumstances a satisfactory year's work in any subject cannot be accomplished in less than one hundred and twenty hours, or their equivalent. Schools organized on any other than a four-year basis can, nevertheless, estimate their work in terms of this unit. For the requirements as to the number and selection of units for entrance to the three departments mentioned above, see, for the College, p. 150; for the Department of Law, p. 166; for the Department of Engineering, p. 203. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. SUBJECTS ACCEPTED FOR ADMISSION. The subjects accepted for admission and their values in units are given below in tabulated form. Fuller definitions of the units follow on page 80.

ADMISSION BY CERTIFICATE. For admission by certificate the applicant should file with the Dean of the University not later than September 1 a Certificate of Preparation, made out on the black form furnished by the University. This certificate must come from a recognized institution of collegiate rank, from an accredited public high school, or from an accredited private secondary school. The candidate for admission from a public high school must be a graduate of an accredited four-year high school. The candidate for admission from a private secondary school must be a graduate of the school, or must present a certificate showing that he has completed at least the equivalent of four years of satisfactory high-school work of standard grade, covering at least fifteen entrance units. In every case the candidate for admission must have the recommendation of the principal of the certifying school. Schools in Virginia are accredited by the Faculty of this university after inspection and report by a committee of the Faculty (see pages 90-93). The Dean of the University is further authorized to accept certificates from schools outside Virginia, accredited by their own State Universities or institutions of equal rank, provided the courses of study offered in such schools meet the requirements demanded of accredited schools in this State. If in any accredited school the number of periods given to a study, or the length of the period, is below the specified standard, the credit for such subject is reduced pro rata. In the science subjects only half-credit is allowed unless individual laboratory notebooks, properly attested by the teacher in charge, are filed with the certificate. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must in all cases take the entrance examinations. ADMISSION BY EXAMINATION. For admission by examination, the candidate must present himself at the University in June or in September, according to the dates given in the Program of Entrance Examinations. The examinations are held under the honor system, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge (see page 14). All candidates who take their examinations at the times appointed are tested free of charge. In case of delayed entrance, where the grounds of postponement are good, the President of the Univercity may admit the candidate to a special examination, for which a fee of five dollars is charged. This fee is payable in advance and is in no case returned. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. PROGRAM OF EXTRANCE EXAMINATIONS. June, 1917 9-11 A. M. 11A.M.-1P.M. 3-5 P. M.

The following definitions of the entrance units are designed on the one hand to guide the student in his preparation for the entrance examinations and on the other to govern high-school principals and teachers in organizing their courses of instruction. ENGLISH. The courses outlined, in accordance with the program of most high schools, take into account English, (1) as a language, (2) as a means of expression, (3) as a literatureâall so intimately connected, however, that the proper study of each will bear indirectly on the other two.

The Latin reading required of candidates for admission to college, without regard to the prescription of particular authors and works, shall ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. be not less in amount than CÃ¦sar, Gallic War, I-IV; Cicero, the orations against Catiline, for the Manilian Law, and for Archias; Vergil, Ãneid, I-VI. 2. The amount of reading specified shall be selected by the schools from the following authors and works: CÃ¦sar (Gallic War and Civil War) and Nepos (Lives); Cicero (Orations, Letters, and De Senectute) and Sallust (Catiline and Jugurthine War); Vergil (Bucolics, Georgics, and Ãneid) and Ovid (Metamorphoses, Fasti, and Tristia.) II. SUBJECTS AND SCOPE OF THE EXAMINATIONS. 1. Translation at Sight. Candidates will be examined in translation at sight of both prose and verse. The vocabulary, constructions, and range of ideas of the passages set will be suited to the preparation secured by the reading indicated above. 2. Prescribed Reading. Candidates will be examined also upon the following prescribed reading: Cicero, orations for the Manilian Law and for Archias, and Vergil, Ãneid, I, II, and either IV or VI at the option of the candidate, with questions on subject-matter, literary and historical allusions, and prosody. Every paper in which passages from the prescribed reading are set for translation will contain also one or more passages for translation at sight; and candidates must deal satisfactorily with both these parts of the paper, or they will not be given credit for either part. 3. Grammar and Composition. The examinations in grammar and composition will demand thorough knowledge of all regular inflections, all common irregular forms, and the ordinary syntax and vocabulary of the prose authors read in school, with ability to use this knowledge in writing simple Latin prose. The words, constructions, and range of ideas called for in the examinations in composition will be such as are common in the reading of the year, or years, covered by the particular examination. Note.âThe examinations in grammar and composition may be either in separate papers or combined with other parts of the Latin examination, at the option of each individual institution; and nothing in any of the above definitions of the requirements shall be taken to prevent any college from asking questions on the grammar, prosody, or subject-matter of any of the passages set for translation, if it so desires. SUGGESTIONS CONCERNING PREPARATION. Exercises in translation at sight should begin in school with the first lessons in which Latin sentences of any length occur, and should continue throughout the course with sufficient frequency to insure correct methods of work on the part of the student. From the outset particular attention should be given to developing the ability to take in the meaning of each wordâand so, gradually, of the whole sentenceâjust as it stands; the sentence should be read and understood in the order of the original, with full appreciation of the force of each word as it comes, so far as this can be known or inferred from that which has preceded and from the form and the position of the word itself. The habit of reading in this way should be encouraged and cultivated as the best preparation for all the translating that the student has to do. No translation, however, should be a mechanical metaphrase. Nor should it be a mere loose paraphrase. The full meaning of the passage to be translated, gathered in the way described above, should finally be expressed in clear and natural English. A written examination cannot test the ear or tongue, but proper instruction in any language will necessarily include the training of both. The school work in Latin, therefore, should include much reading aloud, writing from dictation, and translation from the teacher's reading. Learning suitable passages by heart is also very useful, and should be more practiced. The work in composition should give the student a better understanding of the Latin he is reading at the time, if it is prose, and greater facility in ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. reading. It is desirable, however, that there should be systematic and regular work in composition during the time in which poetry is read as well; for this work the prose authors already studied should be used as models. In accordance with the above report, the following detailed description of the four units of Latin is given: Latin A. Grammar, Composition and Translation:âThe Roman pronunciation; habitual observance of accent and quantity; thorough mastery of the regular forms; the simple rules of word-formation and derivation; syntax of the cases, tenses, and modes; accusative and infinitive, relative and conditional sentences, indirect discourse, and the subjunctive.

REGISTRATION. Registration of New Students.âApplicants seeking admission to the University for the first time must present themselves at Peabody Hall at some time during the first three days of the session. Each candidate who satisfies the requirements for admission set forth on pp. 76-89 will be directed to the dean of the department which he proposes to enter, or, in the case of first-year students in the College, to one of several professors designated for this purpose by the Dean. After conference with the above the candidate will receive a card containing a list of the courses which he wishes to take. This card must be presented to each professor concerned, who will, on satisfying himself that the applicant is prepared to take the course in question, sign the card, and enter the applicant's name upon the roll of the course. The card must then be presented to the Bursar, who will endorse upon it the amount of fees to be paid. On payment of these fees the registration of the applicant as a student of the University will be completed. Registration of Matriculated Students.âStudents who have previously been matriculated as members of the University are required to present themselves directly to the deans of their respective departments upon one of the first three days of the session, and to follow thereafter the procedure described above. Delayed Registration.âAny student who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session will be admitted to registration only provided he can explain his delay in a manner satisfactory to the President, and will be charged a delayed registration fee of three dollars. Registration After the Christmas Recess.âOn the first week-day after the Christmas recess every student is required to register with the dean of his department between the hours of nine A. M. and two P. M. Any student failing to register thus will be required to pay the delayed registration fee of three dollars, and will be liable to whatever penalties may be imposed by his professors for unexcused absences. But if the delay is due to illness or other providential cause, the dean is authorized to remit the fee and to notify the professors concerned that the student's absences have been satisfactorily explained. RESIDENCE AND ATTENDANCE. The Academic Year begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September and continues for thirty-nine weeks. Thanksgiving Day and Jefferson Day are holidays, and there is a Christmas recess beginning on REGULATIONS. the last week-day before the twenty-fifth of December and closing on the evening of the second of January. Attendance is required of each student throughout the entire session, with the exception of holidays, unless he has received written permission to be temporarily absent, or to withdraw before the close of the session. While in residence each student is required to attend regularly all lectures and other prescribed exercises in the courses which he pursues, or else suffer such penalties as his professors may impose for unexcused absences. Leave of Absence from the University is granted for sufficient reason by the dean of the department in which the student is registered, and must in every case be obtained in advance. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or other student organizations on excursions will not be granted except to the officers and members of these organizations. The laws relating to absence from the University of members of the athletic teams are found on page 250. The same regulations apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University and the dean of the department in which the student is registered. When a permit is granted upon the University Physician's certificate that withdrawal is necessary on account of ill health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct, the fees are returned pro rata. Under no other circumstances will there be a return of fees. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the several department faculties for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also the regulations as to delinquent students in the various departments: The College, p. 152; the Department of Law, pp. 181-182; the Department of Medicine, pp. 187-188; the Department of Engineering, p. 221. Absence From Examinations.âWritten examinations are an essential part of the work of every course in the University, and attendance upon them is required of every student. Absence may be excused only on the ground of sickness on the day of the examination (attested by a physician's certificate), or other imperative cause which may be approved by the several faculties of the University. Special Examinations are granted only upon prompt application therefor, and in case the applicant's absence from the regular examination has been excused. See the preceding paragraph. Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the Honor System, and an unpledged paper is counted as a total failure. In matters of class standing as well, students are expected to regard themselves as governed by the law of honor. See p. 13. CONDUCT. The laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University REGULATIONS. whether he be within the university precincts or not. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University any student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The keeping of dogs by students within the university grounds is forbidden. Prohibition of Credit.âAn act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting minor students. The license to contract debts, which the President is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity. DORMITORIES AND BOARD. Dormitories.âStudents may reside in the university dormitories, in their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. The President will withdraw from the approved list any house in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Any change of residence during the session should be reported at the office of the Registrar. For rules governing the rental and occupancy of university dormitories, and the rates charged for the same, see pp. 102-103. For list of private lodging houses, with rates, apply to the Registrar. Board.âStudents may board at the University Commons, at their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. For the cost of board at the Commons, see p. 102. For list of private boarding houses, with rates, apply to the Registrar. MEDICAL ATTENDANCE AND PHYSICAL TRAINING. Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the University Physician; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for his maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, treatment of the eye, ear, nose, and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of students, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Students who take the responsibility of boarding at houses not approved by the Board of Health forfeit the right of medical attendance. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the University Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. REGULATIONS. Physical Training.âNo student is permitted to undertake an amount of work greater than he may reasonably be expected to carry without detriment to his health; and every student is advised to take a due amount of daily outdoor exercise, for which ample opportunities are afforded by the athletic fields, the tennis courts, the golf course, and elsewhere; and, in addition, to make systematic use of the facilities afforded without cost for definite and judicious physical training at the Fayerweather Gymnasium under the advice and instruction of the director and his assistants. Further information upon this important subject will be found upon page 247. EXPENSES. EXPENSES. The university fee, tuition and laboratory fees, the contingent deposit, rent of rooms in the university buildings, and charges for service in the same, are payable upon entrance. Under special conditions the President is authorized to allow credit, but these deferred payments are in all cases to be properly secured. Students permitted to register during a term are required to pay the full fees for that term. Under no circumstances will there be a return of fees except upon certificate from the University Physician that withdrawal from the University is necessary on account of ill health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct. Upon receipt of the University Physician's certificate, the President will return the fees pro rata. A student's necessary expenses are as follows: I. University Charges, which are the same for all students, except Virginians in the College, the Department of Graduate Studies, and the Department of Engineering; II. Department Fees, which depend upon the course of study pursued; III. Board and Lodging, the cost of which varies according to the degree of economy the student is inclined to practice. I. UNIVERSITY CHARGES. Under the first head are included (a) the university fee, $40 ($10 for Virginians in the Academic Departments, $20 for Virginians in the Department of Engineering), and (b) the contingent deposit, $10; as well as (c) certain special fees which may or may not be incurred, namely: 1. The special entrance examination fee of five dollars, 2. The delayed registration fee of three dollars, 3. The re-examination fee of five dollars. (a) The university fee goes to the fund intended to defray the general expenses of the University. Payment of this fee entitles the student, without additional charge, to the use of the Library; to the privileges of the Gymnasium, with baths, private lockers, etc., and the advice and aid of the Instructor of Physical Culture; and to free medical attendance by the University Physician in case of illness (see page 96). It also covers all regular examination and diploma fees. (b) The contingent deposit is intended to cover any damage to university property for which the student is responsible, and any fines incurred by violating the rules of the Library. (See page 239). It is returned at the end of the session, less any charges that may have been made against it. From this deposit there will be deducted the sum of two dollars for the support of the chapel services and general religious work of the University, unless within one month after registration the student shall request the Bursar not to deduct this amount. It will be observed that this sum (which is EXPENSES. less than the average contribution made by the students who have subscribed to the chapel fund in past years), is not a necessary expense, as the support of the religious work of the University is entirely optional. This method of collection is intended merely as a substitute for the canvass formerly made, and it is the desire of the Faculty that the students thus unite with them in maintaining the religious work of the University. (c) 1. The special entrance examination fee of five dollars is required of any candidate admitted to to a special entrance examination, under the provisions set forth on page 78. 2. The delayed registration fee of three dollars is required of any student who fails to register promptly at the beginning of the session or after the Christmas recess, under the provisions set forth on page 94. 3. The re-examination fee of five dollars is required of any student admitted to re-examination, under the provisions set forth on page 152 (the College), and page 221 (the Department of Engineering). II. DEPARTMENT FEES. Under this head are comprised the charges for instruction, which include the tuition fee, and laboratory fees. As these differ in different departments, they are set forth below in tabular form, and for the sake of convenience the university charges above specified are grouped with them. Students From Virginia.âIn accordance with the statute (Virginia Code 1887, Ch. 68, Sec. 1554), the University remits to Virginia students in the Academic Departments the tuition fee (except in Analytical Chemistry) and all but $10 of the university fee, and to Virginia students in the Department of Engineering the tuition fee in those courses (except Analytical Chemistry), which are also offered in the College, and one-half the university fee. In order to be considered a Virginia student, it is necessary that the applicant's parents be domiciled in the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; if he has attained his majority, it is necessary that he himself be domiciled here. One is domiciled in the State who is living in it at the time the application is made and has no intention of removing therefrom in the future, or who, though absent from the State, has not lost his former domicile by acquiring one elsewhere. No other person can honestly avail himself of this privilege. White Male Teachers and Superintendents of the Public Schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Academic Schools of the University without payment of fees (except those charged in laboratory courses), upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the public schools of the State during the year. At the beginning of the third term any of the following courses may be entered upon with profit by an applicant prepared for them: Latin, Greek, French, Spanish, Italian, German, English, English Literature and Rhetoric, Biblical History and Literature, Public Speaking, History, Economics, Political Science, Education, Philosophy, Mathematics, Astronomy, Physics, Chemistry, Industrial Chemistry, Geology, Biology, Botany, and ZoÃ¶logy. Special courses for teachers will be offered in English and Mathematics, EXPENSES. and perhaps in several other subjects during the approaching spring term, if the demand for them is sufficient. Applicants for admission as teachers are required to send in their names to the President of the University not later than March 5. Ministerial Students.âMinisters of the gospel may attend any of the Academic Schools of the University without payment of the tuition fee. The same privilege will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet without aid the expense of an education at the University.

D. Department of Law: University Fee $ 40 Tuition Fee 100 Contingent Deposit 10 $150 Students taking an irregular course pay for tuition according to the relation which the amount of work taken bears to the regular course. For such course the tuition fee may be estimated approximately in dollars as three-tenths of the total number of lecture periods. E. Department of Medicine: University Fee $ 40 Tuition Fee 100 Contingent Deposit 10 $150 Students taking courses in Organic and Physiological Chemistry are required to deposit, in addition to the charges above stated, $10 as a contingent laboratory fee.

For courses in Analytical Chemistry, see above. Virginians are relieved of tuition in collegiate courses. The fee for each technical lecture course is $30; for each practice course in Drawing, $15; for each laboratory or practice course in Applied Mechanics, Engineering, Shop-Work, or Field-Work, $5. These fees include all charges for laboratory materials, but the student is held further responsible for breakage. III. BOARD AND LODGING. A student may rent a room in one of the university dormitories, and take his meals either in the University Commons or in an approved private boarding house; or he may take both room and board in such boarding house, in which case he pays no room-rent or servant-hire to the University. A list of private boarding and lodging houses, with rates, may be had upon application to the Registrar. The University Commons. This building, conveniently situated near the center of the University, provides an attractive dining hall, with accommodations for seating more than two hundred and fifty students at one time. Board is now furnished at $16.50 per month, and it is hoped that it will be possible to continue this rate. University Dormitories. Rules.âThe rules governing the rental and occupancy of rooms in the university dormitories are as follows: Students desiring rooms should apply to the Bursar, enclosing a reservation fee of $5, which will be returned should there be no room to let. The occupant of a room may reserve it for the next session, by applying to the Bursar, and depositing $5 (which is in no case returnable), not later than May 1. The balance of the rent must be paid not later than the first registration day of the session, otherwise such preference or other right shall be forfeited. No room may be sublet. Two students may occupy a room together, each paying half the rent. Rates.âAll rooms are unfurnished. For a single room furniture can be secured from the local dealers at a minimum cost of $15 for the session. All rooms are provided with either steam or hot-water heat, electric light, and janitor service, except where otherwise specified. The rooms on East and West Lawn (with the exception of Bachelor's Row), East and West Range, and Dawson's Row, are commodious, and are frequently occupied by two students. The rates given below are for the session of nine months. Randall Building. The rooms in this building are assigned only to students taking board at the University Commons, and any student occupying one of these rooms, who fails to remain at the Commons until the end of the session, will be EXPENSES. required to vacate the same. The single rooms are 10 Ã 14, 10 Ã 15, 10 Ã 16. The double rooms are 14 Ã 15, 15 Ã 15, 15 Ã 17. The study is 9â² 6â³ Ã 11â² 6â³. No janitor service is provided. Single rooms (32) $35.00 Double rooms (9) 40.00 Double room with study (1) 50.00 East Range. Rooms in old gymnasium building (8) $60.00 Other rooms (26) 72.00 West Range. Rooms, no heat, but provided with great (4) $60.00 Other rooms (20) 72.00 East and West Lawns. Rooms in Bachelor's Row (9) $70.00 Other rooms (27) 75.00 Dawson's Row. Rooms (56) $75.00 Dawson's Row comprises seven detached eight-room houses, toilet in each house, lavatory with running water in each room. Bath house with shower is provided for the Row. APPROXIMATE SUMMARY OF ALL EXPENSES. The figures in the following tables may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of nine months. As necessary expenses are reckoned here university and tuition fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. For each department three estimates are given,âa low, an average, and a liberal, estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundry,âin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. By sharing a room with another student, and by practicing the strictest economy, a student's expenses may possibly be reduced below the low estimate. A. ESTIMATE OF NECESSARY EXPENSES IN THE COLLEGE.

While it is difficult for any student to be assured of remunerative work before he reaches the University, information as to such employment may be had from the Secretary of the Committee on Student Self-Help, Madison Hall. For Loan Funds for deserving students, see page 112. SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS. SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS. All inquiries concerning and all applications for scholarships and fellowships should be addressed to the Dean of the University. Applicants for scholarships and fellowships, if not already registered as students of the University, must comply with all the entrance requirements. The President may, after due warning to the holder, declare any scholarship or fellowship vacant at any time, if in the judgment of the President and Faculty the holder fails to give satisfactory evidence of diligence in the performance of his duties. Unless otherwise stated, the tenure of each scholarship or fellowship is one year, and the holder may be a student in any department of the University. SCHOLARSHIPS.

The Purpose of the School of Education.âIn the rapid development of educational science and the resulting attention given to the improvement of the several phases of public education, it is important that all who are interested in the growth of this great agency of democracy, generally or professionally, be given ample opportunity to study its underlying principles, SCHOOL OF EDUCATION. organization and most practical applications. Those who aim to teach or to administer public-school affairs require instruction and training in the scientific principles and in the technique of their calling. The study of the principles, ways and means of formal education is incumbent on all citizens who earnestly seek an intelligent and conscientious balloting on public school affairs. For these reasons the courses in the School of Education aim to supply the needs of the two classes of citizens referred to. Besides those courses which, as contributing toward a liberal education, may be advantageously included in programs of study leading to the cultural academic degrees (see pp. 156-157), the School of Education offers a wide range of courses for the professional training of teachers and public school administrators. One curriculum is offered leading to the degree of B.S. in Education (see p. 158), and one curriculum leading to a teacher's certificate only. 1. Students receiving the B.S. in Education will receive the Professional Collegiate Certificate issued by the Department of Public Instruction of Virginia. 2. A student who cannot complete the requirements for the B.S. in Education, or who must delay the completion of them, may elect the following two-year course which leads to a Teacher's Certificate issued by the Department of Public Instruction of Virginia. This work may later be credited toward the B.S. in Education. The course, comprising 30 session-hours, embraces the following requirements: (a) From the School of Education: Education B2, B3, B6, and B7 or B8. Total: 12 session-hours. (b) From the other Academic Schools: One modern language course from Group I, and one course each from Groups II, III, IV and V. Total: 18 session-hours. Courses for Teachers in Service.âSaturday courses in any subject offered in the school of Education will be arranged for teachers in service, if requested by at least five teachers. Degree credit will be allowed on the same basis as in regular courses, provided that not more than one and one-half session-hours of credit shall be given for the work in any course for one year. Recommendation of Teachers.âThe recommendation of teachers is in charge of the Bureau of Appointments, through which positions are secured, not only for students in the School of Education, but for other students who are known to be fitted to fill vacancies reported. In response to requests from the proper authorities, teachers are recommended for positions as instructors in colleges and normal schools, as superintendents, as supervisors in special subjects, as principals or department teachers in high schools, and as principals of elementary schools. The demand for teachers has been greater than the supply. Correspondence in regard to this matter may be addressed to the Bureau of Appointments, University, Virginia. For Undergraduates.

President JAMES MORRIS PAGE, M.A., Ph.D., LL.D. Dean ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. The general requirements for admission to the University may be found on page 76. For admission to the College, the candidate should possess an amount of preparation which is at least the equivalent of that represented by four years of successful work in an accredited school. He must offer, either by certificate or by examination (see page 78), fifteen units, of which three must be in English, two and one-half in Mathematics, and one in History. The remaining eight and one-half units may be selected at will from the list on page 77, unless the candidate expects to apply for a baccalaureate degree. In that case he should offer, if he is an applicant for the degree of Bachelor of Arts, four units in Latin or two units in Greek; if he is an applicant for the degree of Bachelor of Science, four units in two modern languages (French, German, Spanish). For definitions of the entrance units, see pages 80-89. Advanced Standing is given to any candidate who, in addition to meeting the minimum requirements for entrance above stated, can show by passing an examination that he has done work equivalent to that covered by any of the following courses offered in the College: Latin A1, Greek A1, English Literature A1, English Literature A2, Mathematics A1, Mathematics A2. Such a candidate will be admitted to the corresponding B course, and upon his successful completion of the same will be entitled to count toward a baccalaureate degree the credit value of both the A and the B courses in question. The examinations for advanced standing are set at some time during the first month of the session. College Credit.âCandidates who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students, and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the College a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. This certificate must be acceptable both to the Dean and to the professors in charge of the courses accredited. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college, must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate, and must give his grades, which should in no case fall below the standard of seventy-five per cent. The final validation of such certificates is effected by the successful completion of the courses taken in this university. In no case will credit be given on more than forty-eight session-hours of work done elsewhere, and any candidate who receives this maximum amount of credit can count among the remaining fifteen session-hours THE COLLEGE. required for his degree only the credit value of the courses he has passed as a resident student in the College, exclusive of any credit for work done in the Summer School or in any of the professional departments. In every case the candidate must spend at least one regular session exclusively in college work in this university. For the conditions upon which college credit is granted for work done in the Summer School, see p. 235. Conditioned Students.âA candidate for entrance must offer fifteen units as defined by the Southern Commission on Accredited Schools. At least thirteen of the units offered must be included in the list of units accepted for admission on p. 77. A student not able to offer fifteen units as defined in this list may be conditioned on any two units except English A and B. All conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the session following initial registration. This may be done by private study or by taking courses in the University or in the Summer School. But no course taken to remove a condition may be counted as part of the work credited toward a degree. No conditioned student may be later registered as a special student. Special Students.âA candidate may be admitted as a special student without fulfilling the entrance requirements above specified, provided he is more than twenty years old on the day of registration and gives adequate evidence of serious purpose and of the training needed to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for a degree; but such students are permitted and encouraged to make up their deficiencies by private study or by taking courses in the University or in the Summer School. They will then be admitted as regular students, and may be accepted as applicants for degrees provided all entrance requirements are met at least one academic year before the date of graduation. REGULATIONS. The Session-Hour.âAll courses are measured in terms of the session-hour as a unit. A session-hour is one hour a week throughout the session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week throughout the session of laboratory work. Maximum and Minimum of Session-Hours in One Session.âEach student is required to undertake each session courses aggregating at least fifteen session-hours, except by special permission of the Academic Faculty. This number may be increased in the following cases: (1) First-year students may take eighteen session-hours, provided (a) three of these be in Greek 1, Greek 2, German 1, French 1, or Spanish 1; or (b) the student in question is credited with six hours of advanced standing. (2) Other than first-year students may take eighteen session-hours, provided (a) the student has passed in the preceding session courses aggregating fifteen session-hours, or (b) the student is in his graduating year and needs eighteen session-hours for his degree. In the latter case the special permission of the Academic Faculty must be obtained. (3) Other than first-year students may take twenty-one session-hours, provided they have passed in the preceding session courses aggregating fifteen THE COLLEGE. session-hours, with a grade of at least ninety per cent on each course. Under no circumstances shall a student take more than twenty-one session-hours. Grade.âThe grade of a student in any course, either for a term or for the session, is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Class standing in any course is determined by the regularity of the student's attendance upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercises) of the course, and by the quality of his work, as indicated by his recitation grades, written tests, laboratory work, etc. Grade Required for Passing.âFor passing in any course a grade of seventy-five per cent is required. Grade Required for ReÃ¶xamination.âA student whose session grade in any course falls below seventy-five per cent, but not below sixty-five per cent, may, upon the written recommendation of the professor in charge, be admitted to reÃ¶xamination upon that course, or upon such portion of it as the professor shall determine, during the registration week of the following September. The fee for each reÃ¶xamination is five dollars, and must be paid to the Bursar on or before July 15. An applicant for a degree who fails on a single term of not more than one of his courses during the last year of his candidacy is entitled to a special examination before Final Day on the work of that term, and will receive credit for the course, provided the result of this special examination entitles him to a grade of seventy-five per cent for the term in question, considered independently and without reference to his grade for the other two terms. In such cases no reÃ¶xamination fee is charged. Minimum Grade Required.âAny student whose average grade in all his courses for any term is less than fifty per cent will be dropped from the rolls. Any first-year student whose average grade for any term is fifty per cent or more, but who attains in no one of his courses a grade of sixty-five per cent, will be put on probation for the term next ensuing, and if he again fails to attain for the current term a grade of sixty-five per cent in at least one of his courses, he will be dropped from the rolls. Any student other than a first-year student whose average grade for any term is fifty per cent or more, but who attains in no one of his courses a grade of seventy-five per cent, will be put on probation for the term next ensuing, and if he again fails to attain for the current term a grade of seventy-five per cent in at least one of his courses, or sixty-five per cent in at least two of his courses, he will be dropped from the rolls. A student who through neglect of his work is evidently making no real progress in a course may at any time, after due admonition, be required to drop the course in question; and if, for the current term or for any succeeding term of the current session, his grade in any one of his remaining courses falls below forty per cent, he will be put on probation. Advisers.âTo each first-year student is assigned, before his registration is completed, a member of the Faculty as his adviser, whose acquaintance THE COLLEGE. he should cultivate, and whom he may feel free to consult on any question touching his work or his life as a student of this university. Change of Subjects of Study after registration is completed can be made only with the consent of the student's adviser and of the professors concerned. Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors, but only for sickness or like providential cause. Any explanation of an absence which a student has to offer must be made on the day of the first lecture after the absence. Unexcused absences from lectures render the student liable to such penalties as his professors may impose, or, in serious cases, to faculty discipline. No student, who has, for any reason, been absent from more than fifty per cent of the lectures of any one term, can receive a grade on the work of that term. Absence from Examinations will not be excused except for sickness on the day of the examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, is entitled to a special examination on a date to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge. Reports.âReports are sent at the end of each term to the parent or guardian of each student. These reports indicate the number of times the student has been absent from lectures, and give his term grade in each course. Preliminary reports on attendance and class-standing are made on November 4 to the parent or guardian of every first-year student. The Dean will be glad at any time to furnish to the proper person a special report on any student's standing. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES. Full opportunity is given to any student to carry out any definite plan of work which he may have in view on coming to the University, or which may have been prescribed for him by those under whose direction he is completing his education. But when no well-considered plan has been outlined in advance, and the end in view is that for which the great majority of students enter college, namely, the attainment of a liberal education, the student will be expected to enter upon the regular work of the College leading to a baccalaureate degree. Four degrees are offered candidates for graduation in the College. Two of these, the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science, are cultural; the Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, the name of which is inscribed on the diploma, is a vocational degree, designed for those who wish to fit themselves especially in some branch of the mathematical or natural sciences as a profession; the Bachelor of Science in Medicine is a vocational degree designed for those who wish special preparation for medical work. No course offered by a successful candidate for one of the cultural baccalaureate degrees can be offered by the same candidate as part of the work THE COLLEGE. credited toward the other cultural baccalaureate degrees, nor can any work done to remove an entrance condition be counted for any degree. For a student who enters without advanced standing the normal time required for obtaining a baccalaureate degree is four years, assuming that he completes each year courses which aggregate the regular minimum of fifteen session-hours. A student receiving advanced standing in not less than two subjects may obtain a degree in three years, provided he is able to complete each year eighteen session-hours. A student may materially shorten the time required for obtaining a degree by taking courses in the Summer School on which college credit is given (see p. 235). For credit for work done at other colleges, see p. 150. The requirements for a baccalaureate degree are such as to allow a large measure of freedom of election on the part of the individual student, such restriction only being placed upon this liberty as is necessary to insure at the same time the thoroughness and the breadth of culture for which these degrees stand. In order to secure to the recipient of a degree a due measure of acquaintance with the methods of thought characteristic of each of the leading departments of knowledge, as well as with their subject matter, his courses must be chosen, subject to the specific requirements detailed below, from the following groups, among which are distributed all the undergraduate courses having credit value toward a baccalaureate degree. The courses in parentheses may be counted only as "electives-at-large." Group I: Languages. Each course in this group has a credit value of 3 session-hours. Latin A1. Latin B1. Latin B2. Greek A1.

DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. EDWIN ANDERSON ALDERMAN, Ph.B., D.C.L., LL.D. President RICHARD HEATH DABNEY, M.A., PhD. Dea ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. Required for Admission to the Department.âA candidate for admission to the Department of Graduate Studies must have a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank; or, in case the institution he attended does not confer such a degree, he must present a certificate of graduation in a course of study accepted by the Academic Faculty as fully equivalent to that ordinarily required for the degree in question. Required for Admission as Applicant for a Degree.âIn order to be recognized as an applicant for a Master's or Doctor's degree, any candidate who has not received a baccalaureate degree from this university must secure from the Registrar of the University a blank form, which, when properly filled out, he must file with the Dean of this department, together with a catalogue of the institution from which he graduated. If that institution has (1) a faculty of at least six professors giving their full time to college or university work; (2) entrance requirements equal to those of this university, and (3) a course of four full years in the liberal arts and sciences, the candidate will not be required to take any undergraduate courses except such as the Committee on Rules and Courses or the professors in charge of the graduate courses he elects may consider necessary for their successful prosecution. If, however, the institution in question does not meet the three conditions mentioned above, the candidate's preparation will be carefully considered by the Committee on Rules and Courses, which will prescribe such undergraduate courses as are deemed necessary to supply his deficiencies. REGULATIONS. Grade.âThe grade of a student in any course, either for a term or for the session, is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Grade Required for Passing.âFor passing in any course a grade of seventy-five per cent is required. Absence from Examination will not be excused except for sickness on the day of examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. is excused, is entitled to a special examination on a date to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge. Change of Subjects of Study after registration can be made only with the consent of the Dean and of the professors concerned. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES. Graduate in a School. Any student who successfully completes all the courses offered in any academic School is entitled to a diploma of graduation in that School. The Master's Degrees. A candidate who has received a baccalaureate degree from this university, or who has fulfilled the conditions above specified under Entrance Requirements, is entitled to a master's degree upon his successful completion of four graduate courses, chosen in accordance with the restrictions detailed below: No C course which a candidate has offered as part of the work credited for baccalaureate degree (pp. 156-157) may be counted for a master's degree. A candidate must take at least two graduate courses during the last year of his work for a master's degree, and no candidate may receive this degree until at least one year after he has received his baccalaureate degree, except by special consent of the Academic Faculty. The degree of Master of Arts is conferred upon a Bachelor of Arts who has successfully completed four graduate courses, chosen with the approval of the Academic Faculty. These four courses must be in at least three distinct subjects, and in three different academic Schools, except by special order of the Academic Faculty. Three of the subjects must be cognate, which means that they must be selected from kindred groups of subjects, such as, for example, languages and literature, or mathematics and natural science, or history, economics, and government, or philosophy, education, and biology. The degree of Master of Science is conferred upon a holder of the cultural degree of Bachelor of Science (p. 156), who has successfully completed four graduate courses chosen in accordance with the regulations prescribed for the Master of Arts above. The degree of Master of Science in a Special Subject, the name of which is inscribed on the diploma, is conferred upon a holder of the vocational degree of Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject (p. 157), who has successfully completed four graduate courses selected from among those offered in his special subject, or from among other courses which meet with the approval of the professor or professors in charge of his special subject. Doctor of Philosophy. A candidate for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy must hold the degree of Bachelor of Arts or the cultural degree of Bachelor of Science DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. of this university, or, if he be a graduate of some other institution, he must have fulfilled the conditions above specified under Entrance Requirements. The requirements for the degree are as follows: (1) A reading knowledge of French and German, attested by the successful completion of the B courses in these languages, or else by examinations held at the beginning of the first year of the candidate's work for the doctorate, by committees consisting of the professor in charge of the candidate's major subject and the professors of French and German, respectively. If the candidate fails on one or both of these examinations, he will be required to enter the appropriate course in one or both of these languages. No student will be regarded as a regular candidate for the doctorate until he has fulfilled this requirement. (2) The successful completion of at least three years of graduate work in three subjects, to be known, respectively, as the candidate's major, primary minor and secondary minor. These subjects must be cognate (see p. 161), and must be chosen, with the approval of the Committee on Rules and Courses, from at least three academic Schools. The major must be pursued for at least three years, the primary minor for at least two years, and the secondary minor for at least one year. Any student taking a D course in any subject may be required by the professor, with the approval of the Academic Faculty, to attend such lectures or courses in any of the academic Schools as the professor may deem necessary. Graduate work done in other universities may be accepted in lieu of resident work, provided sufficient evidence is furnished by examination, written or oral, or both, that such work has been of a grade similar to that required here, and has been satisfactorily performed, and provided also that the candidate takes in this university at least one graduate course in his primary minor, and does at least one year's resident work in his major subject. A candidate who is a professor in a chartered college or university, of the subject selected by him as major, may be allowed by the Academic Faculty to spend only two years in resident work. In all cases the work of the last year of candidacy shall be done in residence, unless the Academic Faculty shall for special reasons direct otherwise. (3) A dissertation exhibiting independent research in some branch of the candidate's major subject. The dissertation must be submitted to the Academic Faculty not later than April 15 of the year in which the candidate applies for the degree. Moreover, the copy presented for the Faculty's approval shall be written (typewritten, if feasible) on paper of prescribed quality and size, shall be bound, and shall have certain prescribed phrases on the cover and title page. If the dissertation is accepted by the Faculty as satisfactory, the copy submitted shall immediately become the property of the University. Before the degree is conferred the dissertation must be printed at the candidate's expense, and one hundred copies deposited in the library of the University; or, if this be impracticable on account of lack of time, the candidate must deposit with the Bursar a sum of money sufficient to have a hundred copies of the dissertation printed. DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses of a Virginia student in the Department of Graduate Studies may be estimated at from $220 a year upward, according to the mode of living; for students from other States this minimum should be increased by a sum ranging from $90 to $130 for tuition fees. A fuller statement of expenses, including the conditions under which Virginians and other students are entitled to free tuition, will be found on pp. 98-104. Applicants for degree of Doctor of Philosophy who are granted the privilege of non-residence during a period of their candidacy, under the conditions above stated, are required to register each year during such period of non-residence, and to pay the annual university fee ($10 for Virginians, $40 for students from other States).

Historical.âAmong the original Schools contemplated in Mr. Jefferson's plan for the organization of the University of Virginia was "Law: Municipal and Foreign; Embracing the General Principles, Theory and Practice of Jurisprudence, together with the Theory and Principles of Constitutional Government." Accordingly the School of Law was established in 1826, and has been in continuous operation since. From the establishment of the Law School until 1894, the course comprised the work of a single year. With the session of 1894-95, a two years' course was inaugurated, which continued up to the session of 1809-10, when the course was extended to three years. The aim of the Department of Law has always been to maintain a high standard as a requirement for graduationâthe degree being conferred only upon such students as are thorough masters of the prescribed course of study. This policy has been rigorously enforced, and its wisdom has been vindicated by the high position which the graduates of the Law School are accustomed to attain at the bar or in public life. The course of instruction has been extended from time to time to conform to changing conditions and to meet the increasing needs of the profession. Minor Hall.âBy action of the Visitors, the new home of the Law School has been named Minor Hall, in honor of the late John B. Minor, whose distinguished service of fifty years as a professor in the Law School, the University thus commemorates. The building is located between Dawson's Row and the southern end of West Range. The architecture is on classic lines, in keeping with the general design of the other university buildings. It contains on the first floor four large lecture halls, with convenient offices, lavatories, etc., and on the second floor a stack room, with ample space for books, two commodious reading rooms, and a number of offices for the use of the librarian and the teaching staff. Liberal provision has been made for heat, light, and ventilation. Special care has been taken to provide comfortable seats and desks in the lecture halls. Law Library.âThe Library contains about fourteen thousand volumes. Its financial resources, from appropriations by the Visitors, and from an endowment of ten thousand dollars by Mr. W. W. Fuller ('78) of New York City, make possible the addition of several hundred volumes annually. The Library contains the English Reports, from and including the Year Books to date; the United States Supreme Court Reports; reports of all the American States; the National Reporter System, complete; modern selected and annotated reports, such as the American Decisions, Reports and State Reports, Lawyers' Reports Annotated, American and English Annotated Cases, English Ruling Cases, etc., together with modern search-books in the form of general Digests (including the Century and Decennial editions), and the leading Encyclopedias, besides a large collection of textbooks, bound volumes of law magazines, etc. Law students have all the privileges of the general University Library, containing more than ninety thousand volumes, without extra charge. The Virginia Law Review.âUnder the title of The Virginia Law Review, the undergraduate students of the Law School conduct a law journal devoted to the discussion of general questions of American jurisprudence. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. Eight numbers are issued annually, from October to May inclusive. The Review is now in its fourth volume. From its inception it has maintained a high standard of excellence, and a worthy rank among the leading law journals of the country. Suggestions as to Preliminary Education.âStudents, and their parents or guardians, are warned that the law is peculiarly an intellectual profession, and demands for its successful prosecution, whether in a law school or in the broader fields of professional life, a well-trained mind. If it be true that untrained recruits, in rare instances, under diligent and persistent effort, develop into successful practitioners after entrance upon the practice, such exceptional cases but serve to illustrate the rule that out of a given number of young men entering upon the study of law, those with sound preliminary training will have incomparable advantages, while those without such training are likely never to rise above mediocrity in their profession. The experience of the Law Facultyâindeed, of all law teachersâis, that the standing and progress of law students may, in general, be measured by their academic preparation. Young gentlemen are therefore advised not to begin their legal studies until they have completed an academic course approximating that required for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. So high a standard, however, is not exacted as a condition of entrance into the Law School. These conditions are shown in the following sections. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. Regular Students.âCandidates for the degree of Bachelor of Laws must have attained the age of eighteen years before entering the department, must produce a certificate of good character from the school or college last attended, or from other satisfactory source, and must conform to the general requirements following: For Admission to the Department of Law the candidate must offer fifteen units, of which three must be in English and one in History. Notice is given that an additional requirement of one year of work in a standard college will become effective with the beginning of the session of 1919-20. The Subjects accepted for Admission and their values in units are given in tabulated form on page 168. The applicant for admission may enter (1) by certificate or (2) by examination. (1) For Admission by Certificate the candidate must file with the Dean of the University not later than September 1 a Certificate of Preparation, made out on the blank form furnished by the University. This certificate must come from some recognized institution of collegiate rank or from an accredited high school; but admission by certificate from accredited public high schools in Virginia is extended only to graduates of four-year high schools. The certificate must bear in all cases the signature of the head of the school; must specify the character and content of each course offered for entrance credit; must give the length of time devoted to the course, and the dates of the examinations; and must give the candidate's grades in percentages. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. Each unit in the entrance requirements is the equivalent of one full year of high-school work, including five periods a week at least forty minutes each during not less than thirty-six weeks. For schools in which the number of periods given to any study, or the length of the period, is below the standard here specified, the credit for such study will be reduced pro rata. In the scientific subjects two hours of laboratory instruction will be counted as the equivalent of one hour of recitation. High-school courses in physics and chemistry, otherwise adequate, will be allowed half credit, when individual laboratory work is not done by the student or is not attested by proper note-books filed with the certificate. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must, in all cases, take the entrance examinations. (2) For Admission by Examination the candidate must present himself for test at the University in June or September, according to the dates given in the Programme of Entrance Examinations, which may be had by applying to the Registrar. The examinations are held under the honor system, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge. All candidates who take their examinations at the times appointed are tested free of charge. In case of delayed entrance, where the grounds of postponement are good, the President of the University may admit the candidate to a special examination, for which an additional fee of five dollars is charged. The fee is payable in advance and is in no case returned. Satisfactory certificates as to character and age are in all cases required. DEPARTMENT OF LAW.

Every applicant for admission as a special student shall make written application to the Dean of the University, on a blank furnished for the purpose, with detailed information as to his age, general habits, his educational and business experience, and his general fitness to undertake the study of law. Such application, together with such testimonials as may be required, must be filed with the Dean of the University not later than September 1 of the year in which the applicant desires to enter the Law School. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. For good cause shown, the requirement as to the time of filing such application may be waived. Every such applicant for admission as a special student must pass a satisfactory examination, to be held at the University during the registration days of the session. The examination, which will be conducted by a committee of the Law Faculty, may include the subjects of English, American and English History, and Civil Government. This regulation is subject to the general university regulation as to delayed entrance examinations. Special students who fail to complete 60 per cent of the work taken during any session may be declared ineligible for re-admission the following session. Admission to Advanced Standing.âNo credit is given for attendance at another law school, nor for time spent in private reading. The candidate for graduation must spend three years in residence. The Session begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September, and continues for thirty-nine weeks. The first three days of the session are given to registration, and all students, both old and new, are required during that time to place their names upon the books of the University and the rolls of their respective classes. Lecture courses begin on the following Monday, and absences will be recorded against any student not present, from the opening lecture of each course. Students entering after the first three days, without satisfactory excuse, will be charged a fee for registration. Late Entrance.âStudents are advised that late entrance is a serious hindrance to progress. The student who enters late must begin his work at the point to which the several courses have advanced at the time of his entrance; and credit for three years' attendance cannot be secured unless the student is in actual residence at least thirty weeks per session. No registration in absentia is permissible. Expenses.âThe necessary expenses of a student in the Department of Law may be estimated at $425 per session of nine months. This minimum estimate includes all university and tuition fees, board, lodging, washing and books. An average estimate would be $500 per session, reckoning board, lodging, washing and books at a somewhat higher figure. The university fee applicable to all law students (including those from Virginia) is $40; and the tuition fee is $100 for the regular work of each session. For special students who desire to take selected courses, the tuition fee is estimated according to the ratio which the work chosen bears to the whole. Three Years' Course.âThe course of study embraces three years of thirty-six weeks each, exclusive of holidays. Residence, for three years, with attendance of at least thirty weeks a year, exclusive of holidays, is essential to graduation. Plan of Instruction.âThe instruction is as thorough as possible, and is given partly through text-books and lectures, and partly through the study of cases. While convinced of the value of the combined text-book and lecture system, which has prevailed for more than half a century in the Law DEPARTMENT OF LAW. School, the Law Faculty have long appreciated the value that the study of cases possesses, in illustrating the practical application of legal principles, and in forcing the student to extract for himself the doctrine which the cases establish. The recent enlargement of the course gives opportunity for more emphasis on this form of instruction, and the case-book will, therefore, be used more extensively than heretoforeânot as supplanting, but as supplementing, the text-book and lecture. The daily oral quiz has long been a marked and, as experience has proved, a most valuable feature of the system of instruction. As cross-examination exposes error and develops truth, so the daily quiz enables the instructor to discover and rectify misconception of legal principles on the part of the student. This oral quiz is supplemented by frequent written tests, the results of which are carefully recorded, and, in the professor's discretion, are considered in estimating the final grade of the student. Practical Work.âIn the course on Equity Procedure, Virginia Pleading, Practice at Law, Code Pleading, Criminal Procedure, and Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, special stress is laid upon practical work. In the Pleading and Procedure courses, every student is required to draw, and submit for correction and criticism, all of the principal pleadings, orders, decrees, and other forms encountered in actual litigation. In the course on Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, an intimate acquaintance with law books and skill in their use are secured by oral and written quizzes, and finally by practical tests; and briefs on assigned topics are required to be prepared according to rigorous standards. Much practical work is done in the headnoting of cases on scientific principles. Required for Graduation.âThe degree of Bachelor of Laws (LL. B.) is conferred upon such students as have attained the age of twenty-one years; have satisfied the entrance requirements; have attended three full sessions of the Law School; and have successfully passed the required examinations, with satisfactory performance of assigned practical work. More specifically, the candidate for graduation must have completed all of the obligatory courses (see Outline of Courses, below), and at least two elective courses, one of which must be either the course in Virginia Pleading or that in Code Pleading. It follows that of the courses termed "elective," a required minimum is in fact obligatoryâthe candidate being permitted to exercise an election among them. OUTLINE OF COURSES. The course, as outlined below, contemplates an average of ten lecture periods (or 15 hours) per week. Each session is divided into three terms. See table, p. 177. Written examinations are held during the final week of each term, on the subjects completed during the term, with the exception of the examination in Forensic Debating, which is held at the end of the session. See Schedule of Examinations, p. 179. The following outline indicates the extent of the courses offered. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. TABULAR OUTLINE OF COURSES.

The prize consists of fifty dollars in cash, and is awarded each year to a student in the Department of Law for the best essay on some legal or sociological subject. Each competitor must file with the Dean of the Department of Law not later than April 15 his name and the title of his essay, and must file his completed essay not later than May 1st. All essays must be typewritten, must contain not more than 15,000 words, and must not be folded. The award is made by a committee of three competent persons, not locally connected with the University, to be selected annually by the Law Faculty. In making the award, literary form as well as subject matter, is taken into consideration. For the session of 1915-16 this prize was awarded to Eugene Silver Williams, whose essay was entitled Leading Questions on the Examination of Witnesses. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. GENERAL REGULATIONS. 1. Registration of New Students.âBefore registration in the Law School, students who have not before been registered in any department of the University must produce to the Dean of the Law School (office in Minor Hall) a certificate from the Dean of the University that entrance requirements have been fulfilled. 2. Registration Generally.âStudents must register in advance at the office of the Dean of the Law School and with the Registrar for every course taken, and no credit will be given for work done in any course without proper registration therefor. 3. Delayed Registration.âStudents are not permitted to delay their registration through carelessness or for inadequate reasons. Any student, new or old, who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session, and between the hours of nine a. m. and two p. m. on the first week-day after the Christmas Recess, will be admitted to registration only upon the consent of the Dean, and will be charged a special registration fee of three dollars. 4. Exchange or Omission of Courses.âAfter registration no course may be exchanged or omitted except on the written approval of the professor in charge and of the Dean. 5. Maximum for Which Student May Register.âNo student is permitted to register, in any year, for courses comprising in the aggregate more than 450 periodsâincluding subjects taken but not completed in a previous yearânor, in any case, for new courses aggregating more than 350 periods. 6. Minimum for Which Student Must Register.âNo student, without special permission, and for good cause, may register for less than nine periods per week. 7. Advanced Work.âStudents of one year are not permitted to anticipate the courses of a subsequent year, without urgent reasons satisfactory to the Dean. 8. Late Entrance Into Classes.âNo credit is given for the completion of any course upon which the student has entered after fifty per centum of the lectures thereon have been delivered. 9. Optional Attendance.âA student who has attended the required lectures upon any subject may, on written application, with the endorsed approval of the professor in charge, and of the Dean, secure optional attendance on such subjects the following sessionâprovided the exercise of this privilege does not reduce his lecture periods below nine per week, nor infringe Regulation 5. DEPARTMENT OF LAW. 10. General Requirements.âEvery student of the Law School is required to attend all regular exercises of the classes of which he is a member, and to perform all the work assigned, including quizzes and examinations, unless excused for good cause by the faculty. 11. Invalids.âStudents whose condition of health is too precarious to permit regular attendance upon lectures, but not serious enough to admit them as patients of the hospital, will be required to withdraw from the University until able to resume their regular work. 12. Conditions of Re-Admission.âAny student who, without satisfactory cause, has not attained for the session, on his examinations, credit for courses completed, comprising in the aggregate at least 150 periods, or, in lieu thereof, a grade of 75 per centum on courses aggregating 200 periods, will be excluded from the Law School the following session. The result of one or more special examinations, granted for cause under existing regulations, may be considered in determining whether this requirement has been met. The foregoing provisions do not affect students who have been permitted, for cause, to take less than two-thirds of a full year's work. Such students will be subject to exclusion or other conditions as may be prescribed. In this connection, attention is called to Regulation 5 foregoing. 13. Students Admitted on Terms of Diligence, by reason of previous unsatisfactory record in the Law School, or other department of the University, will be held to an average class grade (or examination grade, in classes in which class grades are not recorded) of 75 per centum, in the work of the first term. Failure to attain this grade without satisfactory cause, unless the result of his other examinations shall raise his average grade to the required standard, will operate to exclude such delinquent from the Law School for the remainder of the session. An average class grade of less than 75 per centum, at the end of any term, will be regarded as evidence of a lack of the diligence required by the terms of this condition. 14. First-Year Students.âFailure on the part of any first-year student, without just cause, to attain, for the first term, an average grade of seventy-five per centum on the daily written quizzes, will place such student on probation for the remainder of the session, and the student and his parent or guardian will be so notified. Unless, in the opinion of the Law Faculty, a decided improvement in the character of such student's work is indicated at the end of the second term, he will be required to withdraw from the Law School. 15. Absence from the University is permitted upon the written leave of the Dean of the Law School. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or musical clubs on excursions will not be granted, except to the officers and members of the organizations. 16. Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors for sickness or like providential cause. Such excuses must be rendered on the day DEPARTMENT OF LAW. of the first lecture attended after the absence. Unexcused absences from lectures render the student liable to be disciplined. 17. Special Examinations.âNo special examinations are granted, save in cases of sickness on the day of examination (attested by physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause approved by the Law Faculty. In no case will such examination be granted, unless prompt application be made therefor. 18. Re-ExaminationsâThird-Year Students.âCandidates for the degree, who have failed on one or more subjects during their third year, may return the following session, and stand the regular examinations on such subjects, without further attendance upon lectures. But this privilege may be exercised but onceâthat is to say, after a second failure the candidate must take the lectures over again, on the subject or subjects on which he has for a second time proved deficient. 19. Examination Fees.âThe fee for standing such examinations as are mentioned in the preceding regulation is five dollars for each examination taken. Students who, under such circumstances, return for further lectures, and who have paid full matriculation and tuition fees for three years, pay a matriculation fee in proportion to the amount of work taken plus $5 for each course. There is no charge for special examinations granted for imperative cause. 20. Honor System.âAll examinations are conducted under the Honor System. 21. Application for Degree.âCandidates for graduation are required to file a written application with the Dean, not later than November 15th of their third year, indicating the courses completed, together with a schedule of the courses to be pursued during their final year. Blanks for this purpose will be supplied on application to the Dean. 22. Required Withdrawal.âThe right is reserved to require the withdrawal of any student who, in the opinion of the faculty, is not profiting nor likely to profit, by the instruction offered; or whose neglect or irregular performance of required duties, after admonition, indicates indifference or contumacy; or whose habits are a menace to the good order of the Law School.

DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE For information as to lodgings, board, expenses, etc., and for catalogues and other printed literature, address the Registrar. For other information address the Dean of the Department of Medicine. Requirements for Admission to the Department of Medicine.âApplicants for admission to the Department of Medicine are required to furnish evidence of the completion of a four-year course at a recognized public or private high-school, or acceptable certificates which represent work equivalent in amount and character to such a high-school course, and, in addition, to present evidence of the completion at an approved institution of collegiate rank of two years of work aggregating thirty session-hours. This college course must include a year's work in each of the following subjects: English (rhetoric, composition, and literature), mathematics (solid geometry and trigonometry), inorganic (general) chemistry, physics, biology, and either German or French. A session-hour is one hour a week throughout the session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week throughout the session of laboratory work. A student otherwise qualified may be admitted conditioned upon one subject, the condition to be removed before admission to the second year of the medical course; but no condition may be allowed in chemistry, English, or mathematics, nor will any condition be allowed in German or French, unless the student has satisfactorily completed one year of college work or two years of high-school work in the language (i. e., the equivalent of German 1 or French 1 in the College of this university). The modern language (German or French) course must be based upon two years of high-school work in that language or its equivalent; but a candidate may absolve the requirement in this subject by demonstrating on examination the possession of a satisfactory reading knowledge thereof. The modern language requirement may, in exceptional cases, be waived in the case of college graduates by special vote of the faculty. A year's work in general biology, zoÃ¶logy, or botany will be regarded as satisfying the requirement in biology. ZoÃ¶logy is considered preferable to botany, and it is desirable that the course should include the dissection of a mammal. Further information concerning the character of these requirements and forms for certificates may be obtained by addressing the Dean of the Department of Medicine. In planning the two-year college work, students are advised to take English, mathematics, biology, and a modern language during the first year; and to take physics and chemistry during the second year. This arrangement of studies is advised because mathematics should precede physics, and it is desirable to avoid the lapse of a year between the general chemistry of the college and the organic and physiological chemistry of the first year of the medical curriculum. Students who have completed general chemistry and who have one more year of college work for entrance DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE to the medical school, are advised to take some courses in chemistry (e. g., analytical, physical, or organic chemistry) during their last year in college. Limitation of Numbers and Reservation of Places in the First-Year Class.âThe number of studies in the first-year class is limited to thirty-six. Reservation of a place, if desired by the applicant, can be made beforehand on the conditions hereinafter described. Those intending to enter the Department of Medicine are advised to ascertain at once by correspondence with the Dean of the Department of Medicine whether their high-school and college courses entitle them to admission to the first-year class. For this purpose there may be obtained from the Dean a blank form on which the necessary information may be entered in full. At the time of registration, applicants will be registered in the order in which they present themselves, until all vacancies are filled. Applicants who have not made reservations, as described below, are therefore advised to apply for registration at 9:00 o'clock of the first day of registration (September 13, 1917). Any applicant whose record, certified to by the proper official of the college last attended, has been endorsed by the Dean of the Department of Medicine as entitling him to admission to the first-year class may at any time before the registration period have a place reserved for him until 12:00 noon of the first day of registration by depositing with the Bursar the sum of $50.00 in part payment of the tuition fee of the first year. A reservation so made can be cancelled only in exceptional cases. In case a student who has obtained a reservation fails to register, the deposit of $50.00 will be forfeited to the University unless, in case of illness or other providential cause, the Dean of the Department of Medicine directs that it be returned. Facilities for and Methods of Instruction.âIn recent years many additions have been made to the laboratory facilities of the department, so that there are now well-equipped laboratories for the study of organic and physiological chemistry, gross anatomy, histology and embryology, bacteriology and pathology, physiology, pharmacology, materia medica, and clinical diagnosis. These laboratories are all presided over by trained teachers, to whom teaching and investigation are primary considerations. The number of hours assigned to the laboratory subjects is quite large and affords ample time for thorough study of the best methods. The student is brought into close contact with teachers who are both willing and able to guide him; he gains a very large part of his knowledge at first hand and by his own exertions, and thus acquires the habit of working out things for himself; he becomes self-reliant, a quality essential to the practice of his difficult profession. Trained in this manner he acquires an understanding of the medical sciences and the ability to apply the facts of these sciences to the subsequent study of disease. For these reasons the great fundamental sciences receive the utmost consideration, constituting the entire work of the first two years. The methods of clinical instruction are based upon the belief that no DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE clinical teaching is efficient which is not governed by essentially the same principles as those which govern the best laboratory teaching. This instruction is accordingly designed to enforce with the individual student a careful, thorough, face-to-face study of disease and its management. The facilities afforded by the University Hospital and Out-Patient Department are described on a subsequent page. After two sessions devoted to laboratory training, the student is introduced, in the third year, to the study of disease in living persons. In the out-patient department and in the hospital he learns the methods of examining patients, of diagnosing their diseases, and of instituting rational treatment; and he learns these things in much the same way as he studied in the laboratory, that is to say, by doing them himself under the direction and criticism of the instructors. This practical training is accompanied by a systematic study of the various subjects by means of lectures, text-books, and recitations. With this preparation the student is ready to enter upon the hospital work in his fourth year. Here he has advantages for clinical training similar to those enjoyed by internes. Each clinical patient on admission to the hospital is assigned to a student, and that patient is regarded as his "case." The student conducts a complete examination, records his observations in a scientific manner, makes a diagnosis, states his view as to the treatment indicated, and keeps a complete record of the case, all under the advice and criticism of the physician or surgeon in charge. He is expected to keep himself informed of the progress of the case throughout its course; if it is one requiring surgical treatment, he assists at the operation, and thus is able to follow all the procedures of the operator at close range. In addition, students make frequent visits to the wards with the attending physicians and surgeons, during which visits the nature, treatment, and progress of various cases are gone over in detail. To carry out this method of clinical instruction the hospital had last year over 3,000 cases. Since the number of students in each class is relatively small, it is clear that the department offers capable young men clinical advantages which are distinctly exceptional. Opportunities are offered in the third and fourth years for more extended training in certain subjects with a view toward possible specialization after graduation. At the meetings of the Medical Section of the Philosophical Society reviews of important articles and results of original research are presented by the instructors and by invited guests. These meetings are open to the students. Regulations.âThe records given after the regular examination on a course, with their explanations, are as follows: Passed indicates the satisfactory completion of the course and admits to all dependent subjects. Conditioned means that to obtain a clear record on the course the student must pass a special examination. Failure to take or to pass this examination is equivalent to a record of "failed." The record "conditioned" DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE is not given in fourth-year subjects, except in case of illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty. A student may be conditioned on any examination because of failure to maintain a resonable standard of English composition. Deficient indicates that part of the work of the course has not been completed. Upon the satisfactory completion of this work within the time and in the manner prescribed by the professor in charge the student receives the record "passed"; otherwise the record is "failed" on the entire course. Failed indicates that the course must be repeated; except that when the laboratory or other practical work has been satisfactorily performed, the professor in charge may, at his discretion, excuse the student from repeating the same; and, by special vote of the faculty, the student may be granted optional attendance upon the course, in whole or in part. In general a student who is repeating a course will be required to attend all the exercises of the course, and will not be excused from any exercise thereof because of schedule conflicts with more advanced work. Absence from a regular examination, when excused because of illness or other equivalent cause, gives a record of conditioned; if not excused, a record of failed. To pass a regular or a special examination a grade of eighty per cent. is required. If the grade is less than eighty per cent. but not less than seventy per cent., the student is entitled to the record conditioned; but the record conditioned is not given in fourth-year subjects, except under the conditions noted above. No student will be admitted to any subject of the second or the third year (save by the consent of the Dean and the professors concerned), if more than one-third of the work of the preceding year remains unfinished. If at the beginning of the year his deficiencies have not been made up by the satisfactory completion of courses at some school approved by the instructors in charge at this university, he may continue as a student in the Department of Medicine only by repeating the courses in which he has failed. In the interpretation of this rule the values of the subjects of the first and second years are estimated in points as follows: Anatomy 1, 16 points; Anatomy 2, 5 points; Organic Chemistry, 15 points; Histology, 14 points; Embryology, 6 points; Physiological Chemistry, 8 points. Anatomy 3, 16 points; Physiology, 20 points; Bacteriology, 8 points; Pathology, 20 points; Pharmacology, 8 points. Whenever in the judgment of the faculty a student is receiving too many records below the grade of passed, the faculty may prescribe special conditions upon which the student may remain in the Department of Medicine, or may require his withdrawal therefrom. Students will not be allowed to undertake the work of the third or fourth year until they have completed that of the first year, save by special consent of the Medical Faculty. A student may not take any course, either in whole or in part (as DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE explained under the above definition of failed) more than two times. A second record of failed on the same course involves withdrawal from the Department of Medicine. Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine, who have less than one full year's course to complete, may be required to take such additional work and to pass such additional examinations as the Medical Faculty may prescribe. This additional work may be selected from any of the courses given in the Department of Medicine, even when such prescribed courses have previously been taken and passed by the candidate in question. Advanced Standing.âStudents are admitted to advanced standing in the second and third years under the following conditions: 1. Satisfaction of the requirements for entrance into this department at the time of entrance of the class to which the applicant seeks admission. 2. The presentation of a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended. 3. The presentation of the complete record of the student in the school previously attended, on blanks to be obtained from the Dean of the Department of Medicine. This record will be submitted to the action of the Faculty Committee on Advanced Standing and the admission of the student together with the terms of admission will be determined by this committee. Certificates of Attendance.âStudents who attend the whole regular course of one or more of the four years are entitled to certificates of attendance. Requirements for Graduation.âThe degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred by the University of Virginia upon candidates who have complied with the entrance requirements of this department; attended a regular medical course of four years of at least eight months each, the last two of which must have been at this institution; and have satisfactorily completed all of the subjects included in the medical course. Examinations.âThese are in writing, accompanied in many subjects by individual practical examinations. The regular examinations are held at stated periods during the session. In addition, examinations are held each year during the week immediately preceding the beginning of lectures. To the latter are admitted: 1. Students of the previous session who, from illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty, were unable to present themselves for examination in any particular subject at the regular time. 2. Students who at the regular examination in any first, second, or third year subject of the preceding session have attained a grade less than eighty per cent., but as much as seventy per cent. on one or more subjects, as explained in a preceding paragraph; or any student who has received the record of conditioned on a course taken in this university. 3. Certain applicants for advanced standing, who are admitted to these examinations by the Committee on Advanced Standing. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE The Fall Examinations for 1917-1918 begin September 10 and close September 15. Students entitled to admission to these examinations will be informed of the date of examination by the Dean. Expenses.âThe tuition fee for each year is $100. The annual expenses exclusive of tuition are $40 for the university fee (which entitles the student to the use of the library, the gymnasium, to medical attention, etc.), an average of about $265 for living expenses, and $30 for books. In the courses of Organic and Physiological Chemistry a deposit of $10 is required to cover cost of breakage. Combined Degrees in Arts (or Science) and Medicine.âStudents who have credit for the forty-eight session-hours of the group electives required in this university for the cultural baccalaureate degrees in arts and science may substitute for twelve session-hours of electives-at-large the first-year course in the Department of Medicine and receive the degree of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science at the end of the year. The University also offers a course leading to the vocational degree of Bachelor of Science in Medicine. This course includes two years of group electives in academic subjects followed by the first two years of the medical course. Since the academic group electives satisfy the entrance requirements of the Medical Department, students who can spend only two years in college before entering upon the study of medicine are advised to plan their work so as to secure this degree. For further information regarding these degrees, see pp. 157 and 158 of the General Catalogue of the University. The William A. Herndon Scholarships are founded upon the bequest of Dr. Cumberland George Herndon, a graduate in medicine of this university. They are awarded by the Medical Faculty after a competitive examination held during the summer vacation preceding enrollment as a student in the Medical Department. Candidates must be unable to defray the expenses of their medical education and must signify their intention of entering the medical service of the army or navy of the United States. These scholarships provide for the necessary expenses of the student during the entire four years of his medical course and are awarded whenever there is a vacancy. One will be awarded in September, 1918. For information as to the examinations and other requirements, address the Dean of the Department of Medicine. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. In the following description of courses, the number of hours represents the amount of time each student devotes to the course. In addition to the hours scheduled in the third and fourth years of the course, each student devotes a considerable amount of time to practical work which does not appear in the schedule, but the satisfactory performance of which is essential to graduation. Thus the taking of histories, the visits to his DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE cases in the hospital, assisting at operations, attendance upon cases of labour, the employment of microscopical and chemical methods of diagnosis in the hospital, require much time which it has not seemed possible to record in a rigid schedule. It should, however, be stated that each student in the fourth year gives at least two hundred hours to this required but unscheduled practical work. The session, exclusive of the time devoted to examination, is divided into a fall term of twelve weeks, a winter term of ten weeks, and a spring term of ten weeks. FIRST YEAR. Anatomy 1.âSix hours weekly until November 1; twelve hours weekly from November 1 to the end of the second term. This course begins with a systematic study of the bones, on the completion of which a part is assigned to each student for dissection and study. On the completion of this course and Anatomy 3 each student has dissected a lateral half of the body. The student obtains his knowledge at first hand and by his own personal efforts. The satisfactory performance of the laboratory work is essential to a passing grade. Dr. Bean and Dr. Baker. Anatomy 2.âSix hours weekly during the third term. This course consists in a laboratory study of the anatomy of the central nervous system carried out in considerable detail. The gross anatomy of the spinal cord and brain is first considered, on the completion of which sections of the more important regions are studied carefully with the aid of the microscope. Fresh brains and series of sections of the cord and brain are thoroughly used. Dr. Bean and Dr. Baker. Histology.âThree lectures or recitations and nine hours of laboratory work weekly during the first and second terms. This course aims to acquaint the student with the microscopic structure of cells, tissues, and organs. Cytogenesis and histogenesis are briefly considered in the case of many tissues studied. The relation of histology to physiology and pathology is constantly kept in view. The student is also given opportunity to acquaint himself with the principles and practice of histological technique. A record of seventy per cent. in this course is required for admission to Physiology, and of eighty per cent. for admission to Pathology. Dr. Jordan, assisted by Mr. Pagenstecher. Embryology.âNine hours weekly during the third term. The laboratory work (six hours weekly) with sections and dissections of mammalian embryos, is supplemented by lectures, recitations, and the study of models. The course aims to give the student a knowledge of developmental processes, in the light of which he may the better understand the more abstruse normal conditions of adult anatomy, as well as many anomalies and variations, neoplasms and malformations. Dr. Jordan, assisted by Mr. Pagenstecher. Organic Chemistry.âLectures and recitations three hours weekly, laboratory work six and eight hours weekly, respectively, during the first and second terms. This course includes the systematic study of organic chemistry, with special reference to substances of importance in their relation to DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE medicine. The course lays a thorough foundation for subsequent work in Physiological Chemistry, Pharmacology, etc. During the second term the laboratory work includes quantitative determinations of immediate importance in Physiological Chemistry, such as the estimation of sugar, total nitrogen, uric acid, ammonia, etc. A record of seventy per cent. on this course is required for admission to Physiological Chemistry. Dr. Edgar and Dr. Pratt. Physiological Chemistry.âThree lectures, three recitations and nine hours of laboratory work weekly during the third term. The structure, properties and reactions of the more important compounds which the student meets in his subsequent medical study. The laboratory work, continuing that of Organic Chemistry, includes the study of fats, soaps, fatty acids, and proteins; blood, milk, bile; the digestive enzymes, and extensive qualitative and quantitative work on urine. A grade of seventy per cent. on this course is required for admission to Physiology. Dr. Hough and Dr. Pratt. SECOND YEAR. Anatomy 3.âTen hours weekly through the first and second terms. This course is the continuation of Anatomy 1, and consists of the systematic dissection and study, by essentially the same methods, of the parts not studied during the first year. In addition, a course is given in topographic anatomy, with the aid of cross sections of the human body. At the end of this course a practical examination is given, covering the work of Anatomy 1, 2 and 3. Dr. Bean and Dr. Baker. Physiology.âFour hours work weekly of lectures, recitations and demonstrations throughout the year. Six hours weekly of laboratory work in the first and second terms. The physiology of muscle and nerve; blood and lymph; the circulation; respiration; secretion; digestion and nutrition, and the central nervous system. The work of the laboratory closely follows the lectures as an integral part of the study of each subject. Open only to students who have obtained a grade of seventy per cent. in Histology and in Physiological Chemistry. The satisfactory completion of the laboratory work of this course is necessary for admission to Pharmacology. Dr. Hough, assisted by Mr. Setzler and Mr. Strange. Bacteriology and Pathology.âTwelve hours weekly throughout the session and two additional hours a week in the third term. The work in pathology is open only to students who have obtained a record of passed in Histology. Bacteriology and pathology are taught in a combined course. Emphasis is laid upon the medical and public health aspects of bacteriology. Practical studies in infection and immunity form part of the course. Autopsies and the study of gross and microscopic specimens supply the practical work accompanying the systematic study of pathology. Opportunity is given selected students for advanced work.

Some attention is given to the methods of separation and identification. Dr. Waddell, assisted by Mr. Anderson. Clinical Diagnosis.âSix hours weekly during the first and second terms. In this course the student is made familiar with those laboratory methods which are helpful in the diagnosis of disease. These include, among others, the examination of blood, urine, sputum, gastric contents, feces, spinal fluid, exudates and transudates. Instruction is given in the recently completed Clinical Laboratory in the north pavilion of the hospital, which is well equipped with the most modern instruments and apparatus. Dr. Bray. Theory and Practice of Medicine.âThree hours weekly of lectures and recitations throughout the session; nine hours weekly in the clinics for one-half the session. A systematic course of lectures, supplemented by work in the out-patient department and hospital. The class is divided into two sections, DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE each of which devotes itself for half the year to the medical service in the out-patient department, and also twice a week receive instruction on selected cases in the wards of the hospital. There is a general medical clinic once a week in the hospital amphitheater. Dr. Davis, Dr. Flippin, Dr. Magruder, Dr. Nelson and Dr. Gage. Surgery and Gynecology.âFive hours weekly of lectures and recitations, and two hours weekly of surgical clinic throughout the session, with six hours weekly in the out-patient department for one-half the session. The study of surgery begins in the third year and continues through the fourth year. In the third year the classroom work consists of lectures and recitations, as arranged in the schedule, in which the principles and practice of surgery, surgical diseases, surgical diagnosis, etc., are thoroughly discussed. This also includes the surgical specialties, orthopedics, genito-urinary surgery, etc. The out-patient department course in the third year gives opportunities for diagnosis and treatment of clinical cases under close personal supervision. Experience in dressings, bandaging, anesthesia and minor surgery is afforded. Surgical appliances and technique are demonstrated to the students, divided into small groups. The work in gynecology follows closely the outlines already described for surgery. The general principles of gynecology are taken up in lectures and recitations. In addition, the out-patient department affords practice in palpation, diagnosis and treatment. Dr. Watts, Dr. Goodwin, Dr. Neff, Dr. Woodberry and Dr. Wright. Obstetrics.âFive hours weekly of lectures, recitations and manikin demonstrations during the year, supplemented by work with living subjects in the wards of the hospital. The class is divided into sections of five for manikin instruction and for examination of patients in the hospital. The manikin course forms an important part of the work, not only for teaching presentation, position and posture, but also the mechanism of normal and abnormal labor and the application of forceps. When the section is taken into the wards of the hospital, the methods of examination, particularly abdominal palpation, are practiced on the living subject. Dr. Macon. FOURTH YEAR. Theory and Practice of Medicine.âThe same plan is followed in the clinical work as that already described for the third year, each of the two sections of the class devoting itself for half the year to the medical service in the wards of the hospital. Full histories are taken of every case, thorough examinations made, and management indicated by the students of each division. These records are considered in the final grading of the student. The subjects treated with the approximate division of time between them are as follows: DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE Nervous Diseases and Insanity.âThree lectures and recitations weekly, supplemented by clinical work during the first term. In this course is given also instruction in electro-therapeutics. Dr. Davis. Pediatrics.âThree lectures and recitations weekly, supplemented by clinical work during the second term. This course of lectures is intended to point out in a brief way how disease is modified by childhood and to indicate how the difficulties of diagnosis and treatment due to early age may best be encountered. The principles of infant feeding are emphasized and the student is taught how to prepare the food. Dr. Davis and Dr. Rea. Dermatology.âA brief course of lectures is given on this subject, embodying a consideration of the commoner diseases met with in medical practice. Case Teaching, Medical Ethics and Economics, and Insurance Exam- inations.âTwo hours weekly during the third term. Dr. Davis. Therapeutics.âThe treatment of internal diseases is discussed in a systematic course of lectures and practically demonstrated in the wards of the hospital. Especial attention is given to the bedside teaching of this subject, the student being required to follow closely and make a record of the results of the therapeutic agents employed in cases assigned to him. Dr. Flippin. Surgery and Gynecology.âTwo hours weekly of surgical clinic throughout the session; three hours weekly of ward classes, supplemented by clinical work in the wards and operating room for one-half the session with each of the two sections of the class. Instruction in surgery is carried on by clinics and bedside demonstrations in the hospital. In the wards the students are assigned cases, whose histories they must take. They must also make complete physical and clinical examinations, urine analyses, blood examinations, etc. In the ward rounds the diagnosis, operative and other treatment, post-operative care of the cases, complications, prognosis, etc., are discussed in detail. A large variety of cases is available, and the close contact of the students with their cases and with the routine of hospital management offer many of the opportunities that an internship affords. In the operating rooms the students, in small groups, take part in the operations, thus acquiring familiarity with technique, anesthetization, etc. Those of the class who are not assisting witness the operations, whose important features are demonstrated to them. In gynecology the students have the same general work as in surgery, consisting of the examination and the recording of the cases in the public wards, attendance on ward rounds, at which the cases are discussed, and observation and assistance in the operating rooms. Dr. Watts, Dr. Goodwin, Dr. Neff, Dr. Woodberry and Dr. Wright. In addition to the above course, required of all students, the following elective course is offered in the Department of Surgery. Surgical Pathology.âAn optional course. Two hours weekly during one-half of the session. This course is intended to supplement the general courses in Pathology DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE and Surgery and consists of lectures upon the pathology of surgical lesions, demonstrations of fresh tissues obtained from the operating rooms, and examination of microscopic sections. The student reviews pathological technique and frozen section work is emphasized. Dr. Goodwin. Clinical Pathological Conferences.âOne hour weekly is assigned for the study of pathologic material in connection with the clinical aspects of cases coming to autopsy. A history of the case is presented by the student in charge, the autopsy is reviewed, the tissue and microscopic sections are examined, and all the information thus derived is collated and contrasted. Dr. Marshall. Obstetrics.âThe student attends, under the guidance of an instructor, the labor cases in the hospital, is required to prepare the history of patients, and to follow up the cases through the puerperium. Instruction is also given in the care of the new-born. In addition the student has the opportunity of attending patients in the out-patient department and each student is expected to attend at least six cases of labor. Dr. Macon. Forensic Medicine.âOne lecture weekly during one term of the fourth year. Dr. Waddell. Diseases of the Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat.âTwo lectures weekly from the beginning of the session to the first of March, supplemented by regular clinics twice weekly throughout the session and clinical lectures to sections of the class as suitable cases occur. The class is divided into small sections and each student is taught the methods of examination and the use of the opthalmoscope, head-mirror, and of the laryngeal and post-nasal mirrors. In the clinics each patient is assigned to a student, who must take the history and keep the record of that patient; the case is then demonstrated by the professor in charge, and, if possible, each student makes his own examination under the personal supervision of the attending physician. Clinical cases are abundant, and during the year the student sees and handles practically all the common diseases of the eye, ear and upper respiratory tract. Dr. Hedges and Dr. Compton. Hygiene.âThree hours weekly throughout the session. The course begins with a historical sketch of the developments of preventive medicine, including short biographical sketches of the pioneers of hygiene. With this introduction the story of the natural history of contagious and infectious diseases, modes of propagation and methods of prevention engage the attention of the student. With this preparation, the chemical and bacteriological contamination of food, water, air and soil is made an important study. Instruction is also begun in the proper location and construction of habitations, hospitals, schoolhouses, etc., with special reference to the modern methods of heating, ventilating and draining. Notice is taken of the special relations involved in military and naval hygiene. Dr. Lambeth. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE FACILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESEARCH. The Department of Medicine not only fosters in its methods of instruction the inductive study by the student himself of the phenomena presented by the human body in health and disease, but also encourages the spirit of investigation of unsolved problems of medical science and practice on the part of the instructors and students. During the past few years there have appeared annually a number of papers from its laboratories embodying the results of such investigations, and it is the policy of the department to enlarge this feature of its work in the future. Students are encouraged to engage in research as they are prepared for it, usually assisting an instructor in some special study or else conducting the research under his guidance and advice. For this purpose the scientific and clinical laboratories offer the necessary facilities, and heads of departments will always be glad to suggest and outline problems for investigation by any medical student or by others possessing the necessary training therefor. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HOSPITAL. The hospital is the property of the University and is under the exclusive control of its Medical Faculty. It was designed and is administered as a teaching hospital, being so arranged that free use can be made of its clinical material without in any way disturbing or violating the privacy of other patients. The buildings are arranged upon the pavilion system, consisting of a central structure, four stories in height, to which have been added up to the present time three additional units of three stories each. The central building is largely devoted to administrative purposes and general service departments, but also contains an amphitheater and suite of private operating rooms, sterilizing and anesthetizing rooms. The three pavilions are connected with the main building by corridors on each floor. In these are located the wards and suites of rooms for private patients. As at present constituted the hospital has a capacity of about 200 beds; of these, upwards of 160 are available and used for clinical teaching. The recently completed north pavilion contains, in addition to quarters for ward and private patients, on the first floor, a specially designed series of laboratory rooms, which have been equipped with new and modern furnishings and apparatus throughout. The basement floor is devoted in large part to the Out-Patient Department of the Hospital. Here separate waiting rooms for white and colored patients are provided, examining rooms for medical cases, operating rooms for minor surgery, specially equipped rooms for genito-urinary and orthopedic surgery and for the treatment of the diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat. On the same floor is the Roentgen Ray Department of the Hospital. Attention is particularly called to the fact that the hospital with its associated Out-Patient Department, constitutes a most valuable adjunct to the teaching facilities of the Department of Medicine. The size of the clinic permits the presentation of a wide variety of cases, and the organization of the hospital as an integral part of the Medical Department affords exception facilities for thorough study of the individual case. The location of the University Hospital is a most favorable one, being situated at the intersection of two great railway trunk lines near the geographical center of the State. A large population outside of the city of Charlottesville is available as a source of clinical material, both in the wards and the out-patient department. The hospital is thus enabled to serve a large area of the State, and the transportation facilities are such that this service includes a progressively increasing number of emergency cases and cases of acute illness.

Clinics are held three times a week for general medical, surgical and genito-urinary diseases, which are attended by students of the third year; and twice weekly for the diseases of the eye, ear, nose and throat, attended by students of the fourth year. The character of the equipment of this department and its location in the hospital makes possible the use of most advanced methods in the diagnosis and treatment of cases, and the systematic and thorough examination of each case is thus emphasized at the very outset of the student's clinical experience. An out-patient obstetrical service and provision for attendance in the home of certain cases of illness by the student under the supervision of an instructor are a part of the organization of this department.

He must present a certificate of honorable withdrawal from the school last attended, or other valid proof of general good character. He must further satisfy the Dean of the University as to his adequate preparation for the work by passing the Entrance Examinations specified below or by the presentation of equivalent certificates of preparation signed by the President of a recognized institution of collegiate rank, or by the Principal of an accredited high school. The topics required for entrance and their values in units are as follows, the unit being one year's work on the subject in an accredited high school; English A.âGrammar and Grammatical Analysis 1 English B.âComposition and Rhetoric 1 English C.âCritical Study of Specimens of Literature 1 Mathematics A1.âAlgebra to Quadratics 1 Mathematics A2.âQuadratics, Progressions, Binomial Formula 1 Mathematics B.âPlane Geometry 1 Mathematics C.âSolid Geometry Â½ Mathematics D.âPlane Trigonometry Â½ History.âAncient; MediÃ¦val; English; American; (any one) 1 Electives 7 Total 15 High school students who expect to study Engineering are advised to include among their electives Physical Geography, Chemistry, Physics, Mechanical Drawing, and Shop-work (valued at one unit each). Other electives which may be offered are History of English and American Literature (1 unit), History (4 units), Latin (4 units), Greek (3 units), German (4 units), French (4 units), Spanish (4 units), Botany (half unit), ZoÃ¶logy (half unit). A candidate may be admitted as a Conditioned Student in spite of some deficiencies, provided these are not such as will impair the integrity of his work. But no such candidate will be conditioned except upon subjects actually taught in this university, nor will any candidate be conditioned on more than two units; and all conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the next session after initial registration. Courses taken for the removal of entrance conditions may in no case be counted as part of the work credited for any degree. No conditions will be allowed in English A, or B, or in Mathematics A1, A2, or B. A candidate may be admitted as a Special Student, without formal examination, provided he is more than twenty years old, and gives evidence of serious purpose and of fitness to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for any degree. No conditioned student may register later as a special student. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. PROGRAMS OF STUDY. The candidate who has satisfied the requirements for entrance as above defined is matriculated as a student of Engineering and admitted to the Freshman Class. The studies of this class comprise lecture-courses in Mathematics, Chemistry and Engineering, with associated laboratory courses in Chemistry, Drawing, Shop-work and Field-work. For advancement to the Sophomore Class the student must have completed at least two-thirds of his Freshman work. Upon entering this class he elects his specialty. The courses thereafter diverge according as the student is an applicant for a degree in Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Chemical, or Mining Engineering. Programs of study for each degree are given below. The courses are so ordered that the specified entrance requirements are adequate for the work of the Freshman Year. Each succeeding year presupposes the completion of the work for all the foregoing years. Students are advised to adhere strictly to the regular programs. The arrangements specified in them have been carefully planned and are the best. Departures from the curriculum will in almost every case produce conflicts in lecture hours or laboratory periods and may cost the student a year's time. Haphazard election is discouraged and in extreme cases will be prohibited. No student will be registered for a course unless, in the opinion both of the Dean and of the professor, his preliminary training has fitted him for the profitable pursuit of that course. Students are especially advised against the attempt to crowd too many studies into their scheme of work, and are warned that admission to advanced courses will be granted only to those who have adequate mathematical and scientific training to profit by them. Men overloaded with work, too great in volume or in difficulty for their powers, suffer inevitable discouragement and incur almost certain failure. Changes of classes with transfer of fees may be made, subject to the approval of the Dean, within two weeks after the beginning of any term. Thereafter such changes may be made only by special order of the faculty, and then without transfer of fees. Every candidate for a degree in Engineering will be required at the beginning of his graduating year to submit to the Dean some subject for independent study suited to the student's especial course and aims. After such subject has been approved by the Dean and the professor in charge, the student will be expected to carry out for himself the necessary literary and laboratory researches and to present his results in the form of a Graduating Thesis. Such thesis must be typewritten on standard sheets, 8 by 10Â½ inches, bound in a durable stiff cover, and handed in for final approval not later than May 25. All necessary computations and drawings must accompany the thesis. Serious weight will be given to this work in estimating the student's fitness for graduation. Upon the completion of the four years' course as defined in any one of the Programs of Study and the presentation of an acceptable graduating DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. thesis, the faculty will award to any student in regular and honorable standing the appropriate degree of Civil Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Chemical Engineer, or Mining Engineer.

The average annual expenses of a student who pursues the regular course in Engineering will be: Outside Students Virginians University Fee $ 40 $ 20 Tuition and Laboratory Fees (average) 120 80 Living Expenses (for nine months) 250 250 Books and Drawing Materials 20 20 Incidental Expenses (for nine months) 45 45 Total for average conditions $475 $415 DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. The charges for Tuition are uniform to all students, except that Virginians are relieved of tuition on courses offered in the College. The fee for each collegiate class taken will be $25, with the addition of the prescribed laboratory charges, which are $5 per class for Physics and $15 for Chemistry. For each class in Analytical Chemistry a special fee of $50 is charged for tuition, plus $10 for apparatus and supplies. The fee for each technical lecture-course is $30, for each practice-course in drawing $15, for each laboratory or practice course in Applied Mechanics, Engineering, Shop-work, or Field-work $5. These fees include all charges for laboratory materials; but the student is held further responsible for breakage. The Living Expenses include board, lodging, fuel and lights, servant and laundry; the average is $28 a month, the minimum $20, and a reasonable maximum $35. Books and Drawing Materials will cost about $80 for the four-year course. Incidental Expenses ought to be kept within modest bounds; the above estimate is sufficient; large allowances of pocket money promote idleness and attract companions of the baser sort. No allowances are made for clothing or travel, the expenses for which vary too much to be introduced into any general estimate. The charges payable on entrance are the University fee, the contingent deposit of $10 and the tuition and laboratory fees. EXAMINATIONS AND REPORTS. Oral examinations are held at the beginning of each lecture hour on the topics of the preceding lecture. Written test papers are set monthly, or at such interval as the professor may appoint. Absences from lecture except by reason of sickness are not excused without a written leave from the Dean. Class standing is determined on the basis of the oral examinations and the written tests. Absence from the latter or failure to answer incurs a zero grade. Absences from laboratory periods, however caused, must be made up by special private arrangement with the instructor. Written examinations are held at the end of each term on the entire work of that term. The result of the examination combined with the student's class-standing gives his term-grade. The pass-mark is seventy-five per cent. Absence from the written term examination incurs a zero term-grade, which may not be removed except by the passage of a special written examination on the work of that term. Such special examinations are granted only upon presentation of a written certificate from a reputable physician that the student by reason of sickness on the day of the regular examination was unable to attend. Regular Reports are sent out at the end of every term to the student's parent or guardian. These state for each course followed the term-grade and the number of absences. Further comment may be added by the Dean or the professor, if it appears probable that such comment would be helpful to the student. Parents are urged to examine these reports carefully, and to exert such parental influence as may seem needed to establish and confirm the student in habits of industry and order. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. Special Reports are sent to parents at the end of each month for students delinquent in attendance or studiousness and for delinquents only. When a student is making steady progress and showing due diligence in his work only the regular reports are sent. The receipt of a special report is evidence that, in the judgment of the Faculty, prompt and pointed parental admonition is urgently needed. If in any class in the Department of Engineering a student fails to make satisfactory progress, he is first admonished by the professor in charge. In default of prompt and permanent improvement he is next formally warned by the Dean. If due amendment is then not immediately effected, the student's name is dropped from the rolls of the Department, on the ground that he is not accomplishing the purposes for which he should have entered upon a University course of study. REGULATIONS. The following regulations, adopted to define the policy of the Faculty, are published for the information and guidance of the Students: 1. Practice-courses as well as lecture-courses must be conducted under the Honor System. The student who submits any work to be graded is considered to submit it under pledge. 2. When the lecture-course and the associated practice-course are given in the same term of the same year, no student will be admitted to examination on the lecture-course until he has completed at least three-fourths of the practice-course. 3. No student will be admitted to any practice-course unless he is at the same time pursuing the associated lecture-course, or has already received credit for the same. 4. No student will be admitted to the graduating examination on a lecture-course unless he has been present at more than half the lectures in that course. 5. In the technical courses in Engineering (i. e., courses not given in the College) term-grades shall not be averaged; except that the term-grades for Freshman Drawing (600-601-700) may be averaged for first-year men only, provided no mark is below 65. 6. The pass-mark in every course is 75. Class standing is estimated at 20 points; the written examination at 80 points. 7. No student who fails to maks 75 on term-grade shall be granted another examination on the course until he has again attended lectures on that course. 8. Special examinations are not given except by reason of sickness on the day of examination, attested by the written certificate of a reputable physician, or for other like providential causes. In every case they must be validated by special vote of the Faculty. 9. A student whose term-grades average less than 40 for all the courses in which he is registered shall be at once dropped from the rolls. If his average is above 40 with no mark above 65, he is placed on probation. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. 10. A student on probation, who in the next term makes less than 65 on each and all his courses, shall be at once dropped from the rolls. ADVANCED STANDING. Under the elective system of the University of Virginia a student who has completed courses of college or university grade in other institutions of learning on mathematical or scientific subjects may be excused from attendance upon these courses by the Dean, with the advice and consent of the professors in charge, and will then be registered for the more advanced work. In order to secure College Credit upon such courses toward a degree in Engineering from this University the applicant must showâ 1. That the courses offered are coextensive with the corresponding courses as given in the University of Virginia. 2. That his grades on them were not below the seventy-five per cent pass-mark of this University. Such credits may be granted by the Faculty upon the recommendation of the Dean and the professors in charge; but are automatically revoked by the failure of the student to pass in the more advanced courses in the related topics. The same rules apply to Credits on Summer School Courses; except that for courses in the Summer School of this University the examination questions must be prepared by the professor in charge of the regular course and the answers must be read and graded by him. Credits on Practice-Courses in Drawing, Shop-work, or Field-work may be granted to applicants who have gained in professional practice the training which these courses represent. Such applicants must file with the Dean proper certificates from the official under whom the work was done and must in addition pass a practical test on the subjects for which credit is desired. DRAFTING ROOMS. The drafting rooms are abundantly lighted and are provided with solidly constructed tables with locked drawers for instruments and materials. Each student is assigned to a table and has a drawer for his exclusive use. The regular Drawing Classes execute each one plate a week under the supervision of the Instructors in Drawing. The more advanced students have such additional drawings assigned by their respective professors as are needed for the full development of the courses of study. Careful attention is given to the training of the students in free-hand lettering, in the conventional signs of mechanical drawing, in the proper lay-out of drawings, and in neat and accurate execution. Exercises are required also in tracing and in blue-printing, the rooms for which are conveniently arranged and in close contiguity to the drafting rooms. While, however, technical dexterity is demanded, the graphical method is taught DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. and used primarily as an indispensable instrument of research, the thoughtful mastery of which is essential for the instructed Engineer. The construction and theory of the Polar Planimeter, the Slide Rule, and the Pantograph are carefully taught, and the student is trained in the practical use of these appliances for the rapid and accurate production of estimates and copies from finished drawings. SHOPS. The machine shop is provided with six first-class engine lathes, illustrating the practice of the best American makers; with a planer, a shaper, two drill presses, a universal milling machine (Brown &amp; Sharpe), and a universal grinder (same makers); also with a gas forge for tempering tools, a cut-off saw for metal rods, an emery wheel, grindstone, and so on.

In addition, the Department has acquired a 40,000-pound compression tester, a diamond core drill, a diamond rock saw, a grinding lap, a Westphal balance, specific gravity apparatus, and a complete set of sieves. Useful researches in the road-building rocks and gravels of Virginia, as well as the standard tests, are conducted each year by the class in Civil Engineering. The apparatus for tests of Bituminous Road Materials includes the New York Testing Laboratory penetrometer, the Kirschbaum ductility machine, the Engler viscosimeter, the asphalt viscosimeter, the New York Testing Laboratory extractor, the New York State Board of Health oil tester, Hubbard pyknometers, asphalt flow plates, gas and electric hot plates, and all the accessory apparatus needed for research on bituminous road-binders. In recognition of the growing interest in Good Roads in Virginia and the immense social and economic importance of the construction of such roads in all parts of the commonwealth, the Faculty of the Department of Engineering has rearranged the courses of instruction in this topic and brought them together into the Spring Term, so as to form a Special Course in Highway Engineering for the benefit of young men from Virginia, who wish to go into public highway work. To such Virginians, if adequately prepared and recommended, free scholarships will be given. Application should be made to the Dean, accompanied by recommendations from the State Highway Commissioner or from the Board of Supervisors of the applicant's county. ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING LABORATORY. The Scott Laboratory of Electrical Engineering.âThis laboratory was initially equipped and endowed by Mrs. Frances Branch Scott, of Richmond, Va., as a memorial to her late son, an alumnus of this university. During the year 1910 the equipment was substantially increased through the generosity of the Hon. Charles R. Crane, of Chicago, Ill., a friend of the university. During 1912, still further substantial additions were made, consisting of measuring instruments, auxiliary control apparatus, and more particularly a steam-turbine driven three-phase alternating current generator with exciter and control switchboard. In addition to full sets of electric meters with the appliances for testing and calibrating them, galvanometers of the best modern types, standard cells and resistances, standard condensers, and other pieces of apparatus for minor tests, this laboratory contains numerous pieces of the very best construction. Such are the Wolff Potentiometer, the Siemens and Halske Thomson Double Bridge, the Koepsel Permeameter, the Duddell Double Projection Oscillograph, the Station Photometer with Lummer-Brodhum screen, the Carey-Foster Bridge and others. For the work in machine-testing DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. there are a number of direct current generators and motors, series, shunt and compound, an interpole motor, a double current generator, a two-phase alternator, a General Electric experimental test set for alternating current, comprising a generator furnishing single, two, three, six or twelve-phase current, and, in addition, offering three types of induction motors with all necessary starting and controlling devices, a single-phase repulsion motor, a two-phase induction motor, two three-phase induction motors, several pairs of constant voltage transformers, a constant current transformer, frequency meters, power factor indicator, synchronism indicator, ground detector and the auxiliary apparatus used in testing these machines. The laboratory has been arranged with a system of universal plug and receptacle-connections to facilitate the setting up of all experimental combinations. BUILDINGS.

It is 180 by 70 feet and contains on the main floor the Dean's office and the offices of the other professors; the main lecture-room; the laboratory of electrical engineering; and the drafting-room for the First and Second-Year students. Above are a smaller drafting-room for advanced students, and blue-print and photographic rooms. Below on the ground floor are another classroom, the testing laboratories, the wood shop, the metal shop, apparatus and storerooms, the toolroom, and the students' lavatory. The Power House is a single-story building 110 by 40 feet. In addition to the University boiler plant and the electric lighting plant, this contains the foundry and the forge-room. The boiler plant consists of two horizontal return-tubular boilers, each of 140 horse-power. The lighting plant consists of three electric generators directly connected to high-speed engines, the respective capacities being 25, 50, and 75 kilowatts. The whole plant is available for purposes of instruction, study and experiment. The Geological Museum is 120 by 50 feet. It is a three-story building. The main floor is devoted to the very extensive geological collection of specimens, charts, relief maps, and so on. The gallery above contains an equally good collection of minerals and numerous models of typical crystallographic forms. The upper floor contains the lecture-rooms and the laboratories of Economic Geology. In the basement are stored subsidiary collections and new material accumulated in more recent geological surveys. The Physical Laboratory faces the Mechanical Laboratory on the opposite side of the quadrangle, and has almost the same proportions. The main floor contains the lecture-room, the professors' offices, the laboratory of experimental physics, and the storeroom for the very large collection of apparatus used in the lectures. On the ground floor is the laboratory of theoretical electricity, the storage battery room, a well-equipped shop for DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. the repair and manufacture of apparatus, and smaller rooms for the work of graduate students. The new Chemical Laboratory will be opened for use in September, 1917. In this fire-proof structure all the work in Chemistry will be assembled. The floor area provided will be about 30,000 square feet. The lecture-rooms will seat classes of 300, 75 and 25 students. The laboratories assigned to General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Qualitative Analysis, Quantitative Analysis, and Physical Chemistry will contain 110, 60, 40, 30, and 20 desks. Altogether by dividing classes into sections 600 students may be accommodated. Smaller private laboratories will be provided for research workers. Large stock rooms communicating by elevators with the several floors will contain ample stores of chemical supplies. The resources of the valuable Chemical Museum belonging to the University will be for the first time adequately displayed.

The session will begin Tuesday, June 19, and close Thursday, August 2, 1917. Tuesday, June 19, will be devoted to the registration of students. All students should register on this day. No certificate will be granted to students who fail to register before Tuesday, June 26. FEES. For Non-Virginia Students.âA single registration fee of fifteen dollars will be charged each non-Virginia student. This fee will entitle the student to enter any of the courses outlined in the catalogue, except a few special courses which are so designated. No student, however, will be allowed to take more than three advanced courses or six elementary courses without special permission in writing from the Director. For Virginia Students.âStudents from Virginia who are not teachers or preparing to teach next session will be charged the same tuition as nonVirginia students. Tuition will be entirely free to all Virginia teachers in all the regular courses, both elementary and advanced, leading to the professional and first grade certificates. To meet local expenses the State Board of Education has fixed a registration fee of $1.00 for a four weeks' term and $1.50 for a six weeks' term for all the Summer Schools of the State, and these fees will be charged here. There are a few special courses offered to meet certain demands but not necessary for certificate credit, for which fees will be charged. The fee for each is designated in the catalogue. Small fees in laboratory courses will also be charged all students who register in them. SUMMER SCHOOL. CREDITS Certificates will be granted in each course of the University Department to those students who attain a grade of 75 per cent. This grade will be the average of the recitation and examination marks. No students will be permitted to take more than three courses for the Summer School Professional CertificateâAdvanced Grade, or for University credit, without the permission of the Director. University of Virginia College Credit.âCollege credit in the University of Virginia may be obtained on the following courses: Astronomy 1 and 2; Biology 1, 2 and 3; Chemistry 3 and 4; Latin 5, 6, 7 8, 9 and 10; Education 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; English 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8; French 1, 2, 3 and 4; German 1, 2, 3, 4; History 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6; Mathematics 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; Philosophy 1, 2, 3; Physics 5, 6, 7, 8; Psychology 1, 2.

(c) The Dean of the College and the professor in charge of the School in which credit is desired will accept certificates of completion of summer courses in lieu of "A" courses in the University of Virginia, provided that such summer courses be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned as the full equivalent in character and scope of the corresponding "A" courses in the University. (d) Certificates of completion of certain summer courses approved by the Academic Faculty will be accepted in lieu of portions of "B" courses, provided that in each case the Dean of the College, the Faculty Committee on Rules and Courses, and the professor in charge of the courses for which credit is desired certify in writing that the summer courses completed are equivalent in character and scope to that portion of the regular sessional work for which credit is desired. (e) The character of the examinations and the numerical standard (75 per cent) required for their successful completion shall be the same as those of the sessional examinations. (f) Courses which satisfy the conditions above stated will be credited toward the B.A. and B.S. degrees offered in the College of the University as follows: 1. Courses in which not less than thirty (30) hours of lecture instruction are given will be credited as one session-hour. 2. Courses in which not less than thirty hours of lecture instruction and not less than sixty (60) hours of laboratory instruction are given will be credited as two session-hours. SUMMER SCHOOL. Credits in Other Colleges.âThe work of the Summer School is recognized by standard colleges everywhere, so that students who satisfy the entrance requirements have no difficulty in securing transfer of credits. VIRGINIA STATE CERTIFICATES. Teachers outside of Virginia are not bound in the choice of their courses by the conditions under which Virginia certificates are issued, unless they desire to teach in Virginia and apply for a certificate issued in this State. In this case only state certificates from other States issued by a state superintendent or a state board of examiners, and approved in advance by the Department of Public Instruction of Virginia, will be recognized as a proper basis for professional work. Teachers from other States will receive credit for all work done at the University Summer School in accordance with the certificate regulations of those States from which they come. The following general conditions must be fulfilled by all applicants before they can enter upon the work for the Summer-School Professional Certificate Advanced Grade, or High-School Grade. The applicant must be the holder of a Virginia first-grade certificate or of a Virginia first-grade high-school certificate and must have had at least five months of actual teaching experience. When necessary, the certificate which entitles the teacher to enter upon the summer school professional courses may be revived or extended for one year from time to time provided that part of the professional course prescribed for the year is successfully completed. No certificate which has expired can be revived for more than one year upon the basis of completing any one year of professional work. No credit can be allowed for the Summer-School Professional Certificate except for work completed at a registered college or normal school in Virginia and in those of equal grade outside of Virginia whose courses have been approved and registered by the State Board of Education. The Summer-School Professional CertificateâHigh School Grade, entitles the holder to teach all the elementary branches, but only the high-school branches named in the certificate. General Requirements.âThe courses prescribed in any of the branches hereinafter stated for the Summer-School Professional CertificateâHigh-School Grade, must embrace no work unless it be of College Grade, requiring minimum recitation periods of sixty minutes each. These courses must be taken in a summer school at a registered college or university and must be completed within a period of three years from the date of beginning. In all cases a statement of each professor under whom the course is pursued, to the effect that the applicant is highly proficient in his branch must accompany the final report. The following "Content Table" gives the number of hours or recitation periods required in each branch, and in addition thereto the applicant must complete a course of thirty hours in educational psychology and the principles of teaching. This certificate shall continue in force for seven years, and may be renewed for a similar period from time to time. SUMMER SCHOOL. N. B.âThis course must not be given at any school in Virginia unless it is specially mentioned and advertised in its literature; no supposedly equal course at any other than a designated summer school will be recognized or accepted by the Department of Public Instruction. This certificate entitles the holder to teach both high and elementary school branches. Agriculture, 90 hours. Botany, 60 hours. Chemistry, 150 hours, of which 60 hours must be laboratory work. Drawing, 90 hours. English, 120 hours, including 30 hours in English Grammar, 30 hours in Rhetoric and Composition, and 60 hours in English and American Literature. Domestic Science, 90 hours.

STUDENT ACTIVITIES. THE VIRGINIA UNION. The Virginia Union was recently organized with a membership of several hundred students for the purpose of directing and co-ordinating student activities that are not athletic in character. It conducts infercollegiate contests in debating and oratory and takes charge of lectures, concerts, and entertainments that are dependent upon student patronage. Its present officers are: Francis S. Harmon, President; David C. Wilson, Vice President; Arnold R. Boyd, Recording Secretary and Financial Manager; Nicholas E. Oglesby, Corresponding Secretary; Harold A. Sparr, Auditor; who are student members of the Executive Board with Charles W. Paul, Treasurer; Armistead M. Dobie; and Lindsay Rogers as faculty members. LITERARY SOCIETIES. Connected with the University are two literary societies of long standingâ the Jefferson Society and the Washington Society. At weekly meetings in their respective halls, they hold debates and practice extemporaneous and other forms of public speaking. Each society annually offers gold medals for excellence in debating and oratory, and each organization contests for intersociety prizes. MEDALISTS, 1915-1916. Jefferson Society Orator Amos Valentine Pankey Washington Society Orator Carleton Sanders Penn Jefferson Society Debater Francis Stuart Harmon Washington Society Debater Charles Paxson Welsh THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA MAGAZINE. Founded 1838. The University of Virginia Magazine, designed to encourage literary work among the students, is published by the students with the advisory assistance of the Linden Kent Memorial School of English Literature, and appears at monthly intervals, eight times during the session. As a stimulus to literary activity, the Magazine offers every year three medals: One for the best poem, one for the best short story, and one for the best essay, of student authorship, appearing in one of the numbers of the publication. The awards are made by alumni committees, one committee for each of the three medals. MEDALISTS, 1915-1916. John R.

William Joseph Parrish, Jr. THE VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW. Under the title of The Virginia Law Review the undergraduate students of the Law Department conduct a journal devoted to the discussion of general questions of American jurisprudence. Eight numbers are issued annually, from October to May inclusive. The Review is now in its fourth volume. From its inception it has maintained a high standard of excellence and a worthy rank among the leading law journals of the country. RELIGIOUS WORK. RELIGIOUS WORK. YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION, INCORPORATED, William Newton Neff, M.A., General Secretary. Object.âThe Young Men's Christian Association of the University of Virginia has the distinction of being the oldest organization of its kind in existence. It was founded October 12, 1858, and has today a larger proportionate membership than that in any other State university in America. The purpose of the Association is to promote growth in Christian fellowship among its members and enlist them in Christian work for their fellow students and for others not connected with the University. The Association actively promotes the moral, social and spiritual life of the University. Work.âThe Association organizes classes for the voluntary study of the Bible, of Home and Foreign Missions, and of Social Work, under the leadership of students and members of the Faculty; maintains a weekly meeting held on Tuesday evening at 7:30; assists through its membership the work of the Churches and Sunday Schools in the vicinity of the University; sends deputations of students to various preparatory and high schools in the State; supports a representative in the Foreign Field; maintains a medical clinic in the Blue Ridge Mountains; invites eminent Christian workers to address the students on religious matters; and stimulates social intercourse among the students by means of receptions, lectures, entertainments and other social events. Equipment.âThrough the munificence of Mrs. William E. Dodge and family, of New York City, the Association possesses a very handsome and beautiful building, which was erected at a cost, including furnishings, of about $80,000, and which is maintained by an endowment fund of over $16,000, subscribed by students, alumni, and friends of the University. This building, called "Madison Hall" in honor of President Madison, who was so intimately connected with the early history of the University, faces the north front of the Rotunda. It contains an editorial room for the college publications, a reception room, reading room, meeting room, parlor, pool room, office, writing room, auditorium, guest room, bed rooms for the officers, and rooms for the Bible and Missionary departments of the Association. In addition there are a kitchen, a club room, where dinners may be served, lockers, and elaborate shower baths. A library of nearly a thousand volumes of the best religious works and fiction has been donated by a member of the Dodge family. The tennis courts, nineteen in number, for the use of the students of the University, are on the Association grounds immediately in the rear of the building. Help for New Students.âThe Association publishes during the last week of August a Handbook of useful information concerning the University and community, and also a detailed report of the religious work of the session. The General Secretary will gladly send either of these publications, or give any RELIGIOUS WORK. further information desired, upon application of any prospective student. New students are invited to come to Madison Hall as soon as they reach the University, and to make use of the Information Bureau which the Association conducts, including a complete boarding-house register, a directory of the students, and a list of the various forms of employment open to students. The boarding-house list, with locations and prices, is not made up until the first week in September. It is suggested that new students arrive a day or two before the session opens, so that they may choose a boarding place for themselves and get well settled before their work begins. All correspondence with regard to rooms in the University dormitories should be directed to the Bursar. Membership.âThe membership of the Association consists of two classes, active and associate: any member of an evangelical church, who wishes to take some part in the work of the Association, may become an active member of the Association; any young man of good moral character may become an associate member. The annual fee is $2.00 for all members, an extra charge being made for the use of the baths, lockers, pool tables, and tennis courts. Indorsement.âThe Rector and Visitors and the Faculty of the University heartily commend the work of the Association, and it is earnestly desired that every parent or guardian see to it that the student under his care be encouraged to join the Association soon after his arrival at the University. CHAPEL SERVICES. Through the voluntary gifts of students and members of the Faculty, religious services are provided at the University Chapel every Sunday morning, except the first Sunday in each month, when the men are left free to attend the communion services of their respective churches. There are also occasional Sunday evening services either at the Chapel or at Madison Hall. The speakers include some of the most distinguished members of the clergy and laity of Virginia and adjacent states. This plan, which takes the place of the Chaplain system used in former years, is under the supervision of the Faculty Committee on Religious Exercises. A complete list of preachers to the University for 1916 will be found on page 28. PHYSICAL TRAINING. PHYSICAL TRAINING. Daniel Carter Taylor Assistant Instructor in Physical Training William Alexander Lambeth, M.D., PhD. Director of the Gymnasium Henry Haden Lannigan Associate Director of Athletics John Spottswood Graves, M.A. Instructor in Physical Training The method of instruction pursued does not follow blindly any so-called system, but proper attention is given to all methods which in whole or in part have proved useful or effective. The importance of individual training is in every case recognized, especially where an examination discloses the student's inability to pursue with safety or profit general or concerted exercises. Students are entitled, without cost, to a thorough physical examination by the director, and are urged to avail themselves of this privilege soon after they enter the University. The examination includes an accurate measurement of the student's physical proportions, a careful examination of the condition and action of the heart and lungs, and the strength of the principal muscular groups. Upon the basis of the facts thus ascertained, advice is given as to particular exercises and the use of various developing appliances. The examination is repeated at intervals, note is taken of any improvement, and new exercises are suggested. In addition to individual work, daily instruction is given to classes in light gymnasticsâmarching, figure-running, calisthenics, dumb-bells, and clubsâadapted as nearly as possible to the needs of individuals of varying age and physical condition. The exercises are gradual and progressive, commencing with the simplest movements and proceeding to others more complicated and difficult. During the winter months instruction in gymnastics which require great strength and agility is given to those who are fitted for it by previous training. This work is terminated by an annual gymnastic tournament, held usually in the early part of March. The faculty regulations on athletics require that members of the university athletic teams shall give evidence of satisfactory physical condition by passing in doubtful cases a strength test, in addition to the regular physical examination. For members of the football teams, 1,300 points are required, for members of the baseball team, 1,100 points. The points are reckoned as follows: Strength of back in pounds, strength of legs in pounds, strength of chest in pounds, strength of forearms in pounds (pressure), added to one-tenth of the weight (in pounds), multiplied by the number of times the body is lifted by the upper arms. The Fayerweather Gymnasium, the gift of Daniel Fayerweather, of New York, is a handsome and commodious structure situated on the eastern slope of Carr's Hill. The first floor contains a spacious exercise hall, ATHLETICS. equipped with the best and most approved developing appliances, as well as with apparatus for light and heavy gymnastics, a one-twentieth mile concave-inclined running track, a visitor's gallery, lavatory, trophy room, and various offices. The basement floor is concrete throughout and contains hot and cold baths (needle, shower, spray, tub, and plunge), bowling-alleys, ball-cage, boiler-room, lockers, locker-room, and dressing-rooms. The building is heated by hot water, ventilated by airshafts, registers and sky-lights, and lighted by gas and electricity. The gymnasium is open from 8:00 A. M. to 7 P. M. every day except Sunday. Attendance is voluntary and is free of cost to every student. Classes are held at hours which do not conflict with other university duties. Degree Credit for Physical Training.âBeginning with the session of 1917-1918 there will be offered a course in Physical Training and Hygiene which will have a credit-value of three session-hours of electives-at-large toward the several baccalaureate degrees (see pp. 156-158). The course will consist of a very limited number of lectures supplemented by a large amount of physical exercise taken under scientific direction in the gymnasium or in the field. A complete announcement will be made at the beginning of the session, setting forth the content of the course, method of instruction, name of the lecturer, and schedule hours. ATHLETICS. The Athletic Park contains twenty-one acres, and includes two athletic fields, Lambeth Field and Lefevre Field, as well as a driving park, set with trees and hedges, and containing the site for the proposed Athletic Clubhouse, which is now in process of erection. Two hundred thousand surface feet have been perfectly graded, drained and fenced, for football, baseball, and track work. This surface was completed at a cost of about ten thousand dollars, and involved the removal of forty-eight thousand cubic yards of earth. A concrete stadium has been erected, seating eight thousand persons. Games and sports of all kinds are under the special direction of the General Athletic Association, a student organization whose object is to encourage this phase of physical exercise. The Faculty, by means of its Committee on Athletics, exercises a general advisory control, endeavoring to foresee and avert dangerous tendencies or excess in physical exercise, while giving to the students, as far as possible, entire liberty of management. A strict supervision is maintained over the character of intercollegiate games, and the number of these which may be played away from the University is definitely limited. REGULATIONS OF THE GENERAL FACULTY CONCERNING ATHLETICS. 1. The Faculty Committee on Athletics is intrusted with the general oversight of athletics, and is authorized to forbid any features in these exercises which endanger the health or morals of the participants, and to foster the true spirit of amateur sport among them. 2.

Special reports may be made to the President from time to time by any departmental faculty with respect to the class-standing and progress in study of each regular and substitute player on the athletic teams, and if the President and such faculty are convinced that his class-standing is discreditable, such student may be required to sever his connection with such team. 5. The athletic teams shall not have contests elsewhere than upon the university grounds with any teams except those from other institutions of learning. 6.

No student shall participate in any intercollegiate football, baseball, basketball or track contest during his first college year, and in no case shall a student be eligible for these teams unless he shall have been a resident student for at least six months. 11. No person who has participated in intercollegiate football, baseball, basketball or track contests for four sessions, consecutive or not, is eligible; provided, that his total time of participation in these sports shall not include more than five college years. 12. No student who is receiving from the University remuneration for teaching or administrative services shall be eligible for the university teams. 13. It shall be the duty of the President of the Athletic Association, the Executive Committee of that Association, the Manager and the Captain of the team concerned, the Director of the Gymnasium, the Associate Director of Athletics, and the Treasurer of the Association, to furnish on request a statement to the effect that each member of an athletic team is above their suspicion as to his eligibility to represent the University as a proper amateur player, before such player shall be allowed to take part in any contest. 14. No coach, not an alumnus, and no trainer, not an officer of the University, shall be employed for the purpose of instructing or training any athletic team in this university.* * The Faculty Committee on Athletics may permit the employment of coaches other than alumni for a period not exceeding two weeks for any one individual during any one season. But in no case shall such coach be in responsible charge of the team. 15. The Faculty Committee on Athletics is directed to assume responsible ATHLETICS. charge of the details of the athletic situation and to permit the playing of intercollegiate games with such colleges only as express a general conformity with the code of rules adopted by this faculty. 16.

"Training Table" for football, baseball, basketball and track teams are hereby abolished. 20. No student of this university shall be eligible for any athletic team who has played upon, or been a member or substitute member of any of the professional or league teams names in Classes A, B, C, and D, in the publication of the American Sports Company. To the list of professional teams thus proscribed shall be added all league teams in any State or States, which the leading university of such State or States declares professional, and from which it debars its own players. 21. The term "college" as used in the Faculty Regulations concerning Athletics is hereby interpreted to mean any college named in Table 28 of the Report of the U. S. Commissioner of Education of 1902, which has not less than 150 male students of at least collegiate grade recorded in the catalogue of the institution in question as students of the session preceding the applicant's entrance into this university. In case such catalogue fails to distinguish between students of collegiate and preparatory grade, the president of the college concerned shall be requested to render or to authorize an official statement as to the number of college students. 22. The term "substitute" is interpreted to mean a student who has taken part in an intercollegiate contest. 23. The term "general conformity," as used in the Faculty Regulations, is interpreted by the Faculty to mean conformity in regard to period of residence, maximum period of eligibility and amateur standing.

The University of Virginia Philosophical Society represents an important phase of the scientific interest and life of the University. It is divided into three sections: Scientific, Humanistic and Medical. These bodies meet regularly throughout the session and in their meetings papers representing the research of the members are read and discussed. General discussions of scientific progress are frequent. An annual meeting of the General Society is held once a year in the spring at which the officers for the following year are elected and reports are made on the year's work. The Society publishes its Proceedings and Transactions. The President during the present year is Professor C. Alphonso Smith, the Secretary, Professor Llewelyn Hoxton. THE COLONNADE CLUB. Incorporated in October, 1907, the Colonnade Club was formed to increase the efficiency and welfare of the University of Virginia by promoting cordial and friendly relations and desirable co-operation among its teaching and administrative staff, and, so far as possible, to assist the University to keep in touch with its alumni and its alumni to keep in touch with the University and with each other, to the end that the loyalty of the alumni to the institution might be developed and strengthened. At this writing, the resident membership of about 120 includes most of the teaching staff and administrative officers, together with a number of local alumni and friends of the University. The number of non-resident alumni members is considerable. The addition of the "Alumni Annex," the erection of which was largely rendered possible by the Club's contributions, materially helps to make it the center of the alumni life of the University and provides a commodious, attractive and comfortable building with chambers sufficient, ordinarily, to accommodate all returning alumni, where they will be sure of a welcome, and with the University Commons nearby, will feel at home. The rooms will be ready for use without formality, and ordinarily without notice (rate, $1 a day; light, heat, attendance and use of bath). Largely through the Club's influence, more alumni are revisiting the University than ever before, both singly and in class reunions. The Club is also proving useful as a headquarters for visiting educators and other influential visitors at the University. In accordance with an arrangement, effected in June, 1916, between the Club and the General Alumni Association, the annual dues of non-resident members of the Club who are also members of the General Alumni Association have been reduced from $4 to $2.50, and such non-resident members are entitled to all the rights of resident members, including the right to vote when present at meetings of the Club. On the other hand, non-resident members of the General Alumni THE COLLONNADE CLUB. Association who are not members of the Club are entitled only to the privileges that "card holders" of the Club enjoy. The Club's non-resident dues for those who are not members of the General Alumni Association are $4 a year; or this rate may be commuted to $25 for ten years or $50 for life. The present officers are: Raleigh C. Minor, President; Howard Winston, Treasurer; Russell Bradford, Secretary; Raleigh C. Minor, William M. Forrest, J. Sharshall Grasty, Robert H. Webb, James H. Dillard, Walter S. Rodman, and Llewelyn G. Hoxton, Board of Governors.</field>
